      <title>Triaxial nuclear shapes from simple ratios of electric-quadrupole matrix elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theoretical models often invoke triaxial nuclear shapes to explain elusive collective phenomena, but such assumptions are usually difficult to confirm experimentally. The only direct measurements of the nuclear axial asymmetry $\gamma$ is based on rotational invariants of zero-coupled products of the electric-quadrupole (E2) operator, the Kumar-Cline sum rule analysis, which generally require knowledge of a large number of E2 matrix elements connecting the state of interest. We propose an alternative assumptions-free method to determine $\gamma$ of even-even rotating nuclei using only two E2 matrix elements, which are among the easiest to measure. This approach is based on a simple description of nuclear rotation, where the underlying assumptions of the Davydov-Filippov model are either empirically proven or unnecessary. The $\gamma$ values extracted here are found in agreement with the values deduced from Kumar-Cline sum rules measurements (where available), providing further evidence that the proposed approach represents a reliable, model-independent deduction of $\gamma$. The technique was applied to more than 60 deformed even-even rotating nuclei and the results indicate that rotating nuclei generally exhibit well-defined stable axially-asymmetric shapes.</description>

      <title>Investigating the possibility of extracting neutron-skin thickness in nuclei by their collisions at intermediate energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by various studies on extracting the density distributions of nuclei from their collisions at ultrarelativistic energies, in the present work we investigate the possibility of extracting the neutron-skin thickness $\Delta r_{np}$ in nuclei by their collisions at intermediate energies. We have analyzed the free neutron-to-proton yield ratio $n/p$ as a candidate probe at both midrapidities and forward rapidities in peripheral and central $^{124}$Sn+$^{124}$Sn collisions based on an isospin-dependent Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck (IBUU) transport model, and found that the resulting $n/p$ yield ratio is more sensitive to the symmetry potential in the collision dynamics than to the initial $\Delta r_{np}$ in colliding nuclei in most cases. The largest effect on the $n/p$ yield ratio from the initial $\Delta r_{np}$ is observed for nucleons at large transverse or longitudinal momenta in central collisions at the collision energy of a few GeV/nucleon.</description>

      <title>Nonautonomous Volterra Series Expansion of the Variable Phase Approximation and its Application to the Nucleon-Nucleon Inverse Scattering Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the nonlinear Volterra series expansion is extended and used to describe certain types of nonautonomous differential equations related to the inverse scattering problem in nuclear physics. The nonautonomous Volterra series expansion lets us determine a dynamic, polynomial approximation of the variable phase approximation (VPA), which is used to determine the phase shifts from nuclear potentials through first-order nonlinear differential equations. By using the first-order Volterra expansion, a robust approximation is formulated to the inverse scattering problem for weak potentials and/or high energies. The method is then extended with the help of radial basis function neural networks by applying a nonlinear transformation on the measured phase shifts to be able to model the scattering system with a linear approximation given by the first-order Volterra expansion. The method is applied to describe the 1S0 NN potentials in neutron+proton scattering below 200 MeV laboratory kinetic energies, giving physically sensible potentials and below 1% averaged relative error between the recalculated and the measured phase shifts.</description>

      <title>Bayesian evaluation of hadron-quark phase transition models through neutron star observables in light of nuclear and astrophysics data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the role of hybrid and nucleonic equations of state (EOSs) within neutron star (NS) interiors using Bayesian inference to evaluate their alignment with recent observational data from NICER and LIGO-Virgo (LV) collaborations. We find that smooth hybrid EOSs are slightly favoured in explaining NS mass-radius relations, particularly for pulsars such as PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0740+6620. However, this preference is not definitive, as gravitational wave (GW) data does not significantly differentiate between our hybrid and nucleonic models. Our analysis also reveals tensions between older NICER data and recent measurements for PSR J0437-4715, highlighting the need for more flexible EOS models. Through two sampling approaches - one fixing the hadronic EOS set and the other without fixing the same, we demonstrate that the hybrid EOS model can incorporate stiffer EOSs, resulting in a better agreement with NICER data but leading to higher tidal deformability, which is less consistent with GW observations. In some recent publications a parameter $d_c$, related to the trace anomaly and its derivative, is used to indicate the presence of deconfined quark matter. We find that our hadronic model, which does not include phase transition to deconfined matter, under the influence of imposed constraints, is able to predict values below 0.2 for $d_c$ at around five times saturation density. The hybrid model goes below this threshold at lower densities under the same conditions.</description>

      <title>Higher partial waves in femtoscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Femtoscopy is recently gaining more attention as a new approach complementary to scattering experiments for constraining hadron-hadron interactions. We discuss the effect of higher partial waves on the two-particle correlation function, which has been neglected in traditional formulae used in the femtoscopy analyses. We consider the partial-wave expansion of the wave function in the Koonin-Pratt formula to give the correction to the correlation function by a sum of the contributions from each partial wave. We also generalize the Lednicky-Lyuboshitz formula, which was originally derived for the s-wave interaction, for higher partial waves. We find a compact representation of the generalized Lednicky-Lyuboshitz formula given by the backward scattering amplitude $f(\theta = \pi)$ and the Fourier-Laplace transform of the relative source function, which gives an insight into the structure of the Lednicky-Lyuboshitz formula and its relation to the optical theorem. We numerically demonstrate the significance of higher partial waves with resonances using the square potential well. Also, the generalized Lednicky-Lyuboshitz formula turned out to be broken for higher partial waves, which suggests the importance of the centrifugal force for the higher partial waves.</description>

      <title>Correlation of the symmetry energy at subsaturation densities and neutron-skin thickness in low-energy antiproton induced reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the framework of Lanzhou quantum molecular dynamics transport model, the neutron-skin thickness and its impact on the nuclear dynamics induced by low-energy antiprotons are investigated thoroughly. The correlation of the neutron-skin thickness and stiffness of symmetry energy is implemented into the transport model via the Fermi distributions of the proton and neutron density profiles. It is found that antiprotons are predominantly annihilated in the subsaturation density region (0.4$\rho_{0}$-0.8$\rho_{0}$). The isospin ratios of free neutrons to protons (n/p) and charged pion yields ($\pi^{-}$/$\pi^{+}$) in collisions of antiprotons on $^{48}\rm{Ca}$ and $^{208}\rm{Pb}$ are analyzed systematically for extracting the symmetry energy in the domain of subsaturation densities. The n/p ratio is sensitive to the stiffness of symmetry energy in the low-density region and a soft symmetry energy leads to the larger n/p ratio, in particular with decreasing the beam momentum. The $\pi^-/\pi^+$ ratio is also enhanced with the soft symmetry energy at kinetic energies below 150 MeV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structure of the nucleus $^{84}$Mo has been studied using the projected generator coordinate method (PGCM) with the Gogny D1S interaction. The calculations incorporate a mixing of particle-number and angular-momentum projected intrinsic wave functions, defined over triaxial quadrupole degrees of freedom. This approach yields an excellent agreement with the scarce experimental data for this nucleus and several bands based on different shapes are predicted.</description>

      <title>Damping of density oscillations from bulk viscosity in quark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this contribution, we extend the discussion about the calculation of the bulk viscosity of quark matter in the normal phase due to electroweak processes and its effect on the damping of baryon density oscillations that might occur in the coalescence of two compact stars. Employing the EoSs from the MIT bag model and perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD) up to $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s)$, we analyze our results varying densities in the range of temperatures from 0 to 10 MeV for frequencies around 1 kHz. Our estimates show that bulk viscous effects might play a relevant role during the postmerger stage if the system reaches a deconfined quark matter phase.</description>

      <title>Imaging the Femtoscopic Freeze-out Source in Heavy Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By combining the femtoscopic interferometry and the optical deblurring algorithm, we implement a novel method to image the source formed in HICs, while the interaction strength between the particle pair can be simultaneously determined. The spatial distribution of the emission source has been reconstructed for protons ($p$) and antiprotons ($\bar{p}$) from the respective $pp$ and $\bar{p}\bar{p}$ correlation functions in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{S_{\rm NN}}=200$ GeV. Within experimental uncertainties, protons and antiprotons share the same freeze-out distribution showing higher density in the center compared to the widely assumed Gaussian shape. The results evidence the matter-antimatter symmetry in coordinate space at the moment of freeze-out before the nucleons are fully randomized in the collisions.</description>

      <title>A precision evaluation of the $\eta$- and $\eta'$-pole contributions to hadronic light-by-light scattering in the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Next to the $\pi^0$ pole, $\eta$ and $\eta'$ intermediate states give rise to the leading singularities of the hadronic light-by-light tensor, resulting in sizable contributions to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon $a_\mu$. The strength of the poles is determined by the respective transition form factors (TFFs) to two (virtual) photons. We present a calculation of these TFFs that implements a number of low- and high-energy constraints, including the $\eta^{(\prime)}\to\gamma\gamma$ decay widths, $\eta^{(\prime)}\to\pi^+\pi^-\gamma$ spectra, chiral symmetry for the $\eta^{(\prime)}\to2(\pi^+\pi^-)$ amplitudes, vector-meson couplings, and asymptotic limits. Crucially, we investigate the role of the leading left-hand singularity generated by the exchange of the $a_2$ tensor meson, yielding, for the first time, an estimate of the associated factorization-breaking corrections. Our final results, $a_\mu^{\eta\text{-pole}}=14.7(9)\times 10^{-11}$ and $a_\mu^{\eta'\text{-pole}}=13.5(7)\times 10^{-11}$, conclude a dedicated effort to evaluate the pseudoscalar-pole contributions to hadronic light-by-light scattering using dispersion relations, amounting to a combined $a_\mu^{\text{PS-poles}}=91.2^{+2.9}_{-2.4}\times 10^{-11}$.</description>

      <title>Spin dynamics with realistic hydrodynamic background for relativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The equations of perfect spin hydrodynamics are solved for the first time using a realistic (3+1)-dimensional hydrodynamic background, calibrated to reproduce a comprehensive set of hadronic observables, including rapidity distributions, transverse momentum spectra, and elliptic flow coefficients for Au+Au collisions at the beam energy of $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 200$ GeV. The spin dynamics is governed by the conservation of the spin tensor, describing spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particles, with particle mass in the spin tensor treated as an effective parameter. We investigate several scenarios, varying both the effective mass and the initial evolution time for the spin polarization tensor. The model predictions are then compared with experimental measurements of global and longitudinal spin polarization of Lambda hyperons. Our results indicate that a successful description of the data requires a delayed initial evolution time for the perfect spin hydrodynamics of about 4 fm/$c$ (in contrast to the standard initial time of 1 fm/$c$ used for the hydrodynamic background). This delay marks a transition from the phase where spin-orbit interaction is significant to the regime where spin-conserving processes dominate. Our findings suggest that the spin-orbit dissipative interaction plays a significant role only in the very early stages of the system's evolution.</description>

      <title>Hypernuclei production with a modified coalescence model in BUU transport calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the usual momentum- and coordinate-space distance criteria for creating nuclear clusters in transport simulations are addressed by using a dynamical, covariant description in an off-shell Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck transport approach. The free parameter of this clustering scheme is the cluster formation time, which is fitted through the FOPI data of low energy charged cluster multiplicities in Au+Au collisions at 150 A MeV and 400 A MeV incident energies. The coalescence model is used to estimate the yields of the 3H(Lambda), 5H(2Lambda), 6He(2Lambda) single and double strange hypernuclei in central Au+Au collisions between 2, and 20 A GeV incident energies, giving comparable results to estimations from other methods.</description>

      <title>The time evolution of light nuclei cumulants and ratios with a first-order phase transition in the UrQMD transport model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08444v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The UrQMD model with a density dependent equation of state, including a first-order phase transition, is used to study the time dependence of baryon number and proton number susceptibilities up to third order in heavy ion reactions of $E_{\mathrm{lab}}=2-3 A$ GeV. A significant deviation from the Gaussian fluctuations of the baryon number fluctuation in coordinate space is observed. The proton number fluctuations are always suppressed as they constitute only a small fraction of the total baryon number during the dense phase of the collision. It is found that the only measurable, but small, signal would be an enhancement of the third order (or higher) proton cumulant in a finite rapidity window $\Delta y$ that is larger than one unit of rapidity. In addition, it is found that the coordinate fluctuations will lead to an enhancement of cluster production due to the correlations in coordinate space. However, this enhancement is small and mainly occurs during the dense part of the collision before the system actually freezes out.</description>

      <title>Dark energy effects on realistic neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By considering realistic equations of state (EoSs) to describe the ordinary matter of the stellar crust, in this study, we explore the effect of a dark energy core, made of Chaplygin Dark Fluid (CDF), on neutron stars (NSs). To accomplish this purpose, we solve the stellar structure equations and investigate the impact of the CDF parameters on the several macroscopic properties of NSs such as mass-radius ($M-R$) relation, and tidal deformabilities of a single star and of a binary system, the latter being of great importance when analyzing gravitational-wave signals coming from the merger of such compact objects. We also present an analysis of the radial oscillation modes for the rapid phase transition, with the aim of distinguishing regions consisting of dynamically stable stars from those of unstable ones. Specifically, our outcomes reveal that an increase in the energy density jump (controlled by a parameter $\alpha$) leads to an increase in the radial stability of the NS with a CDF core. Furthermore, our theoretical results are consistent with the observational $M-R$ measurements of millisecond pulsars from NICER data and tidal deformability constraints from the GW170817 event.</description>

Abstract: The isoscalar and isovector components and their contributions to $M1$ transitions are discussed in the odd-$A$, $T=1/2$ mirror nuclei with mass number ranging from $A=23$ to 37. The orbital contributions in various $M1$ transitions and ground state magnetic moments are calculated by comparing analogous $M1$ and Gamow-Teller transitions between mirror pairs. The orbital contributions in different $M1$ transitions are explained on the basis of configurations of the initial and final states involved. In magnetic moments, the orbital contributions are found to be dependent on the deformation and single-particle nature of the states. All the $T=1/2$ mirror pairs are studied using isospin non-conserving interaction. The results are also compared with predictions from \textit{ab initio} effective interaction derived from realistic nuclear forces.</description>

      <title>Skyrme-Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov mass models on a 3D mesh: IV. Improved description of the isospin dependence of pairing</title>

Abstract: Providing reliable data on the properties of atomic nuclei and infinite nuclear matter to astrophysical applications remains extremely challenging, especially when treating both properties coherently within the same framework. Methods based on energy density functionals (EDFs) enable manageable calculations of nuclear structure throughout the entire nuclear chart and of the properties of infinite nuclear matter across a wide range of densities and asymmetries. To address these challenges, we present BSkG4, the latest Brussels-Skyrme-on-a-Grid model. It is based on an EDF of the extended Skyrme type with terms that are both momentum and density-dependent, and refines the treatment of $^1S_0$ nucleon pairing gaps in asymmetric nuclear matter as inspired by more advanced many-body calculations. The newest model maintains the accuracy of earlier BSkGs for known atomic masses, radii and fission barriers with rms deviations of 0.633 MeV w.r.t. 2457 atomic masses, 0.0246 fm w.r.t. 810 charge radii, and 0.36 MeV w.r.t 45 primary fission barriers of actinides. It also improves some specific pairing-related properties, such as the $^1S_0$ pairing gaps in asymmetric nuclear matter, neutron separation energies, $Q_\beta$ values, and moments of inertia of finite nuclei. This improvement is particularly relevant for describing the $r$-process nucleosynthesis as well as various astrophysical phenomena related to the rotational evolution of neutron stars, their oscillations, and their cooling.</description>

      <title>Hot quark matter and merger remnants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work investigates hot quark matter under the thermodynamic conditions characteristic of a binary neutron star (BNS) merger remnants. We use the density-dependent quark mass model (DDQM) to access the microscopic nuclear equation of state (EoS). The strange quark matter (SQM) is studied at finite temperature and entropy in the presence of electrons and muons and their neutrinos to simulate the BNS merger conditions. We observe that as the entropy of the SQM increases, the merger remnant becomes more massive, and increases in size whereas the neutrino population also increases. In the fixed temperature case, on the other hand, we observe that the entropy spreads from the surface towards the center of the remnant. We determine the particle distribution in the remnants' core, the remnant's structure, the temperature profile, sound velocity, and the polytropic index and discuss their effects. The strange quark (SQ) remnants satisfy the $2\,{\rm M_\odot}$ mass constraint associated with neutron stars (NS).</description>

      <title>Identification of the $G(3900)$ as the P-wave $D\bar{D}^*/\bar{D}D^*$ resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The BESIII Collaboration recently performed a precise measurement of the $e^+e^-\rightarrow D\bar{D}$ Born cross sections, and confirmed the $G(3900)$ structure reported by BaBar and Belle with high significance. We identify the $G(3900)$ as the first P-wave $\DDbar$ molecular resonance. The experimental and theoretical identification of the P-wave dimeson state holds paramount importance in enhancing our comprehension of the non-perturbative QCD and few-body physics. Its existence is firmly established in a unified meson-exchange model which simultaneously depicts the features of the $\chi_{c1}(3872)$, $Z_c(3900)$ and $T_{cc}(3875)$. This scenario can be directly examined in the $e^+e^-\rightarrow D\bar{D}^*/\bar{D}D^*$ cross section by seeing whether a resonance exists at the threshold. The credibility of the investigations is also ensured by the fact that the P-wave interaction dominantly arises from the well-known long-range pion exchange. Additionally, thanks to the centrifugal barrier, it is easier to form resonances in P-wave than in S-wave. We extensively calculate all systems up to P-wave with various quantum numbers and predict a dense population of the $\DDbar$ and $\DD$ states, where the S-wave $\DDbar$ state with $I^G (J^{PC})=0^- (1^{+-})$, P-wave $\DDbar$ state with $I^G(J^{PC})=0^+(0^{-+})$, and P-wave $\DD$ state with $I(J^P)=0(0^-)$ are more likely to be observed in experiments.</description>

      <title>Mass measurements of neutron-rich nuclides using the Canadian Penning Trap to inform predictions in the $r$-process rare-earth peak region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06310</link>

Abstract: Studies aiming to determine the astrophysical origins of nuclei produced by the rapid neutron capture process ($r$ process) rely on nuclear properties as inputs for simulations. The solar abundances can be used as a benchmark for such calculations, with the $r$-process rare-earth peak (REP) around mass number ($A$) 164 being of special interest due to its presently unknown origin. With the advancement of rare isotope beam production over the last decade and improvement in experimental sensitivities, many of these REP nuclides have become accessible for measurement. Masses are one of the most critical inputs as they impact multiple nuclear properties, namely the neutron-separation energies, neutron capture rates, $\beta$-decay rates, and $\beta$-delayed neutron emission probabilities. In this work, we report masses of 20 neutron-rich nuclides (along the Ba, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Pm, Gd, Dy and Ho isotopic chains) produced at the CAlifornium Rare Isotope Breeder Upgrade (CARIBU) facility at Argonne National Laboratory. The masses were measured with the Canadian Penning trap (CPT) mass spectrometer using the Phase-Imaging Ion-Cyclotron-Resonance (PI-ICR) technique. We then use these new masses along with previously published CPT masses to inform predictions for a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) procedure aiming to identify the astrophysical conditions consistent with both solar data and mass measurements. We show that the MCMC responds to this updated mass information, producing refined results for both mass predictions and REP abundances.</description>
