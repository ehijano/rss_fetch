      <title>Rings Whose Units Have Identity Plus Quasi-Nilpotent Square</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the structural and characterizing properties of the so-called {\it 2-UQ rings}, that are rings such that the square of every unit is the sum of an idempotent and a quasi-nilpotent element that commute with each other. We establish some fundamental connections between 2-UQ rings and relevant widely classes of rings including 2-UJ, 2-UU and tripotent rings. Our novel results include: (1) complete characterizations of 2-UQ group rings, showing that they force underlying groups to be either 2-groups or 3-groups when $3 \in J(R)$; (2) Morita context extensions preserving the 2-UQ property when trace ideals are nilpotent; and (3) the discovery that potent 2-UQ rings are precisely the semi-tripotent rings. Furthermore, we determine how the 2-UQ property interacts with the regularity, cleanness and potent conditions. Likewise, certain examples and counter-examples illuminate the boundaries between 2-UQ rings and their special relatives.
  These achievements of ours somewhat substantially expand those obtained by Cui-Yin in Commun. Algebra (2020) and by Danchev {\it et al.} in J. Algebra \&amp; Appl. (2025).</description>

      <title>The Deligne-Simpson Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given k similarity classes of invertible matrices, the Deligne-Simpson problem asks to determine whether or not one can find matrices in these classes whose product is the identity and with no common invariant subspace. The author conjectured an answer in terms of an associated root system, and proved one implication in joint work with Shaw. In this paper we prove the other implication, thus confirming the conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present an encryption/decryption algorithm which use properties of finite MV-algebras, we proved that there are no commutative and unitary rings R such that Id (R) = L,where L is a finite BL-algebra which is not an MV-algebra and we give a method to generate BL-comets. Moreover, we give a final characterisation of finite BL-algebra and we proved that a finite BL-algebra is a comet or MV-algebras which are not chains.</description>

      <title>On cardinalities whose arithmetical properties determine the structure of solutions of the Yang--Baxter equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to provide purely arithmetical characterisations of those natural numbers $n$ for which every non-degenerate set-theoretic solution of cardinality $n$ of the Yang--Baxter equation arising from a skew brace (sb-solution for short) satisfies some relevant properties, such as being a flip or being involutive. For example, it turns out that every sb-solution of cardinality $n$ has finite multipermutation level if and only if its prime factorisation $n= p_1^{\alpha_1} \ldots p_t^{\alpha_t}$ is cube-free, namely $\alpha_i\leq 2$ for every $i$, and $p_i$ does not divide $p_j^{\alpha_j}-1$ for $i\neq j$. Two novel constructions of skew braces will play a central role in our proofs.
  We shall also introduce the notion of supersoluble solution and show how this concept is related to that of supersoluble skew brace. In doing so, we have spotted an irreparable mistake in the proof of Theorem C [Ballester-Bolinches et al., Adv. Math. 455 (2024)], which characterizes soluble solutions in terms of soluble skew braces.</description>

      <title>A new approach to the bialgebra theory for relative Poisson algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is natural to consider extending the typical construction of relative Poisson algebras from commutative differential algebras to the context of bialgebras. The known bialgebra structures for relative Poisson algebras, namely relative Poisson bialgebras, are equivalent to Manin triples of relative Poisson algebras with respect to the symmetric bilinear forms which are invariant on both the commutative associative and Lie algebras. However, they are not consistent with commutative and cocommutative differential antisymmetric infinitesimal (ASI) bialgebras as the bialgebra structures for commutative differential algebras. Alternatively, with the invariance replaced by the commutative $2$-cocycles on the Lie algebras, the corresponding Manin triples of relative Poisson algebras are proposed, which are shown to be equivalent to certain bialgebra structures, namely relative PCA bialgebras. They serve as another approach to the bialgebra theory for relative Poisson algebras, which can be naturally constructed from commutative and cocommutative differential ASI bialgebras. The notion of the relative PCA Yang-Baxter equation (RPCA-YBE) in a relative PCA algebra is introduced, whose antisymmetric solutions give coboundary relative PCA bialgebras. The notions of $\mathcal{O}$-operators of relative PCA algebras and relative pre-PCA algebras are also introduced to give antisymmetric solutions of the RPCA-YBE.</description>

      <title>Isomorphism of Clean Graphs over $\mathbb{Z}_n$ and Structural Insight into $M_2(\mathbb{Z}_p)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a finite ring with identity. The clean graph $Cl(R)$ of a ring $R$ is a graph whose vertices are pairs $(e, u)$, where $e$ is an idempotent element and $u$ is a unit of $R$. Two distinct vertices $(e, u)$ and $(f, v)$ are adjacent if and only if $ef = fe = 0$ or $uv = vu = 1$. The graph $Cl_2(R)$ is the induced subgraph of $Cl(R)$ induced by the set $\{(e, u): e \text{ is a nonzero idempotent and } u \text{ is a unit of } R\}$. In this study, we present properties that arise from the isomorphism of two clean graphs and conditions under which two clean graphs over direct product rings are isomorphic. We also examine the structure of the clean graph over the ring $M_2(\mathbb{Z}_p)$ through their $Cl_2$ graph.</description>

      <title>Classes of Preradicals Induced by Relative Injectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.01222</link>
      <description>arXiv:1511.01222v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper analyzes new classes of preradicals defined as weak forms of left exact and idempotent preradicals. We introduce prehereditary preradicals to generalize the hereditary property, and essentially idempotent and weakly idempotent preradicals to generalize idempotency. Our motivation is to study the concept of relative injectivity. We show that these new classes facilitate the extension of classical results on injectivity with respect to a hereditary torsion theory to a broader context, requiring weaker assumptions.</description>

      <title>Exact Algorithms for Computing Generalized Eigenspaces of Matrices via Jordan-Krylov Basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.04807v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An effective exact method is proposed for computing generalized eigenspaces of a matrix of integers or rational numbers. Keys of our approach are the use of minimal annihilating polynomials and the concept of the Jourdan-Krylov basis. A new method, called Jordan-Krylov elimination, is introduced to design an algorithm for computing Jordan-Krylov basis. The resulting algorithm outputs generalized eigenspaces as a form of Jordan chains. Notably, in the output, components of generalized eigenvectors are expressed as polynomials in the associated eigenvalue as a variable.</description>

      <title>Embedding Higman-Thompson groups of unfolding trees into the Leavitt path algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01363v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The isomorphism problem of regular Higman-Thompson groups was solved in arXiv:1006.1759, via embedding it into the Leavitt algebra. In this paper, we will expand these results to embed the Higman-Thompson groups of unfolding trees of directed graphs into the Leavitt path algebra. This embedding allows us to show that any isomorphism of rooted Leavitt path algebras induces an isomorphism between Higman-Thompson groups.</description>

Abstract: Let $A$ and $B$ be finite partially ordered sets (ordered sets). We show that if the ordered sets of self-maps $A^A$ and $B^B$ (ordered pointwise) are isomorphic, then $A$ and $B$ are isomorphic. This resolves a question originating with Duffus (1978), with related results by Duffus--Wille and Farley.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the annihilator condition $(a.c.)$ for skew Poincar\'e-Birkhoff-Witt extensions. We prove that some results about the annihilator condition $(a.c.)$ for skew polynomial rings also hold for skew PBW extensions. We also demonstrate that the behavior of annihilators is determined by the defining relations of the extension. Our results extend those corresponding presented for skew polynomial rings</description>

      <title>Maximal rigid modules over a gentle algebra and applications to higher Auslander-Reiten theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a bijective correspondence between the set of rigid modules over a gentle algebra and the set of admissible arc systems on the associated coordinated-marked surface. In particular, a maximal rigid module aligns with an equivalence class of admissible $5$-partial triangulations, which is an (admissible) set of simple arcs dissecting the surface into $s$-gons with $3\leqslant s\leqslant 5$. Furthermore, the rank of the maximal rigid module is equal to the rank of the algebra plus the number of internal $4$-gons and $5$-gons in the associated $5$-partial triangulation.
  Subsequently, these results facilitate an exploration of the higher Auslander-Reiten theory for gentle algebras with global dimension $n$. The $\tau_m$-closures of injective modules are realized as admissible $(m+2)$-partial triangulations, where $\tau_m$ are higher Auslander-Reiten translations with $2\leqslant m \leqslant n$. Finally, we provide a complete classification of gentle algebras that are $\tau_n$-finite or $n$-complete introduced by Iyama [I11].</description>

      <title>The Negation Of Singer's Conjecture For The Sixth Algebraic Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09455v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathscr A$ be the Steenrod algebra over the field of characteristic two, $\mathbb F_2.$ Denote by $GL(q)$ the general linear group of rank $q$ over $\mathbb F_2.$ The algebraic transfer, introduced by W. Singer [Math. Z. 202 (1989), 493-523], is a rather effective tool for unraveling the intricate structure of the (mod-2) cohomology of the Steenrod algebra, ${\rm Ext}_{\mathscr A}^{q,*}(\mathbb F_2, \mathbb F_2).$ The Kameko homomorphism is one of the useful tools to study the dimension of the domain of the Singer transfer. Singer conjectured that the algebraic transfer is always a monomorphism, but this remains open for all homology degrees $q\geq 5.$ In this paper, by constructing a novel algorithm implemented in the computer algebra system OSCAR for computing $GL(q)$-invariants of the kernel of the Kameko homomorphism, we disprove Singer's conjecture for bidegree $(6, 6+36).$</description>
