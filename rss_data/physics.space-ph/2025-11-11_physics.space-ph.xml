      <title>Forecasting Thermospheric Density with Transformers for Multi-Satellite Orbit Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate thermospheric density prediction is crucial for reliable satellite operations in Low Earth Orbits, especially at high solar and geomagnetic activity. Physics-based models such as TIE-GCM offer high fidelity but are computationally expensive, while empirical models like NRLMSIS are efficient yet lack predictive power. This work presents a transformer-based model that forecasts densities up to three days ahead and is intended as a drop-in replacement for an empirical baseline. Unlike recent approaches, it avoids spatial reduction and complex input pipelines, operating directly on a compact input set. Validated on real-world data, the model improves key prediction metrics and shows potential to support mission planning.</description>

      <title>Accelerometer Measurements for Orbit and Gravity Recovery: Challenges and Benefits for the BepiColombo Mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The European Space Agency's BepiColombo mission continues its pioneering voyage to Mercury, the innermost planet of the Solar System. Among the advanced instruments onboard the Mercury Planetary Orbiter (MPO) is the Italian Spring Accelerometer (ISA), whose scientific objectives are closely linked to the Mercury Orbiter Radio-Science Experiment (MORE). Together, these instruments aim to provide high-precision data on the spacecraft's orbit, as well as Mercury's gravity field and internal structure. This simulation study investigates how the modeling and parametrization of accelerometer measurements influence orbit and gravity field recovery and explores strategies to overcome the challenges associated with the co-estimation of all parameters. We assess the integrated retrieval accuracy of the spacecraft orbit, gravity field, and accelerometer parameters under different noise levels and varying observation geometries during the mission. The MPO orbit is propagated, and Doppler and accelerometer measurements are simulated based on available noise models. Our results indicate that postponing the estimation of accelerometer biases until a preliminary gravity field is established helps prevent gravity field mismodelings from being absorbed into the accelerometer parameters. The daily estimation of bias was found to be essential. Using one year of Doppler tracking data and applying Kaula regularization, we demonstrate the potential to recover Mercury's gravity field up to degree and order 40. Low-degree coefficients improve under more optimistic noise conditions. Errors in cross-track bias estimation rise sharply when the beta-Earth angle falls below 45{\deg}, corresponding to the degraded Doppler observability. Orbit determination achieved centimetre-level radial accuracy and metre-level along- and cross-track accuracy, with increased cross-track errors during low-observability periods.</description>

      <title>Regression to the Mean of Extreme Geomagnetic Storms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.02137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.02137v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extreme space weather events on Earth occur during intervals of strong solar wind driving. The solar wind drives plasma convection and currents in the near-Earth space environment. For low values of the driver, the Earth's response is linear, estimated by parameters such as the polar cap index based on ground magnetometer activity. Curiously, for extreme solar wind driving, the Earth's response appears not to increase beyond a saturation limit. Theorists have advanced a host of explanations for this saturation effect, but there is no consensus. Here, we demonstrate that the saturation is a manifestation of the regression to the mean effect resulting from random uncertainty in the time and magnitude of solar wind measurements. Our results reveal that data analysis underpinning the saturation theories is non-linearly biased; hence, the theories must be validated against the correct solar wind data. Correcting for the uncertainties reveals that the Earth's response to solar wind driving is linear throughout, and the impact of extreme geomagnetic storms can be twice as large as previously thought. We show that regression to the mean is a fundamental property of the relationship between measurement and the truth, where the truth corresponding to the measurement is closer to the mean. This effect is particularly pronounced for uncertain measurements of extreme values and is likely to manifest across various fields, from extreme climate studies to chronic medical pain.</description>
