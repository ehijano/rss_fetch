      <title>A Modified Landau-de Gennes Theory for Smectic Liquid Crystals: Phase Transitions and Structural Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the behaviour of Smectic-A (SmA) liquid crystals with a modified Landau-de Gennes (mLdG) model. The director and orientational order of SmA are described by a tensor-order parameter $\mathbf{Q}$, and the positional order is described by a real scalar $u$, which represents the deviation from the average concentration of liquid crystal molecules. Firstly, we prove the existence and regularity of the global minimiser of the mLdG free energy. Then, we analytically prove that the mLdG model can exhibit Isotropic-Nematic-Smectic phase transition in terms of the critical temperatures and stabilities of phases. Furthermore, we explore smectic configurations confined within a square domain with edge length $\lambda$. We analytically study the positional order far from and near the defects and the limiting cases with $\lambda\to 0$ and $\lambda\to\infty$, to potentially guide the behavior of SmA in finite domain size.With finite $\lambda$, we numerically recover BD-like and D-like states observed in experiments. The stability of a BD-like state is enhanced by the layer structure of positional order. The analogous $\mathbf{Q}$ profile of D-like states in nematics and smectics indicates the memory of the director in the N-S phase transition. We also study the frustrated smectic energy landscape and the strategy to alleviate the frustration.</description>

      <title>Ultra-soft liquid-ferrofluid interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft interfaces are ubiquitous in nature, governing quintessential hydrodynamics functions, like lubrication, stability and cargo transport. It is shown here how a magnetic force field at a magnetic-nonmagnetic fluid interface results in an ultra-soft interface with nonlinear elasticity and tunable viscous shear properties. The balance between magnetic pressure, viscous stress and Laplace pressure results in a deformed and stable liquid-in-liquid tube with apparent elasticity in the range 2 kPa -10 kPa, possibly extended by a proper choice of liquid properties. Such highly deformable liquid-liquid interfaces of arbitrary shape with vanishing viscous shear open doors to unique microfluidic phenomena, biomaterial flows and complex biosystems mimicking.</description>

      <title>Molecular dynamics characterization of the free and encapsidated RNA2 of CCMV with the oxRNA model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cowpea chlorotic mottle virus (CCMV) has emerged as an exemplary model system to assess the balance between electrostatic and topological features of ssRNA viruses, specifically in the context of the viral self-assembly process. Yet, in spite of its biophysical significance, little structural data of the RNA content of the CCMV virion is currently available. Here, the conformational dynamics of the RNA2 fragment of CCMV was assessed via coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, employing the oxRNA2 model. The behavior of RNA2 has been characterized both as a freely-folding molecule and within a mean-field depiction of a CCMV-like capsid. For the latter, a multi-scale approach was employed, to derive a radial potential profile of the viral cavity, from atomistic structures of the CCMV capsid in solution. The conformational ensembles of the encapsidated RNA2 were significantly altered with respect to the freely-folding counterparts, as shown by the emergence of long-range motifs and pseudoknots in the former case. Finally, the role of the N-terminal tails of the CCMV subunits (and ionic shells thereof) is highlighted as a critical feature in the construction of a proper electrostatic model of the CCMV capsid.</description>

      <title>Mechanics of poking a cyst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Indentation tests are classical tools to determine material properties. For biological samples such as cysts of cells, however, the observed force-displacement relation cannot be expected to follow predictions for simple materials. Here, by solving the Pogorelov problem of a point force indenting an elastic shell for a purely nonlinear material, we discover that complex material behaviour can even give rise to new scaling exponents in this force-displacement relation. In finite-element simulations, we show that these exponents are surprisingly robust, persisting even for thick shells indented with a sphere. By scaling arguments, we generalise our results to pressurised and pre-stressed shells, uncovering additional new scaling exponents. We find these predicted scaling exponents in the force-displacement relation observed in cyst indentation experiments. Our results thus form the basis for inferring the mechanisms that set the mechanical properties of these biological materials.</description>

      <title>Complex Dynamics in Reaction-Phase Separation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of sustained spatio-temporal behaviors in reaction-phase separation systems. We focus on binary systems, in which either one or both species can phase separate, and we discuss the stability of the homogeneous state determining the conditions for the emergence of a Hopf-type bifurcation. We then examine the effects of a specific autocatalytic chemical reaction, and computationally determine the full solutions to the partial differential equations. We find that when both species phase separate, sustained pulsed dynamics arise in one dimension. When considered in two dimensions, the system generates persistent, complex dynamic droplets, which do not generally appear if only one of the species can phase separate. We finally discuss the emergence of dynamics with complex features, which can be understood using the framework of a cellular automata.</description>

      <title>Resolving the kinetics of an ensemble of muscle myosin motors via a temperature-dependent fitting procedure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A data fitting procedure is devised and thoroughly tested to provide self-consistent estimates of the relevant mechanokinetic parameters involved in a plausible scheme underpinning the output of an ensemble of myosin II molecular motors mimicking the muscle contraction. The method builds on a stochastic model accounting for the force exerted by the motor ensemble operated both in the low and high force-generating regimes corresponding to different temperature ranges. The proposed interpretative framework is successfully challenged against simulated data, meant to mimic the experimental output of a unidimensional synthetic nanomachine powered by pure muscle myosin isoforms.</description>

      <title>Simplifying FFT-based methods for mechanics with automatic differentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast-Fourier Transform (FFT) methods have been widely used in solid mechanics to address complex homogenization problems. However, current FFT-based methods face challenges that limit their applicability to intricate material models or complex mechanical problems. These challenges include the manual implementation of constitutive laws and the use of computationally expensive and complex algorithms to couple microscale mechanisms to macroscale material behavior. Here, we incorporate automatic differentiation (AD) within the FFT framework to mitigate these challenges. We demonstrate that AD-enhanced FFT-based methods can derive stress and tangent stiffness directly from energy density functionals, facilitating the extension of FFT-based methods to more intricate material models. Additionally, AD simplifies the calculation of homogenized tangent stiffness for microstructures with complex architectures and constitutive properties. This enhancement renders current FFT-based methods more modular, enabling them to tackle homogenization in complex multiscale systems, especially those involving multiphysics processes. Our work will simplify the numerical implementation of FFT-based methods for complex solid mechanics problems.</description>

      <title>Self-assembled porous media from particle-stabilized emulsions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1408.2974</link>
      <description>arXiv:1408.2974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new mechanism to create self-assembled porous media with highly tunable geometrical properties and permeabilities: We first allow a particle-stabilized emulsion to form from a mixture of two fluids and colloidal particles. Then, either one fluid phase or the particle layer is solidified, which can be achieved by techniques such as polymerization or freezing. Based on computer simulations we demonstrate that modifying only the particle wettability or concentration results in porous structures with a wide range of pore sizes and a permeability that can be varied by up to three orders of magnitude. We then discuss optimization of these properties for self-assembled filters or reactors and conclude that structures based on so-called "bijels" are most suitable candidates.</description>

      <title>Structural origin of relaxation in dense colloidal suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Amorphous solids relax via slow molecular rearrangement induced by thermal fluctuations or applied stress. Although microscopic structural signatures predicting these structural relaxations have long been sought, a physically motivated structural measure relevant to diverse systems remains elusive. Here, we introduce a structural order parameter derived from the mean-field caging potential experienced by the particles due to their neighbors, which reliably predicts the occurrence of structural relaxations. The parameter, derived from density functional theory, is a measure of susceptibility to particle rearrangements that can effectively identify weak or defect-like regions in disordered systems. Using experiments on dense colloidal suspensions, we demonstrate a causal relationship between this order parameter and the structural relaxations of the amorphous solid. In quiescent suspensions, increasing the density leads to stronger correlations between the structure and dynamics. Under applied shear, the mean structural order parameter increases with increasing strain, signaling shear-induced softening, which is accompanied by the proliferation of plastic events. In both cases, the order parameter reliably identifies weak regions where the plastic rearrangements due to thermal fluctuation or applied shear preferentially occur. Our study paves the way to a structural understanding of the relaxation of a wide range of amorphous solids, from suspensions to metallic glasses.</description>

      <title>Physics of a granular pile</title>

Abstract: From the onset of the subject, granular media have been defying the toolkit of statistical mechanics thus preventing from understanding their thermodynamical and rheological properties and making them one of the key remaining mysteries in science. In the present work, we offer a resolution to this problem in the case of static granular media by considering a collective behavior of 2D identical balls forming a granular pile in the gravity field, which allows us to develop its thermodynamics and rheology from the first principles. Besides the uncertainty due to rough substrate on which the pile is built, we uncover another one due to ambiguities occurring in the positions of some interior balls. Both are responsible for the thermodynamic description of the granular pile, which proves to be anything but ordinary. In particular, we show that a pile is characterized by three temperatures: one is infinite, the other is negative, and the third is of higher-order. Also, considering the fields of ball displacements $\boldsymbol{\xi}$ and the normal force deviations $\delta\boldsymbol{N}$ from the ideal isosceles triangular structure of a regular pile reveals the hyperbolic nature of the $\boldsymbol{\xi}$-field and ability of the $\delta\boldsymbol{N}$-field to change the characteristic type from hyperbolic to elliptic. The latter property not only explains the origin of force chains and provides an adequate description of the rheology of static granular media, but turned out to be instrumental for understanding of granular media thermodynamics. Our model should provide a basis for further grasping of granular media properties, in general.</description>
