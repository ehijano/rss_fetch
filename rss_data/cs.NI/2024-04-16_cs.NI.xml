      <title>Integrating Multi -WAN, VPN and IEEE 802.3ad for Advanced IPSEC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the emergence of the internet, IPSEC has undergone significant changes due to changes in the type and behavior of users worldwide. IEEE 802.3ad, while considered a key aspect of the IPSEC model, is predictable and can result in potential design flaws, making it relatively easy to access a secure workstation. Thus, it is critical to leverage the benefits of multiple ISPs (multi-WAN) and a link aggregation model and integrate an aspect of randomisation in the network. This facet of the network is highlighted by the proof of concept in the simulation of a double pendulum. The analysis of POC provided a network topology designed to utilize multiple WAN, 802.3ad link aggregation, and other environmental components to create a sense of true randomness within a network system. An analysis of this approach shows that it accounts for the data stream's size, transmission speed, WANs and VPNs' location, and other environmental factors to create a sense of randomness. Based on the proof concept, it can be concluded that attaining randomisation using multi-WAN, VPN, and 802.3ad is a highly effective model for improving IPSEC.</description>

      <title>6AInets: Harnessing artificial intelligence for the 6G network security: Impacts and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This decade has witnessed the initiation of the digital revolution, as anticipated with the advent of 5G networks. Looking ahead to the 6G communication era, considerations are being made regarding how individuals will engage with the digital virtual world. The design of 6G technology, which will present enormous opportunities to develop and enhance human potential, will have a major impact on communications in the 2030s. We believe that in 6G we will see an unprecedented transformation that will set it apart from earlier wireless cellular network generations. Specifically, 6G will leverage ubiquitous AI services ranging from the network's core to its end devices, going beyond unpredictable limits. Despite the numerous advantages offered by 6G over existing technologies, there remains a pressing need to address security concerns. For example, the automation of critical processes in the 6G infrastructure will lead to a significantly broader and more intricate attack surface. Thus, the significance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in providing security aspects within the envisioned 6G paradigm is substantial, but its integration presents a dual-edged dynamic. Therefore, to strengthen and validate the relevance of AI in securing 6G networks, this article elucidates how AI can be strategically used in 6G security, addressing potential challenges, and proposing solutions to enhance its role in securing networks.</description>

      <title>RIS Assisted Wireless Networks: Collaborative Regulation, Deployment Mode and Field Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, RIS has made significant progress in engineering application research and industrialization and academic research. However, the engineering application research field of RIS still faces several challenges. This article analyzes and discusses the two deployment modes of RIs-assisted wireless networks: Network Controlled Mode and Standalone mode. It also presents three typical collaboration scenarios of RIS networks, including multi-RIS collaboration, multi-user access, and multi-cell coordination, which reflect the differences between the two deployment modes of RIS. The article proposes collaborative regulation mechanisms for RIS and analyzes their applications in the two network deployment modes in-depth. Furthermore, the article establishes simulation models of three scenarios and provides rich numerical simulation results. An actual field test environment was also built, where a specially designed and processed RIS prototype was used for preliminary field test and verification. Finally, this article puts forward future trends and challenges.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Typical structural health monitoring configuration implies sensors and supervisor installations connected by electric cable for communication. As done in other wireless projects, this one aim at reducing installation and maintenance costsby designing a wireless sensor network. One of the problem when designing wireless sensors, is data tagging: an event has to be correctly dated by many sensors. This problem increases when a precise time stamping is required. What distinguishes this project is the implementation of algorithms that allows precise time stamping by the use of a standard protocol and the separation between measurements operations and communication task in order to make modular sensors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data center networks are experiencing unprecedented exponential growth, mostly driven by the continuous computing demands in machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms. Within this realm, optical networking offers numerous advantages, including low latency, energy efficiency, and bandwidth transparency, positioning it as a compelling alternative to its electronic counterparts. In this work, we showcase a range of software-defined optical networking applications deployed on a general-purpose programmable integrated photonic processor. Leveraging graph-based theory, we experimentally demonstrate dynamic optical interconnects, circuit switching, and multicasting on the same photonic platform, yielding remarkable results in terms of crosstalk and reconfiguration speed. Our approach harnesses the benefits of reconfigurability and reliability, paving the way for a new generation of high-performance optical devices tailored for data center and computing clusters.</description>

      <title>Algorithm for AGC index management against crowded radio environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes a receiver that uses an innovative method to predict, according to history of receiver operating metrics (packet lost/well received), the optimum automatic gain control (AGC) index or most appropriate variable gain range to be used for next packet reception, anticipating an interferer appearing during the payload reception. This allows the receiver to have higher immunity to interferers even if they occur during the gain frozen payload reception period whilst still ensuring an optimum sensitivity level. As a result, the method allows setting the receiver gain to get an optimum trade-off between reception sensitivity and random interferer immunity.</description>

      <title>Routing and Spectrum Allocation in Broadband Quantum Entanglement Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate resource allocation for quantum entanglement distribution over an optical network. We characterize and model a network architecture that employs a single quasi-deterministic time-frequency heralded Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pair source, and develop a routing scheme for distributing entangled photon pairs over such a network. We focus on max-min fairness in entanglement distribution and compare the performance of various spectrum allocation schemes by examining the max-min and median number of EPR-pairs assigned by them, and the Jain index associated with this assignment. Since this presents an NP-hard problem, we identify two approximation algorithms that outperform others in minimum and mean EPR-pair rate distribution and are comparable to others in the Jain index. We also analyze how the network size and connectivity affect these metrics using Watts-Strogatz random graphs. We find that a spectrum allocation approach that achieves high minimum EPR-pair rate can perform significantly worse when the median EPR-pair rate, Jain index, and runtimes are considered.</description>

      <title>Generative AI Agent for Next-Generation MIMO Design: Fundamentals, Challenges, and Vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next-generation multiple input multiple output (MIMO) is expected to be intelligent and scalable. In this paper, we study generative artificial intelligence (AI) agent-enabled next-generation MIMO design. Firstly, we provide an overview of the development, fundamentals, and challenges of the next-generation MIMO. Then, we propose the concept of the generative AI agent, which is capable of generating tailored and specialized contents with the aid of large language model (LLM) and retrieval augmented generation (RAG). Next, we comprehensively discuss the features and advantages of the generative AI agent framework. More importantly, to tackle existing challenges of next-generation MIMO, we discuss generative AI agent-enabled next-generation MIMO design, from the perspective of performance analysis, signal processing, and resource allocation. Furthermore, we present two compelling case studies that demonstrate the effectiveness of leveraging the generative AI agent for performance analysis in complex configuration scenarios. These examples highlight how the integration of generative AI agents can significantly enhance the analysis and design of next-generation MIMO systems. Finally, we discuss important potential research future directions.</description>

      <title>ProSecutor: Protecting Mobile AIGC Services on Two-Layer Blockchain via Reputation and Contract Theoretic Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobile AI-Generated Content (AIGC) has achieved great attention in unleashing the power of generative AI and scaling the AIGC services. By employing numerous Mobile AIGC Service Providers (MASPs), ubiquitous and low-latency AIGC services for clients can be realized. Nonetheless, the interactions between clients and MASPs in public mobile networks, pertaining to three key mechanisms, namely MASP selection, payment scheme, and fee-ownership transfer, are unprotected. In this paper, we design the above mechanisms using a systematic approach and present the first blockchain to protect mobile AIGC, called ProSecutor. Specifically, by roll-up and layer-2 channels, ProSecutor forms a two-layer architecture, realizing tamper-proof data recording and atomic fee-ownership transfer with high resource efficiency. Then, we present the Objective-Subjective Service Assessment (OS^{2}A) framework, which effectively evaluates the AIGC services by fusing the objective service quality with the reputation-based subjective experience of the service outcome (i.e., AIGC outputs). Deploying OS^{2}A on ProSecutor, firstly, the MASP selection can be realized by sorting the reputation. Afterward, the contract theory is adopted to optimize the payment scheme and help clients avoid moral hazards in mobile networks. We implement the prototype of ProSecutor on BlockEmulator.Extensive experiments demonstrate that ProSecutor achieves 12.5x throughput and saves 67.5\% storage resources compared with BlockEmulator. Moreover, the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed mechanisms are validated.</description>

      <title>On the Benefits of Traffic "Reprofiling" -- The Multiple Hops Case -- Part I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers networks where user traffic is regulated through deterministic traffic profiles, e.g., token buckets, and requires hard delay bounds. The network's goal is to minimize the resources it needs to meet those bounds. The paper explores how reprofiling, i.e., proactively modifying how user traffic enters the network, can be of benefit. Reprofiling produces ``smoother'' flows but introduces an up-front access delay that forces tighter network delays. The paper explores this trade-off and demonstrates that, unlike what holds in the single-hop case, reprofiling can be of benefit} even when ``optimal'' schedulers are available at each hop.</description>

      <title>ProSAS: An O-RAN Approach to Spectrum Sharing between NR and LTE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN), an industry-driven initiative, utilizes intelligent Radio Access Network (RAN) controllers and open interfaces to facilitate efficient spectrum sharing between LTE and NR RANs. In this paper, we introduce the Proactive Spectrum Adaptation Scheme (ProSAS), a data-driven, O-RAN-compatible spectrum sharing solution. ProSAS is an intelligent radio resource demand prediction and management scheme for intent-driven spectrum management that minimizes surplus or deficit experienced by both RANs. We illustrate the effectiveness of this solution using real-world LTE resource usage data and synthetically generated NR data. Lastly, we discuss a high-level O-RAN-compatible architecture of the proposed solution.</description>

      <title>Interactive Generative AI Agents for Satellite Networks through a Mixture of Experts Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In response to the needs of 6G global communications, satellite communication networks have emerged as a key solution. However, the large-scale development of satellite communication networks is constrained by the complex system models, whose modeling is challenging for massive users. Moreover, transmission interference between satellites and users seriously affects communication performance. To solve these problems, this paper develops generative artificial intelligence (AI) agents for model formulation and then applies a mixture of experts (MoE) approach to design transmission strategies. Specifically, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to build an interactive modeling paradigm and utilize retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to extract satellite expert knowledge that supports mathematical modeling. Afterward, by integrating the expertise of multiple specialized components, we propose an MoE-proximal policy optimization (PPO) approach to solve the formulated problem. Each expert can optimize the optimization variables at which it excels through specialized training through its own network and then aggregates them through the gating network to perform joint optimization. The simulation results validate the accuracy and effectiveness of employing a generative agent for problem formulation. Furthermore, the superiority of the proposed MoE-ppo approach over other benchmarks is confirmed in solving the formulated problem. The adaptability of MoE-PPO to various customized modeling problems has also been demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Feasibility Study of Function Splits in RAN Architectures with LEO Satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the evolution of Radio Access Network (RAN) architectures and their integration into Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN) to address escalating mobile traffic demands. Focusing on Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites as key components of NTN, we examine the feasibility of RAN function splits (FSs) in terms of fronthaul (FH) latency, elevation angle, and bandwidth (BW) across LEO satellites and ground stations (GS), alongside evaluating performance of Conditional Handover (CHO) procedures under diverse scenarios. By assessing performance metrics such as handover duration, disconnection time, and control traffic volume, we provide insights on several aspects such as stringent constraints for Low Layer Splits (LLSs), leading to longer delays during mobility procedures and increased control traffic across the feeder link in comparison with the case when gNodeB is onboard satellite. Despite challenges, LLSs demonstrate minimal onboard satellite computational requirements, promising reduced power consumption and payload weight. These findings underscore the architectural possibilities and challenges within the telecommunications industry, paving the way for future advancements in NTN RAN design and operation.</description>

      <title>A Paradigm For Collaborative Pervasive Fog Computing Ecosystems at the Network Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the success of edge and fog computing increased with the proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) solutions, such novel computing paradigm, that moves compute resources closer to the source of data and services, must address many challenges such as reducing communication overhead to/from datacenters, the latency to compute and receive results, as well as energy consumption at the mobile and IoT devices. fog-to-fog (f2f) cooperation has recently been proposed to increase the computation capacity at the network edge through cooperation across multiple stakeholders. In this paper we adopt an analytical approach to studying f2f cooperation paradigm. We highlight the benefits of using such new paradigm in comparison with traditional three-tier fog computing paradigms. We use a Continuous Time Markov Chain (CTMC) model for the N f2f cooperating nodes and cast cooperation as an optimization problem, which we solve using the proposed model.</description>

      <title>A Distributed Scalable Cross-chain State Channel Scheme Based on Recursive State Synchronization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As cross-chain technology continues to advance, the scale of cross-chain transactions is experiencing significant expansion. To improve scalability, researchers have turned to the study of cross-chain state channels. However, most of the existing schemes rely on trusted parties to support channel operations. To address this issue, we present Interpipe: a distributed cross-chain state channel scheme. Specifically, we propose a real-time cross-chain synchronization scheme to ensure consistent operations between two blockchains to a cross-chain state channel. Moreover, we propose a batch transaction proof scheme based on recursive SNARK to meet the cross-chain verification needs of large-scale users. Based on the above designs, Interpipe offers protocols for opening, updating, closing, and disputing operations to cross-chain state channels. Security analysis shows that Interpipe has consistency and resistance, and experimental results demonstrate that a cross-chain state channel can be nearly as efficient as an existing intra-chain state channel.</description>

OAL is implemented on off-the-shelf software-defined radios (SDR) and presents a smaller-scale alternative to expensive commercially available channel emulators. Path loss and propagation delay are the fundamental aspects of emulating a wireless channel. OAL provides a simple method to change these aspects in real-time. The emulator is implemented using a finite impulse response (FIR) filter. The FIR filter is written in Verilog and flashed on the SDRs Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). Most processing transpires on the FPGA, so OAL does not require high-performance computing hardware and SDRs. We validate the performance of OAL and demonstrate the utility of such a channel emulation tool using two examples. We believe that open-source channel emulators such as OAL can make reproducible wireless experiments accessible to many researchers in the scientific community.</description>

      <title>Improved methodology for longitudinal Web analytics using Common Crawl</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Common Crawl is a multi-petabyte longitudinal dataset containing over 100 billion web pages which is widely used as a source of language data for sequence model training and in web science research. Each of its constituent archives is on the order of 75TB in size. Using it for research, particularly longitudinal studies, which necessarily involve multiple archives, is therefore very expensive in terms of compute time and storage space and/or web bandwidth. Two new methods for mitigating this problem are presented here, based on exploiting and extending the much smaller (&lt;200 gigabytes (GB) compressed) _index_ which is available for each archive. By adding Last-Modified timestamps to the index we enable longitudinal exploration using only a single archive. By comparing the distribution of index features for each of the 100 segments into which archive is divided with their distribution over the whole archive, we have identified the least and most representative segments for a number of recent archives. Using this allows the segment(s) that are most representative of an archive to be used as proxies for the whole. We illustrate this approach in an analysis of changes in URI length over time, leading to an unanticipated insight into the how the creation of Web pages has changed over time.</description>

      <title>Quality of Experience Oriented Cross-layer Optimization for Real-time XR Video Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extended reality (XR) is one of the most important applications of beyond 5G and 6G networks. Real-time XR video transmission presents challenges in terms of data rate and delay. In particular, the frame-by-frame transmission mode of XR video makes real-time XR video very sensitive to dynamic network environments. To improve the users' quality of experience (QoE), we design a cross-layer transmission framework for real-time XR video. The proposed framework allows the simple information exchange between the base station (BS) and the XR server, which assists in adaptive bitrate and wireless resource scheduling. We utilize the cross-layer information to formulate the problem of maximizing user QoE by finding the optimal scheduling and bitrate adjustment strategies. To address the issue of mismatched time scales between two strategies, we decouple the original problem and solve them individually using a multi-agent-based approach. Specifically, we propose the multi-step Deep Q-network (MS-DQN) algorithm to obtain a frame-priority-based wireless resource scheduling strategy and then propose the Transformer-based Proximal Policy Optimization (TPPO) algorithm for video bitrate adaptation. The experimental results show that the TPPO+MS-DQN algorithm proposed in this study can improve the QoE by 3.6% to 37.8%. More specifically, the proposed MS-DQN algorithm enhances the transmission quality by 49.9%-80.2%.</description>

Abstract: In today's hyper-connected world, ensuring the reliability of telecom networks becomes increasingly crucial. Telecom networks encompass numerous underlying and intertwined software and hardware components, each providing different functionalities. To ensure the stability of telecom networks, telecom software, and hardware vendors developed several methods to detect any aberrant behavior in telecom networks and enable instant feedback and alerts. These approaches, although powerful, struggle to generalize due to the unsteady nature of the software-intensive embedded system and the complexity and diversity of multi-standard mobile networks. In this paper, we present a system to detect anomalies in telecom networks using a generative AI model. We evaluate several strategies using diffusion models to train the model for anomaly detection using multivariate time-series data. The contributions of this paper are threefold: (i) A proposal of a framework for utilizing diffusion models for time-series anomaly detection in telecom networks, (ii) A proposal of a particular Diffusion model architecture that outperforms other state-of-the-art techniques, (iii) Experiments on a real-world dataset to demonstrate that our model effectively provides explainable results, exposing some of its limitations and suggesting future research avenues to enhance its capabilities further.</description>

      <title>An Autoencoder-Based Constellation Design for AirComp in Wireless Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wireless federated learning (FL) relies on efficient uplink communications to aggregate model updates across distributed edge devices. Over-the-air computation (a.k.a. AirComp) has emerged as a promising approach for addressing the scalability challenge of FL over wireless links with limited communication resources. Unlike conventional methods, AirComp allows multiple edge devices to transmit uplink signals simultaneously, enabling the parameter server to directly decode the average global model. However, existing AirComp solutions are intrinsically analog, while modern wireless systems predominantly adopt digital modulations. Consequently, careful constellation designs are necessary to accurately decode the sum model updates without ambiguity. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end communication system supporting AirComp with digital modulation, aiming to overcome the challenges associated with accurate decoding of the sum signal with constellation designs. We leverage autoencoder network structures and explore the joint optimization of transmitter and receiver components. Our approach fills an important gap in the context of accurately decoding the sum signal in digital modulation-based AirComp, which can advance the deployment of FL in contemporary wireless systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.03364v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents two wireless measurement campaigns in industrial testbeds: industrial Vehicle-to-vehicle (iV2V) and industrial Vehicle-to-infrastructure plus Sensor (iV2I+), together with detailed information about the two captured datasets. iV2V covers sidelink communication scenarios between Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs), while iV2I+ is conducted at an industrial setting where an autonomous cleaning robot is connected to a private cellular network. The combination of different communication technologies within a common measurement methodology provides insights that can be exploited by Machine Learning (ML) for tasks such as fingerprinting, line-of-sight detection, prediction of quality of service or link selection. Moreover, the datasets are publicly available, labelled and prefiltered for fast on-boarding and applicability.</description>

      <title>The Role of Federated Learning in a Wireless World with Foundation Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are general-purpose artificial intelligence (AI) models that have recently enabled multiple brand-new generative AI applications. The rapid advances in FMs serve as an important contextual backdrop for the vision of next-generation wireless networks, where federated learning (FL) is a key enabler of distributed network intelligence. Currently, the exploration of the interplay between FMs and FL is still in its nascent stage. Naturally, FMs are capable of boosting the performance of FL, and FL could also leverage decentralized data and computing resources to assist in the training of FMs. However, the exceptionally high requirements that FMs have for computing resources, storage, and communication overhead would pose critical challenges to FL-enabled wireless networks. In this article, we explore the extent to which FMs are suitable for FL over wireless networks, including a broad overview of research challenges and opportunities. In particular, we discuss multiple new paradigms for realizing future intelligent networks that integrate FMs and FL. We also consolidate several broad research directions associated with these paradigms.</description>

      <title>Wireless Resource Optimization in Hybrid Semantic/Bit Communication Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, semantic communication (SemCom) has shown great potential in significant resource savings and efficient information exchanges, thus naturally introducing a novel and practical cellular network paradigm where two modes of SemCom and conventional bit communication (BitCom) coexist. Nevertheless, the involved wireless resource management becomes rather complicated and challenging, given the unique background knowledge matching and time-consuming semantic coding requirements in SemCom. To this end, this paper jointly investigates user association (UA), mode selection (MS), and bandwidth allocation (BA) problems in a hybrid semantic/bit communication network (HSB-Net). Concretely, we first identify a unified performance metric of message throughput for both SemCom and BitCom links. Next, we specially develop a knowledge matching-aware two-stage tandem packet queuing model and theoretically derive the average packet loss ratio and queuing latency. Combined with practical constraints, we then formulate a joint optimization problem for UA, MS, and BA to maximize the overall message throughput of HSB-Net. Afterward, we propose an optimal resource management strategy by utilizing a Lagrange primal-dual transformation method and a preference list-based heuristic algorithm with polynomial-time complexity. Numerical results not only demonstrate the accuracy of our analytical queuing model, but also validate the performance superiority of our proposed strategy compared with different benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Optimal Slicing and Scheduling with Service Guarantees in Multi-Hop Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the problem of scheduling in wireless networks to meet end-to-end service guarantees. Using network slicing to decouple the queueing dynamics between flows, we show that the network's ability to meet hard throughput and deadline requirements is largely influenced by the scheduling policy. We characterize the feasible throughput/deadline region for a flow under a fixed route and set of slices, and find throughput- and deadline-optimal policies for a solitary flow. We formulate the feasibility problem for multiple flows in a general topology as a mixed-integer program, and show that it grows exponentially in the size of the network. Drawing on results from the solitary flow setting, we show that scheduling links in a regular fashion leads to smaller delay, and we derive tighter upper bounds on end-to-end delay for regular schedules. Finally, we design a polynomial-time algorithm that returns an (almost) regular schedule, optimized to meet service guarantees for all flows.</description>

Abstract: Over the past few years, ubiquitous, or pervasive computing has gained popularity as the primary approach for a wide range of applications, including enterprise-grade systems, consumer applications, and gaming systems. Ubiquitous computing refers to the integration of computing technologies into everyday objects and environments, creating a network of interconnected devices that can communicate with each other and with humans. By using ubiquitous computing technologies, communities can become more connected and efficient, with members able to communicate and collaborate more easily. This enabled interconnectedness and collaboration can lead to a more successful and sustainable community. The spread of ubiquitous computing, however, has emphasized the importance of automated learning and smart applications in general. Even though there have been significant strides in Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning, large scale adoption has been hesitant due to mounting pressure on expensive and highly complex cloud numerical-compute infrastructures. Adopting, and even developing, practical machine learning systems can come with prohibitive costs, not only in terms of complex infrastructures but also of solid expertise in Data Science and Machine Learning. In this paper we present an innovative approach for low-code development and deployment of end-to-end AI cooperative application pipelines. We address infrastructure allocation, costs, and secure job distribution in a fully decentralized global cooperative community based on tokenized economics.</description>

      <title>Asynchronous Federated Reinforcement Learning with Policy Gradient Updates: Algorithm Design and Convergence Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To improve the efficiency of reinforcement learning, we propose a novel asynchronous federated reinforcement learning framework termed AFedPG, which constructs a global model through collaboration among $N$ agents using policy gradient (PG) updates. To handle the challenge of lagged policies in asynchronous settings, we design delay-adaptive lookahead and normalized update techniques that can effectively handle the heterogeneous arrival times of policy gradients. We analyze the theoretical global convergence bound of AFedPG, and characterize the advantage of the proposed algorithm in terms of both the sample complexity and time complexity. Specifically, our AFedPG method achieves $\mathcal{O}(\frac{{\epsilon}^{-2.5}}{N})$ sample complexity at each agent on average. Compared to the single agent setting with $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2.5})$ sample complexity, it enjoys a linear speedup with respect to the number of agents. Moreover, compared to synchronous FedPG, AFedPG improves the time complexity from $\mathcal{O}(\frac{t_{\max}}{N})$ to $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{1}{t_{i}}})$, where $t_{i}$ denotes the time consumption in each iteration at the agent $i$, and $t_{\max}$ is the largest one. The latter complexity $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{1}{t_{i}}})$ is always smaller than the former one, and this improvement becomes significant in large-scale federated settings with heterogeneous computing powers ($t_{\max}\gg t_{\min}$). Finally, we empirically verify the improved performances of AFedPG in three MuJoCo environments with varying numbers of agents. We also demonstrate the improvements with different computing heterogeneity.</description>
