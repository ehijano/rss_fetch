      <title>A Polarimetry-based Field-deployable Non-interruptive Mirror Soiling Detection Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The soiling level of heliostat mirrors in Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) fields is one of the key factors that significantly influences optical efficiency. State-of-the-art methods of monitoring heliostats soiling levels have limitations such as slow, labor-intensive, high-cost installation, and interruptive to solar field operations. Here we present a rapid, cost-effective, user-friendly and non-intrusive Polarimetric Imaging-based Mirror Soiling (PIMS) detection method. The PIMS imaging device is very compact and can be integrated on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) for single-shot measurement of large area measurement on Heliostat mirrors for fast soiling detection without labor-intensive inspection of each heliostat with a reflectometer. With skylight as a natural light source, we developed a methodology to correlate Degree of Linear Polarization (DoLP) image of mirrors to their soiling levels using an experimentally calibrated model based on Mie Scattering Theory and Monte-Carlo simulation. For field deployment of the PIMS method, minimal pre-installation is required, and the field operation is not interrupted by the UAV imaging process. The PIMS method has significant potential for deployment in various concentration solar-thermal power (CSP) plants, offering high speed, non-interruptive mirror soiling detection. Moreover, the method can be further developed for other types of solar fields, such as parabolic troughs, solar panels, etc.</description>

      <title>Customizing pseudospin unidirectional states of acoustic and electromagnetic waves in two-dimensional phoxonic topological insulators via multi-objective strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological materials for classical waves offer remarkable potential in applications such as sensing, waveguiding and signal processing, leveraging topological protection effects like strong robustness, immunity to backscattering and unidirectional transmission. This work presents the simultaneous inverse design of pseudospin-dependent topological edge states for acoustic and electromagnetic waves in two-dimensional $C_{\textrm{6v}}$ phoxonic crystals. The phoxonic crystals are created by arranging the silicon columns periodically in the air background. We propose a multi-objective optimization framework based on the NSGA-II collaborated with the finite element approach, where the bandgaps of acoustic and electromagnetic waves are treated separately as the objective values. The topological nature of bandgaps is determined by analyzing the positional relationships of paired degenerate modes through the modal field calculations, enabling the customization of one of the two bandgaps within the same unit cell. Unlike traditional approaches relying on the band inversion to induce topological phase transitions, the proposed approach directly generates a pair of unit cells with distinct topological properties for both wave types, achieving the maximum bandgap matching in each case. We further demonstrate the existence of the pseudospin-dependent topological edge states for both acoustic and electromagnetic waves, verifying their unidirectionality and robustness against backscattering and defects. This work establishes a systematic strategy for customizing phoxonic topological states, offering a new avenue for the inverse design of multi-functional devices based on both sound and light.</description>

      <title>Analytical modeling of laminated composite rings on nonreciprocal elastic foundations under non-axisymmetric loading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A mechanical model of a laminated composite ring on a nonreciprocal elastic foundation is a valuable engineering tool during the early design stages of various applications, such as non-pneumatic wheels, flexible bearings, expandable tubulars in oil wells, and vascular stents interacting with blood vessel linings, especially under non-axisymmetric loadings. Despite its importance, limited research has focused on the interaction between laminated composite rings and nonreciprocal elastic foundations. Moreover, no quantitative studies have yet explored the influence of foundation stiffness on the ring deformation. This work aims to develop an analytical framework for a laminated composite ring supported by a nonreciprocal elastic foundation under non-axisymmetric loading conditions. The model generates a design map that correlates the foundation stiffness with the ring deformation, accounting for ring dimensions, laminate layup architecture, and lamina anisotropy. The closed-form solution provides an efficient design tool for analyzing non-axisymmetric and nonuniform loadings at a low computational cost. The resulting design map provides a valuable resource for exploring the interaction between the nonreciprocal foundation and the laminated ring. The proposed analytical framework and design map hold broad potential applications in automotive, mechanical, civil, and biomedical engineering fields.</description>

      <title>Landau-Levich Scaling for Optimization of Quantum Dot Layer Morphology and Thickness for Enhanced Quantum-Dot Light-Emitting Diode Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum dot (QD) light-emitting diodes (QLEDs) are promising candidates for next-generation displays because of their high efficiency, brightness, broad color gamut, and solution-processability. Large-scale solution-processing of electroluminescent QLEDs poses significant challenges, particularly concerning the precise control of the active layer's thickness and uniformity. These obstacles directly impact charge transport, leading to current leakage and reduced overall efficiency. Blade-coating is a prevalent and scalable solution processing technique known for its speed and minimal waste. Additionally, it allows for continuous "roll-to-roll" processing, making it highly adaptable in various applications. In this study, we demonstrate the precise control of blade speed in the Landau-Levich regime to create a uniform QD emission layer, using a commercial CdSe/ZnS QD as a representative example. QDs assemble into different morphologies on glass and the underlying layers of the QLED device due to variations in interaction energy. The QD film thickness can be modified from monolayer to multilayer by adjusting blade speed, which can be predicted by fitting the Landau-Levich-Derjaguin theory. The optimal speed at 7 mm/s results in a QD film with a surface coverage of around 163% and low roughness (1.57 nm mean square height). The QLED external quantum efficiency (EQE) of approximately 1.5% was achieved using commercially available CdSe/ZnS QDs with low photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), and an EQE of around 7% has been obtained using lab-made InP/ZnSe/ZnS QDs having a solution PLQY of 74%. All-blade-coated CdSe-QLEDs are further demonstrated by adopting the optimized speed for the QD layer. This method demonstrates significant potential for developing low-cost, reproducible, and scalable QLED technologies with uniform emission characteristics and low-waste production.</description>

      <title>C$_{60}$ building blocks with tuneable structures for tailored functionalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that C$_{60}$ fullerene molecules can serve as promising building blocks in the construction of versatile crystal structures with unique symmetries using first-principles calculations. These phases include quasi-2D layered structures and 3D van der Waals crystals where the molecules adopt varied orientations. The interplay of molecular arrangement and lattice symmetry results in a variety of tuneable crystal structures with distinct properties. Specifically, the electronic structures of these phases vary significantly, offering potential for fine-tuning the band gap for electronics and optoelectronics. Additionally, the optical properties of these materials are strongly influenced by their crystalline symmetry and molecular alignment, providing avenues for tailoring optical responses for photonics. Our findings highlight the potential of fullerene-based building blocks in the rational design of functional materials.</description>

      <title>Implementing photonic-crystal resonator frequency combs in a photonics foundry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore an AIM Photonics silicon-nitride platform to fabricate photonic-crystal resonators for generating optical parametric oscillators (OPO) and soliton microcombs. Our approach leverages the scalability and fine feature size of silicon-nitride processing on large-scale silicon wafers to achieve low-loss, high-Q microresonators, functionalized by nano-scale photonic-crystal structures. We demonstrate intrinsic microresonator quality factor up to 1.2*10^7 with complete foundry fabrication on 300 mm silicon, a 700 nm thick silicon-nitride device layer, and inclusion of complex nanophotonics. These features enable a host of nonlinear nanophotonics sources on the platform, including OPOs, microcombs, parametric amplifiers, squeezed-light generators, and single-photon sources. By fine-tuning the photonic-crystal design parameters, we achieve broad tunability in the frequency of the OPO output, spanning a significant portion of the near-infrared. Additionally, we observe the formation of soliton frequency combs, enabled by the precise dispersion engineering of the microresonators. These results highlight the potential of widely accessible, photolithographically patterned, silicon-nitride photonics to enable wide access to and complex integration of frequency-comb sources, with applications in spectroscopy, metrology, and communications.</description>

      <title>A self-learning magnetic Hopfield neural network with intrinsic gradient descent adaption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physical neural networks using physical materials and devices to mimic synapses and neurons offer an energy-efficient way to implement artificial neural networks. Yet, training physical neural networks are difficult and heavily relies on external computing resources. An emerging concept to solve this issue is called physical self-learning that uses intrinsic physical parameters as trainable weights. Under external inputs (i.e. training data), training is achieved by the natural evolution of physical parameters that intrinsically adapt modern learning rules via autonomous physical process, eliminating the requirements on external computation resources.Here, we demonstrate a real spintronic system that mimics Hopfield neural networks (HNN) and unsupervised learning is intrinsically performed via the evolution of physical process. Using magnetic texture defined conductance matrix as trainable weights, we illustrate that under external voltage inputs, the conductance matrix naturally evolves and adapts Oja's learning algorithm in a gradient descent manner. The self-learning HNN is scalable and can achieve associative memories on patterns with high similarities. The fast spin dynamics and reconfigurability of magnetic textures offer an advantageous platform towards efficient autonomous training directly in materials.</description>
