      <title>Are Universal Potentials Ready for Alkali-Ion Battery Kinetics?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accelerating alkali-ion battery discovery requires accurate modeling of atomic-scale kinetics, yet the reliability of universal machine learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs) in capturing these high-energy landscapes remains uncertain. Here, we systematically benchmark state-of-the-art uMLIPs, including M3GNet, CHGNet, MACE, SevenNet, GRACE, and Orb, against DFT baselines for cathodes and solid electrolytes. We find that the Orb-v3 family excels in static migration barrier predictions (MAE $\approx$ 75--111 meV), driven primarily by architectural refinements. Conversely, for dynamic transport, the GRACE model trained on the OMat24 dataset demonstrates superior fidelity in reproducing ion diffusivities and structural correlations. Our results reveal that while architectural sophistication (e.g., equivariance) is beneficial, the inclusion of high-temperature, non-equilibrium training data is the dominant driver of kinetic accuracy. These findings establish that modern uMLIPs are sufficiently robust to serve as zero-shot surrogates for high-throughput kinetic screening of next-generation energy storage materials.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of anomalous Hall effect in Si/Fe multilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anomalous Hall effect studies were performed at 300 K on Si/Fe multilayers prepared by dc magnetron sputtering. About 60 times enhancement in the saturation Hall resistance and 80 times enhancement in anomalous Hall coefficient are obtained in [Si(50 angstrom)/Fe(tFe)]_20 multilayers when decreasing the Fe layer thickness from 100 Angstrom to 20 Angstrom. The largest anomalous Hall coefficient (Rs) of 1.4 x 10^-7 Ohm m/T was found for t_Fe=20 Angstrom, which is about three orders of magnitude larger than that of pure Fe and Fe/Cr, Al/Fe, Cu/Fe, SiO2/FePt/SiO2 multilayers. The ordinary Hall coefficient R_0 was about two orders of magnitude larger than that of pure Fe. The R_s was found to vary with the longitudinal electronic resistivity, Rho as R_s proportional to (Rho)^2.2, indicating the role of interfaces for the enhancement of the anomalous Hall effect in the multilayers. An increase of Hall sensitivity from 9 mOhm/T to 1.2 Ohm/T is observed on decreasing tFe from 100 Angstrom to 10 Angstrom. The high Hall sensitivity obtained is about three orders of magnitude larger than that of Al/Fe and Cu/Fe multilayers, showing it as an emerging candidate for Hall element for potential applications.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Prediction of Ionic Conductivity in Solid-State Electrolytes with Machine Learning and Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) are attractive for next-generation lithium-ion batteries due to improved safety and stability but their low room-temperature ionic conductivity hinders practical application. Experimental synthesis and testing of new SSEs remain time-consuming and resource intensive. Machine learning (ML) offers an accelerated route for SSE discovery; however, composition-only models neglect structural factors important for ion transport while graph neural networks (GNNs) are challenged by the scarcity of structure-labeled conductivity data and the prevalence of crystallographic disorder in CIFs. Here, we train two complementary predictors on the same room-temperature, structure-labeled dataset (n = 499). A gradient-boosted tree regressor (GBR) combining stoichiometric and geometric descriptors achieves best performance (MAE = 0.543 in log(S cm-1)), and Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) identifies probe-occupiable volume (POAV) and lattice parameters as key correlations for conductivity. In parallel, we fine-tune large language models (LLMs) using compact text prompts derived from CIF metadata (formula with optional symmetry and disorder tags), avoiding direct use of raw atomic coordinates. Notably, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct achieves high accuracy (MAE = 0.657 in log(S cm-1)) using formula and symmetry information, eliminating the need for numerical feature extraction from CIF files. Together, these results show that global geometric descriptors improve tree-based predictions and enable interpretable structure-property analysis, while LLMs provide a competitive low-preprocessing alternative for rapid SSE screening.</description>

      <title>Magnetization and anomalous Hall effect in SiO2/Fe/SiO2 trilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SiO2/Fe/SiO2 sandwich structure films fabricated by sputtering were studied by varying the Fe layer thickness (t_Fe). The structural and microstructural studies on the samples showed that the Fe layer has grown in nanocrystalline form with (110) texture and that the two SiO2 layers are amorphous. Magnetic measurements performed with the applied field in in-plane and perpendicular direction to the film plane confirmed that the samples are soft ferromagnetic having strong in-plane magnetic anisotropy. The temperature dependence of magnetization shows complex behavior with the coexistence of both ferromagnetic and superparamagnetic properties. The transport properties of the samples as studied through Hall effect measurements show anomalous Hall effect (AHE). An enhancement of about 14 times in the saturation anomalous Hall resistance (R_Ahs) was observed upon reducing the t_Fe from 300 to 50 Angstrom. The maximum value of R_Ahs = 2.3 Ohm observed for tFe = 50 Angstrom sample is about 4 orders of magnitude larger than that reported for bulk Fe. When compared with the single Fe film, a maximum increase of about 56% in the R_Ahs was observed in sandwiched Fe (50 Angstrom) film. Scaling law suggests that the R_s follows the longitudinal resistivity (Rho) as, R_s proportional to (Rho)^1.9, suggesting side jump as the dominant mechanism of the AHE. A maximum enhancement of about 156% in the sensitivity S was observed.</description>

      <title>Giant anomalous Hall effect in ultrathin Si/Fe bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anomalous Hall effect studies on ultrathin Si(50Angstrom)/Fe(t_Fe) bilayers were performed at 300 K. Giant enhancements of about 60 times in saturation anomalous Hall resistivity and 265 times in anomalous Hall coefficient (R_s) were observed upon decreasing the Fe layer thickness t_Fe from 200 to 10 Angstrom. The R_s observed for t_Fe = 10 Angstrom is about three orders of magnitude larger than that of bulk Fe. The scaling law between R_s and longitudinal electrical resistivity (Rho) suggests that the side jump is the dominant mechanism of the anomalous Hall effect. The observed largest Hall sensitivity of 433 Ohm/T surpasses that of the semiconducting GaAs and InAs Hall sensors already reported.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional Intrinsic Janus Structures: Design Principle and Anomalous Nonlinear Optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional Janus structures have garnered rapidly growing attention across multidisciplinary fields. However, despite extensive theoretical and experimental efforts, a principle for designing intrinsic Janus materials remains elusive. Here, we propose a first-principles alloy theory based on cluster expansion, incorporating a strong repulsive interaction of a cation-mediated anion-pair cluster and refined short-range cluster-cluster competitions, to unravel the formation mechanism of intrinsic Janus structures with a distorted 1T phase among numerous competing phases. Our theory not only explains why intrinsic Janus structures are accidentally observed in RhSeCl and BiTeI which are composed of alloyed elements from different groups, but also accurately predicts a wide range of 1T-like intrinsic Janus materials that are ready for synthesis. Intriguingly, as demonstrated in the case of RhSeCl, we reveal that intrinsic Janus materials can exhibit anomalous second-harmonic generation (SHG) with a distinct quantum geometric effect, originating from strong lattice and chemical-potential mirror asymmetry. Furthermore, a novel skin effect unexpectedly emerges in finite-thickness RhSeCl, accompanied by a hidden SHG effect within the bulk region. Our theory paves the way for the ab initio design of intrinsic Janus materials, significantly accelerating progress in Janus science.</description>

      <title>Mesoscale Modelling of Confined Split-Hopkinson Pressure Bar Tests on Concrete: Effects of Internal Damage and Strain Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamic strength of concrete under complex loading conditions is a key consideration in the design and maintenance of infrastructures. To assess this mechanical property, Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar (SHPB) tests are typically adopted across a wide range of loading and confining conditions. In this study, mesoscale modelling based on the finite element method (FEM) is employed to simulate SHPB tests on three-phase concrete with realistic aggregate shape, in order to investigate the effects of loading ramp rate, internal friction, and confining pressure on the dynamic increase factor (DIF). Microscopic evidence to explain these effects is explored through analysing the distributions of the internal strain rate and local damage. As key results, increasing loading ramp rates, internal friction, and confining pressure can generally leads to higher DIF values. Only a higher loading ramp rate significantly amplifies the strain-rate effect on the DIF, as evidenced by pronounced increases in both internal strain rate and damage in the mortar and aggregate phases. In contrast, higher internal friction and confining pressure weaken the strain-rate effect on the DIF. Both can be attributed to the mortar phase, which shows a less pronounced increase in damage with increasing strain rate. This study enriches the understanding of the dynamic fracture of concrete toward complex loading scenarios.</description>

      <title>Lattice dynamics and structural phase stability of group IV elemental solids with the r$^2$SCAN functional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The strongly constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN) meta-GGA functional is a milestone achievement of electronic structure theory. Recently, a revised and restored form (r$^2$SCAN) has been suggested as a replacement for SCAN in high-throughput applications. Here, we assess the accuracy and reliability of the r$^2$SCAN meta-GGA functional for the group IV elemental solids carbon (C), silicon (Si), germanium (Ge), and tin (Sn). We show that the r$^2$SCAN functional agrees closely with its parent functional SCAN for elastic constants, bulk moduli, and phonon dispersions, but the numerical stability of r$^2$SCAN is superior. Both meta-GGA functionals outperform standard GGA (Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof) in terms of accuracy and approach the level of common hybrid functionals (Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof). However, we find that r$^2$SCAN performs much worse than SCAN for the $\alpha\leftrightarrow \beta$ phase transition of both Ge and Sn, yielding larger phase energy differences and transition pressures.</description>

      <title>Impact ionization in narrow band gap CdHgTe quantum well with "resonant" band structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Impact ionization probabilities were calculated in a CdHgTe quantum well, where the distance between electron subbands is close to the band gap energy. This band structure enables impact ionization with small momentum transfer for electrons in the second subband. The study demonstrates that such processes increase the impact ionization probability by approximately two orders of magnitude compared to the impact ionization probability for electrons in the first subband, for which transitions with small momentum changes are impossible. The probability of single impact ionization during the electron energy loss due to optical phonon emission is estimated. Experimental methods for detecting impact ionization in this structure are discussed.</description>

      <title>DFT modelling of stacking faults in hexagonal and cubic GaN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have performed density functional theory (DFT) calculations to characterize the energetics, and the atomic and electronic structure, of stacking faults in GaN, both in the stable hexagonal wurtzite (wz) phase and in the metastable cubic zincblende (zb) phase. In wz GaN, SFs on the (0001) planes can be divided into three different intrinsic stacking faults (I1, I2, and I3) and oneextrinsic stacking fault (E). In zb GaN, SFs form along (111) directions, giving one type each of intrinsic, extrinsic and twin SFs. Based on the calculated formation energy, I1 is the most stable SF of wz GaN in agreement with experiment. For zb GaN, the intrinsic stacking fault is the most dominant planar defect. To characterize the effect of the stacking faults on the electronic structure of the material, we examined the band density. We found that the bands near the valence band maximum in wz GaN are localised on the Ga-polar side of the stacking fault (i.e. on the Ga side of the Ga-N bonds perpendicular to the SF), with the bands near the conduction band minimum more on the N-polar side, though somewhat delocalised. We found the opposite trend in zb GaN; this behaviour is caused by a redistribution of charge near the interface. We also show the band offsets for the stacking faults, finding that they are very sensitive to local conditions, but can all be described as type II interfaces, with the presence of a stacking fault reducing the gap locally.</description>

      <title>Computational Design of Ductile Additively Manufactured Tungsten-Based Refractory Alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tungsten exhibits exceptional temperature and radiation resistance, making it well-suited for applications in extreme environments such as nuclear fusion reactors. Additive manufacturing offers geometrical design freedom and rapid prototyping capabilities for these applications, provided the intrinsic brittleness and low printability of tungsten can be overcome. Designing tungsten alloys with improved ductility, and thus printability in additive manufacturing, can be accelerated using a computationally derived performance predictor to screen out brittle compositions. Calculations of the Pugh ratio using density functional theory may serve this purpose, given its correlation with ductility. This process can be made more efficient through the use of machine learning interatomic potentials to accelerate density functional theory calculations. Here, we demonstrate that machine learning interatomic potentials can effectively identify optimal alloy compositions in the W-Ta-Nb system along the melting point-Pugh ratio Pareto front. The trend in Pugh ratio as a function of tungsten fraction is explained in terms of the electronic density of states at the Fermi level. Experimental validation reveals a strong correlation between the computed Pugh ratio and the observed crack fractions in additively manufactured alloys. Notably, the two alloys predicted to have the highest Pugh ratio values, W20Ta70Nb10 and W30Ta60Nb10, exhibit no intergranular microcracking in experiments.</description>

      <title>Controlled epitaxy of room-temperature quantum emitters in gallium nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to generate quantum light at room temperature on a mature semiconductor platform opens up new possibilities for quantum technologies. Heteroepitaxial growth of gallium nitride on silicon substrates offers the opportunity to leverage existing expertise and wafer-scale manufacturing to integrate bright quantum emitters in this material within cavities, diodes, and photonic circuits. Until now, it has only been possible to grow GaN QEs at uncontrolled depths on sapphire substrates, which is disadvantageous for potential device architectures. Here, we report a method to produce GaN QEs by metal-organic vapor phase epitaxy at a controlled depth in the crystal through the application of silane treatment and subsequent growth of 3D islands. We demonstrate this process on highly technologically relevant silicon substrates, producing room-temperature QEs with a high Debye Waller factor and strongly anti-bunched emission.</description>

      <title>Cavity-Mediated Radiative Energy Transfer Enables Stable, Low-Threshold Lasing in Hybrid Quantum Dot-Nanoplatelet Supraparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals are promising building blocks for optoelectronics due to their solution processability, spectral tunability, and ability to self-assemble into complex architectures. However, their use in lasing application remains limited by high working thresholds, rapid nonradiative losses from Auger recombination, and sensitivity to environmental conditions. Here, we report hybrid microscale supraparticles composed of core/shell CdSe/ZnS quantum dots (QDs) and CdSe/CdxZn1-xS nanoplatelets (NPLs), which overcome these limitations through efficient, cavity-mediated energy funneling and coupling. Broadband absorbing QDs rapidly transfer excitation to narrow emitting NPLs, enabling stable whispering gallery mode lasing with a low threshold of 0.35 mJ/cm2. These supraparticles retain optical performance after prolonged exposure to air, water, and continuous irradiation, offering practical advantages for optoelectronic devices and advanced pigment technologies. Ultimately, our approach provides a versatile, programmable platform for optical amplification and tunable emission control within colloidal photonic architectures. Keywords</description>

      <title>Growth of Large Crystals of Janus Phase RhSeCl Using Self-Selecting Vapour Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, interest in 2D Janus materials has grown exponentially, particularly with regard to their applications in spintronics and optoelectronic devices. The defining feature of Janus materials is the ordered arrangement of different layer terminations - creating chemically distinct surfaces and an inherent out-of-plane polarity. Among the few known Janus materials, RhSeCl is particularly intriguing as a rare example of an intrinsic Janus compound. Owing to its exceptional chemical stability, RhSeCl offers a promising platform for exploring the physics related to the Janus-structure. However, synthesising large, high-quality crystals of this compound remains a significant challenge. Here, we report a novel synthetic pathway for growing crystals up to 6 mm in lateral size via a two-step self-selecting vapour growth reaction. We further present a comprehensive comparison of newly developed synthesis routes with all previously reported methods for RhSeCl. During these investigations, we identified a previously unreported impurity that forms in specific growth pathways and demonstrate how it can be avoided to obtain phase-pure few- and monolayer flakes. We showcase the reproducibility of the process to obtain high-quality, large single-crystals and flakes.</description>

      <title>Unexpected Anisotropic Mn-Sb Anti-site Distribution and Van der Waals Epitaxy of MnSb2Te4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mn-Sb site mixing directly impacts both the magnetic and topological properties of MnSb2Te4. This study reveals, unlike previously believed, that these anti-sites can be unevenly distributed within the crystal. To that end, a polycrystalline sample was created with a two-step synthesis using MnTe and Sb2Te3 as precursors. DC-SQUID magnetometry was used to confirm its magnetic properties. In addition, the use of High-Resolution Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy combined with Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy allowed us to identify the presence of an inversion-breaking asymmetry in the anti-site distribution. This reduced-symmetry structure bears resemblance to the recently proposed class of Janus materials and thus warrants further exploration due to its potential for combining topology and magnetism with other effects, such as non-linear optics and piezoelectricity. Finally, to further elucidate the interplay between site mixing, doping, topology, and magnetism, a method for growing MnSb2Te4 thin films over amorphous SiOx using Sb2Te3 seeds is introduced. The successful Van der Waals epitaxy of MnSb2Te4 over Sb2Te3 seeds using Pulsed Laser Deposition is confirmed using Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy. This represents a crucial step in incorporating these materials into a Si-based architecture, which offers the possibility of controlling the Fermi lever via gating.</description>

      <title>Thermalization of Optically Excited Fermi Systems: Electron-Electron Collisions in Solid Metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrafast optical excitation of metals induces a non-equilibrium energy distribution in the electronic system, with a characteristic step-structure determined by Pauli blocking. On a femtosecond timescale, electron-electron scattering drives the electrons towards a hot Fermi distribution. In this work, we present a derivation of the full electron-electron Boltzmann collision integral within the random-k approximation. Building on this approach, we trace the temporal evolution of the electron energy distribution towards equilibrium, for an excited but strongly degenerate Fermi system. Furthermore, we examine to which extent the resulting dynamics can be captured by the numerically simpler relaxation time approach, applying a constant and an energy-dependent relaxation time derived from Fermi-liquid theory. We find a better agreement with the latter, while specific features caused by the balance of scattering and reoccupation can only be captured with a full collision integral.</description>

      <title>Chemical Origin of Exciton Self-trapping in Cs$_3$Cu$_2$X$_5$ Cesium Copper Halides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Copper halides Cs3Cu2X5 (X=Cl, Br, I) are promising materials for optoelectronic applications due to their high photoluminescence efficiency, stability, and large Stokes shifts. In this work, we uncover the chemical bonding origin of the Stokes shift in these materials using density functional theory calculations. Upon excitation, one [Cu2X5]3- anion undergoes sizeable local distortions, driven by Cu-X and Cu-Cu bond formation. These structural changes coincide with the formation of a self-trapped exciton, where particularly the hole is strongly localized on one anion. Analysis of the electronic structure and bonding reveals reduced antibonding interactions and enhanced bonding character in the excited state, stabilizing the distorted geometry. Our results establish a direct link between orbital-specific hole localization and bond formation. It provides a fundamental understanding of the excitation mechanism in Cs3Cu2X5 and offers design principles to tune optical properties in 0D copper halides.</description>

      <title>An exciting approach to theoretical spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theoretical spectroscopy, and more generally, electronic-structure theory, are powerful concepts for describing the complex many-body interactions in materials. They comprise a variety of methods that can capture all aspects, from ground-state properties to lattice excitations to different types of light-matter interaction, including time-resolved variants. Modern electronic-structure codes implement either a few or several of these methods. Among them, exciting is an all-electron full-potential package that has a very rich portfolio of all levels of theory, with a particular focus on excitations. It implements the linearized augmented planewave plus local orbital basis, which is known as the gold standard for solving the Kohn-Sham equations of density-functional theory. Based on this, it also offers benchmark-quality results for a wide range of excited-state methods. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the features implemented in exciting in recent years, accompanied by short summaries on the state of the art of the underlying methodologies. They comprise density-functional theory and time-dependent density-functional theory, density-functional perturbation theory for phonons and electron-phonon coupling, many-body perturbation theory in terms of the $GW$ approach and the Bethe-Salpeter equation. Moreover, we capture resonant inelastic x-ray scattering, pump-probe spectroscopy as well as exciton-phonon coupling. Finally, we cover workflows and a view on data and machine learning. All aspects are demonstrated with examples for scientific relevant materials.</description>

      <title>Raman scattering fingerprints of the charge density wave state in one-dimensional NbTe$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charge-density waves (CDWs) are ordered quantum states of conduction electrons accompanied by periodic lattice distortions. Raman scattering (RS) spectroscopy is therefore well suited for probing CDW-induced structural modulations. We investigate the CDW state in quasi-one-dimensional NbTe$_4$ using RS spectroscopy. At $T$=5~K, the resonantly enhanced Raman spectrum exhibits 25 phonon modes. Polarization-dependent measurements reveal a strong coupling between phonon-mode symmetry and crystallographic symmetry, with modes polarized parallel or perpendicular to the crystallographic $c$-axis, along which the one-dimensional structure is elongated. Temperature-dependent RS measurements identify a transition between commensurate and incommensurate CDW phases, accompanied by pronounced thermal hysteresis, with transition temperatures of approximately 45~K upon cooling and 90~K upon warming. The hysteresis width depends on the warming rate, indicating a finite nucleation rate of CDW domains and suggesting potential relevance for memory-device applications.</description>

      <title>Halide diffusion in mixed-halide perovskites and heterojunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Migration of halide defects guides ion transport in metal halide perovskites and controls the kinetics of halide mixing and phase separation. We study the diffusion of halide vacancies and interstitials in \ce{CsPb(I_{x}Br_{1-x})_{3}} and \ce{CsPbI_{3}}/\ce{CsPbBr_{3}} heterojunctions by molecular dynamics simulations using neural network potentials trained on density functional theory calculations. We observe enhanced diffusion of both vacancies and interstitials in the mixed halide compounds compared to the single halide ones, as well as a difference in mobility between Br and I ions in the mixed compound. Diffusion across heterojunctions is governed by the interface structure, where a Br-rich interface blocks migration of vacancies in particular, but an I-rich interface is permeable.</description>

      <title>Predictive autoencoder-transformer model of Cu oxidation state from EELS and XAS spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) produce detailed information about oxidation state, bonding, and coordination, making them essential for quantitative studies of redox and structure in functional materials. However, high-throughput quantitative analysis of these spectra, especially for mixed valence materials, remains challenging as diverse experimental conditions introduce noise, misalignment, broadening of the spectral features. We address this challenge by training a machine learning model consisting of an autoencoder to standardize the spectra and a transformer model to predict both Cu oxidation state and Bader charge directly from L-edge spectra. The model is trained on a large dataset of FEFF-simulated spectra and evaluates model performance on both simulated and experimental data. The results of the machine learning model exhibit highly accurate prediction across the domains of simulated and experimental XAS as well as experimental EELS. These advances enable future quantitative analysis of Cu redox processes under in situ and operando conditions.</description>

      <title>Differentiating through binarized topology changes: Second-order subpixel-smoothed projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key challenge in topology optimization (TopOpt) is that manufacturable structures, being inherently binary, are non-differentiable, creating a fundamental tension with gradient-based optimization. The subpixel-smoothed projection (SSP) method addresses this issue by smoothing sharp interfaces at the subpixel level through a first-order expansion of the filtered field. However, SSP does not guarantee differentiability under topology changes, such as the merging of two interfaces, and therefore violates the convergence guarantees of many popular gradient-based optimization algorithms. We overcome this limitation by regularizing SSP with the Hessian of the filtered field, resulting in a twice-differentiable projected density during such transitions, while still guaranteeing an almost-everywhere binary structure. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our second-order SSP (SSP2) methodology on both thermal and photonic problems, showing that SSP2 has faster convergence than SSP for connectivity-dominant cases -- where frequent topology changes occur -- while exhibiting comparable performance otherwise. Beyond improving convergence guarantees for CCSA optimizers, SSP2 enables the use of a broader class of optimization algorithms with stronger theoretical guarantees, such as interior-point methods. Since SSP2 adds minimal complexity relative to SSP or traditional projection schemes, it can be used as a drop-in replacement in existing TopOpt codes.</description>

      <title>Lambert W Function Framework for Graphene Nanoribbon Quantum Sensing: Theory, Verification, and Multi-Modal Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a rigorous mathematical framework connecting graphene nanoribbon quantum sensing to the Lambert W function through the finite square well (FSW) analogy. The Lambert W function, defined as the inverse of $f(W) = We^W$, provides exact analytical solutions to transcendental equations governing quantum confinement. We demonstrate that operating near the branch point at $z = -1/e$ yields sensitivity enhancement factors scaling as $\eta_{\text{enh}} \propto (z - z_c)^{-1/2}$, achieving 35-fold enhancement at $\delta = 0.001$. Comprehensive numerical verification confirms: (i) all seven bound states for strength parameter $R = 10$ satisfying the constraint $u^2 + v^2 = R^2$; (ii) exact agreement between theoretical band gap formula $E_g = 2\pi\hbar v_F/(3L)$ and empirical relation $E_g = 1.38/L$ eV$\cdot$nm; (iii) universal sensitivity scaling across biomedical (SARS-CoV-2, inflammatory markers, cancer biomarkers), environmental (CO$_2$, CH$_4$, NO$_2$, N$_2$O, H$_2$O), and physical (strain, magnetic field, temperature) sensing modalities. This unified framework provides design principles for next-generation graphene quantum sensors with analytically predictable performance.</description>

      <title>Charge-Carrier Mobility in Diamond: Review, Data Compilation, and Modelling for Detector Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reported electron and hole mobilities, and their saturation velocities, in diamond span orders of magnitude across the literature. We attribute this dispersion primarily to (i) the electric-field window probed in TCT measurements, (ii) the choice of mobility model, and (iii) the excitation source (alpha, laser, or electron). Using an aggregated literature dataset, we benchmark the Trofimenkoff and Caughey-Thomas parameterisations together with a new piecewise model for both conduction- and valence-band transport. For electrons, the piecewise model provides the best global description over a broad electric-field range and is shown to arise as the room-temperature limit of a more general superposition framework that explicitly incorporates intervalley repopulation in the conduction band. For holes, the Caughey-Thomas model remains the statistically preferred description, in line with the absence of a strong repopulation effect in the accessible data. Furthermore, we demonstrate a systematic source dependence (alpha versus laser) and quantify its impact on fitted mobility and saturation-velocity values. We provide temperature scalings over narrow intervals around room temperature and recommend parameter sets for implementation in device and detector simulation frameworks. Together, these results reconcile much of the apparent inconsistency in the literature and offer clear guidance for model selection, experimental design, and device-level simulation of charge transport in intrinsic diamond.</description>

      <title>Supercritical Snapping and Controlled Launching via Dual Latch Gels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Natural organisms have evolved integrated Latch-Mediated Spring Actuation systems (LaMSA) that consist of multiple latches and springs to enhance power output and adapt to diverse environmental conditions. Similar designs are appealing yet largely unexplored in engineered materials due to the complexity of integrating multiple components into a single material platform. Here, we report a dual-latched magneto-elastic shell device capable of selectively activating the latches to regulate snapping pathways and energy output based on specific actuation requirements. Differential deswelling across the thickness acts as the motor to load the elastic energy into the shell, which is then released via the snap-through instability once the loading reaches the critical threshold, constituting an intrinsic mechanical latch. Activation of the external magnetic latch delays snapping onset beyond the threshold of the intrinsic latch, leading to a power-amplified supercritical snap-through instability as well as a bifurcation instability. The combined function of both latches allows for flexible control over energy storage and release. Additionally, this integrated LaMSA system possesses an untethered anchoring mechanism, enabling the device to launch in arbitrary directions from the substrate, driven by the energy released during snapping. We envision that the design principles of dual-latched LaMSA systems will create opportunities for power-dense actuation in engineered materials and robotic devices.</description>

      <title>Combining laser ablation and Sol-Gel techniques for the synthesis of nanostructured organic-inorganic matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we report a new and simple method that combines the pulsed laser ablation in liquids (PLAL) and the Sol-Gel techniques to obtain nanocomposite glasses and gelatins. Gold nanoparticles (Au-NPs) are generated by PLAL using the corresponding target. The target is submerged in a transparent liquid solution made previously with tetraetylorthosilicate (TEOS) adding diluted hydrochloric acid as catalyzer. In the case of gelatins commercial gelatin and tap water are used. The laser source is a Nd:YAG laser emitting at 1064 nm, with an energy of 100 mJ and 8 ns pulse duration at 10 Hz repetition rate focused on the target in a 2 mm diameter laser spot. The ablation time is 10 min for the glasses and gelatins. The Au-NPs are uniformly dispersed in the solution. After the ablation process the gels are sealed and stored at room temperature for several days. The samples are characterized by UV-Vis spectroscopy, HRTEM, ellipsometry and AFM microscopy, these measurements reveal optical transparency and a refractive index near 1.45 for the pure glass, whereas a colorful aspect, a refractive index of 1.42, and a small surface roughness of 1.92 nm for the glass containing Au-NPs. In the case of gelatins self-sustained flexible films are obtained.</description>

      <title>Unconventional thermal conductivity of suspended zigzag graphene nanomesh</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compared to the study of graphene itself, the study of nano-structured graphene is rather limited because it is difficult to prepare atomically ordered edges. In this study, we have fabricated a periodically patterned mesh structure of graphene with atomically precise zigzag edges (zGNM: zigzag graphene nanomesh) and studied its thermal conductivity ($\kappa$) by opto-thermal Raman measurement. Unintuitively, it is found that the $\kappa$ of zGNM of 2,3 monolayers (MLs) thick is inversely proportional to the nanoribbon width ($W$), while that of zGNM of 5$\sim$10 MLs thick is independent of $W$ down to 30 nm. Since the $\kappa$ of suspended zigzag graphene nanoribbons (zGNRs) is suppressed by decreasing $W$, this nonclassical behavior of zGNM is due to the mesh structure. In addition, zGNRs show a higher $\kappa$ than GNRs with atomically rough edges. This is probably due to the atomically ordered zigzag edges.</description>

      <title>Coexisting electronic smectic liquid crystal and superconductivity in a Si square-net semimetal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electronic nematic and smectic liquid crystals are spontaneous symmetry-breaking phases that are seen to precede or coexist with enigmatic unconventional superconducting states in multiple classes of materials. In this Letter we describe scanning tunneling microscopy observations of a short ranged charge stripe (smectic) order in NaAlSi, whose superconductivity is speculated to have an unconventional origin. As well as this we resolve a clear spatial modulation of the superconducting gap amplitude, which arises due to the intertwined superconducting and smectic orders. Numerical calculations help to understand the possible driving mechanism as a suppression of kinetic energy on the Fermi surface formed in part by two large, flat-topped hole pockets of p-orbital character.</description>

      <title>A monolithic fabrication platform for intrinsically stretchable polymer transistors and complementary circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Soft, stretchable organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) can provide powerful on-skin signal conditioning, but current fabrication methods are often material-specific: each new polymer semiconductor (PSC) requires a tailored process. The challenge is even greater for complementary OFET circuits, where two PSCs must be patterned sequentially, which often leads to device degradation. Here, we introduce a universal, monolithic photolithography process that enables high-yield, high-resolution stretchable complementary OFETs and circuits. This approach is enabled by a process-design framework that includes (i) a direct, photopatternable, solvent-resistant, crosslinked dielectric/semiconductor interface, (ii) broadly applicable crosslinked PSC blends that preserve high mobility, and (iii) a patterning strategy that provides simultaneous etch masking and encapsulation. Using this platform, we achieve record integration density for stretchable OTFTs (55,000 cm^-2), channel lengths down to 2 um, and low-voltage operation at 5 V. We demonstrate photopatterning across multiple PSC types and realize complementary circuits, including 3 kHz stretchable ring oscillators, the first to exceed 1 kHz and representing more than a 60-fold increase in stage switching speed over the state of the art. Finally, we demonstrate the first stretchable complementary OTFT neuron circuit, where the output frequency is modulated by the input current to mimic neuronal signal processing. This scalable approach can be readily extended to diverse high-performance stretchable materials, accelerating the development and manufacturing of skin-like electronics.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Anomalous Hall Effect at Room Temperature in Antiferromagnetic Material NbMnAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that certain antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials with the same symmetry breaking as ferromagnets can generate sufficiently large ferromagnetic (FM) responses. Here, we report that the new AFM material NbMnAs exhibits a large anomalous Hall effect (AHE) at zero field and at room temperature, despite having only a small net magnetization. A polycrystalline sample of NbMnAs, likely close to stoichiometric composition, exhibited an AFM state with a small spontaneous magnetization of approximately $6 \times 10^{-3} \mu_{\rm B}$/Mn and the AHE below $T_{\rm N}=354\,{\rm K}$. In contrast, single crystals of NbMnAs obtained by a flux method exhibited a deficiency at the As site, {which resulted} in a decrease in $T_{\rm N}$ and an increase in spontaneous magnetization. Although improvement of the single-crystal growth is still required, our study reveals that NbMnAs is a novel material capable of exhibiting significant FM responses derived from antiferromagnetism at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Majorana Zero Modes and Topological Nature in Bi2Ta3S6-family Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we report that Bi2Ta3S6-family superconductors exhibit nontrivial band topology. They possess a natural quantum-well structure consisting of alternating stacks of TaS2 and honeycomb Bi layers, which contribute superconducting and topological properties, respectively. Symmetry-based indicators $(\mathbb{Z}_4;\mathbb{Z}_{2}\mathbb{Z}_{2}\mathbb{Z}_{2})=(2;000)$ reveal that the topological nature arises entirely from the Bi layers, which belong to a quantum spin Hall phase characterized by a $p_x-p_y$ model on a honeycomb lattice. The topological zigzag (ZZ) and armchair (AC) edge states are obtained. Using VASP2KP, the in-plane $g$ factors of these topological edge states are computed from the ab initio calculations: $g_{x/y}^{\mathrm{ZZ}}=2.07/1.60$ and $g_{x/y}^{\mathrm{AC}}=0.50/0.06$. The strong anisotropy of the edge-state $g$ factors allows us to explore Majorana zero modes in the Bi monolayer on a superconductor, which can be obtained by exfoliation or molecular beam epitaxy. The relaxed structures of the Bi2Ta3Se6, Bi2Nb3S6 and Bi2Nb3Se6 are obtained. Their superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ are estimated based on the electron-phonon coupling and the McMillan formula. Furthermore, using the experimental superconducting gap $\Delta$ and the computed $g$ factors, we obtain the phase diagram, which shows that the in-plane field $B_y&gt;2.62\mathrm{ T}$ can generate corner Majorana zero modes in the Bi monolayer of the superconductor Bi2Ta3S6. A similar paradigm also applies to the Bi2Ta3S6 bulk with the emergence of Majorana hinge states. These natural quantum-well superconductors therefore offer ideal platforms for exploring topological superconductivity and Majorana zero modes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The capabilities of a plug-flow fixed-bed cell for operando studies of heterogeneous catalysts are demonstrated using laboratory-based X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) with a von Hamos spectrometer. The cell operates at temperatures up to 1000 deg C and pressures up to 10 bar, equipped with three mass flow controllers and two infrared lamps for rapid heating under inert/reactive gas atmospheres. Proof-of-principle studies include in situ MnO oxidation in 5% Ni/MnO and operando Ni nanoparticle evolution in 20-NiO/COK-12 (20.2% NiO on SiO2) during CO2 methanation before/after activation. Within 5-15 min per spectrum, oxidation state changes are resolved while catalytic activity is simultaneously quantified by online GC. Extended datasets and methods are available in the ancillary file SI.pdf (Supplementary Information file). A shortened version is submitted to Journal of Analytical Atomic Spectrometry as a Technical Note.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exploration of novel topological insulators (TIs) beyond binary chalcogenides has been accelerated in pursuit of exotic quantum states and device applications. Here, the layered ternary chalcogenide Ge2Bi2Te5 is identified as a three-dimensional TI. The bulk electronic structure of Ge2Bi2Te5 features a hole-type Fermi surface at Fermi level EF, which dominates the transport properties. Moreover, an unoccupied topological surface state with a Dirac point located at 290 meV above EF has been observed. Theoretical calculations confirm a bulk bandgap and a nontrivial Z2 topological invariant (000;1). The present study demonstrates that the material family of layered tetradymite-like ternary compounds is an important platform to explore exotic topological phenomena.</description>

      <title>The rise and fall of stretched bond errors: Extending the analysis of Perdew-Zunger self-interaction corrections of reaction barrier heights beyond the LSDA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Incorporating self-interaction corrections (SIC) significantly improves chemical reaction barrier height predictions made using density functional theory methods. We present a detailed, orbital-by-orbital analysis of these corrections for three semi-local density functional approximations (DFAs) situated on the three lowest rungs of the Jacob's Ladder of approximations. The analysis is based on Fermi-L\"owdin Orbital Self-Interaction Correction calculations performed at several steps along the reaction pathway from the reactants (R) to the transition state (TS) to the products (P) for four representative reactions selected from the BH76 benchmark set. For all three functionals, the major contribution to self-interaction corrections of the barrier heights can be traced to stretched bond orbitals that develop near the TS configuration. The magnitude of the ratio of the self-exchange-correlation energy to the self-Hartree energy (XC/H) for a given orbital is introduced as an indicator of one-electron self-interaction error. For the exact, but unknown density functional, XC/H = 1.0 for all orbitals, while for the practical DFAs studied here, XC/H spans a range of values. The largest values are obtained for stretched or strongly lobed orbitals. We show that significant differences in XC/H for corresponding orbitals in the R, TS, and P configurations can be used to identify the major contributors to the SIC of barrier heights and reaction energies. Based on such comparisons, we suggest that barrier height predictions made using the SCAN meta-generalized gradient approximation may have attained the best accuracy possible for a semi-local functional using the Perdew-Zunger SIC approach.</description>

      <title>Visualization of Tunable Electronic Structure of Monolayer TaIrTe$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monolayer TaIrTe$_4$ has emerged as an attractive material platform to study intriguing phenomena related to topology and strong electron correlations. Recently, strong interactions have been demonstrated to induce strain and dielectric screening tunable topological phases such as quantum spin Hall insulator (QSHI), trivial insulator, higher-order topological insulator, and metallic phase, in the ground state of monolayer TaIrTe$_4$. Moreover, charge dosing has been demonstrated to convert the QSHI into a dual QSHI state. Although the band structure of monolayer TaIrTe$_4$ is central to interpreting its topological phases in transport experiments, direct experimental access to its intrinsic electronic structure has so far remained elusive. Here we report direct measurements of the monolayer TaIrTe$_4$ band structure using spatially resolved micro-angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (microARPES) with micrometre-scale resolution. The observed dispersions show quantitative agreement with density functional theory calculations using the Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof hybrid functional, establishing the insulating ground state and revealing no evidence for strong electronic correlations. We further uncover a pronounced electron-hole asymmetry in the doping response. Whereas hole doping is readily induced by electrostatic gating, attempts to introduce electrons via gating or alkali metal deposition do not yield a rigid upward shift of the Fermi level. Fractional charge calculations demonstrate that added electrons instead drive band renormalization and shrink the band gap. Taken together, our experimental and theoretical results identify the microscopic mechanism by which induced charges reshape the band topology of monolayer TaIrTe$_4$, showing that doping can fundamentally alter the electronic structure beyond the rigid band behaviour that is typically assumed.</description>

Abstract: At extreme strain rates, where fast moving dislocations govern plastic deformation, anharmonic phonon scattering imparts a drag force on the dislocations. In this paper, we present calculations of the dislocation drag coefficients of aluminum and copper as functions of temperature and density.

      <description>arXiv:2410.08294v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose machine learning (ML) models to predict the electron density -- the fundamental unknown of a material's ground state -- across the composition space of concentrated alloys. From this, other physical properties can be inferred, enabling accelerated exploration. A significant challenge is that the number of sampled compositions and descriptors required to accurately predict fields like the electron density increases rapidly with species. To address this, we employ Bayesian Active Learning (AL), which minimizes training data requirements by leveraging uncertainty quantification capabilities of Bayesian Neural Networks. Compared to strategic tessellation of the composition space, Bayesian-AL reduces the number of training data points by a factor of 2.5 for ternary (SiGeSn) and 1.7 for quaternary (CrFeCoNi) systems. We also introduce easy-to-optimize, body-attached-frame descriptors, which respect physical symmetries and maintain approximately the same descriptor-vector size as alloy elements increase. Our ML models demonstrate high accuracy and generalizability in predicting both electron density and energy across composition space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02367v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement fine-tuning played an instrumental role in enhancing the instruction-following and reasoning abilities of large language models. In this work, we employ reinforcement fine-tuning for materials design, in which discriminative machine learning models are used to provide rewards to the autoregressive transformer-based materials generative model CrystalFormer. By optimizing the reward signals-such as energy above the convex hull and material properties figures of merit-reinforcement fine-tuning infuses knowledge from discriminative models into generative models. The resulting model, CrystalFormer-RL, shows enhanced stability in generated crystals and successfully discovers crystals with desirable yet conflicting material properties, such as substantial dielectric constant and band gap simultaneously. Notably, we observe that reinforcement fine-tuning not only enables the property-guided material design but also unlocks property-based material retrieval behavior of pretrained generative model. The present framework opens an exciting gateway to the synergies of the machine learning ecosystem for materials design.</description>

      <title>Suppression of the valence transition in solution-grown single crystals of Eu$_2$Pt$_6$Al$_{15}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of Eu intermetallic compounds has allowed the exploration of valence fluctuations and transitions in 4f electron systems. Recently, a Eu$_2$Pt$_6$Al$_{15}$ phase synthesized by arc-melting followed by a thermal treatment was reported [M. Radzieowski \textit{et al.}, J Am Chem Soc 140(28), 8950-8957 (2018)], which undergoes a transition upon cooling below 45~K that was interpreted as a valence transition from Eu$^{2+}$ to Eu$^{3+}$. In this paper, we present the discovery of another polymorph of Eu$_2$Pt$_6$Al$_{15}$ obtained by high temperature solution growth, which presents different physical properties than the arc-melted polycrystalline sample. Despite the similarities in crystal structure and chemical composition, the Eu valence transition is almost fully suppressed in the solution-grown crystals, allowing the moments associated with the Eu$^{2+}$ state to order antiferromagnetically at around 14~K. A detailed analysis of the crystal structure using single crystal X-ray diffraction reveals that, although the solution grown crystals are built from the same constituent layers as the arc-melted samples, these layers present a different stacking. The effect of different thermal treatments is also studied. Different anneal procedures did not result in significant changes in the intrinsic properties, and only by arc-melting and quenching the crystals we were able to convert them into the previously reported polymorph.</description>

      <title>Getting the manifold right: The crucial role of orbital resolution in DFT+U for mixed d-f electron compounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurately modeling compounds with partially filled $d$ and $f$ shells remains a hard challenge for density-functional theory, due to large self-interaction errors stemming from local or semi-local exchange-correlation functionals. Hubbard $U$ corrections can mitigate such errors, but are often detrimental to the description of hybridized states, leading to spurious force contributions and wrong lattice structures. Here, we show that careful disentanglement of localized and delocalized states leads to accurate predictions of electronic states and structural distortions in ternary monouranates (AUO$_4$, where A represents Mn, Co, or Ni), for which standard $U$ corrections generally fail. Crucial to achieving such accuracy is a minimization of the mismatch between the spatial extension of the projector functions and the true coordination geometry. This requires Wannier-like alternatives to atomic-orbital projector functions, or corrections of Hubbard manifolds exclusively comprised of the most localized A-$3d$, U-$5f$ and O-$2p$ orbitals. These findings open up the computational prediction of fundamental properties of actinide solids of critical technological importance.</description>

      <title>pyRMG: A Framework for High-Throughput, Large-Cell DFT Calculations on Supercomputers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exascale computing delivers the raw power to simulate ever larger and more chemically realistic systems, but realizing this potential requires codes that can efficiently use thousands of processors. Our real-space multigrid (RMG) density functional theory (DFT) code's grid-decomposition approach scales nearly linearly with the number of GPUs, even for simulations exceeding thousands of atoms. This scalability makes RMG a compelling tool for high-throughput DFT studies of materials that would otherwise be bottlenecked in other codes (for example, by global Fast Fourier Transforms in plane-wave DFT). However, the limited workflow infrastructure for RMG has thus far constrained its adoption to a small user community. In this work, we present pyRMG, a Python package designed to streamline the setup and execution of RMG DFT calculations. Built on the pymatgen and ASE computational materials science Python packages, pyRMG automates input generation and convergence checking, and integrates with modern job schedulers (e.g., Flux) on leadership-class platforms such as Frontier and Perlmutter. We demonstrate pyRMG for a high-throughput study of interfacial strain and twist-angle effects in lattice-matched, 2D Bi$_2$Se$_3$/NbSe$_2$ heterostructures, which offers chemical insights into this system and shows that RMG-based workflows can converge with limited user intervention.</description>

      <title>Growth, discovery and characterization of single crystalline Eu$_{0.8}$Pt$_6$Al$_{16.4}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a ternary compound, Eu$_{0.8}$Pt$_6$Al$_{16.4}$. We determine its chemical and structural characteristics based on energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy as well as both powder and single-crystal X-ray diffraction, demonstrating that it crystallizes in a hexagonal structure type EuPt$_6$Al$_{17}$ with no reported structural analog. The electronic and magnetic properties are characterized by temperature- and field-dependent magnetization, and temperature-dependent resistance measurements, revealing that the Eu$^{2+}$ magnetic moments order antiferromagnetically below 2.8 K.</description>

      <title>PFT: Phonon Fine-tuning for Machine Learned Interatomic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many materials properties depend on higher-order derivatives of the potential energy surface, yet machine learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) trained with standard a standard loss on energy, force, and stress errors can exhibit error in curvature, degrading the prediction of vibrational properties. We introduce phonon fine-tuning (PFT), which directly supervises second-order force constants of materials by matching MLIP energy Hessians to DFT-computed force constants from finite displacement phonon calculations. To scale to large supercells, PFT stochastically samples Hessian columns and computes the loss with a single Hessian-vector product. We also use a simple co-training scheme to incorporate upstream data to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. On the MDR Phonon benchmark, PFT improves Nequix MP (trained on Materials Project) by 55% on average across phonon thermodynamic properties and achieves state-of-the-art performance among models trained on Materials Project trajectories. PFT also generalizes to improve properties beyond second-derivatives, improving thermal conductivity predictions that rely on third-order derivatives of the potential energy.</description>

      <title>Femtosecond spin-state switching dynamics of spin-crossover molecules condensed in thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01483v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The photoinduced switching of Fe(II)-based spin-crossover complexes from singlet to quintet takes place at ultrafast time scales. This a priori spin-forbidden transition triggered numerous time-resolved experiments of solvated samples to elucidate the mechanism at play. The involved intermediate states remain uncertain. We apply ultrafast x-ray spectroscopy in molecular films as a method sensitive to spin, electronic, and nuclear degrees of freedom. Combining the progress in molecule synthesis and film growth with the opportunities at x-ray free-electron lasers, we analyze the transient evolution of the Fe L3 fine structure at room temperature. Our measurements and calculations indicate the involvement of an Fe triplet intermediate state. The high-spin state saturates at half of the available molecules, limited by molecule-molecule interaction within the film.</description>

      <title>Knitting Multistability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14810v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Curved elastic shells can be fabricated through molding or by harnessing residual stresses. These shells often exhibit snap-through behavior and multistability when loaded. We present a unique way of fabricating curved elastic shells that exhibit multistability and snap-through behavior, weft-knitting. The knitting process introduces internal stresses into the textile sheet, which leads to complex 3D curvatures. We explore the relationship between the geometry and the mechanical response, identifying a parameter space where the textiles are multistable. We harness the snapping behavior and shape change through multistability to design soft conductive switches with built-in haptic feedback, and incorporate these textile switches into wearable devices. This work will allow us to harness the nonlinear mechanical behavior of textiles to create functional, soft, and seamless wearable devices. This includes but is not limited to the devices for additional cycling visibility and safety that we envision.</description>

      <title>Correlated phases in rhombohedral multilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14630v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of correlated electron phases in rhombohedral $N$-layer graphene due to two-valley Coulomb interactions within a low-energy $k \cdot p$ framework. Analytical expressions for Lindhard susceptibilities in intra- and intervalley channels are derived, and the critical temperatures for phase transitions are estimated using both the random phase approximation (RPA) and the parquet approximation (PA). Within RPA, only Stoner and intervalley coherent (IVC) phases are supported, while the PA reveals a richer phase structure including particle-particle (PP) channel instabilities. We establish a general scaling law for the critical temperature with respect to layer number $N$, highlighting an upper bound as $N \rightarrow \infty$, and demonstrate a non-monotonic decrease of the critical temperature with increasing chemical potential. The PA uncovers the role of interaction symmetry: $SU(4)$-symmetric interactions favor intervalley Stoner order in the density channel, whereas $SU(2) \times SU(2)$-symmetric interactions permit a broader set of phases. A crossover in the dominant instability occurs in the particle-hole channel at a critical layer number, suggesting the emergence of magnetic or IVC phases in thicker systems. We also identify conditions under which pair-density wave (PDW) order could form in the PP channel, though its physical realization may be constrained.</description>

      <title>Surface Optimization of Aluminum Resonators for Robust Quantum Device Fabrication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aluminum remains the central material for superconducting qubits, and considerable effort has been devoted to optimizing its deposition and patterning for quantum devices. However, while post-processing of Nb- and Ta-based resonators has been widely explored, primarily focusing on oxide removal using buffered oxide etch (BOE), post-treatment strategies for Al resonators remain underdeveloped. This challenge becomes particularly relevant for industry-scale fabrication with multichip bonding, where delays between sample preparation and cooldown require surface treatments that preserve low dielectric loss during extended exposure to ambient conditions. In this work, we investigate surface modification approaches for Al resonators subjected to a 24-hour delay prior to cryogenic measurement. Passivation using self-limiting oxygen and fluorine chemistries was evaluated utilizing different plasma processes. Remote oxygen plasma treatment reduced dielectric losses, in contrast to direct plasma, likely due to additional ashing of residual resist despite the formation of a thicker oxide layer on both Si and Al surfaces. A fluorine-based plasma process was developed that passivated the Al surface with fluorine for subsequent BOE treatment. However, increasing fluorine incorporation in the aluminum oxide correlated with higher loss, identifying fluorine as an unsuitable passivation material for Al resonators. Finally, selective oxide removal using HF vapor and phosphoric acid was assessed for surface preparation. HF vapor selectively etched SiO2 while preserving Al2O3, whereas phosphoric acid exhibited the opposite selectivity. Sequential application of both etches yielded dielectric losses as low as $\delta_\mathrm{LP} = 5.2 \times 10^{-7}$ ($Q\mathrm{i} \approx 1.9\,\mathrm{M}$) in the single photon regime, demonstrating a promising pathway for robust Al-based resonator fabrication.</description>
