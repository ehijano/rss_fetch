      <title>Stability and Vibrations of Proteins in Vacuum and Water: Bridging Quantum Accuracy and Force-Field Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting biomolecular thermodynamics and spectroscopy requires accurate relative energies of metastable states and local curvatures on the potential-energy surface. We show that the general-purpose SO3LR machine-learned force field (MLFF) reproduces PBE0+MBD density-functional theory with unprecedented fidelity across bio-relevant molecules spanning sizes and complexities far beyond its training dataset. For 23 small molecules, SO3LR captures harmonic and anharmonic vibrational features, including frequencies, displacement patterns, and IR spectra. We perform detailed dynamical studies of the amino acid oF-Phe+, folding of the alanine-15 peptide, and assembly of monomeric p53 transactivation domains into tetramers, in vacuum and water. SO3LR consistently reproduces DFT-level potential-energy surfaces, vibrational densities of states, and mode eigenvectors, capturing anharmonicity, polarization, and medium-range environment-driven interactions crucial for proteins. Our results establish that MLFF-driven dynamics provide a quantum-accurate picture of metastable minima and vibrational properties, achieving DFT-level accuracy at force-field computational cost and opening new possibilities for the computational study of biomolecules.</description>

      <title>Development of a glow-discharge ion-trap instrument for measuring effective radiative-association rate coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to directly measure radiative-association rate coefficients for reactions between ions and neutral molecules has long challenged chemical physics laboratories, yet radiative association is one of the most important processes occurring in cold, diffuse regions of space. A reaction kinetics instrument has been developed for the investigation of ion--molecule radiative-association reactions, aimed at measuring slow, effective reaction rate coefficients for species relevant to astrophysical objects. The instrument consists of a glow-discharge ion source for production of bright and stable ion currents, a quadrupole mass filter for mass selection and detection, and a quadrupole ion trap capable of trapping reactants and products for the long times needed to measure slow kinetics. The performance and adaptability of the glow-discharge ion source has been evaluated using several configurations. To assess the feasibility of measuring reaction rate coefficients, the reaction of Ag$^{+}$ and O$_{2}$ was studied under pseudo-first-order conditions in the ion trap at room temperature. We present the first pressure-dependent study of this reaction and extract a lower limit of $1 \times 10^{-15}$ cm$^3$ molecule$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$ for the Ag$^{+}$ + O$_{2}$ effective radiative-association rate coefficient. Measurements of effective radiative-association rate coefficients are possible for diverse atomic and molecular ions that react with neutral molecules over a range of rates in this versatile new instrument.</description>

      <title>A model for water transport in the membrane and an impedance spectroscopy study of the effect of relative humidity on PEM fuel cell parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective water management is essential for the optimal performance of PEM fuel cells. We have developed an impedance model for liquid water transport through the membrane and coupled it with the two-phase model for cathode side impedance. The complete model was fitted to experimental spectra measured at anode/cathode relative humidities (RH) of 32/32\%, 50/50\% and 100/100\% within a current density range of 100 to 1000 mA cm$^{-2}$ and an air flow stoichiometry of 2. Cathode catalyst layer (CCL) saturation decreases with current density due to a growing liquid pressure gradient. For all RH values, the CCL oxygen diffusivity increases dramatically with cell current due to progressive involvement of larger pores into the proton current conversion. Higher RH leads to higher double layer capacitance, which indicates that liquid water increases the electrochemically active surface area.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Quantum Algorithms for Computational Chemistry: Application to the Pyridine-Li ion Complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately capturing electron correlation in large-scale molecular systems remains one of the foremost challenges in quantum chemistry and a primary driver for the development of quantum algorithms. Classical configuration-interaction methods, while rigorous, suffer from exponential scaling, rendering them impractical for large or strongly correlated systems. Overcoming this limitation is central to realizing the promise of quantum computing in chemistry. Here, we investigate the pyridine-Li ion complex using three quantum algorithms: the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), the subspace quantum diagonalization (SQD) method, and the recently introduced handover iterative VQE (HI-VQE). Our results demonstrate how new generations of hybrid quantum-classical frameworks overcome the scalability and noise sensitivity that constrain conventional VQE approaches. SQD and HI-VQE achieve ground-state energy calculations for problem sizes inaccessible to classical computation, marking a clear advance toward quantum advantage. In particular, HI-VQE enables calculations within active spaces as large as (24e,22o), requiring 44 qubits-well beyond the reach of classical CASCI and VQE. This capability provides a systematic pathway for incorporating increasing numbers of electrons into quantum treatment, thereby approaching exact molecular energies. Importantly, both SQD and HI-VQE exhibit robustness against hardware noise, a critical improvement over earlier approaches. By enabling quantum simulations of molecular systems previously deemed intractable, SQD and HI-VQE offer a realistic route toward practical quantum advantage in computational chemistry. The comparison between HI-VQE and SQD shows that optimizing circuit parameters is crucial for accurate simulation.</description>

      <title>Nonadiabatic couplings drive ultrafast, mode-selective intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution in flavins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flavins are the chromophores in several blue-light-sensitive photoreceptor proteins and act as redox cofactors in many enzymes relevant for biological processes. Despite their biological relevance and numerous, detailed optical investigations of their photophysical properties, the ultrafast nonequilibrium dynamics of their elementary optical excitations are not yet fully known. Here, we use ultrafast coherent vibrational spectroscopy with 10-fs time resolution in the 450-nm spectral range to study their excited state coherent vibrational dynamics. We observe that coherent wavepacket motion along high-frequency C-C stretching modes with ~ 20-fs period is rapidly damped on a 20-fs timescale. In contrast, coherent motion along several low-frequency modes persists much longer. We attribute this to a mode-selective intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution driven by nonadiabatic couplings between the optical bright state and a close-lying dark electronic state, in accordance with model calculations. Our results may be of relevance for the formation of long-lived radical pair states in magnetic-field sensitive proteins.</description>

      <title>Molecular electrostatic potentials from machine learning models for dipole and quadrupole predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) is a key quantity for describing and predicting intermolecular and ion-molecule interactions. Here, we assess the ability of machine-learning (ML) models to infer the MEP, based on the equivariant graph-convolutional neural network architecture PiNet2 and trained on dipole and quadrupole moments. For the established QM9 dataset, we find that including the quadrupole contribution in the ML models substantially improves their ability to recover the MEP compared to dipole-only models. This trend is confirmed on the SPICE dataset, which spans a much broader region of organic chemical space. Together, this study underscores the central role of the quadrupole moment as a fitting target for ML models aiming at rapid access to the MEP.</description>

      <title>The Direct-Product Decomposition Approach for Symmetry Exploitation in Many-Body Methods in Case of Non-Abelian Point Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate for the specific case of $C_{3v}$ how the direct-product decomposition scheme for the treatment of symmetry in coupled-cluster (CC) calculations can be extended to non-Abelian point groups. We show that for the two-electron integrals and CC amplitudes a block structure can be obtained by resolving the reducible products of two irreducible representations into their irreducible representations. To deal with the necessary resorts of the ordering of the two-electron integrals and amplitudes, spin-adaptation, and the O(M$^5$) contractions (with M as the number of basis functions) of a CC calculation, we suggest a strategy that uses both the reduced and non-reduced representation of the corresponding quantities and switches back and forth between them. While the reduced representations are the ones used in the O(M$^6$) contractions, the other steps are better carried out in the non-reduced representation. Our pilot implementation of the CC singles and doubles method confirms in test calculations for NH$_3$ and PH$_3$ using different basis sets that significant savings (of more than 20 compared to treatments without symmetry and about 5 compared to treatments using $C_s$ symmetry) are possible and suggest that the exploitation of non-Abelian symmetry would render CC computations on large highly symmetric molecules possible</description>

      <title>Rotational Memory Function of SPC/E water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Memory effects are essential for dynamics of condensed materials and are responsible for non-exponential relaxation of correlation functions of dynamic variables through the memory function. Memory functions of dipole rotations for polar liquids have never been calculated. We present here calculations of memory functions for single-dipole rotations and for the overall dipole moment of the sample for SPC/E water. The memory functions for single-particle and collective dipole dynamics turn out to be nearly identical. This result validates theories of dielectric spectroscopy in terms of single-particle time correlation functions and the connection between the collective and single-particle relaxation times through the Kirkwood factor. The dielectric function in this formalism contains no new dynamic information that does not exist in the single-dipole correlation function. A short memory time, $\lesssim 1$ fs, justifies the use of rotational diffusion model to describe dynamics of a single molecular dipole moment in bulk water.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Quantum Simulation through Large Language Model Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that large language model (LLM) agents can autonomously perform tensor network simulations of quantum many-body systems, achieving approximately 90% success rate across representative benchmark tasks. Tensor network methods are powerful tools for quantum simulation, but their effective use requires expertise typically acquired through years of graduate training. By combining in-context learning with curated documentation and multi-agent decomposition, we create autonomous AI agents that can be trained in specialized computational domains within minutes. We benchmark three configurations (baseline, single-agent with in-context learning, and multi-agent with in-context learning) on problems spanning quantum phase transitions, open quantum system dynamics, and photochemical reactions. Systematic evaluation using DeepSeek-V3.2, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Claude Opus 4.5 demonstrates that both in-context learning and multi-agent architecture are essential. Analysis of failure modes reveals characteristic patterns across models, with the multi-agent configuration substantially reducing implementation errors and hallucinations compared to simpler architectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While current technology has enabled their widespread use, further improvements are needed for stationary, portable, and mobile applications, for example by the development of novel cathode materials. Digitalization of battery development, combining both experimental and modelling efforts is extremely valuable in this development. This is addressed in the present paper, where the authors present a comprehensive dataset for a graphite/LNMO 1 Ah pouch cell, including material, design, and electrochemical data. The dataset, validated through the BattMo modelling framework, supports physical modelling and aims to benefit the battery modelling community by offering a comprehensive resource for future studies. Both the dataset and the accompanying software for numerical validation is openly available and processed in such a way that it can serve as blueprint for reporting of comparable research data.</description>

      <title>Hidden long-range correlations in the ion distribution at the graphite / [bmim][NTf$_2$] electrified interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24900v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A capacitor consisting of the [bmim][NTf$_2$] ionic liquid (IL) confined in between planar graphite electrodes has been investigated by molecular dynamics based on an all-atom, unpolarizable force field. Despite a few peculiarities due to the size and complexity of the ions, properties such as the density of ions throughout the capacitor, the screening of the surface charge on the electrodes by the IL and exact sum rules for the radial distribution functions of cations and anions generally comply with the results of time honored theories of the electrostatic double layer. This soothing regularity may conceal hidden correlations still compatible with the static screening rules, propagating far inside the IL the information on the state of charge of the capacitor. Evidence in this respect might have been detected by vibrational spectroscopy (see, for instance, Langmuir 2021, vol. 37, 5193-5201) showing changes in optical properties of the IL far from the charged electrodes. We show that grouping the [bmim]$^+$ and [NTf$_2$]$^-$ ions into instantaneous neutral pairs reveals an intriguing long range ordering of ions normal to the interface, driven by the capacitor state of charge. These correlations manifest themselves through the parallel orientation of the dipole moments of the neutral ion pairs. We speculate that this effect changes the average intensity of fluctuating electric fields deep in the IL, while average, static fields vanish in agreement with well established screening laws. This effect, which could change the spectroscopic properties of the IL, is present in the simulated [bmim][NTf$_2$] / graphite capacitor, but too small to be unambiguously confirmed by the present simulations with a safe margin over the error bar. The conceptual interest in these effects, however, will motivate further studies of the same or similar electrode / ionic liquid interfaces.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Density Fitting with Adaptive-precision and 8-bit Integer on AI Accelerators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) accelerators like NVIDIA Tensor Cores offers new opportunities to speed up tensor-heavy scientific computations. However, applying them to quantum chemistry is challenging due to strict accuracy demands and irregular data patterns. We propose an adaptive precision algorithm to accelerate the density fitting (DF) method with Gaussian basis sets on AI accelerators using 8-bit integer (INT8) arithmetics. Implemented in the GPU-accelerated PySCF package, the algorithm is tested on more than twenty molecular systems with different NVIDIA GPUs. Compared to the standard FP64 code, our algorithm is up to 204\% faster on a RTX 4090 gaming GPU and up to 364\% faster on a RTX 6000 Ada workstation GPU without compromising the converged energy. This work demonstrates a practical approach to use AI hardware for reliable quantum chemistry simulations.</description>

      <title>Predicting the suitability of photocatalysts for water splitting using Koopmans spectral functionals: The case of TiO$_2$ polymorphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17488v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photocatalytic water splitting has attracted considerable attention for renewable energy production. Since the first reported photocatalytic water splitting by titanium dioxide, this material remains one of the most promising photocatalysts, due to its suitable band gap and band-edge positions. However, predicting both of these properties is a challenging task for existing computational methods. Here we show how Koopmans spectral functionals can accurately predict the band structure and level alignment of rutile, anatase, and brookite TiO$_2$ using a computationally efficient workflow that only requires (a) a DFT calculation of the photocatalyst/vacuum interface and (b) a Koopmans spectral functional calculation of the bulk photocatalyst. The success of this approach for TiO$_2$ suggests that this strategy could be deployed for assessing the suitability of novel photocatalyst candidates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05613v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cryogenic buffer gas sources are ubiquitous for producing cold, collimated molecular beams for quantum science, chemistry, and precision measurements. The molecules are typically produced by laser ablating a metal target in the presence of a donor gas. The radical of interest emerges due to a barrier-free reaction or under thermal or optical excitation. High-barrier reactions, such as between Ca and H$_2$, should be precluded. We study chemical reactions between Ca and three hydrogen isotopologues H$_2$, D$_2$, and HD in a cryogenic cell with helium buffer gas. We observe that H$_2$ can serve as both a reactant and a buffer gas, outperforming D$_2$ and HD. We use a reaction network model to describe the chemical dynamics and find that the enhanced molecular yield can be attributed to rapid vibrational excitations of the reactant gas. Our results demonstrate a robust method for generating bright cold beams of alkaline-earth-metal hydrides for laser cooling and trapping.</description>

Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are essential tools for unraveling atomistic insights into the structure and dynamics of condensed-phase systems. However, the universal and accurate prediction of macroscopic properties from ab initio calculations remains a significant challenge, often hindered by the trade-off between computational cost and simulation accuracy. Here, we present ByteFF-Pol, a graph neural network (GNN)-parameterized polarizable force field, trained exclusively on high-level quantum mechanics (QM) data. Leveraging physically-motivated force field forms and training strategies, ByteFF-Pol exhibits exceptional performance in predicting thermodynamic and transport properties for a wide range of small-molecule liquids and electrolytes, outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) classical and machine learning force fields. The zero-shot prediction capability of ByteFF-Pol bridges the gap between microscopic QM calculations and macroscopic liquid properties, enabling the exploration of previously intractable chemical spaces. This advancement holds transformative potential for applications such as electrolyte design and custom-tailored solvent, representing a pivotal step toward data-driven materials discovery.</description>

      <title>Nonadiabatic H-Atom Scattering Channels on Ge(111) Elucidated by the Hierarchical Equations of Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16916</link>

Abstract: Atomic and molecular scattering at semiconductor interfaces plays a central role in surface chemistry and catalysis, yet predictive simulations remain challenging due to strong nonadiabatic effects causing the breakdown of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. Here, we present fully quantum simulations of H-atom scattering from the Ge(111)c(2x8) rest site using the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) with matrix product states (MPS). The system is modeled by mapping a density functional theory (DFT) potential energy surface onto a Newns-Anderson Hamiltonian. Our simulations reproduce the experimentally observed bimodal kinetic energy distributions, capturing both elastic and energy-loss channels. By systematically examining atom-surface coupling, incident energy, and isotope substitution, we identify the strong-coupling regime required to recover the experimental energy-loss profile. This regime suppresses the elastic peak, implying additional site-specific scattering channels in the observed elastic peak. Deuterium substitution further produces a subtle shift in the energy-loss peak, consistent with experiment. These results establish HEOM as a rigorous framework for quantum surface scattering, capable of capturing nonadiabatic dynamics beyond electronic friction and perturbative approaches.</description>

      <title>Constrained dynamics for searching saddle points on general Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03931v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finding constrained saddle points on Riemannian manifolds is significant for analyzing energy landscapes arising in physics and chemistry. Existing works have been limited to special manifolds that admit global regular level-set representations, excluding applications such as electronic excited-state calculations. In this paper, we develop a constrained saddle dynamics applicable to smooth functions on general Riemannian manifolds. Our dynamics is formulated compactly over the Grassmann bundle of the tangent bundle. By analyzing the Grassmann bundle geometry, we achieve universality via incorporating the second fundamental form, which captures variations of tangent spaces along the trajectory. We rigorously establish the local linear stability of the dynamics and the local linear convergence of the resulting algorithms. Remarkably, our analysis provides the first convergence guarantees for discretized saddle-search algorithms in manifold settings. Moreover, by respecting the intrinsic quotient structure, we remove unnecessary nondegeneracy assumptions on the eigenvalues of the Riemannian Hessian that are present in existing works. We also point out that locating saddle points can be more ill-conditioning than finding local minimizers, and requires using nonredundant parametrizations. Finally, numerical experiments on linear eigenvalue problems and electronic excited-state calculations showcase the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms and corroborate the established local theory.</description>
