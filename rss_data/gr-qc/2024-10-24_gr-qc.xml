      <title>On the Unruh effect for hyperbolic observers in spacetimes of maximal proper acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the Unruh temperature formula is generalized to the case of hyperbolic observers in spacetimes of maximal proper acceleration, implying the existence of a maximal for the temperature. We explore this result for an electrodynamic model with maximal proper acceleration, showing that the maximal Unruh temperature is of order $10^5\, K$ for certain high acceleration gradient laser-plasma acceleration experiments.</description>

      <title>Astrophysical Consequences of Black Holes in Asymptotically Safe Quantum Gravity: Shadows and Strong Gravitational Lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the astrophysical consequences of black holes in asymptotically safe quantum gravity, characterized by the parameters $S_0$, $S_2$, $m_0$, and $m_2$, in addition to the black hole mass $M$. To evaluate the physical validity of the fundamental asymptotically safe theory of quantum gravity black hole solutions, we analyze their gravitational lensing properties in the strong field regime. Specifically, we examine the shadow cast by the asymptotically safe quantum gravity black hole and constrain its parameters using observational data from the M87* and Sgr A* supermassive black holes. Our analysis reveals that, within the $1\sigma$ confidence level, a significant portion of the parameter space for asymptotically safe quantum gravity black holes is consistent with the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations of M87* and Sgr A*. This suggests these black holes are plausible candidates for describing astrophysical black holes. As an additional observational test, we perform a detailed investigation of the strong gravitational lensing properties of these black holes. We explore the fundamental strong lensing observables in detail, including the angular positions and separations of the lensed images, the relative magnifications, the radius of the outermost Einstein ring, and the relativistic time delay between images. We compare the predictions of the asymptotically safe quantum gravity black hole for each observable with those of the classical Schwarzschild solution using realistic astrophysical data. Our findings provide a pathway for testing asymptotically safe quantum gravity at galactic and extragalactic scales, offering new insights into the observational properties of black hole solutions within this framework.</description>

      <title>Relativisitic non-pascalian fluid as a density contribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anisotropy of local pressure distribution and dissipation are essential in understanding the evolution of the internal structure of compact objects and their observable characteristics. In this work, we reinterpret local pressure anisotropy in relativistic stellar structures as a contribution to the energy density. This approach allows the modelling of any anisotropic equation of state in self-gravitating systems by treating anisotropy as a contribution. We demonstrate that this approach provides more realistic stellar models that meet essential physical criteria, such as mass-radius relationships and stability conditions. The results are compared to observational data, particularly the inferred compactness values for pulsars PSR J0740+6620 and PSR J0030+0451, showing that anisotropic and isotropic models can represent these objects. We further explore how dissipation, such as temperature gradients, influences radial pressure and show that it can be modelled similarly to anisotropy.</description>

      <title>The $D$-dimensional charged AdS black holes solutions in polytropic dark energy from Barrow entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper mainly aims to solve the Anti deSitter Black Holes (AdS BH) under the Barrow entropy under polytropic gas fluid, especially the Chaplygin Gas. First, we develop this last polytropic model in detail to then obtain the possible solutions and thermodynamic conditions on the Energy-Momentum and the Barrow Entropy for spacetimes of spatial dimension $D&gt;3$. Then, we focus on thermidynamic solutions and the different impacts on the Barrow entropy of the black hole, the temperature profile, the mass and the various physical quantities involved. Afterwards, we focus on the specific cases of the solutions of dimensions $D=4$ and $5$ in order to concretely test the models, especially from the point of view of the thermodynamic topology. Finally, we generalize everything by elaborating and testing the stability of the models to arrive at the thermal geometry of the AdS BH.</description>

      <title>The two-body problem in Yukawa gravity (a revisited version) and in Buckingham gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the Keplerian-like parametrization of the two-body problem in Yukawa gravity studied in the literature. Some inconsistencies which spoil the Bertrand's theorem, observed, in particular, in the formulae for the pericenter's advance are resolved. Moreover, inspired in this kind of study, we couple the Buckingham potential, a variation of the Lennard-Jones intermolecular potential, with the gravitational Newtonian potential and find a Keplerian-like parametrization for the solution of the two-body problem in this sort of gravity. The outcomes for the advance of the pericenter in both types of gravity are corroborated by using the Landau and Lifshitz's method.</description>

      <title>Unified Lagrangians for gravity and gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new Lagrangian formulation of General Relativity with cosmological constant, coupled to Yang-Mills gauge theory. The formulation has a manifest color/kinematics-dual structure, both in the choice of fundamental fields and in the way they appear in the Lagrangian. The color/kinematics duality is between gauge and Lorentz generators. The fundamental fields consists of 1-form connections and 0-form curvatures -- a structure inspired by higher-spin gravity. The new formulation can be arrived at by combining appropriate versions of the Plebanski and Chalmers-Siegel Lagrangians, and integrating out the Plebanski 2-form. The construction comes in chiral and non-chiral versions. The chiral version is slightly simpler, and highlights the self-dual sector. The non-chiral one makes parity manifest, and doesn't force us to complexify the theory.</description>

      <title>Gravitational and electromagnetic Cherenkov radiation constraints in modified dispersion relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by different approaches to quantum gravity, one could consider that Lorentz invariance is not an exact symmetry of nature at all energy scales. Following this spirit, modified dispersion relations have been used to encapsulate quantum gravity phenomenology. In the present work, we propose a class of Lorentz invariance violating phenomenological dispersion relations, which could be different for each particle species, to study the generalized vacuum Cherenkov radiation process. We identify the kinematic regions where the process is allowed and then compute the energy loss rate due to the emission of vacuum electromagnetic and gravitational Cherenkov radiation. Furthermore, we estimate constraints for the Lorentz invariance breaking parameters of protons and gravitons taking into account the existence (or absence) of vacuum gravitational Cherenkov radiation using ultra high energy cosmic ray detections.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The expansion dynamics of the universe in $f(Q)$ gravity is examined with the Gong-Zhang kind of dark energy equation of state parameter. By considering the $f(Q)$ gravity form $f(Q)=Q+ \alpha Q^{n}$, we obtain the Hubble parameters in terms of redshift $z$. Using Bayesian statistical methods based on the $\chi^{2}$ minimization methodology, we constrain the model parameters by using the supernovae Pantheon sample with cosmic chronometer sample. The evolution of equation of state parameter, energy density, pressure with the statefinder diagnostic are thoroughly investigated to examine the universe evolution in model. We have also obtained the universe's current age for these models. The considered models may exhibit either the quintom evolution or the future decelerating universe evolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we have worked out dynamical aspects for the particles moving around the GUP-corrected-Schwarzschild (S-GUP) black hole. We have calculated the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) around black hole and explored its implications for different microquasars. Additionally, we have shown that the Kerr black hole mimics S-GUP black hole after some tuning of parameters. Finally, considering the S-GUP black hole as a microquasar source, we have studied quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO). Further utilizing the available observational data of few microquasars, we have obtained constrains on the GUP parameter $\epsilon$ as well.</description>

      <title>Intermediate mass ratio inspirals in dark matter halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study eccentric equatorial orbits of a stellar-mass black hole around an intermediate-mass slowly rotating Kerr black hole in the presence of gravitational radiation and a dark matter halo. The stellar-mass companion will inspiral towards the central black hole while emitting gravitational waves. The evolution is affected by the dynamical friction force caused by the presence of dark matter surrounding the intermediate-mass black hole at the core. Previous studies have shown that the presence of dark matter can be deduced from the gravitational waveforms. We explore the combined effects of slow-rotation of the central black hole and the presence of the dark matter halo around it on the system's gravitational wave emission.</description>

      <title>Hypersurface deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deformations of spacelike hypersurfaces in space-time play an important role in discussions of general covariance and slicing independence in gravitational theories. In a canonical formulation, they provide the geometrical meaning of gauge transformations generated by the diffeomorphism and Hamiltonian constraints. However, it has been known for some time that the relationship between hypersurface deformations and general covariance is not a kinematical equivalence but holds only on the solution space of the constraints and requires their gauge equations and equations of motion to be used. The off-shell behavior of hypersurface deformations on their own, without imposing constraint and gauge equations, is therefore different from space-time diffeomorphisms. Its complete understanding is important for potential quantizations or modifications of general relativity in canonical form and of compatible space-time geometries that may be implied by them. Here, a geometrical analysis of hypersurface deformations is performed, allowing for a dependence of hypersurface deformation generators (the lapse function and the shift vector) on the phase-space degrees of freedom given by the geometry of an embedded spacelike hypersurface. The result is compared in detail with Poisson brackets of the gravitational constraints. As a new implication of physical relevance, covariance conditions are obtained for theories of emergent modified gravity without symmetry restrictions.</description>

      <title>Parity-violating Gravitational Wave Background Search with a Network of Space-borne Triangular Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Circularly polarized gravitational wave backgrounds are predicted in many well-motivated models of inflation and phase transitions involving spontaneous parity violation. In this work, we investigate the detection of such parity-violating signals with the network of two space-borne triangular detectors. We derive the general analytical formula for the overlap reduction functions of networks composed of two triangular detectors, by exploiting the system's symmetrical properties under the long-wave approximation. Based on these results, we further assess the detectability of a parity-violating background with alternative LISA-Taiji network configurations. We find that the sensitivity to the parity-violating component can be significantly enhanced at low frequencies by adjusting the orientation of Taiji's constellation plane. This sensitivity gain is approximately an order of magnitude around the millihertz band, making the peak sensitivity comparable to that of the total intensity. This provides a promising opportunity to constrain various parity-violating theories in the millihertz band with upcoming space-borne detectors.</description>

      <title>Stability analysis of power-law cosmological models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the stability analysis of power-law models, focusing on an alternative approach that differs significantly from the standard approaches used in studying power-law models. In the standard approach, stability is studied by reducing the system of background FRW equations to a one-dimensional system for a new background variable $X$ in terms of the number of e-foldings. However, we rewrote the equations, including $H$ also into the system and went on to do the calculations up to second order. We demonstrate by computing the deviations from the power-law exact solution to second-order and show that power-law contraction is never an attractor, regardless of parameter values. Our analysis shows that while first-order corrections align with existing interpretations, second-order corrections introduce significant deviations that cannot be explained by a simple time shift that explains the first-order diverging terms. We also support our claim with numerical results. This new insight has broader implications for the study of attractor behaviour of differential equation solutions and raises questions about the stability of scenarios like the ekpyrotic bounce driven by an exponential potential.</description>

      <title>On the effect of the maximal proper acceleration in the inertia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15077v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effect of a hypothetical maximal proper acceleration on the mass of a charged particles is investigated in the context of particle accelerators. In particular, it is shown that maximal proper acceleration implies an increase in the kinetic energy of the particle being accelerated with respect to the relativistic energy. Such an increase in kinetic energy leads to a reduction of the luminosity of the bunches with respect to the expected luminosity in the relativistic models of the bunches. This relative loss in luminosity is of the order $10^{-3}$ to $10^{-5}$ for the LHC bunches and can be of order up to $10^{-3}$ for certain laser plasma accelerator facilities. Although the effect is small, it increases with the square of the bunch population.</description>

      <title>Anisotropies of cosmological gravitational wave backgrounds in non-flat spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent reports of stochastic gravitational wave background from four independent pulsar-timing-array collaborations have renewed the interest in the cosmological gravitational wave background (CGWB), which is expected to open a new window into the early Universe. Although the early Universe is supposed to be flat from an inflationary point of view, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) data alone from the Planck satellite measurement prefers an enhanced lensing amplitude that can be explained by a closed Universe. In this paper, we propose an independent method to constrain the early-Universe flatness from the anisotropies of CGWB. Using the generalized harmonic decompositions in the non-flat spacetime, we find CGWBs from different physical mechanisms such as cosmic inflation and phase transitions share the same integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) term but possess different SW terms, which would exhibit different behaviors when including the spatial curvature since the ISW effect is more sensitive to the spatial curvature than the SW effect. Furthermore, we provide the cross-correlations between CGWB and CMB, implying a positive or negative correlation between their SW effect terms depending on the GW mechanisms, which may hint at the sign of f NL when considering non-Gaussianity contributions to anisotropies.</description>

      <title>Stellar-mass black-hole binaries in LISA: characteristics and complementarity with current-generation interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar-mass black-hole binaries are the most numerous gravitational-wave sources observed to date. Their properties make them suitable for observation both by ground- and space-based detectors. Starting from synthetic catalogues constructed based on observational constraints from ground-based detectors, we explore the detection rates and the characteristic parameters of the stellar-mass black-hole binaries observable by LISA during their inspiral, using signal-to-noise ratio thresholds as a detection criterion. We find that only a handful of these sources will be detectable with signal-to-noise ratio larger than 8: about 5 sources on average in 4 years of mission duration, among which only one or two are multiband ones (i.e. merging in less than 15 years). We find that detectable sources have chirp mass $10 M_\odot\lesssim \mathcal{M}_c\lesssim 100 M_\odot$, residual time-to-coalescence $4\mathrm{yr}\lesssim \tau_c\lesssim 100 \mathrm{yr}$, and redshift $z\lesssim 0.1$, much closer than those observed up to now by ground-based detectors. We also explore correlations between the number of LISA detectable sources and the parameters of the population, suggesting that a joint measurement with the stochastic signal might be informative of the population characteristics. By performing parameter estimation on a subset of sources from the catalogues, we conclude that, even if LISA measurements will not be directly informative on the population due to the low number of resolvable sources, it will characterise a few, low-redshift candidates with great precision. Furthermore, we construct for the first time the LISA waterfall plot for low chirp mass, and demonstrate that LISA will also be able to discriminate and characterize, through very precise parameter estimation, a population of binaries with higher masses, $\mathcal{M}_c\sim \mathcal{O}(10^3) M_\odot$, if it exists.</description>

      <title>Impact of the observation frequency coverage on the significance of a gravitational wave background detection in PTA data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) collaborations gather high-precision timing measurements of pulsars with the aim of detecting gravitational wave (GW) signals. A major challenge lies in the identification and characterization of the different sources of noise that may hamper their sensitivity to GWs. The presence of time-correlated noise that resembles the target signal might give rise to degeneracies that can directly impact the detection statistics. In this work, we focus on the covariance that exists between a "chromatic" dispersion measure (DM) noise and an "achromatic" stochastic gravitational wave background (GWB). "Chromatic" associated to the DM noise means that its amplitude depends on the frequency of the incoming pulsar photons measured by the radio-telescope. Several frequency channels are then required to accurately characterise its chromatic features and when the coverage of incoming frequency is poor, it becomes impossible to disentangle chromatic and achromatic noise contributions. In this paper, we explore this situation by injecting realistic GWB into 100 realizations of two mock versions of the second data release (DR2) of the European PTA (EPTA), characterized by different frequency coverage. The first dataset is a faithful copy of DR2, in which the first half of the data is dominated by only one frequency channel of observation; the second one is identical except for a more homogeneous frequency coverage across the full dataset. We show that for 91% of the injections, a better frequency coverage leads to an improved statistical significance (~1.3dex higher log Bayes factor on average) of the GWB and a better characterization of its properties. We propose a metric to quantify the degeneracy between DM and GWB parameters and show that it is correlated with a loss of significance for the recovered GWB and an increase in the GWB bias towards a higher and flatter spectral shape.</description>

      <title>IceCube AGN Neutrino candidate PKS 1717+177: Dark deflector bends nuclear jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The BL Lac Object PKS 1717+177 has been identified as potential neutrino-emitting AGN in the point source stacking analysis of IceCube data. We explore peculiarities in the morphology and kinematics of the jet and examine multi-wavelength light curves for distinctive effects which might allow to pinpoint a likely neutrino generation mechanism. We re-modeled 34 high resolution radio interferometric Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) observations obtained at 15 GHz (between 1999/12/27 and 2023/05/03). A correlation and periodicity analysis of optical KAIT and Tuorla data, as well as for Fermi-LAT $\gamma$-ray data has been performed. The nuclear jet appears deflected and bent at about 0.5 mas distance from the radio core by an encounter with a dark, unseen object. The deviation of the jet evolves over 23.5 years from a simple apparent bend into a significantly meandering structure with increasing amplitude: a zig-zag line. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the temporal evolution of a jet deviation can be traced. The turning point shifts with time and the jet seems to brighten up almost periodically at the point of deviation. The radio core as well as the jet contribute approximately equally to the total flux-density at 15 GHz. We discuss scenarios which could explain the complex jet bending and quasi-regular flaring. We propose that the jet could either be deflected by the magnetosphere of a second massive black hole, by the pressure gradient due to a circumnuclear dense cloud, or via gravitational lensing by an intervening black hole.</description>

      <title>Lepton Collider as a window to Reheating: II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM) genesis via Ultraviolet (UV) freeze-in embeds the seed of reheating temperature and dynamics in its relic density. Thus, discovery of such a DM candidate can possibly open the window for post-inflationary dynamics. However, there are several challenges in this exercise, as freezing-in DM possesses feeble interaction with the visible sector and therefore very low production cross-section at the collider. We show that mono-photon (and dilepton) signal at the ILC, arising from DM effective operators connected to the SM field strength tensors, can still warrant a signal discovery. We study both the scalar and fermionic DM production during reheating via UV freeze-in, when the inflaton oscillates at the bottom of a general monomial potential. Interestingly, we see, right DM abundance can be achieved only in the case of bosonic reheating scenario, satisfying bounds from big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN). This provides a unique correlation between collider signal and the post-inflationary dynamics of the Universe within single-field inflationary models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new mode-sum prescription for the efficient computation of renormalized expectation values for a massive, charged, quantum scalar field propagating on a curved space-time background. Our method is applicable to any static, spherically-symmetric, four-dimensional space-time with a time-independent, background electrostatic potential and can be used to find the renormalized scalar condensate, current and stress-energy tensor. As an explicit example, we present a calculation of these quantities for a charged scalar field in the Hartle-Hawking state on a Reissner-Nordstrom black hole background.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two formulations of superfluidity are reviewed: Landau's phenomenological two-fluid model and a relativistic effective field theory description. We demonstrate how the two-fluid formalism can be recovered from the nonrelativistic limit of the relativistic effective theory at finite temperatures. We show how self-gravitating, nonrelativistic superfluids are obtained from the Newtonian limit of the relativistic approach on curved spaces. The concepts are presented in an accessible manner for readers who may not be deeply familiar with superfluidity from a condensed matter perspective.</description>

      <title>$\text{T}\overline{\text{T}}$ deformations from AdS$_2$ to dS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the formalism of $\text{T}\overline{\text{T}}$ deformations for quantum theories that are holographically dual to two-dimensional dilaton-gravity theories with Dirichlet boundary conditions. To better understand the microscopics of de Sitter space, we focus on deformations for which the dual bulk geometry flows from Anti-de Sitter to de Sitter space. We explore two distinct ways to achieve this: either through so-called centaur geometries that interpolate between AdS$_2$ and dS$_2$, or by a spherical dimensional reduction of $\text{T}\overline{\text{T}} + \Lambda_2$ theories that were proposed to give a microscopic interpretation of three-dimensional de Sitter entropy. We derive the microscopic energy spectrum, heat capacities, and deformed Cardy expressions for the thermodynamic entropy in the canonical and microcanonical ensembles for these two setups. In both setups a signature of the change from AdS to dS is that the heat capacity at a fixed deformation parameter of the boundary system changes sign, indicating the existence of a thermodynamically unstable de Sitter patch. Our findings provide important consistency conditions for holographic models of the dS$_2$ static patch.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Systems of PDEs comprised of a combination of constraints and evolution equations are ubiquitous in physics. For both theoretical and practical reasons, such as numerical integration, it is desirable to have a systematic understanding of the well-posedness of the Cauchy problem for these systems. Presently we review the use of hyperbolic reductions, in which the evolution equations are singled out for consideration. We then examine in greater detail the extensions, in which constraints are evolved as auxiliary variables alongside the original variables. Assuming a particular structure of the original system, we give sufficient conditions for strong-hyperbolicity of an extension. This theory is then applied to the examples of electromagnetism and a toy for magnetohydrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Holographic Entanglement Entropy for Brane-World Higher Derivative Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the splitting problem, it is difficult to derive the holographic entanglement entropy for general higher derivative gravity. Inspired by double holography and renormalized entanglement entropy, we develop a method to derive the generalized gravitational entropy for the brane-world higher derivative (BWHD) gravity. Remarkably, this approach is independent of the splitting problem. The so-called BWHD gravity is an effective theory on the brane, given by the counter terms of holographic renormalization. Interestingly, all solutions to Einstein gravity are also solutions to BWHD gravity. We first verify our approach can derive the correct results for curvature-squared gravity and then derive the holographic entanglement entropy for cubic BWHD gravity, which is the main result of this paper. We also derive the entropy of quartic BWHD gravity in flat space with constant extrinsic curvatures and perform several tests on our results. Finally, we briefly comment on our results.</description>

      <title>Using Cartesian slice plots of a cosmological simulation as input of a convolutional neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using a uniform partitioning of cubic cells, we cover the total volume of a $\Lambda$CDM cosmological simulation based on particles. We define a visualisation cell as a spatial extension of the cubic cell, so that we collect all simulation particles contained in this visualisation cell to create a series of Cartesian plots in which the over-density of matter is clearly visible. We then use these plots as input to a convolutional neural network (CNN) based on the Keras library and TensorFlow for image classification. To assign a class to each plot, we approximate the Hessian of the gravitational potential in the centre of the cubic cells. Each selected cubic cell is then assigned a label of 1,2 or 3, depending on the number of positive eigenvalues obtained for the Householder reduction of the Hessian matrix. We apply the CNN to several models, including two models with different visualisation volumes, one with a cell size of type L (large) and the other with a cell type S (small). A third model that combines the plots of the previous L and S cell types. So far, we have mainly considered a slice parallel to the XY plane to make the plots. The last model is considered based on visualisations of cells that also include slices parallel to the ZX and ZY planes. We find that the accuracy in classificating plots is acceptable, and the ability of the models to predict the class works well. These results allow us to demonstrate the aim of this paper, namely that the usual Cartesian plots contain enough information to identify the observed structures of the cosmic web.</description>

      <title>XTE J1814-338: A potential hybrid star candidate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recent analysis on the properties of XTE J18014-338 yielded a surprising radius value around ~ 7 km. Notably, this estimation is significantly lower compared to the expected values for the radius of neutron stars, which are derived from both theoretical calculations and corresponding observations. In this letter, we focus on the construction of hybrid equations of state for the possible reconciliation of the exotic XTE J18014-338 properties. Our analysis indicates that an equation of state involving a sufficiently strong phase transition could potentially lead to the explanation of the size and mass of such a compact object. By examining the sign of the $dM/dP_c$ slope, we found that stellar configurations compatible to XTE J18014-338 are only stable for a 'stiff' low density phase. For a 'soft' hadronic EOS selection the stability of the resulting configurations may not be satisfied in terms of the turning point criterion. However, a complementary analysis for the radial oscillations of the aforementioned configurations indicates their stability when a slow phase conversion is considered.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave-Sensitive Photonic-Like Electronic Transport in Graphene for Efficient High-Frequency Gravitational Wave Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-frequency gravitational waves are crucial for understanding the very early universe and distinguishing between various cosmological models, but detecting them remains a significant challenge. We investigated the effects of high-frequency gravitational waves on photonic-like electronic transport in graphene. The results show that, unlike the influence of gravitational waves on the propagation of light, the influence of gravitational waves on photonic-like electronic transport can accumulate not only in real space but also in $k$-space. This makes photonic-like electronic transport under gravitational waves similar to the propagation of light in a medium where the refractive index varies dramatically due to gravitational waves, and with shorter wavelengths. As a result, the relative intensity variation in photonic-like electronic transport under gravitational waves exceeds that of a laser interferometer with the same arm length by six orders of magnitude. At low temperatures, the influence of phonons on photon-like transport in the context of high-frequency gravitational waves can be ignored. These findings indicate a strong interaction between gravitational waves and electron transport, which helps to deepen the understanding of the interaction between gravitational waves and matter, and provides a different method for detecting high-frequency gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Flow of dynamical causal structures with an application to correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Causal models capture cause-effect relations both qualitatively - via the graphical causal structure - and quantitatively - via the model parameters. They offer a powerful framework for analyzing and constructing processes. Here, we introduce a tool - the flow of causal structures - to visualize and explore the dynamical aspect of classical-deterministic processes, arguably like those present in general relativity. The flow describes all possible ways in which the causal structure of a process can evolve. We also present an algorithm to construct its supergraph - the superflow - from the causal structure only. Consequently, the superflow of a given process may describe additional unrealizable evolutions of its causal structure. As an application, we show that if all leafs of a flow are trivial, then the corresponding process produces causal correlations only, i.e., correlations where past data influences future events only. This strengthens the result that processes, where the cycles in their causal structure are chordless, establish causal correlations only. We also discuss the main difficulties for the quantum generalization.</description>

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that there is a strong interplay between quantum complexity and quantum chaos. In this work, we consider a new method to study geometric complexity for interacting non-Gaussian quantum mechanical systems to benchmark the quantum chaos in a well-known oscillator model. In particular, we study the circuit complexity for the unitary time-evolution operator of a non-Gaussian bosonic quantum mechanical system. Our results indicate that, within some limitations, geometric complexity can indeed be a good indicator of quantum chaos.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tensor networks provide a powerful tool for studying many-body quantum systems, particularly making quantum simulations more efficient. In this article, we construct a tensor network representation of the spin network states, which correspond to $SU(2)$ gauge-invariant discrete field theories. Importantly, the spin network states play a central role in the Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) approach to the Planck scale physics. Our focus is on the Ising-type spin networks, which provide a basic model of quantum space in LQG. It is shown that the tensor network approach improves the previously introduced methods of constructing quantum circuits for the Ising spin networks by reducing the number of qubits involved. It is also shown that the tensor network approach is convenient for implementing holographic states involving the bulk-boundary conjecture, which contributes to establishing a link between LQG and holographic duality.</description>

      <title>Holographic Weyl semimetals with dislocations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weyl semimetals (WSMs) represent three-dimensional gapless topological states of matter characterized by the monopole-antimonopole pairs of the Abelian Berry curvature at the band-touching points in the momentum space. As a consequence, they display chiral anomalies that can be realized through a crystalline dislocation defect associated with the discrete lattice translational symmetry. Using the last two features of WSMs as our guiding principles, we construct a holographic WSM with dislocations by utilizing the ($4+1$)-dimensional Chern-Simons gravitational theory in anti-de Sitter spacetime. This theory encodes the chiral anomaly and incorporates torsion, thereby holographically capturing lattice dislocation defects. By explicitly solving the equations of motion employing the asymptotic expansion near the boundary, we show that such a theory at the ($3+1$)-dimensional spacetime boundary possesses axially-symmetric solutions that can be interpreted as holographic WSMs with dislocation defects at finite temperature, encoded through a black hole in the bulk gravity. Such solutions, at the same time, feature the chiral anomaly proportional to the Nieh-Yan invariant. Our results should therefore motivate future studies of the holographic topological phases by employing bulk gravitational Chern-Simons theories and establishing torsion as a holographic counterpart of crystalline dislocation defects.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of Kerr Effective Black Hole Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We uncover the thermodynamical properties of a class of non-asymptotically flat geometries, referred here as the Kerr effective geometries, that realize the hidden symmetries of Kerr black hole spacetimes via Teukolsky's equation in the theory of linear gravitational perturbations. While the thermodynamic properties, such as entropy, remain the same as those of Kerr black holes, the asymptotic charges, as we will demonstrate, are different. In this new framework with the ambient flat asymptotic boundary removed, we derive the mass and angular momentum of the Kerr effective geometries using the regulated Komar integral and the Brown-York prescription. We also obtain explicit expressions for the corresponding gauge potentials and electric charges. By deriving the asymptotic charges, we demonstrate that both the first law of black hole mechanics and the Smarr law hold.</description>

      <title>On CCGG, the De Donder-Weyl Hamiltonian formulation of canonical gauge gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10589v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper gives a brief overview of the manifestly covariant canonical gauge gravity (CCGG) that is rooted in the De Donder-Weyl Hamiltonian formulation of relativistic field theories, and the proven methodology of the canonical transformation theory. That framework derives, from a few basic physical and mathematical assumptions, equations describing generic matter and gravity dynamics with the spin connection emerging as a Yang Mills-type gauge field. While the interaction of any matter field with spacetime is fixed just by the transformation property of that field, a concrete gravity ansatz is introduced by the choice of the free (kinetic) gravity Hamiltonian. The key elements of this approach are discussed and its implications for particle dynamics and cosmology presented. Among the results are especially: - Anomalous Pauli coupling of spinors to curvature and torsion of spacetime, - spacetime with (A)dS ground state, inertia, torsion and geometrical vacuum energy, - Zero-energy balance of the Universe leading to a vanishing cosmological constant and torsional dark energy.</description>

      <title>Distinctive GWBs from eccentric inspiraling SMBH binaries with a DM spike</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14041v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent detections of a low-frequency gravitational wave background (GWB) from various pulsar-timing-array (PTA) observations have renewed the interest in the inspiraling supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), whose population is believed to be the most promising candidate with possible generalizations from including either orbital eccentricity or dark matter (DM) spike. In this Letter, we show that the inclusion of both can further display distinctive features detectable in future PTA observations. With a typical initial eccentricity $e_0\sim\mathcal{O}(0.1)$ for the inspiraling SMBHBs, even a shallow DM spike can easily drive the orbital eccentricity close to $1$, leaving behind a large turnover eccentricity when GWs begin to dominate the orbital circularization. In particular, the DM spike index $\gamma_\mathrm{sp}$ universally manifests itself in the characteristic strain by $h_c\sim f^{7/6-\gamma_\mathrm{sp}/3}$ in the far infrared and features a novel oscillation structure at low frequencies. Future PTA detection of such characteristics would be the smoking gun for the DM spike and even reveal the nature of DM.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Searches for Post-Merger Remnants of GW170817 and GW190425</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11392v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the results of two searches for gravitational waves from the post-merger remnants of the binary neutron star coalescence events GW170817 and GW190425. The searches are fully coherent over 1800~s of data from the 2nd (for GW170817) and 3rd (for GW190425) observing runs of the LIGO and Virgo observatories. The searches compute the matched filter $\mathcal{F}$-statistic, and use a piecewise model of the rapidly changing frequency evolution appropriate for young neutron stars. No detection is claimed. The peak root-sum-squared strain upper limit at 50\% detection probability ($h_{\text{rss}}^{50\%})$ of both searches occurs at 1700~Hz and is estimated at $1.64 \times 10^{-22}~\text{Hz}^{-1/2}$ for GW170817, and $1.0 \times 10^{-22}~\text{Hz}^{-1/2}$ for GW190425. This is the first gravitational wave search for a neutron star remnant of GW190425.</description>

      <title>Mass function of stellar black holes as revealed by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ninety gravitational wave events have been detected by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA network and are released in the Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog. Among these events, 83 cases are definitely binary black hole mergers since the masses of all the objects involved significantly exceed the upper limit of neutron stars. The black holes in these merger events naturally form two interesting samples, a pre-merger sample that includes all the black holes before the mergers and a post-merger sample that consists of the black holes generated during the merging processes. The former represents black holes that once existed in the Universe, while the latter represents newly born black holes. Here we present a statistical analysis on these two samples. The non-parametric $\tau$ statistic method is adopted to correct for the observational selection effect. The Lynden-Bell's $C^{-}$ method is further applied to derive the mass distribution and density function of black holes. It is found that the mass distribution can be expressed as a broken power-law function. More interestingly, the power-law index in the high mass region is comparable for the two samples. The number density of black holes is found to depend on redshift as $\rho(z) \propto z^{-2.06}$ -- $z^{-2.12}$ based on the two samples. Implications of these findings on the origin of black holes are discussed.</description>

      <title>Discontinuous Galerkin scheme for elliptic equations on extremely stretched grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06120v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods for solving elliptic equations are gaining popularity in the computational physics community for their high-order spectral convergence and their potential for parallelization on computing clusters. However, problems in numerical relativity with extremely stretched grids, such as initial data problems for binary black holes that impose boundary conditions at large distances from the black holes, have proven challenging for DG methods. To alleviate this problem we have developed a primal DG scheme that is generically applicable to a large class of elliptic equations, including problems on curved and extremely stretched grids. The DG scheme accommodates two widely used initial data formulations in numerical relativity, namely the puncture formulation and the extended conformal thin-sandwich (XCTS) formulation. We find that our DG scheme is able to stretch the grid by a factor of $\sim 10^9$ and hence allows to impose boundary conditions at large distances. The scheme converges exponentially with resolution both for the smooth XCTS problem and for the nonsmooth puncture problem. With this method we are able to generate high-quality initial data for binary black hole problems using a parallelizable DG scheme. The code is publicly available in the open-source SpECTRE numerical relativity code.</description>

      <title>Post-Minkowskian self-force in the low-velocity limit: scalar field scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we present an approach to compute analytical post-Minkowskian corrections to unbound two-body scattering in the self-force formalism. Our method relies on a further low-velocity (post-Newtonian) expansion of the motion. We present a general strategy valid for gravitational and non-gravitational self-force, and we explicitly demonstrate our approach for a scalar charge scattering off a Schwarzschild black hole. We compare our results with recent calculations in [Barack et al., PRD 108, 024025 (2023)], showing complete agreement where appropriate and fixing undetermined scale factors in their calculation. Our results also extend their results by including in our dissipative sector the contributions from the flux into the black hole horizon.</description>

      <title>On the analytic generalization of particle deflection in the weak field regime and shadow size in light of EHT constraints for Schwarzschild-like black hole solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, an analytic generalization of the weak field deflection angle (WDA) is derived by utilizing the current non-asymptotically flat generalization of the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. The derived formula is valid for any Schwarzschild-like spacetime, which deviates from the classical Schwarzschild case through some constant parameters. This work provided four examples in the context of bumblebee gravity theory, and one example from a black hole surrounded with soliton dark matter, where some results are new, and some agreed with existing literature. The WDA formula provided a simple calculation, where approximations based on some conditions can be done directly on it, skipping the preliminary steps. For the shadow size analysis, it is shown how it depends solely on the parameter associated with the metric coefficient in the time coordinate. A general formula for the constrained parameter is also derived based on the Event Horizon Collaboration (EHT) observational results. Finally, the work realized further possible generalizations on other black hole models, such as RN-like, dS/AdS-like black hole solutions, and even black hole solutions in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Non-spherical effects on the mass function of Primordial Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this letter, we investigate the impact of non-spherical effects on the Primordial Black Hole mass function, based on the ellipticity-dependent threshold calculated by performing $3+1$ relativistic numerical simulations. We consider an equation of state of radiation $w:=P/\rho=1/3$ and a softer one $w=1/10$ with $P$ and $\rho$ being the pressure and energy density, respectively. We suppose that the curvature perturbations obey Gaussian statistics with a monochromatic power spectrum and examine the most probable ellipsoidal configurations utilizing peak theory. We also suppose the critical scaling law of the PBH mass near the threshold following the known results. The simulations arXiv:2410.03452 show that the non-sphericity can easily prevent the system from black hole formation when the initial fluctuation amplitude is near the threshold (critical scaling regime). Nevertheless, we show that the non-spherical effects make the mass function just a few times smaller and are insignificant on the mass function distribution, including the power-law scaling in the small mass region.</description>

      <title>Simulations of Ellipsoidal Primordial Black Hole Formation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform $3+1$ relativistic numerical simulations to study primordial black hole (PBH) formation from the collapse of adiabatic super-horizon non-spherical perturbations generated from curvature fluctuations obeying random Gaussian statistics with a monochromatic power spectrum. The matter field is assumed to be a perfect fluid of an equation of state $w:=P/\rho={\rm const.}$ with $P$ and $\rho$ being the pressure and the energy density, respectively. The initial spatial profile of the curvature perturbation is modeled with the amplitude $\mu$ and non-spherical parameters $e$ (ellipticity) and $p$ (prolateness) according to peak theory. We focus on the dynamics and the threshold for PBH formation in terms of the non-spherical parameters $e$ and $p$. We find that the critical values ($e_c, p_c$) with a fixed value of $\mu$ closely follow a superellipse curve. With $p=0$, for the range of amplitudes considered, we find that the critical ellipticity for non-spherical collapse follows a decaying power law as a function of $(\mu-\mu_{\rm c,sp})$ with $\mu_{\rm c,sp}$ being the threshold for the spherical case. Our results also indicate that, for both cases of $w = 1/3$ and $w = 1/10$, small deviations from sphericity can avoid collapsing to a black hole when the amplitude is near its critical threshold. Finally we discuss the significance of the ellipticity on the rate of the PBH production.</description>

      <title>Exploring a novel Einstein--Rosen BTZ wormhole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11907v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel Einstein-Rosen BTZ wormhole metric as a solution to the Einstein field equations with a negative cosmological constant and explore in detail its various phenomenological aspects. We show that the wormhole metric is characterized by a horizon at the throat, resembling a black hole horizon. This implies that our wormhole metric describes a one-way traversable wormhole at the throat, with Hawking radiation observed by an observer located at some distance from the wormhole. It is also found the same Hawking temperature using the BTZ-like coordinates and Kruskal-like coordinates. This temperature is invariant not only on the type of coordinates but also the nature of the spin of quantum fields. Importantly, we find that at the wormhole throat, the spacetime is not a pure vacuum solution, but rather contains an exotic string matter source with negative tension, which may stabilize the wormhole geometry. To this end, we found that the size of the wormhole throat is proportional to the number of quantum bits suggesting a possible implications on ER=EPR. Further we studied the particle dynamics and, finally, we tested the ANEC with a test scalar and vector fields. For the double null-component computed in BTZ coordinates, we found an apparent divergence at the wormhole throat, which is then shown to be regularized by means of Kruskal-like coordinates. The ANEC for such a scalar/vector field is violated at the wormhole throat.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Einstein Rings of Reissner-Nordstr\"om metric Black Holes Nonminimally Coupled to Electrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14822v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we examine the relativistic Einstein rings assuming a nonminimal coupling between gravitation and electromagnetism in a Reissner-Norstr\"om background. Starting from a general action of a nonminimal coupled electrodynamics we show that an unstable effective photon sphere may be obtained in the regime of eikonal approximation. Restricting ourselves to the unstable photon sphere domain we examine the expected angular positions of the first and second relativistic Einstein rings. To compare our results with previous studies in the literature we model the lens as a Galactic supermassive black hole. For fixed coupling parameters we show that such angular positions decrease as the charge parameter increases. The angular separation between the first and second rings is also evaluated. We show that such separation increases as the charge parameter increases. These patterns are not followed by nearly extremal configurations. In this case we show that there is an overlap domain so that the angular position and the corresponding coupling parameter do not allow one to differ extremal cases from complementary configurations which satisfy the cosmic censorship hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Emergence of space from the first law of thermodynamics in the braneworld scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15918v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emergent space paradigm is a unique way to understand the universe's expansion. In this paradigm, as proposed by Padmanabhan in the context of Einstein's gravity the expansion of the universe is driven by the difference between the degrees of freedom on the horizon surface and that within the bulk enclosed by the horizon. This principle called the law of emergence, has been extended to more general gravity theories like Gauss-Bonnet and Lovelock gravity. We derive the law of emergence for braneword models of gravity, starting from the more fundamental and well established principle, the first law of thermodynamics. More specifically, we derive the law of emergence in the context of RS II braneworld, warped DGP model and Gauss-Bonnet braneworld. The significance of the braneworld theory is that the observable universe could be a 3+1 surface or brane embedded in 3+1+d dimensional bulk spacetime. We further compared the derived law with the one proposed by Sheykhi for braneworld models. Our results strongly suggests that the unified first law of thermodynamics is the backbone of the law of emergence.</description>

      <title>Underdetermination of dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07482v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is compelling evidence that the Universe is undergoing a late phase of accelerated expansion. One of the simplest explanations for this behaviour is the presence of dark energy. A plethora of microphysical models for dark energy have been proposed. The hope is that, with the ever increasing precision of cosmological surveys, it will be possible to precisely pin down the model. We show that this is unlikely and that, at best, we will have a phenomenological description for the microphysics of dark energy. Furthermore, we argue that the current phenomenological prescriptions are ill-equipped for shedding light on the fundamental theory of dark energy.</description>

      <title>Hopf algebras from poset growth models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17547v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a framework for growth models on posets which simultaneously generalizes the Classical Sequential Growth models for posets from causal set theory and the tree growth models of natural growth and simple tree classes, the latter of which also appear as solutions of combinatorial Dyson-Schwinger equations in quantum field theory. We prove which cases of the Classical Sequential Growth models give subHopf algebras of the Hopf algebra of posets, in analogy to a characterization due to Foissy in the Dyson-Schwinger case. We find a family of generating sets for the Connes-Moscovici Hopf algebra.</description>

      <title>Inflationary non-Gaussianities in alpha vacua and consistency with conformal symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the conformal invariance of inflationary non-Gaussianities associated with scalar fluctuations in a non-Bunch-Davies initial state, known as the $\alpha$-vacuum, in single-field slow-roll inflation. The $\alpha$-vacuum is a one-parameter family of states, including the Bunch-Davies one, that preserves the conformal symmetry of inflationary dynamics in a nearly de-Sitter space-time. Working within the leading slow-roll approximation, we compute the four-point scalar correlator (the trispectrum) in $\alpha$-vacuum using the in-in formalism. We check that the conformal Ward identities are met between the three and four-point scalar $\alpha$-vacua correlators. Surprisingly, this contrasts the previously reported negative result of the Ward identities being violated between the two and the three-point correlators. We have also extended the wave-functional method, previously used for correlators with Bunch-Davies initial condition, to compute the three and four-point scalar correlators in $\alpha$-vacua. The results obtained from the wave-function method match the corresponding in-in results, adding further justification to our check of Ward identities with $\alpha$-vacua correlators.</description>

      <title>Thin-wall vacuum decay in the presence of a compact dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of false vacuum decay in arbitrary dimensions, in the presence of gravity, and compute the transition probability within the thin-wall approximation, generalising the results of Coleman and de Luccia. In the particular case of one compact dimension, we present explicit formulae for the Euclidean Bounce configuration that drives the transition from a de Sitter to Minkowski or from a Minkowski to anti-de Sitter vacua.</description>

      <title>Black holes with electroweak hair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14357v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct static and axially symmetric magnetically charged hairy black holes in the gravity-coupled Weinberg-Salam theory. Large black holes merge with the Reissner-Nordstr\"om (RN) family, while the small ones are extremal and support a hair in the form of a ring-shaped electroweak condensate carrying superconducting W-currents and up to $22\%$ of the total magnetic charge. The extremal solutions are asymptotically RN with a mass {\it below} the total charge, $M&lt;|Q|$, due to the negative Zeeman energy of the condensate interacting with the black hole magnetic field. Therefore, they cannot decay into RN black holes. As their charge increases, they show a phase transition when the horizon symmetry changes from spherical to oblate. At this point they have the mass typical for planetary size black holes of which $\approx 11\%$ is stored in the hair. Being obtained within a well-tested theory, our solutions are expected to be physically relevant.</description>

      <title>Classicality of Stochastic Noise Away From Quasi-de Sitter Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11640v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well known that a coarse-grained scalar field living on a de~Sitter (dS) background exhibits classical stochastic behavior, driven by a noise whose amplitude is set by the Hubble constant $H$. The coarse-graining is achieved by discarding wave numbers larger than a cutoff $\sigma a H$ and demanding that $\sigma \ll 1$. Similar results hold for quasi-dS space, where the equation of state parameter $w$ is close to $-1$. Here we present exact expressions for the noise amplitude of a free massless field on an inflationary background with constant $w &lt; -1/3$. We find that a classical stochastic behavior can emerge for $-5/3 &lt; w &lt; -1/3$. Furthermore, as we move away from $w = -1$ and approach $w = -1/3$, the constraint $\sigma \ll 1$ is relaxed and larger cutoffs ($\sigma \sim 1$) become feasible, too. However, in general the amplitude of the noise depends on $\sigma$, except in the quasi-dS regime $w \approx -1$.</description>

      <title>Vetting quark-star models with gravitational waves in the hierarchical Bayesian framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11103v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent discovery of gravitational waves (GWs) has opened a new avenue for investigating the equation of state (EOS) of dense matter in compact stars, which is an outstanding problem in astronomy and nuclear physics. In the future, next-generation (XG) GW detectors will be constructed, deemed to provide a large number of high-precision observations. We investigate the potential of constraining the EOS of quark stars (QSs) with high-precision measurements of mass $m$ and tidal deformability $\Lambda$ from the XG GW observatories. We adopt the widely-used bag model for QSs, consisting of four microscopic parameters: the effective bag constant $B_{\rm eff}$, the perturbative quantum chromodynamics correction parameter $a_4$, the strange quark mass $m_s$, and the pairing energy gap $\Delta$. With the help of hierarchical Bayesian inference, for the first time we are able to infer the EOS of QSs combining multiple GW observations. Using the top 25 loudest GW events in our simulation, we find that, the constraints on $B_{\rm eff}$ and $\Delta$ are tightened by several times, while $a_4$ and $m_s$ are still poorly constrained. We also study a simplified 2-dimensional (2-d) EOS model which was recently proposed in literature. The 2-d model is found to exhibit significant parameter-estimation biases as more GW events are analyzed, while the predicted $m$-$\Lambda$ relation remains consistent with the full model.</description>

      <title>Quantum Theory, Gravity and Second Order Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06799v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argue that a consistent coupling of a quantum theory to gravity requires an extension of ordinary `first order' Riemannian geometry to second order Riemannian geometry, which incorporates both a line element and an area element. This extension results in a misalignment between the dimension of the manifold and the dimension of the tangent spaces. In particular, we find that for a 4-dimensional spacetime, tangent spaces become 18-dimensional. We then discuss the construction of physical theories within this framework, which involves the introduction of terms that are quadratic in derivatives in the action. On a flat spacetime, the quadratic sector is perpendicular to the first order sector and only affects the normalization of the path integral, whereas in a curved spacetime the quadratic sector couples to the first order sector. Moreover, we show that, despite the introduction of higher order derivatives, the Ostragradski instability can be avoided, due to an order mixing of the two sectors. Finally, we comment on extensions to higher order geometry and on relations with non-commutative and generalized geometry.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves Detected by a Burst Search in LIGO/Virgo's Third Observing Run</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Burst searches identify gravitational-wave (GW) signals in the detector data without use of a specific signal model, unlike the matched-filter searches that correlate data with simulated signal waveforms (templates). While matched filters are optimal for detection of known signals in the Gaussian noise, the burst searches can be more efficient in finding unusual events not covered by templates or those affected by non-Gaussian noise artifacts. Here, we report the detection of 3 gravitational wave signals that are uncovered by a burst search Coherent WaveBurst (cWB) optimized for the detection of binary black hole (BBH) mergers. They were found in the data from the LIGO/Virgo's third observing run (O3) with a combined significance of 3.6 $\sigma$. Each event appears to be a BBH merger not previously reported by the LIGO/Virgo's matched-filter searches. The most significant event has a reconstructed primary component in the upper mass gap ($m_1 = 70^{+36}_{-18}\,$M$_\odot$), and unusually low mass ratio ($m_2/m_1\sim0.3$), implying a dynamical or AGN origin. The 3 new events are consistent with the expected number of cWB-only detections in the O3 run ($4.8 \pm 2.1$), and belong to the stellar-mass binary population with the total masses in the $70-100$ M$_\odot$ range.</description>
