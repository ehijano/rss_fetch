      <title>Cross-Attention Message-Passing Transformers for Code-Agnostic Decoding in 6G Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Channel coding for 6G networks is expected to support a wide range of requirements arising from heterogeneous communication scenarios. These demands challenge traditional code-specific decoders, which lack the flexibility and scalability required for next-generation systems. To tackle this problem, we propose an AI-native foundation model for unified and code-agnostic decoding based on the transformer architecture. We first introduce a cross-attention message-passing transformer (CrossMPT). CrossMPT employs two masked cross-attention blocks that iteratively update two distinct input representations-magnitude and syndrome vectors-allowing the model to effectively learn the decoding problem. Notably, our CrossMPT has achieved state-of-the-art decoding performance among single neural decoders. Building on this, we develop foundation CrossMPT (FCrossMPT) by making the architecture invariant to code length, rate, and class, allowing a single trained model to decode a broad range of codes without retraining. To further enhance decoding performance, particularly for short blocklength codes, we propose CrossMPT ensemble decoder (CrossED), an ensemble decoder composed of multiple parallel CrossMPT blocks employing different parity-check matrices. This architecture can also serve as a foundation model, showing strong generalization across diverse code types. Overall, the proposed AI-native code-agnostic decoder offers flexibility, scalability, and high performance, presenting a promising direction to channel coding for 6G networks.</description>

      <title>On Securing Berrut Approximated Coded Computing Through Discrete Cosine Transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coded computing is a reliable and fault-tolerant mechanism for implementing large computing tasks over a distributed set of worker nodes. While a majority of coded computing frameworks address accurate computation of the target functions, they are restricted to computing multivariate polynomial functions. To generalize these computing platforms to non-polynomial target functions, Jahani-Nezhad and Maddah-Ali recently proposed Berrut Approximated Coded computing (BACC), which was proven fault-tolerant against stragglers albiet with tolerable approximation errors on the target functions. Despite these benefits, there is no formal study on the security of BACC against worker nodes which report erroneous computations. To fill this research gap, we use a coding-theoretic approach to propose Secure Berrut Approximated Coded Computing (SBACC), which is resilient to stragglers and also robust to the presence of such untrusted worker nodes. One of the highlights of SBACC is the new choice of evaluation points for distributed computation which makes the well-known Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) codes amenable to error detection and correction. To validate the new choice of evaluation points, first, we derive bounds on the accuracy of SBACC in the absence of untrusted worker nodes. Subsequently, to handle the presence of untrusted worker nodes, we derive bounds on the accuracy of SBACC and show that interesting optimization problems can be formulated to study the trade-off between the error correcting capability of the DCT codes and the accuracy of the target computation.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Multimodal Fusion with Mixture-of-Experts for Localizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal fingerprinting is a crucial technique to sub-meter 6G integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) localization, but two hurdles block deployment: (i) the contribution each modality makes to the target position varies with the operating conditions such as carrier frequency, and (ii) spatial and fingerprint ambiguities markedly undermine localization accuracy, especially in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios. To solve these problems, we introduce SCADF-MoE, a spatial-context aware dynamic fusion network built on a soft mixture-of-experts backbone. SCADF-MoE first clusters neighboring points into short trajectories to inject explicit spatial context. Then, it adaptively fuses channel state information, angle of arrival profile, distance, and gain through its learnable MoE router, so that the most reliable cues dominate at each carrier band. The fused representation is fed to a modality-task MoE that simultaneously regresses the coordinates of every vertex in the trajectory and its centroid, thereby exploiting inter-point correlations. Finally, an auxiliary maximum-mean-discrepancy loss enforces expert diversity and mitigates gradient interference, stabilizing multi-task training. On three real urban layouts and three carrier bands (2.6, 6, 28 GHz), the model delivers consistent sub-meter MSE and halves unseen-NLOS error versus the best prior work. To our knowledge, this is the first work that leverages large-scale multimodal MoE for frequency-robust ISAC localization.</description>

      <title>Coding for Quasi-Static Fading Channel with Imperfect CSI at the Transmitter and Quantized Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical Schalkwijk-Kailath (SK) scheme for the additive Gaussian noise channel with noiseless feedback is highly efficient since its coding complexity is extremely low and the decoding error doubly exponentially decays as the coding blocklength tends to infinity. However, its application to the fading channel with imperfect CSI at the transmitter (I-CSIT) is challenging since the SK scheme is sensitive to the CSI. In this paper, we investigate how to design SK-type scheme for the quasi-static fading channel with I-CSIT and quantized feedback. By introducing modulo lattice function and an auxiliary signal into the SK-type encoder-decoder of the transceiver, we show that the decoding error caused by the I-CSIT can be perfectly eliminated, resulting in the success of designing SK-type scheme for such a case. The study of this paper provides a way to design efficient coding scheme for fading channels in the presence of imperfect CSI and quantized feedback.</description>

      <title>Joint Spatial Division and Multiplexing with Customized Orthogonal Group Channels in Multi-RIS-Assisted Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) offer the unique capability to reshape the radio environment, thereby simplifying transmission schemes traditionally contingent on channel conditions. Joint spatial division and multiplexing (JSDM) emerges as a low-overhead transmission scheme for multi-user equipment (UE) scenarios, typically requiring complex matrix decomposition to achieve block-diagonalization of the effective channel matrix. In this study, we introduce an innovative JSDM design that leverages RISs to customize channels, thereby streamlining the overall procedures. By strategically positioning RISs at the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) directions of the base station (BS), we establish orthogonal line-of-sight links within the BS-RIS channel, enabling a straightforward pre-beamforming design. Based on UE grouping, we devise reflected beams of the RIS with optimized directions to mitigate inter-group interference in the RISs-UEs channel. An approximation of the channel cross-correlation coefficient is derived and serves as a foundation for the RISs-UEs association, further diminishing inter-group interference. Numerical results substantiate the efficacy of our RIS-customized JSDM in not only achieving effective channel block-diagonalization but also in significantly enhancing the sum spectral efficiency for multi-UE transmissions.</description>

      <title>Half Spatially Coupled Turbo-Like Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a new class of spatially coupled turbo-like codes (SC-TCs), namely half spatially coupled braided convolutional codes (HSC-BCCs) and half spatially coupled parallel concatenated codes (HSC-PCCs). Different from the conventional SC-TCs, the proposed codes have simpler and deterministic coupling structures. Most notably, the coupling of HSC-BCCs is performed by re-encoding the whole coupling sequence in the component encoder of one time instant, rather than spreading the coupling bits to component encoders of multiple time instants. This simplification not only addresses the window decoding threshold loss issue in existing BCCs, but also allows the proposed codes to attain very close-to-capacity performance with a coupling memory as small as 2. Both theoretical and numerical results are provided to demonstrate the performance advantages of the proposed codes over existing spatially coupled codes.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface aided Integrated-Navigation-and-Communication in Urban Canyons: A Satellite Selection Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the application of a simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS)-aided medium-Earth-orbit (MEO) satellite network for providing both global positioning services and communication services in the urban canyons, where the direct satellite-user links are obstructed. Superposition coding (SC) and successive interference cancellation (SIC) techniques are utilized for the integrated navigation and communication (INAC) networks, and the composed navigation and communication signals are reflected or transmitted to ground users or indoor users located in urban canyons. To meet diverse application needs, navigation-oriented (NO)-INAC and communication-oriented (CO)-INAC have been developed, each tailored according to distinct power allocation factors. We then proposed two algorithms, namely navigation-prioritized-algorithm (NPA) and communication-prioritized-algorithm (CPA), to improve the navigation or communication performance by selecting the satellite with the optimized position dilution of precision (PDoP) or with the best channel gain. The effectiveness of the proposed STAR-RIS-aided INAC network is quantified by analyzing the positioning error for navigation services and by evaluating communication performance through achievable ergodic rate metrics. Our satellite selection approach indicates that: the positioning services at the urban canyon users can be completed with the aid of STAR-RIS. 2) Additionally, it is observed that while a single STAR-RIS array can extend the navigational link, it fails to serve users in indoor scenarios, highlighting a limitation in the current system design.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Ensemble Learning Framework for Image-Based Solar Panel Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The installation of solar energy systems is on the rise, and therefore, appropriate maintenance techniques are required to be used in order to maintain maximum performance levels. One of the major challenges is the automated discrimination between clean and dirty solar panels. This paper presents a novel Dual Ensemble Neural Network (DENN) to classify solar panels using image-based features. The suggested approach utilizes the advantages offered by various ensemble models by integrating them into a dual framework, aimed at improving both classification accuracy and robustness. The DENN model is evaluated in comparison to current ensemble methods, showcasing its superior performance across a range of assessment metrics. The proposed approach performs the best compared to other methods and reaches state-of-the-art accuracy on experimental results for the Deep Solar Eye dataset, effectively serving predictive maintenance purposes in solar energy systems. It reveals the potential of hybrid ensemble learning techniques to further advance the prospects of automated solar panel inspections as a scalable solution to real-world challenges.</description>

      <title>Symbiotic Backscatter Communication: A Design Perspective on the Modulation Scheme of Backscatter Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symbiotic Backscatter Communication (SBC) has emerged as a spectrum-efficient and low-power communication technology, where backscatter devices (BDs) modulate and reflect incident radio frequency (RF) signals from primary transmitters (PTs). While previous studies have assumed a circularly symmetric complex Gaussian (CSCG) distribution for the BD's signal, this assumption may not be practical because the high complexity of generating CSCG signals is not supported by the low-cost BD. In this paper, we address this gap by investigating SBC for two low-complexity modulation schemes, i.e., $M$-ary amplitude-shift keying (MASK) and $M$-ary phase-shift keying (MPSK), where BD's signals inherently deviate from CSCG distribution. Our goal is to derive the achievable rate of the PT and BD under the MASK/MPSK and to design MASK/MPSK modulation scheme for maximizing the PT's rate. Towards this end, we first derive the expressions of both the PT's rate and BD's rate. Theoretical results reveal that whether or not the BD improves the PT's rate depends on the phase of MASK/MPSK modulation, while the BD's rate is independent of this phase. We then formulate two optimization problems to maximize the PT's rate by adjusting the phase under the MASK and MPSK modulation schemes, respectively, and derive the optimal phases for each modulation scheme in closed forms. Simulation results demonstrate that the optimal phase of MASK/MPSK can ensure an improvement in the PT's rate, and reveal that a low-order ASK modulation is better than a low-order PSK for the BD in terms of improving PT's rate, especially when the direct link is not significantly weaker than the backscatter link in SBC.</description>

      <title>ASTARS empowered Satellite Positioning Approach for Urban Canyons and Indoor Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To mitigate the loss of satellite navigation signals in urban canyons and indoor environments, we propose an active simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (ASTARS) empowered satellite positioning approach. Deployed on building structures, ASTARS reflects navigation signals to outdoor receivers in urban canyons and transmits signals indoors to bypass obstructions, providing high-precision positioning services to receivers in non-line-of-sight (NLoS) areas. The path between ASTARS and the receiver is defined as the extended line-of-sight (ELoS) path and an improved carrier phase observation equation is derived to accommodate that. The receiver compensates for its clock bias through network time synchronization, corrects the actual signal path distance to the satellite-to-receiver distance through a distance correction algorithm, and determines its position by using the least squares (LS) method. Mathematical modeling of the errors introduced by the proposed method is conducted, followed by simulation analysis to assess their impact. Simulation results show that: 1) in areas where GNSS signals are blocked, with time synchronization accuracy within a 10 ns error range, the proposed method provides positioning services with errors not exceeding 4 m for both indoor and outdoor receivers, outperforming conventional NLoS methods with positioning errors of more than 7 m; 2) the additional errors introduced by the proposed method do not exceed 3 m for time synchronization errors within 10 ns, which includes the phase shift, beamwidth error, time synchronization errors, and satellite distribution errors, outperforming traditional NLoS methods, which typically produce positioning errors greater than 5 m.</description>

      <title>Joint Power Control and Precoding for Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems With Sparse Multi-Dimensional Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF mMIMO) has emerged as a prominent candidate for future networks due to its ability to significantly enhance spectral efficiency by eliminating inter-cell interference. However, its practical deployment faces considerable challenges, such as high computational complexity and the optimization of its complex processing. To address these challenges, this correspondence proposes a framework based on a sparse multi-dimensional graph neural network (SP-MDGNN), which sparsifies the connections between access points (APs) and user equipments (UEs) to significantly reduce computational complexity while maintaining high performance. In addition, the weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) algorithm is introduced as a comparative method to further analyze the trade-off between performance and complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that the sparse method achieves an optimal balance between performance and complexity, significantly reducing the computational complexity of the original MDGNN method while incurring only a slight performance degradation, providing insights for the practical deployment of CF mMIMO systems in large-scale network.</description>

      <title>Functional Renormalization for Signal Detection: Dimensional Analysis and Dimensional Phase Transition for Nearly Continuous Spectra Effective Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Signal detection is one of the main challenges of data science. According to the nature of the data, the presence of noise may corrupt measurements and hinder the discovery of significant patterns. A wide range of techniques aiming at extracting the relevant degrees of freedom from data has been thus developed over the years. However, signal detection in almost continuous spectra, for small signal-to-noise ratios, remains a known difficult issue. This paper develops over recent advancements proposing to tackle this issue by analysing the properties of the underlying effective field theory arising as a sort of maximal entropy distribution in the vicinity of universal random matrix distributions. Nearly continuous spectra provide an intrinsic and non-conventional scaling law for field and couplings, the scaling dimensions depending on the energy scale. The coarse-graining over small eigenvalues of the empirical spectrum defines a specific renormalization group, whose characteristics change when the collective behaviour of "informational" modes become significant, that is, stronger than the intrinsic fluctuations of noise. This paper pursues three different goals. First, we propose to quantify the real effects of fluctuations relative to what can be called "signal", while improving the robustness of the results obtained in our previous work. Second, we show that quantitative changes in the presence of a signal result in a counterintuitive modification of the distribution of eigenvectors. Finally, we propose a method for estimating the number of noise components and define a limit of detection in a general nearly continuous spectrum using the renormalization group. The main statements of this paper are essentially numeric, and their reproducibility can be checked using the associated code.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasi-twisted (QT) codes generalize several important families of linear codes, including cyclic, constacyclic, and quasi-cyclic codes. Despite their potential, to the best of our knowledge, there exists no efficient decoding algorithm for QT codes. In this work, we propose a syndrome-based decoding method capable of efficiently correcting up to (d* - 1)/2 errors, where d* denotes an HT-like lower bound on the minimum distance of QT codes, which we formalize here. Additionally, we introduce a Niederreiter-like cryptosystem constructed from QT codes. This cryptosystem is resistant to some classical attacks as well as some quantum attacks based on Quantum Fourier Sampling.</description>

      <title>LotteryCodec: Searching the Implicit Representation in a Random Network for Low-Complexity Image Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and validate the lottery codec hypothesis, which states that untrained subnetworks within randomly initialized networks can serve as synthesis networks for overfitted image compression, achieving rate-distortion (RD) performance comparable to trained networks. This hypothesis leads to a new paradigm for image compression by encoding image statistics into the network substructure. Building on this hypothesis, we propose LotteryCodec, which overfits a binary mask to an individual image, leveraging an over-parameterized and randomly initialized network shared by the encoder and the decoder. To address over-parameterization challenges and streamline subnetwork search, we develop a rewind modulation mechanism that improves the RD performance. LotteryCodec outperforms VTM and sets a new state-of-the-art in single-image compression. LotteryCodec also enables adaptive decoding complexity through adjustable mask ratios, offering flexible compression solutions for diverse device constraints and application requirements.</description>

      <title>Degrees of Freedom of Spatial Multiplexing in Distance Domain of Arbitrary Continuous-Aperture Array in Near-Field Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extremely large aperture array operating in the near-field regime unlocks additional spatial resources that can be exploited to simultaneously serve multiple users even when they share the same angular direction, a capability not achievable in conventional far-field systems. A fundamental question, however, remains: What is the maximum spatial degree of freedom (DoF) of spatial multiplexing in the distance domain?
  In this paper, we address this open problem by investigating the spatial DoF of a line-of-sight (LoS) channel between a large two-dimensional transmit aperture and a linear receive array with collinearly-aligned elements (i.e., at the same angular direction) but located at different distances from the transmit aperture. We assume that both the aperture and linear array are continuous-aperture (CAP) arrays with an infinite number of elements and infinitesimal spacing, which establishes an upper bound for the spatial degrees of freedom (DoF) in the case of finite elements. First, we assume an ideal case where the transmit array is a single piece and the linear array is on the broad side of the transmit array. By reformulating the channel as an integral operator with a Hermitian convolution kernel, we derive a closed-form expression for the spatial DoF via the Fourier transform. Our analysis shows that the spatial DoF in the distance domain is predominantly determined by the extreme boundaries of the array rather than its detailed interior structure. We further extend the framework to non-broadside configurations by employing a projection method, which effectively converts the spatial DoF to an equivalent broadside case. Finally, we extend our analytical framework to the modular array, which shows the spatial DoF gain over the single-piece array given the constraint of the physical length of the array.</description>

      <title>Numerical Techniques for the Maximum Likelihood Toeplitz Covariance Matrix Estimation: Part I. Symmetric Toeplitz Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In several applications, one must estimate a real-valued (symmetric) Toeplitz covariance matrix, typically shifted by the conjugated diagonal matrices of phase progression and phase "calibration" errors. Unlike the Hermitian Toeplitz covariance matrices, these symmetric matrices have a unique potential capability of being estimated regardless of these beam-steering phase progression and/or phase "calibration" errors. This unique capability is the primary motivation of this paper.</description>

      <title>Multi-User Generative Semantic Communication with Intent-Aware Semantic-Splitting Multiple Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the booming development of generative artificial intelligence (GAI), semantic communication (SemCom) has emerged as a new paradigm for reliable and efficient communication. This paper considers a multi-user downlink SemCom system, using vehicular networks as the representative scenario for multi-user content dissemination. To address diverse yet overlapping user demands, we propose a multi-user Generative SemCom-enhanced intent-aware semantic-splitting multiple access (SS-MGSC) framework. In the framework, we construct an intent-aware shared knowledge base (SKB) that incorporates prior knowledge of semantic information (SI) and user-specific preferences. Then, we designate the common SI as a one-hot semantic map that is broadcast to all users, while the private SI is delivered as personalized text for each user. On the receiver side, a diffusion model enhanced with ControlNet is adopted to generate high-quality personalized images. To capture both semantic relevance and perceptual similarity, we design a novel semantic efficiency score (SES) metric as the optimization objective. Building on this, we formulate a joint optimization problem for multi-user semantic extraction and beamforming, solved using a reinforcement learning-based algorithm due to its robustness in high-dimensional settings. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.</description>

      <title>Inequalities in Fourier analysis on binary cubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies two classical inequalities, namely the Hausdorff-Young inequality and equal-exponent Young's convolution inequality, for discrete functions supported in the binary cube $\{0,1\}^d\subset\mathbb{Z}^d$. We characterize the exact ranges of Lebesgue exponents in which sharp versions of these two inequalities hold, and present several immediate consequences. First, if the functions are specialized to be the indicator of some set $A\subseteq\{0,1\}^d$, then we obtain sharp upper bounds on two types of generalized additive energies of $A$, extending the works of Kane-Tao, de Dios Pont-Greenfeld-Ivanisvili-Madrid, and one of the present authors. Second, we obtain a sharp binary variant of the Beckner-Hirschman entropic uncertainty principle, as well as a sharp lower estimate on the entropy of a sum of two independent random variables with values in $\{0,1\}^d$. Finally, the sharp binary Hausdorff-Young inequality also reveals the exact range of dimension-free estimates for the Fourier restriction to the binary cube.</description>

      <title>Automatic Rank Determination for Low-Rank Adaptation via Submodular Function Maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose SubLoRA, a rank determination method for Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) based on submodular function maximization. In contrast to prior approaches, such as AdaLoRA, that rely on first-order (linearized) approximations of the loss function, SubLoRA utilizes second-order information to capture the potentially complex loss landscape by incorporating the Hessian matrix. We show that the linearization becomes inaccurate and ill-conditioned when the LoRA parameters have been well optimized, motivating the need for a more reliable and nuanced second-order formulation. To this end, we reformulate the rank determination problem as a combinatorial optimization problem with a quadratic objective. However, solving this problem exactly is NP-hard in general. To overcome the computational challenge, we introduce a submodular function maximization framework and devise a greedy algorithm with approximation guarantees. We derive a sufficient and necessary condition under which the rank-determination objective becomes submodular, and construct a closed-form projection of the Hessian matrix that satisfies this condition while maintaining computational efficiency. Our method combines solid theoretical foundations, second-order accuracy, and practical computational efficiency. We further extend SubLoRA to a joint optimization setting, alternating between LoRA parameter updates and rank determination under a rank budget constraint. Extensive experiments on fine-tuning physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Results show that SubLoRA outperforms existing methods in both rank determination and joint training performance.</description>

      <title>A hierarchical invariant for line bundles and its applications in algebraic geometry codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of hierarchical depth for line bundles on smooth projective surfaces, defined via filtrations by line subbundles with successive quotients supported on effective divisors. This invariant helps to investigate both the algebraic and geometric complexity of line bundles through discrete stepwise constructions. We study some of its basic properties, including functorial behavior under restriction to curves and compatibility with ampleness and base-point freeness. Applying this framework to algebraic geometry (AG) codes, we show that hierarchical filtrations yield natural code families whose combinatorial parameters (dimension, minimum distance) evolve predictably across the filtration.</description>

      <title>Time-Series JEPA for Predictive Remote Control under Capacity-Limited Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04853v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In remote control systems, transmitting large data volumes (e.g., images, video frames) from wireless sensors to remote controllers is challenging when uplink capacity is limited (e.g., RedCap devices or massive wireless sensor networks). Furthermore, controllers often need only information-rich representations of the original data. To address this, we propose a semantic-driven predictive control combined with a channel-aware scheduling to enhance control performance for multiple devices under limited network capacity. At its core, the proposed framework, coined Time-Series Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (TS-JEPA), encodes high-dimensional sensory data into low-dimensional semantic embeddings at the sensor, reducing communication overhead. Furthermore, TS-JEPA enables predictive inference by predicting future embeddings from current ones and predicted commands, which are directly used by a semantic actor model to compute control commands within the embedding space, eliminating the need to reconstruct raw data. To further enhance reliability and communication efficiency, a channel-aware scheduling is integrated to dynamically prioritize device transmissions based on channel conditions and age of information (AoI). Simulations on inverted cart-pole systems show that the proposed framework significantly outperforms conventional control baselines in communication efficiency, control cost, and predictive accuracy. It enables robust and scalable control under limited network capacity compared to traditional scheduling schemes.</description>

      <title>QoS-Aware and Routing-Flexible Network Slicing for Service-Oriented Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the network slicing (NS) problem which attempts to map multiple customized virtual network requests (also called services) to a common shared network infrastructure and manage network resources to meet diverse quality of service (QoS) requirements. We propose a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) formulation for the considered NS problem that can flexibly route the traffic flow of the services on multiple paths and provide end-to-end delay and reliability guarantees for all services. To overcome the computational difficulty due to the intrinsic nonlinearity in the MINLP formulation, we transform the MINLP formulation into an equivalent mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation and further show that their continuous relaxations are equivalent. In sharp contrast to the continuous relaxation of the MINLP formulation which is a nonconvex nonlinear programming problem, the continuous relaxation of the MILP formulation is a polynomial-time solvable linear programming problem, which significantly facilitates the algorithmic design. Based on the newly proposed MILP formulation, we develop a customized column generation (cCG) algorithm for solving the NS problem. The proposed cCG algorithm is a decomposition-based algorithm and is particularly suitable for solving large-scale NS problems. Numerical results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed formulations and the proposed cCG algorithm.</description>

      <title>Actions Speak Louder Than Words: Rate-Reward Trade-off in Markov Decision Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03335v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The impact of communication on decision-making systems has been extensively studied under the assumption of dedicated communication channels. We instead consider communicating through actions, where the message is embedded into the actions of an agent which interacts with the environment in a Markov decision process (MDP) framework. We conceptualize the MDP environment as a finite-state channel (FSC), where the actions of the agent serve as the channel input, while the states of the MDP observed by another agent (i.e., receiver) serve as the channel output. Here, we treat the environment as a communication channel over which the agent communicates through its actions, while at the same time, trying to maximize its reward. We first characterize the optimal information theoretic trade-off between the average reward and the rate of reliable communication in the infinite-horizon regime. Then, we propose a novel framework to design a joint control/coding policy, termed \textit{Act2Comm}, which seamlessly embeds messages into actions. From a communication perspective, \textit{Act2Comm} functions as a learning-based channel coding scheme for non-differentiable FSCs under input-output constraints. From a control standpoint, \textit{Act2Comm} learns an MDP policy that incorporates communication capabilities, though at the cost of some control performance. Overall, \textit{Act2Comm} effectively balances the dual objectives of control and communication in this environment. Experimental results validate \textit{Act2Comm}'s capability to enable reliable communication while maintaining a certain level of control performance.</description>

      <title>Rank-1 Matrix Completion with Gradient Descent and Small Random Initialization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.09396v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nonconvex formulation of the matrix completion problem has received significant attention in recent years due to its affordable complexity compared to the convex formulation. Gradient Descent (GD) is a simple yet efficient baseline algorithm for solving nonconvex optimization problems. The success of GD has been witnessed in many different problems in both theory and practice when it is combined with random initialization. However, previous works on matrix completion require either careful initialization or regularizers to prove the convergence of GD. In this paper, we study the rank-1 symmetric matrix completion and prove that GD converges to the ground truth when small random initialization is used. We show that in a logarithmic number of iterations, the trajectory enters the region where local convergence occurs. We provide an upper bound on the initialization size that is sufficient to guarantee the convergence, and show that a larger initialization can be used as more samples are available. We observe that the implicit regularization effect of GD plays a critical role in the analysis, and for the entire trajectory, it prevents each entry from becoming much larger than the others.</description>

      <title>Contrastive Learning and Adversarial Disentanglement for Privacy-Aware Task-Oriented Semantic Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22784v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Task-oriented semantic communication systems have emerged as a promising approach to achieving efficient and intelligent data transmission in next-generation networks, where only information relevant to a specific task is communicated. This is particularly important in 6G-enabled Internet of Things (6G-IoT) scenarios, where bandwidth constraints, latency requirements, and data privacy are critical. However, existing methods struggle to fully disentangle task-relevant and task-irrelevant information, leading to privacy concerns and suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose an information-bottleneck inspired method, named CLAD (contrastive learning and adversarial disentanglement). CLAD utilizes contrastive learning to effectively capture task-relevant features while employing adversarial disentanglement to discard task-irrelevant information. Additionally, due to the absence of reliable and reproducible methods to quantify the minimality of encoded feature vectors, we introduce the Information Retention Index (IRI), a comparative metric used as a proxy for the mutual information between the encoded features and the input. The IRI reflects how minimal and informative the representation is, making it highly relevant for privacy-preserving and bandwidth-efficient 6G-IoT systems. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CLAD outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of semantic extraction, task performance, privacy preservation, and IRI, making it a promising building block for responsible, efficient and trustworthy 6G-IoT services.</description>

      <title>Empirical Bayes Estimation for Lasso-Type Regularizers: Analysis of Automatic Relevance Determination</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11280v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on linear regression models with non-conjugate sparsity-inducing regularizers such as lasso and group lasso. Although the empirical Bayes approach enables us to estimate the regularization parameter, little is known on the properties of the estimators. In particular, many aspects regarding the specific conditions under which the mechanism of automatic relevance determination (ARD) occurs remain unexplained. In this paper, we derive the empirical Bayes estimators for the group lasso regularized linear regression models with limited parameters. It is shown that the estimators diverge under a specific condition, giving rise to the ARD mechanism. We also prove that empirical Bayes methods can produce the ARD mechanism in general regularized linear regression models and clarify the conditions under which models such as ridge, lasso, and group lasso can do so.</description>

      <title>Distributional Information Embedding: A Framework for Multi-bit Watermarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel problem, distributional information embedding, motivated by the practical demands of multi-bit watermarking for large language models (LLMs). Unlike traditional information embedding, which embeds information into a pre-existing host signal, LLM watermarking actively controls the text generation process--adjusting the token distribution--to embed a detectable signal. We develop an information-theoretic framework to analyze this distributional information embedding problem, characterizing the fundamental trade-offs among three critical performance metrics: text quality, detectability, and information rate. In the asymptotic regime, we demonstrate that the maximum achievable rate with vanishing error corresponds to the entropy of the LLM's output distribution and increases with higher allowable distortion. We also characterize the optimal watermarking scheme to achieve this rate. Extending the analysis to the finite-token case with non-i.i.d. tokens, we identify schemes that maximize detection probability while adhering to constraints on false alarm and distortion.</description>

      <title>Query Complexity of Classical and Quantum Channel Discrimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12989v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum channel discrimination has been studied from an information-theoretic perspective, wherein one is interested in the optimal decay rate of error probabilities as a function of the number of unknown channel accesses. In this paper, we study the query complexity of quantum channel discrimination, wherein the goal is to determine the minimum number of channel uses needed to reach a desired error probability. To this end, we show that the query complexity of binary channel discrimination depends logarithmically on the inverse error probability and inversely on the negative logarithm of the (geometric and Holevo) channel fidelity. As a special case of these findings, we precisely characterize the query complexity of discriminating two classical channels and two classical-quantum channels. Furthermore, by obtaining a tighter characterization of the sample complexity of quantum hypothesis testing, including prior probabilities, we provide a more precise characterization of query complexity when the error probability does not exceed a fixed threshold. We also provide lower and upper bounds on the query complexity of binary asymmetric channel discrimination and multiple quantum channel discrimination. For the former, the query complexity depends on the geometric R\'enyi and Petz R\'enyi channel divergences, while for the latter, it depends on the negative logarithm of the (geometric and Uhlmann) channel fidelity. For multiple channel discrimination, the upper bound scales as the logarithm of the number of channels.</description>

      <title>LZ Penalty: An information-theoretic repetition penalty for autoregressive language models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20131v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the LZ penalty, a penalty specialized for reducing degenerate repetitions in autoregressive language models without loss of capability. The penalty is based on the codelengths in the LZ77 universal lossless compression algorithm. Through the lens of the prediction-compression duality, decoding the LZ penalty has the interpretation of sampling from the residual distribution after removing the information that is highly compressible. We demonstrate the LZ penalty enables state-of-the-art open-source reasoning models to operate with greedy (temperature zero) decoding without loss of capability and without instances of degenerate repetition. Both the industry-standard frequency penalty and repetition penalty are ineffective, incurring degenerate repetition rates of up to 4%.</description>

      <title>An example showing that Schrijver's $\vartheta$-function need not upper bound the Shannon capacity of a graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07778v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This letter addresses an open question concerning a variant of the Lov\'{a}sz $\vartheta$ function, which was introduced by Schrijver and independently by McEliece et al. (1978). The question of whether this variant provides an upper bound on the Shannon capacity of a graph was explicitly stated by Bi and Tang (2019). This letter presents an explicit example of a Tanner graph on 32 vertices, which shows that, in contrast to the Lov\'{a}sz $\vartheta$ function, this variant does not necessarily upper bound the Shannon capacity of a graph. The example, previously outlined by the author in a recent paper (2024), is presented here in full detail, making it easy to follow and verify. By resolving this question, the note clarifies a subtle but significant distinction between these two closely related graph invariants.</description>
