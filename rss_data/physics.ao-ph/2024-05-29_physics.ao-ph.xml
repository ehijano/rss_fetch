      <title>Transfer Learning for Emulating Ocean Climate Variability across $CO_2$ forcing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the success of machine learning (ML) applied to climate reaching further every day, emulators have begun to show promise not only for weather but for multi-year time scales in the atmosphere. Similar work for the ocean remains nascent, with state-of-the-art limited to models running for shorter time scales or only for regions of the globe. In this work, we demonstrate high-skill global emulation for surface ocean fields over 5-8 years of model rollout, accurately representing modes of variability for two different ML architectures (ConvNext and Transformers). In addition, we address the outstanding question of generalization, an essential consideration if the end-use of emulation is to model warming scenarios outside of the model training data. We show that 1) generalization is not an intrinsic feature of a data-driven emulator, 2) fine-tuning the emulator on only small amounts of additional data from a distribution similar to the test set can enable the emulator to perform well in a warmed climate, and 3) the forced emulators are robust to noise in the forcing.</description>

      <title>A dynamical geography of observed trends in the global ocean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Revealing the ongoing changes in ocean dynamics and their impact on marine ecosystems requires the joint analysis of multiple variables. Yet, global observational records only cover a few decades, posing a challenge in the separation of climatic trends from internal dynamical modes. Here, we apply an empirical stochastic model to identify the emergent patterns of trends in six fundamental components of upper ocean physics. We analyze a data-driven reconstruction of the ocean state covering the 1993-2018 period. We found that including temporal derivatives into the state vector enhances the description of the ocean's dynamical system. Once Pacific oscillations are properly accounted for, averaged surface warming appears &gt;60% faster, and a deep reshaping of the seascape is revealed. A clustering of the trend patterns identifies the main factors that drive observed trends in chlorophyll-a concentration. This data-driven approach opens new perspectives in empirical climate modelling.</description>

      <title>Deep Bayesian Filter for Bayes-faithful Data Assimilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State estimation for nonlinear state space models is a challenging task. Existing assimilation methodologies predominantly assume Gaussian posteriors on physical space, where true posteriors become inevitably non-Gaussian. We propose Deep Bayesian Filtering (DBF) for data assimilation on nonlinear state space models (SSMs). DBF constructs new latent variables $h_t$ on a new latent (``fancy'') space and assimilates observations $o_t$. By (i) constraining the state transition on fancy space to be linear and (ii) learning a Gaussian inverse observation operator $q(h_t|o_t)$, posteriors always remain Gaussian for DBF. Quite distinctively, the structured design of posteriors provides an analytic formula for the recursive computation of posteriors without accumulating Monte-Carlo sampling errors over time steps. DBF seeks the Gaussian inverse observation operators $q(h_t|o_t)$ and other latent SSM parameters (e.g., dynamics matrix) by maximizing the evidence lower bound. Experiments show that DBF outperforms model-based approaches and latent assimilation methods in various tasks and conditions.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Tornadic Supercell Thunderstorms on the Atmospheric Muon Flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tornadoes are severe weather phenomena characterized by a violently rotating column of air connecting the ground to a parent storm. Within the United States, hundreds of tornadoes occur every year. Despite this, the dynamics of tornado formation and propagation are not particularly well understood, in part due to the challenge of instrumentation: many existing instruments for measuring atmospheric properties are in-situ detectors, making deployment in or near an active or developing tornado difficult. Here, we combine local atmospheric and cosmic ray air shower simulation to explore the potential for remote measurement of the pressure field within tornado-producing supercell thunderstorms by examining directional variations of the atmospheric muon flux.</description>
