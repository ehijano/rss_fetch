      <title>Lorentz contraction of electric field lines for a point charge in uniform motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine a logical foundation of depicting a Lorentz contraction of a Coulomb field (an electric field of a point charge in uniform motion) by means of the 'Lorentz contracted' field lines. Two existing arguments for a contraction of field lines sound appealing and lead to very simple calculations yielding the correct results. However, one of them is a victim to subtle logical weaknesses, as it relies on ascribing a degree of physical reality to the electric field lines. The other one correctly proves what it sets out to prove. But it does not provide a proof, or even a suggestion, of an additional result that can be obtained by a new poof that we present here. Though our idea is very simple, the calculations used to prove it - based on a little known, half a century old result by Tsien - are somewhat more involved than those from past arguments.</description>

      <title>Correction to the quantum relation of photons in the Doppler effect based on a special Lorentz violation model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The possibility of the breaking of Lorentz symmetry has been discussed in many models of quantum gravity. In this paper we follow the Lorentz violation model in Ref. [1] (i.e., our previous work) to discuss the Doppler frequency shift of photons and the Compton scattering process between photons and electrons, pointing out that following the idea in Ref. [1] we have to modify the usual quantum relation of photons in the Doppler effect. But due to the current limited information and knowledge, we could not yet determine the specific expression for the correction coefficient in the modified quantum relation of photons. However, the phenomenon called spontaneous radiation in a cyclotron maser give us an opportunity to see what the expression for this correction coefficient might look like. Therefor, under some necessary constraints, we construct a very concise expression for this correction coefficient through the discussion of different cases. And then we use this expression to analyze the wavelength of radiation in the cyclotron maser, which tends to a limited value at v is close to c, rather than to 0 as predicted by the Lorentz model. And the inverse Compton scattering phenomenon is also discussed and we find that there is a limit to the maximum energy that can be obtained by photons in the collision between extremely relativistic particles and low-energy photons, which conclusion is also very different from that obtained from the Lorentz model, in which the energy that can be obtained by the photon tends to be infinite as the velocity of particle is close to c. This paper still follows the purpose in Ref. [1] that the energy and momentum of particles (i.e., any particles, including photons) cannot be infinite, otherwise it will make some physical scenarios invalid.</description>
