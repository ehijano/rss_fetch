      <title>Mechanism Design by a Politician</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A set of agents has to make a decision about the provision of a public good and its financing. Agents have heterogeneous values for the public good and each agent's value is private information. An agenda-setter has the right to make a proposal about a public-good level and a vector of contributions. For the proposal to be approved, only the favourable votes of a subset of agents are needed. If the proposal is not approved, a type-dependent outside option is implemented. I characterize the optimal public-good provision and the coalition-formation for any outside option in dominant strategies. Optimal public-good provision might be a non-monotonic function of the outside option public-good level. Moreover, the optimal coalition might be a non-convex set of types.</description>

      <title>Equality of Opportunity and Opportunity Pluralism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08955v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper seeks to explore the potential trade-off arising between the theories of $\textit{Equality of Opportunity}$ and $\textit{Opportunity Pluralism}$. Whereas the first theory has received much attention in the literature on Welfare Economics, the second one has only recently been introduced with the publication of the book by Joseph Fishkin, $\textit{Bottlenecks: A New Theory of Equal Opportunity}$. After arguing extensively that any notion of human flourishing is incompatible with traditional theories of $\textit{Equality of Opportunity}$, the author proposes an alternative theory squarely based on a broad notion of human development. This paper seeks to formalize the argument made in this book through the lens of economic theory. My analysis suggests that traditional theories of $\textit{Equality of Opportunity}$ are not incompatible with $\textit{Opportunity Pluralism}$.</description>

      <title>Diversity-Fair Online Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Online selection problems frequently arise in applications such as crowdsourcing and employee recruitment. Existing research typically focuses on candidates with a single attribute. However, crowdsourcing tasks often require contributions from individuals across various demographics. Further motivated by the dynamic nature of crowdsourcing and hiring, we study the diversity-fair online selection problem, in which a recruiter must make real-time decisions to foster workforce diversity across many dimensions. We propose two scenarios for this problem. The fixed-capacity scenario, suited for short-term hiring for crowdsourced workers, provides the recruiter with a fixed capacity to fill temporary job vacancies. In contrast, in the unknown-capacity scenario, recruiters optimize diversity across recruitment seasons with increasing capacities, reflecting that the firm honors diversity consideration in a long-term employee acquisition strategy. By modeling the diversity over $d$ dimensions as a max-min fairness objective, we show that no policy can surpass a competitive ratio of $O(1/d^{1/3})$ for either scenario, indicating that any achievable result inevitably decays by some polynomial factor in $d$. To this end, we develop bilevel hierarchical randomized policies that ensure compliance with the capacity constraint. For the fixed-capacity scenario, leveraging marginal information about the arriving population allows us to achieve a competitive ratio of $1/(4\sqrt{d} \lceil \log_2 d \rceil)$. For the unknown-capacity scenario, we establish a competitive ratio of $\Omega(1/d^{3/4})$ under mild boundedness conditions. In both bilevel hierarchical policies, the higher level determines ex-ante selection probabilities and then informs the lower level's randomized selection that ensures no loss in efficiency. Both policies prioritize core diversity and then adjust for underrepresented dimensions.</description>
