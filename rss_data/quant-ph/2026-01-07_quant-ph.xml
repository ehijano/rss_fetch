      <title>Minimal length: a source of non-Hermiticity and non-locality in quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First, the study tries to shed light on the relationship between purely quantum mechanical momentum measurements (canonical momentum space) and measurements of the generalized momentum operator, including minimal length effects. Additionally, the existence of complex numbers in quantum mechanics seems justifiable as a consequence of minimal length. Finally, a novel method for generating quantum entangled states with complex quantum numbers inspired by the minimal length is also reported. Therefore, theories including a minimal length, like some quantum scenarios of gravity, seem to be able to enrich the current understanding of non-locality.</description>

      <title>How Alice, long before her time, derived the principles of quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This philosophical dialogue explores the idea that the foundational principles of quantum mechanics need not be interpreted as describing a new physics, but may instead arise from the logical necessity of formalising the act of measurement within a coherent algebraic framework. By pushing this perspective to its extreme, the dialogue argues that the core structures of quantum mechanics can be derived independently of any specifically quantum properties of atomic particles, and can be formulated within an otherwise classical theory once limitations of observability and measurement context are taken seriously.</description>

      <title>Formal Modeling and Verification of Grover's Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grover's algorithm relies on the superposition and interference of quantum mechanics, which is more efficient than classical computing in specific tasks such as searching an unsorted database. Due to the high complexity of quantum mechanics, the correctness of quantum algorithms is difficult to guarantee through traditional simulation methods. By contrast, the fundamental concepts and mathematical structure of Grover's algorithm can be formalized into logical expressions and verified by higher-order logical reasoning. In this paper, we formally model and verify Grover's algorithm in the HOL Light theorem prover. We focus on proving key properties such as the unitarity of its oracle and diffusion operators, the monotonicity of the success probability with respect to the number of iterations, and an exact expression for the optimal iteration count. By analyzing a concrete application to integer factorization, we demonstrate the practicality and prospects of our work.</description>

      <title>Gravitational time dilation in quantum clock interferometry with entangled multi-photon states and quantum memories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational time dilation implies that clocks held at different heights accumulate different proper times. We analyze a memory-assisted quantum clock interferometer in which a frequency-bin photonic clock is stored in two vertically separated quantum memories for a controllable duration, such that the joint state evolves in a quantum superposition of two proper times. After retrieval, the photonic modes interfere in a Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interferometer, for which we derive analytic expressions for the resulting multiphoton detection statistics. Extending this HOM-based scheme from entangled photon pairs to frequency-entangled 2N-photon inputs, we show that the proper-time dependent phase is amplified by a factor N, leading to an N-times faster collapse and revival of the interference signal compared with the two-photon case. Incorporating finite memory efficiency and lifetime, we identify regimes where this modulation remains observable. For parameters compatible with demonstrated Rb and Cs memories and achievable optical frequency separations, the first collapse occurs for height differences in the order of 10-100 m with subsecond to few-second storage times, while suitable rare-earth ion and alkali memory combinations can reduce the required height to the few-metre scale. These results establish near-term laboratory conditions for observing entanglement dynamics driven by gravitational time dilation in a photonic platform.</description>

      <title>Gaussian time-translation covariant operations: structure, implementation, and thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-translation symmetry strongly constrains physical dynamics, yet systematic characterization for continuous-variable systems lags behind its discrete-variable counterpart. We close this gap by providing a rigorous classification of Gaussian quantum operations that are covariant under time translations, termed Gaussian covariant operations. We show that several key results known for discrete-variable covariant operations break down in the Gaussian optical setting: discrepancies arise in physical and thermodynamic implementation, in the extensivity of asymmetry, and in catalytic advantages. Our results provide comprehensive mathematical and operational toolkits for Gaussian covariant operations, including a peculiar pair of asymmetry measures that are completely non-extensive. Our findings also reveal surprising consequences of the interplay among symmetry, Gaussianity, and thermodynamic constraints, suggesting that real-world scenarios with multiple constraints have a rich structure not accessible from examining individual constraints separately.</description>

      <title>Minimization of AND-XOR Expressions with Decoders for Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new logic structure for reversible quantum circuit synthesis. Our synthesis method aims to minimize the quantum cost of reversible quantum circuits with decoders. In this method, multi-valued input, binary output (MVI) functions are utilized as a mathematical concept only, but the circuits are binary. We introduce the new concept of ``Multi-Valued Input Fixed Polarity Reed-Muller (MVI-RM)" forms. Our decoder-based circuit uses three logical levels in contrast to commonly-used methods based on Exclusive-or Sum of Products (ESOP) with two levels (AND-XOR expressions), realized by Toffoli gates. In general, the high number of input qubits in the resulting Toffoli gates is a problem that greatly impacts the quantum cost. Using decoders decreases the number of input qubits in these Toffoli gates. We present two practical algorithms for three-level circuit synthesis by finding the MVI-FPRM: products-matching and the newly developed butterfly diagrams. The best MVI-FPRM forms are factorized and reduced to approximate Multi-Valued Input Generalized Reed-Muller (MVI-GRM) forms.</description>

      <title>Compressed Qubit Noise Spectroscopy: Piecewise-Linear Modeling and Rademacher Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random pulse sequences are a powerful method for qubit noise spectroscopy, enabling efficient reconstruction of sparse noise spectra. Here, we advance this method in two complementary directions. First, we extend the method using a regularizer based on the total generalized variation (TGV) norm, in order to reconstruct a larger class of noise spectra, namely piecewise-linear noise spectra, which more realistically model many physical systems. We show through numerical simulations that the new method resolves finer spectral features, while maintaining an order-of-magnitude speedup over conventional approaches to noise spectroscopy. Second, we simplify the experimental implementation of the method, by introducing Rademacher measurements for reconstructing sparse noise spectra. These measurements use pseudorandom pulse sequences that can be generated in real time from a short random seed, reducing experimental complexity without compromising reconstruction accuracy. Together, these developments broaden the reach of random pulse sequences for accurate and efficient noise characterization in realistic quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Deep learning parameter estimation and quantum control of single molecule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent control, a central concept in physics and chemistry, has sparked significant interest due to its ability to fine-tune interference effects in atoms and individual molecules for applications ranging from light-harvesting complexes to molecular qubits. However, precise characterization of the system's dissipative dynamics is required for its implementation, especially at high temperature. In a quantum control experiment, this means learning system-bath parameters and driving coupling strengths. Here, we demonstrate how to infer key physical parameters of a single molecule driven by spectrally modulated pulses at room temperature. We develop and compare two computational approaches based on two-photon absorption photoluminescence signals: an optimization-based minimization scheme and a feed-forward neural network. The robustness of our approach highlights the importance of reliable parameter estimation in designing effective coherent control protocols. Our results have direct applications in ultrafast spectroscopy, quantum materials and technology.</description>

      <title>Further Improving the Decoy State Quantum Key Distribution Protocol with Advantage Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the application of classical advantage distillation (CAD) to the decoy-state BB84 protocol. Prior work has shown that CAD can greatly improve maximal distances and noise tolerances of the practical decoy state protocol. However, past work in deriving key-rate bounds for this protocol with CAD have assumed a trivial bound on the quantum entropy, whenever Alice sends a vacuum state in a CAD block (i.e., the entropy of such blocks is taken to be zero). Since such rounds contribute, negatively, to the error correction leakage, this results in a correct, though sub-optimal bound. Here, we derive a new proof of security for CAD applied to the decoy state BB84 protocol, computing a bound on Eve's uncertainty in all possible single and vacuum photon events. We use this to derive a new asymptotic key-rate bound which, we show, outperforms prior work, allowing for increased distances and noise tolerances.</description>

      <title>Localization of joint quantum measurements on $\mathbb{C}^d \otimes \mathbb{C}^d$ by entangled resources with Schmidt number at most $d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Localizable measurements are joint quantum measurements that can be implemented using only non-adaptive local operations and shared entanglement. We provide a protocol-independent characterization of localizable projection-valued measures (PVMs) by exploiting algebraic structures that any such measurement must satisfy. We first show that a rank-1 PVM on $\mathbb{C}^d\otimes\mathbb{C}^d$ containing an element with the maximal Schmidt rank can be localized using entanglement of a Schmidt number at most $d$ if and only if it forms a maximally entangled basis corresponding to a nice unitary error basis. This reveals strong limitations imposed by non-adaptive local operations, in contrast to the adaptive setting where any joint measurement is implementable. We then completely characterize two-qubit rank-1 PVMs that can be localized with two-qubit entanglement, resolving a conjecture of Gisin and Del Santo, and finally extend our characterization to ideal two-qudit measurements, strengthening earlier results.</description>

      <title>Multiparameter quantum estimation with a uniformly accelerated Unruh-DeWitt detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The uniformly accelerated Unruh-DeWitt detector serves as a fundamental model in relativistic quantum metrology. While previous studies have mainly concentrated on single-parameter estimation via quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound, the multi-parameter case remains significantly underexplored. In this paper, we investigate the multiparameter estimation for a uniformly accelerated Unruh-DeWitt detector coupled to a vacuum scalar field in both bounded and unbounded Minkowski vacuum. Our analysis reveals that quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound fails to provide a tight error bound for the two-parameter estimation involving the initial phase and weight parameters. For this reason, we numerically compute two tighter error bounds, Holevo Cram\'er-Rao bound and Nagaoka bound, based on a semidefinite program. Notably, our results demonstrate that Nagaoka bound yields the tightest error bound among all the considered error bounds, consistent with the general hierarchy of multiparameter quantum estimation. In the case with a boundary, we observe the introduction of boundary systematically reduces the values of both Holevo Cram\'er-Rao bound and Nagaoka bound, indicating an improvement on the attainable estimation precision. These results offer valuable insights on and practical guidance for advancing multiparameter estimation in relativistic context.</description>

      <title>Q-based, objective-field model for wave-function collapse: Analyzing measurement on a macroscopic superposition state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The measurement problem remains unaddressed in modern physics, with an array of proposed solutions but as of yet no agreed resolution. In this paper, we examine measurement using the Q-based, objective-field model for quantum mechanics. Schrodinger considered a microscopic system prepared in a superposition of states which is then coupled to a macroscopic meter. We analyze the entangled meter and system, and measurements on it, by solving forward-backward stochastic differential equations for real amplitudes $x(t)$ and $p(t)$ that correspond to the phase-space variables of the Q function of the system at a time $t$. We model the system and meter as single-mode fields, and measurement of $\hat{x}$ by amplification of the amplitude $x(t)$. Our conclusion is that the outcome for the measurement is determined at (or by) the time $t_{m}$, when the coupling to the meter is complete, the meter states being macroscopically distinguishable. There is consistency with macroscopic realism. By evaluating the distribution of the amplitudes $x$ and $p$ postselected on a given outcome of the meter, we show how the $Q$-based model represents a more complete description of quantum mechanics: The variances associated with amplitudes $x$ and $p$ are too narrow to comply with the uncertainty principle, ruling out that the distribution represents a quantum state. We conclude that the collapse of the wavefunction occurs as a two-stage process: First there is an amplification that creates branches of amplitudes $x(t)$ of the meter, associated with distinct eigenvalues. The outcome of measurement is determined by $x(t)$ once amplified, explaining Born's rule. Second, the distribution that determines the final collapse is the state inferred for the system conditioned on the outcome of the meter: information is lost about the meter, in particular, about the complementary variable $p$.</description>

      <title>Quantum key distribution without authentication and information leakage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) is the most widely studied quantum cryptographic model that exploits quantum effects to achieve information-theoretically secure key establishment. Conventional QKD contains public classical post-processing steps that require authentication to prevent impersonation and maintain security. However, a major limitation of QKD is it cannot perform authentication by itself, and thus requires a separate authentication mechanism. In addition, these public classical steps also have information leakage which subjects QKD to additional attack strategies and reduces the final key rate. In this work, we propose a new QKD variant that removes the need for a separate authentication mechanism, eliminates information leakage, and achieves a substantially higher key rate. By having two more protocol keys than conventional QKD and no public classical steps, our design achieves (almost) perfect information-theoretic security with the protocol keys reusable.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Entropy for Screened Interactions via Dimensional Mapping to Harmonic Oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate interaction-induced corrections to entanglement entropy by mapping a screened Yukawa-type interaction to an effective harmonic oscillator system with controlled anharmonic perturbations. Starting from a one-dimensional interaction $V(x) = -g^2 e^{-\alpha m x}/x$, we reformulate the problem in terms of a four-dimensional radial oscillator, where the finite screening length generates a systematic hierarchy of polynomial interactions in the radial coordinate. This mapping enables a controlled Rayleigh-Schrodinger perturbative treatment of the ground-state wavefunction and an explicit spectral analysis of the reduced density matrix. Working in the weak-screening regime, we compute the leading non-Gaussian correction arising from the quartic interaction $\rho^4$, which appears at order $\alpha^2$ in the expansion of the Yukawa-like potential. We obtain closed analytic expressions for the resulting small eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix and evaluate their contribution to the von Neumann entanglement entropy. We show that the entropy receives analytic corrections at order $\alpha^2$, originating both from explicit anharmonic state-mixing effects and from the implicit $\alpha$ dependence of the Gaussian width parameter. Our results clarify the distinct roles of harmonic renormalization and genuinely non-Gaussian interactions in generating entanglement, establish a systematic power-counting and normalization scheme for higher-order $\rho^{2n}$ perturbations, and provide a transparent oscillator-based framework for computing entanglement entropy in weakly interacting low-dimensional and field-theoretic systems.</description>

      <title>Trading symmetry for Hilbert-space dimension in Bell-inequality violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum information, asymmetry, i.e., the lack of symmetry, is a resource allowing one to accomplish certain tasks that are otherwise impossible. Similarly, in a Bell test using any given Bell inequality, the maximum violation achievable using quantum strategies respecting or disregarding a certain symmetry can be different. In this work, we focus on the symmetry involved in the exchange of parties and explore when we have to trade this symmetry for a lower-dimensional quantum strategy in achieving the maximal violation of given Bell inequalities. For the family of symmetric Collins-Gisin-Linden-Massar-Popescu inequalities, we provide evidence showing that there is no such trade-off. However, for several other Bell inequalities with a small number of dichotomic measurement settings, we show that symmetric quantum strategies in the minimal Hilbert space dimension can only lead to a suboptimal Bell violation. In other words, there exist symmetric Bell inequalities that can only be maximally violated by asymmetric quantum strategies of minimal dimension. In contrast, one can also find examples of asymmetric Bell inequalities that are maximally violated by symmetric correlations. The implications of these findings on the geometry of the set of quantum correlations and the possibility of performing self-testing therefrom are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Violation of Bell Monogamy Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The entangled multipartite systems, specially in pure states, exhibit the phenomenon entanglement monogamy. Such systems also display the phenomenon of Bell nonlocality. Like entanglement monogamy relations, there are Bell monogamy relations. These relations suggest a sharing of nonlocality across the subsystems. The nonlocality, as characterized by Bell inequalities, of one subsystem limits the nonlocality exhibited by another subsystem. We show that the Bell monogamy relations can be violated by using local filtering operations. We consider permutation-symmetric multipartite pure states, in particular $W$ states, to demonstrate the violation.</description>

      <title>Nonseparability as Time-Averaged Dynamic States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonseparability - multipartite states that cannot be factorized - is one of the most striking features of quantum mechanics, as it gives rise to entanglement and non-causal correlations. In quantum computing, it also contributes directly to the computational advantage of quantum computers over its digital counterparts. In this work, we introduce a simple mechanism that frames nonseparability as a time-averaged manifestation of an underlying oscillatory process within state space. The central idea is the inclusion of auxiliary angular frequencies that modulate the temporal evolution of composite states. These additional dynamical degrees of freedom act as coherence channels through which nonseparability is mediated. While the proposed formalism could eventually serve as an alternative theoretical handle on the mechanisms of quantum entanglement, its greater significance lies in opening practical routes for simulating multipartite entanglement in controlled classical wave systems.</description>

      <title>Entanglement signatures of quantum criticality in Floquet non-Hermitian topological systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The entanglement entropy can be an effective diagnostic tool for probing topological phase transitions. In one-dimensional single particle systems, the periodic driving generates a variety of topological phases and edge modes. In this work, we investigate the topological phase transition of the one-dimensional Floquet Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model using entanglement entropy, and construct the phase diagram based on entanglement entropy. The entanglement entropy exhibits pronounced peaks and follows the logarithmic scaling law at the phase transition points, from which we extract the central charge $c=1$. We further investigate the entanglement spectrum to accurately distinguish the different topological phases. In addition, the coupling between zero and $\pi$ modes leads to characteristic splittings in the entanglement spectrum, signaling their hybridization under periodic driving. These results remain robust in non-Hermitian regimes and in the presence of next-nearest-neighbor hopping, demonstrating the reliability and universality of entanglement entropy as a diagnostic for topological phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Who can compete with quantum computers? Lecture notes on quantum inspired tensor networks computational techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is a set of lectures on tensor networks with a strong emphasis on the core algorithms involving Matrix Product States (MPS) and Matrix Product Operators (MPO). Compared to other presentations, particular care has been given to disentangle aspects of tensor networks from the quantum many-body problem: MPO/MPS algorithms are presented as a way to deal with linear algebra on extremely (exponentially) large matrices and vectors, regardless of any particular application. The lectures include well-known algorithms to find eigenvectors of MPOs (the celebrated DMRG), solve linear problems, and recent learning algorithms that allow one to map a known function into an MPS (the Tensor Cross Interpolation, or TCI, algorithm). The lectures end with a discussion of how to represent functions and perform calculus with tensor networks using the "quantics" representation. They include the detailed analytical construction of important MPOs such as those for differentiation, indefinite integration, convolution, and the quantum Fourier transform. Three concrete applications are discussed in detail: the simulation of a quantum computer (either exactly or with compression), the simulation of a quantum annealer, and techniques to solve partial differential equations (e.g. Poisson, diffusion, or Gross-Pitaevskii) within the "quantics" representation. The lectures have been designed to be accessible to a first-year PhD student and include detailed proofs of all statements.</description>

      <title>Collective dynamics versus entanglement in quantum battery performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying the physical origin of enhanced charging performance in many-body quantum batteries is a key challenge in quantum thermodynamics. We investigate whether improvements in stored energy and instantaneous charging power arise from genuine quantum correlations or from coherent collective dynamics that are not intrinsically quantum. We compare the time evolution of energetic quantities with a hierarchy of information-theoretic measures probing bipartite, tripartite, and further-partite correlations. Across different battery charger configurations, we find a consistent temporal ordering in which the instantaneous power peaks before the buildup of strong quantum correlations, indicating that peak charging is dominated by coherent transport, while entanglement and scrambling develop at later times. Furthermore, charging protocols based on k local interactions are examined under both unconstrained and norm-constrained (fair) settings, enabling a clear distinction between classical scaling effects and genuine collective enhancements. Increasing the interaction order or the participation number does not automatically translate into higher charging power. Instead, the performance is primarily dictated by how many particles actually become mutually correlated and contribute to entanglement. Fully collective interactions provide a genuine advantage because all particles participate coherently, whereas partially extended interaction schemes fail to monotonically increase the number of effectively interacting particles, and therefore do not guarantee improved charging efficiency.</description>

      <title>Gradient descent reliably finds depth- and gate-optimal circuits for generic unitaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When the gate set has continuous parameters, synthesizing a unitary operator as a quantum circuit is always possible using exact methods, but finding minimal circuits efficiently remains a challenging problem. The landscape is very different for compiled unitaries, which arise from programming and typically have short circuits, as compared with generic unitaries, which use all parameters and typically require circuits of maximal size. We show that simple gradient descent reliably finds depth- and gate-optimal circuits for generic unitaries, including in the presence of restricted chip connectivity. This runs counter to earlier evidence that optimal synthesis required combinatorial search, and we show that this discrepancy can be explained by avoiding the random selection of certain parameter-deficient circuit skeletons.</description>

      <title>Operational modes of a Raman-coupled two-qubit quantum thermal machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a quantum thermal machine composed of two qubits coupled through a Raman-induced exchange interaction and driven by inhomogeneous transition frequencies. The system is analyzed within Carnot, Otto, and Stirling thermodynamic cycles, including the Stirling cycle with and without regeneration. We identify the conditions under which the device operates as a heat engine, refrigerator, thermal accelerator, or heater. Efficiency maps and operational-mode diagrams reveal well-defined boundaries in parameter space, governed by the frequency ratio $r=\bar{\omega}/\omega$, the coupling strength $g$, and the thermal gradient between reservoirs. The Carnot cycle exhibits sharp transitions between engine and refrigerator regimes, while the Otto cycle displays a richer structure with the coexistence of all operational modes. The Stirling cycle shows enhanced versatility and performance, particularly when assisted by a regenerator, where near-ideal efficiencies are achieved. Overall, the Raman-type interaction introduces a controllable left-right asymmetry that enables nontrivial manipulation of thermodynamic behavior through frequency tuning.</description>

      <title>Energetics of Rydberg-atom Quantum Computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing exploits the properties of Quantum Mechanics to solve problems faster than classical computers. The potential applications of this technology have been widely explored, and extensive research over the past decades has been dedicated to developing scalable quantum computers. However, the question of the energetic performance of quantum computation has only gained attention more recently, and its importance is now recognized. In fact, quantum computers can only be a viable alternative if their energy cost scales favorably, and some research has shown that there is even a potential quantum energy advantage. Rydberg atoms have emerged recently as one of the most promising platforms to implement a large-scale quantum computer, with significant advances made in recent years. This work aims at contributing first steps to understand the energy efficiency of this platform, namely by investigating the energy consumption of the different elements of a Rydberg atom quantum computer. First, an experimental implementation of the Quantum Phase Estimation algorithm is analyzed, and an estimation of the energetic cost of executing this algorithm is calculated. Then, a potential scaling of the energy cost of performing the Quantum Fourier Transform with Rydberg atoms is derived. This analysis facilitates a comparison of the energy consumption of different elements within a Rydberg atom quantum computer, from the preparation of the atoms to the execution of the algorithm, and the measurement of the final state, enabling the evaluation of the energy expenditure of the Rydberg platform and the identification of potential improvements. Finally, we used the Quantum Fourier Transform as an energetic benchmark, comparing the scaling we obtained to that of the execution of the Discrete Fourier Transform in two state-of-the-art classical supercomputers.</description>

      <title>A Unified Frequency Principle for Quantum and Classical Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum neural networks constitute a key class of near-term quantum learning models, yet their training dynamics remain not fully understood. Here, we present a unified theoretical framework for the frequency principle (F-principle) that characterizes the training dynamics of both classical and quantum neural networks. Within this framework, we prove that quantum neural networks exhibit a spectral bias toward learning low-frequency components of target functions, mirroring the behavior observed in classical deep networks. We further analyze the impact of noise and show that, when single-qubit noise is applied after encoding-layer rotations and modeled as a Pauli channel aligned with the rotation axis, the Fourier component labeled by $\boldsymbol{\omega}$ is suppressed by a factor $(1-2\gamma)^{\|\boldsymbol{\omega}\|_1}$. This leads to exponential attenuation of high-frequency terms while preserving the learnability of low-frequency structure. In the same setting, we establish that the resulting noisy circuits admit efficient classical simulation up to average-case error. Numerical experiments corroborate our theoretical predictions: Quantum neural networks primarily learn low-frequency features during early optimization and maintain robustness against dephasing and depolarizing noise acting on the encoding layer. Our results provide a frequency-domain lens that unifies classical and quantum learning dynamics, clarifies the role of noise in shaping trainability, and guides the design of noise-resilient quantum neural networks.</description>

      <title>FTCircuitBench: A Benchmark Suite for Fault-Tolerant Quantum Compilation and Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Realizing large-scale quantum advantage is expected to require quantum error correction (QEC), making the compilation and optimization of logical operations a critical area of research. Logical computation imposes distinct constraints and operational paradigms that differ from those of the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) regime, motivating the continued evolution of compilation tools. Given the complexity of this emerging stack, where factors such as gate decomposition precision and computational models must be co-designed, standardized benchmarks and toolkits are valuable for evaluating progress. To support this need, we introduce FTCircuitBench, which serves as: (1) a benchmark suite of impactful quantum algorithms, featuring pre-compiled instances in both Clifford+T and Pauli Based Computation models; (2) a modular end-to-end pipeline allowing users to compile and decompose algorithms for various fault-tolerant architectures, supporting both prebuilt and custom optimization passes; and (3) a toolkit for evaluating the impact of algorithms and optimization across the full compilation stack, providing detailed numerical analysis at each stage. FTCircuitBench is fully open-sourced and maintained on Github.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a symmetry-informed representation for hybrid photon--exciton--phonon quantum electrodynamics Hamiltonians to restore Bloch's theorem. The interchange of momenta between fermions and bosons breaks crystalline excitons' translational symmetry under strong coupling. Restoring said symmetry, we efficiently compute experimentally accessible observables without introducing approximations to the Hamiltonian, enabling investigations that elucidate material properties in strong coupling with applications enhancing coherent transport and unlocking symmetry-forbidden matter transitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing has long promised transformative advances in data analysis, yet practical quantum machine learning has remained elusive due to fundamental obstacles such as a steep quantum cost for the loading of classical data and poor trainability of many quantum machine learning algorithms designed for near-term quantum hardware. In this work, we show that one can overcome these obstacles by using a linear Hamiltonian-based machine learning method which provides a compact quantum representation of classical data via ground state problems for k-local Hamiltonians. We use the recent sample-based Krylov quantum diagonalization method to compute low-energy states of the data Hamiltonians, whose parameters are trained to express classical datasets through local gradients. We demonstrate the efficacy and scalability of the methods by performing experiments on benchmark datasets using up to 50 qubits of an IBM Heron quantum processor.</description>

      <title>Grand-Canonical Typicality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how the grand-canonical density matrix arises in macroscopic quantum systems. ``Canonical typicality'' is the known statement that for a typical wave function $\Psi$ from a micro-canonical energy shell of a quantum system $S$ weakly coupled to a large but finite quantum system $B$, the reduced density matrix $\hat{\rho}^S_\Psi=\mathrm{tr}^B |\Psi\rangle\langle \Psi|$ is approximately equal to the canonical density matrix $\hat{\rho}_\mathrm{can}=Z^{-1}_\mathrm{can} \exp(-\beta \hat{H}^S)$. Here, we discuss the analogous statement and related questions for the \emph{grand-canonical} density matrix $\hat{\rho}_\mathrm{gc}=Z^{-1}_\mathrm{gc} \exp(-\beta(\hat{H}^S-\mu_1 \hat{N}_{1}^S-\ldots-\mu_r\hat{N}_{r}^S))$ with $\hat{N}_{i}^S$ the number operator for molecules of type $i$ in the system $S$. This includes (i) the case of chemical reactions and (ii) that of systems $S$ defined by a spatial region which particles may enter or leave. It includes the statements (a) that the density matrix of the appropriate (generalized micro-canonical) Hilbert subspace $H_\mathrm{gmc} \subset H^S \otimes H^B$ (defined by a micro-canonical interval of total energy and suitable particle number sectors), after tracing out $B$, yields $\hat{\rho}_\mathrm{gc}$; (b) that typical $\Psi$ from $H_\mathrm{gmc}$ have reduced density matrix $\hat{\rho}^S_\Psi$ close to $\hat{\rho}_\mathrm{gc}$; and (c) that the conditional wave function $\psi^S$ of $S$ has probability distribution $\mathrm{GAP}_{\hat{\rho}_\mathrm{gc}}$ if a typical orthonormal basis of $H^B$ is used. That is, we discuss the foundation and justification of both the density matrix and the distribution of the wave function in the grand-canonical case. We also extend these considerations to the so-called generalized Gibbs ensembles, which apply to systems for which some macroscopic observables are conserved.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic freedom, lost: Complex conformal field theory in the two-dimensional $O(N&gt;2)$ nonlinear sigma model and its realization in the spin-1 Heisenberg chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The two-dimensional $O(N)$ nonlinear sigma model (NLSM) is asymptotically free for $N&gt;2$: it exhibits neither a nontrivial fixed point nor spontaneous symmetry-breaking. Here we show that a nontrivial fixed point generically does exist in the $\textit{complex}$ coupling plane and is described by a complex conformal field theory (CCFT). This CCFT fixed point is generic in the sense that it has a single relevant singlet operator, and is thus expected to arise in any non-Hermitian model with $O(N)$ symmetry upon tuning a single complex parameter. We confirm this prediction numerically by locating the CCFT at $N = 3$ in a non-Hermitian spin-1 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain, finding good agreement between the complex central charge and scaling dimensions and those obtained by analytic continuation of real fixed points from $N\leq 2$. We further construct a realistic Lindbladian for a spin-1 chain whose no-click dynamics are governed by the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian realizing the CCFT. Since the CCFT vacuum is the eigenstate with the smallest decay rate, the system naturally relaxes under dissipative dynamics toward a CFT state, thus providing a route to preparing long-range entangled states through engineered dissipation.</description>

Abstract: We show that every holographic entropy inequality can be recast in the form: `some entanglement wedges reach deeper in the bulk than some other entanglement wedges.' When the inequality is saturated, the two sets of wedges reach equally deep. Because bulk depth geometrizes CFT scales, the inequalities enforce and protect the holographic Renormalization Group.</description>

Among these, transmon qubits stand out for their ability to suppress external noise while remaining highly sensitive to tiny energy deposits. Ambient galactic halo dark matter interacting with electrons can deposit energy in the qubit, leading to changes in its decoherence time. Recent measurements of transmons have consistently measured, in various experimental setups, a residual contribution to the decoherence time unexplained by thermal noise or known external sources. We use such measurements to set the most stringent laboratory-based constraints to date on dark matter-electron scattering at the keV scale and competitive constraints on dark photon absorption.</description>

      <title>Superextensive charging speeds in a correlated quantum charger</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define a quantum charger as an interacting quantum system that transfers energy between two drives. The key figure of merit characterizing a charger is its charging power. Remarkably, the presence of long-range interactions within the charger can induce a collective steady-state charging mode that depends superlinearly on the size of the charger, exceeding the performance of noninteracting, parallel units. Using the driven Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model and power-law interacting spin chains, we show that this effect persists up to a critical system size set by the breakdown of the high-frequency regime. We discuss optimal work output as well as experimentally accessible initial states. The superlinear charging effect can be probed in trapped-ion experiments, and positions interacting Floquet systems as promising platforms for enhanced energy conversion.</description>

      <title>Stable boundary modes for fragile topology from spontaneous PT-symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional topological insulators protected by nonlocal symmetries or with fragile topology usually do not admit robust in-gap edge modes due to the incompatibility between the symmetry and the boundary. Here, we show that in a parity-time (PT) symmetric system robust in-gap topological edge modes can be stably induced by non-Hermitian couplings that spontaneously break the PT symmetry of the eigenstates. The topological edge modes traverse the imaginary spectral gap between a pair of fragile topological bands, which is opened by the presence of the non-Hermitian perturbation. We demonstrate that the net number of resulting in-gap modes is protected by an operator version of anomaly cancellation that extends beyond the Hermitian limit. The results imply that loss and gain can in principle drive fragile topological phenomena to stable topological phenomena.</description>

      <title>Quantum-enhanced long short-term memory with attention for spatial permeability prediction in oilfield reservoirs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatial prediction of reservoir parameters, especially permeability, is crucial for oil and gas exploration and development. However, the wide range and high variability of permeability prevent existing methods from providing reliable predictions. For the first time in subsurface spatial prediction, this study presents a quantum-enhanced long short-term memory with attention (QLSTMA) model that incorporates variational quantum circuits (VQCs) into the recurrent cell. Using quantum entanglement and superposition principles, the QLSTMA significantly improves the ability to predict complex geological parameters such as permeability. Two quantization structures, QLSTMA with Shared Gates (QLSTMA-SG) and with Independent Gates (QLSTMA-IG), are designed to investigate and evaluate the effects of quantum structure configurations and the number of qubits on model performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the 8-qubit QLSTMA-IG model significantly outperforms the traditional long short-term memory with attention (LSTMA), reducing Mean Absolute Error (MAE) by 19% and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) by 20%, with particularly strong performance in regions featuring complex well-logging data. These findings validate the potential of quantum-classical hybrid neural networks for reservoir prediction, indicating that increasing the number of qubits yields further accuracy gains despite the reliance on classical simulations. This study establishes a foundational framework for the eventual deployment of such models on real quantum hardware and their extension to broader applications in petroleum engineering and geoscience.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Enhanced Neural Contextual Bandit Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic contextual bandits are fundamental for sequential decision-making but pose significant challenges for existing neural network-based algorithms, particularly when scaling to quantum neural networks (QNNs) due to issues such as massive over-parameterization, computational instability, and the barren plateau phenomenon. This paper introduces the Quantum Neural Tangent Kernel-Upper Confidence Bound (QNTK-UCB) algorithm, a novel algorithm that leverages the Quantum Neural Tangent Kernel (QNTK) to address these limitations.
  By freezing the QNN at a random initialization and utilizing its static QNTK as a kernel for ridge regression, QNTK-UCB bypasses the unstable training dynamics inherent in explicit parameterized quantum circuit training while fully exploiting the unique quantum inductive bias. For a time horizon $T$ and $K$ actions, our theoretical analysis reveals a significantly improved parameter scaling of $\Omega((TK)^3)$ for QNTK-UCB, a substantial reduction compared to $\Omega((TK)^8)$ required by classical NeuralUCB algorithms for similar regret guarantees. Empirical evaluations on non-linear synthetic benchmarks and quantum-native variational quantum eigensolver tasks demonstrate QNTK-UCB's superior sample efficiency in low-data regimes. This work highlights how the inherent properties of QNTK provide implicit regularization and a sharper spectral decay, paving the way for achieving ``quantum advantage'' in online learning.</description>

      <title>Does relativistic motion really freeze initially maximal entanglement?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the relativistic dynamics of quantum entanglement in a four-qubit cluster ($CL_4$) state using a fully operational Unruh-DeWitt detector framework. Contrary to the widely held expectation that the Unruh effect inevitably degrades initially maximal entanglement, we demonstrate that the 1-3 bipartite entanglement of the $CL_4$ state remains strictly maximal for all accelerations, including the infinite-acceleration limit. This result uncovers a previously unexplored phenomenon, namely the ``complete freezing of initially maximal entanglement" under relativistic motion. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first identification and systematic characterization of such a phenomenon within a relativistic framework. These findings overturn the conventional view that acceleration universally diminishes maximal entanglement and establish the $CL_4$ state as a promising resource for quantum information processing in non-inertial or curved-spacetime settings.</description>

      <title>Egorov-Type Semiclassical Limits for Open Quantum Systems with a Bi-Lindblad Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a bridge between bi-Hamiltonian structures of Poisson-Lie type, contact Hamiltonian dynamics, and the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) formalism for quantum open systems. On the classical side, we consider bi-Hamiltonian systems defined by a Poisson pencil with non-trivial invariants. Using an exact symplectic realization, these invariants are lifted and projected onto a contact manifold, yielding a completely integrable contact Hamiltonian system in terms of dissipated quantities and a Jacobi-commutative algebra of observables. On the quantum side, we introduce a class of contact-compatible Lindblad generators: GKSL evolutions whose dissipative part preserves a commutative $C^\ast$-subalgebra generated by the quantizations of the classical dissipated quantities, and whose Hamiltonian part admits an Egorov-type semiclassical limit to the contact dynamics. This construction provides a mathematical mechanism compatible with the semiclassical limit for pure dephasing, compatible with integrability and contact dissipation. An explicit Euler-top-type Poisson-Lie pencil, inspired by deformed Euler top models, is developed as a fully worked-out example illustrating the resulting bi-Lindblad structure and its semiclassical behavior.</description>

      <title>Multipartite Non-local Magic and SYK Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the structure of quantum magic in interacting disordered fermionic systems, quantifying non-stabilizerness via the fermionic stabilizer R\'enyi entropy (SRE). To resolve the distribution of magic across different scales, we introduce a multipartite non-local magic functional, constructed from an inclusion-exclusion combination of subsystem contributions. This measure serves as a fine-grained diagnostic, isolating genuinely global contributions and revealing nontrivial interactions between local and collective supports of magic. We illustrate the measure on paradigmatic multipartite states and apply these diagnostics to the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model and its variants. Crucially, for thermal/typical ensembles, we observe a marked disparity between Thermal Pure Quantum (TPQ) states and the thermal density matrix. This reveals a concealed complexity: the immense computational hardness characterizing the unitary evolution is encoded in the specific microstructure of the black hole microstates, while being washed out in the coarse-grained thermodynamic description. Furthermore, in $\mathcal N=2$ supersymmetric SYK, we show that while fortuitous BPS states exhibit intermediate stabilizer complexity, the multipartite measure unveils a rich, sector-dependent pattern of global correlations, distinguishing them from generic chaotic states.</description>

      <title>Collective light-matter interaction in plasmonic waveguide quantum electrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rabi oscillations characterize light-matter hybridization in the waveguide quantum electrodynamics~(WQED) framework, with their associated decay rates reflecting excitation damping, yet their behavior remains unresolved when collective emitters are coupled to a collective waveguide mode. This scenario reveals a conceptually novel collective-light-collective-matter interaction, realizable when a timed-Dicke state~(TDS) of subwavelength emitters couples to a slow, delocalized surface-plasmon mode, forming a hybridized plasmon-polariton~(HPP). The HPP acquires its directionality from the TDS via momentum matching. It also exhibits plasmonic characteristics, with excitation frequencies following the surface-plasmon dispersion relation. We obtain a Rabi oscillation and a long-time decay that describe the HPP and use them to reveal weak- and strong-coupling regimes through the emergence of normal-mode splitting. By performing a finite-time Lyapunov-exponent analysis, we show that the HPP also exhibits instantaneous decay and identify three distinct decay regimes: early-time rapid, transient-time oscillatory, and long-time classical. Finally, by analyzing the emission spectrum, we observe an anticrossing of the peak doublets~(a feature also seen in cavity QED setups) which originates from quantum vacuum effects and the resulting non-Markovian HPP evolution in our WQED.</description>

      <title>Higher-Dimensional Anyons via Higher Cohomotopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We highlight that integer Heisenberg groups at level 2 underlie topological quantum phenomena: their group algebras coincide with the algebras of quantum observables of abelian anyons in fractional quantum Hall (FQH) systems on closed surfaces. Decades ago, these groups were shown to arise as the fundamental groups of the space of maps from the surface to the 2-sphere -- which has recently been understood as reflecting an effective FQH flux quantization in 2-Cohomotopy. Here we streamline and generalize this theorem using the homotopy theory of H-groups, showing that for $k \in \{1,2,4\}$, the non-torsion part of $\pi_1 \mathrm{Map}\big({(S^{2k-1})^2, S^{2k}}\big)$ is an integer Heisenberg group of level 2, where we identify this level with 2 divided by the Hopf invariant of the generator of $\pi_{4k-1}(S^{2k})$. This result implies the existence of higher-dimensional analogs of FQH anyons in the cohomotopical completion of 11D supergravity ("Hypothesis H").</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detection of entanglement through the Newtonian potential has been claimed to support the existence of gravitons, by extrapolating to a thought experiment which demonstrates that complementarity and causality would be in conflict unless quantum fluctuations exist. We critically assess this consistency argument using scalar field models. We show that whether complementarity or no-signalling is violated when quantum fluctuations are neglected, depends on how this approximation is taken, while in both cases entanglement is generated locally in spacetime. We clarify that the correct reading of the paradox requires making a clear distinction between two notions of causality violation: Newtonian action-at-a-distance and the quantum mechanical no-signalling; the latter is pertinent while the former is not. We conclude that the thought experiment (a) does not add to the epistemological relevance of entanglement through Newtonian potentials (b) lends support for the existence of gravitons, if retardation effects are detected in entanglement through gravity.</description>

      <title>$\mathsf{QAC}^0$ Contains $\mathsf{TC}^0$ (with Many Copies of the Input)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $\mathsf{QAC}^0$ is the class of constant-depth polynomial-size quantum circuits constructed from arbitrary single-qubit gates and generalized Toffoli gates. It is arguably the smallest natural class of constant-depth quantum computation which has not been shown useful for computing any non-trivial Boolean function. Despite this, many attempts to port classical $\mathsf{AC}^0$ lower bounds to $\mathsf{QAC}^0$ have failed.
  We give one possible explanation of this: $\mathsf{QAC}^0$ circuits are significantly more powerful than their classical counterparts. We show the unconditional separation $\mathsf{QAC}^0\not\subset\mathsf{AC}^0[p]$ for decision problems, which also resolves for the first time whether $\mathsf{AC}^0$ could be more powerful than $\mathsf{QAC}^0$. Moreover, we prove that $\mathsf{QAC}^0$ circuits can compute a wide range of Boolean functions if given multiple copies of the input: $\mathsf{TC}^0 \subseteq \mathsf{QAC}^0 \circ \mathsf{NC}^0$. Along the way, we introduce an amplitude amplification technique that makes several approximate constant-depth constructions exact.</description>

Abstract: Unitary transformations are employed to enhance the violations of the Bell-CHSH inequality in relativistic Quantum Field Theory. The case of the scalar field in $1+1$ Minkowski space-time is scrutinized by relying on the Tomita-Takesaki modular theory. The example of the bounded Hermitian operator $sign(\varphi(f))$, where $\varphi(f)$ stands for the smeared scalar field, is worked out. It is shown that unitary deformations enable for violations of the Bell-CHSH inequality. The setup is generalized to the Proca vector field by means of its equivalence with the scalar theory.</description>

Abstract: Solid-state defect quantum systems are exquisite probes of their local charge environment. Nonlinear dynamical electric fields in solids are challenging to characterize directly, conventionally limited to coarse macroscopic methods which fail to capture subtle effects in the material. Here, through transient optical spectroscopy on an embedded T center ensemble, we realize the in-situ observation of a silicon PIN-diode phase transition to a regime of self-sustained carrier oscillatory dynamics characteristic of negative differential resistance. Manifest in both the ensemble electroluminescence and photoluminescence, we find a temperature and field-dependent phase space for persistent undamped amplitude oscillations indicative of a collective ensemble response to the field dynamics. These findings shed new light on the cryogenic behavior of silicon, provide fundamental insight into the physics of the T center for improved quantum device performance, and open a promising new direction for defect-based local quantum sensing in semiconductor devices.</description>

      <title>Robust Quantum Control for Bragg Pulse Design in Atom Interferometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04618v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate a robust optimal control algorithm to synthesize minimum energy pulses that can transfer a cold atom system into various momentum states. The algorithm uses adaptive linearization of the evolution operator and sequential quadratic programming to iterate the control towards a minimum energy pulse that achieves optimal target state fidelity. Robustness to parameter variation is achieved using Legendre polynomial approximation over the domain of variation. The method is applied to optimize the Bragg beamsplitting operation in ultra-cold atom interferometry. Even in the presence of 10-40% variability in the initial momentum dispersion of the atomic cloud and the intensity of the optical pulse, the algorithm reliably converges to a control protocol that robustly achieves unprecedented momentum levels with high fidelity for a single-frequency multi-photon Bragg diffraction scheme (e.g. $|\pm 40\hbar k\rangle$). We show the advantages of our method by comparison to stochastic optimization using sampled parameter values, provide detailed sensitivity analyses, and performance of the designed pulses is verified in laboratory experiments.</description>

Abstract: Discrete translational symmetry plays a fundamental role in condensed matter physics and lattice gauge theories, enabling the analysis of systems that would otherwise be intractable. Despite this, many open problems remain. Quantum simulation promises to offer new insights, but progress is often limited by device connectivity constraints, which lead to prohibitively long computation times. We extend the use of spatial symmetry from the systems to be simulated to the quantum circuits simulating them. One application is that it becomes possible to efficiently and optimally alleviate device connectivity constraints algorithmically. This leads to reductions in quantum computational time by several orders of magnitude even for moderate system sizes, making such simulations feasible, with even greater relative gains for larger systems. This substantially enhances the capabilities of quantum computers in the simulation of condensed matter systems and lattice gauge theories, even before hardware improvements. Our work forms the basis for using spatial symmetry of quantum circuits in other areas of quantum computation, such as in the design and implementation of quantum error correcting codes.</description>

      <title>The source of hardware-tailored codes and coding phases</title>

Abstract: A central challenge in quantum error correction is identifying powerful quantum codes tailored to specific hardware and determining their error thresholds above which quantum information is unprotected. This problem is hard because we cannot determine the noise models for our devices. Inspired by the quantum capacity theorem, we seek an optimal quantum source of information, namely the density matrix that degrades minimally when passed through a noisy channel. We explore this idea with the Open Random Unitary Model (ORUM), a simplified model of a $N$-qubit quantum computer with competing depolarizing and dephasing channels as a stand-in for unitary gates and measurements. Through numerical optimization, we find that the ORUM hosts three discrete regimes, three "phases", the "maximally mixed source" phase, a "$\mathbb{Z}_2$ source" phase (where ORUM's $U(1)$ gauge symmetry is broken down to $\mathbb{Z}_2$), and a no-coding phase where all information is lost. These phases exhibit first-order transitions among themselves and converge at a novel zero-capacity multicritical point. These results show a remarkable similarity between the quantum capacity theorem and Jaynes' maximum entropy principle of statistical mechanics. Using the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ source, we build two codes, a classical cat code capable of correcting all the dephasing errors and a concatenated cat code capable of correcting all errors up to a distance $d=\text{min}(m,N)$ and reduces to Shor's 9-qubit code for $m=N=3$. Neither classical nor quantum code survives near the vicinity of the zero-capacity multicritical point in the source phase diagram. Applying our approach to current noisy devices could provide a systematic method for constructing quantum codes for robust computation and communication.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stochastic quantum trajectories, such as pure state evolutions under unitary dynamics and random measurements, offer a crucial ensemble description of many-body open system dynamics. Recent studies have highlighted that individual quantum trajectories also encode essential physical information. Prominent examples include measurement induced phase transitions, where a pure quantum state corresponding to fixed measurement outcomes (trajectories) exhibits distinct entanglement phases, depending on the measurement rate. However, direct observation of this effect is hindered by an exponential post-selection barrier, whereby the probability of realizing a specific trajectory is exponentially small. We propose a deterministic method to efficiently prepare quantum trajectories in polynomial time using imaginary time evolution and, thus, overcome this fundamental challenge. We demonstrate that our method applies to a certain class of quantum states, and argue that there does not exist universal approaches for any quantum trajectories. Our result paves the way for experimentally exploring the physics of individual quantum trajectories at scale and enables direct observation of certain post-selection-dependent phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00483v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamical quantum phase transitions reveal singularities in quench dynamics, characterized by the emergence of Loschmidt echo zeros at critical times, which usually exist only in the thermodynamic limit but are absent in finite-size quantum systems. In this Letter, we propose a theoretical scheme to probe Loschmidt echo zeros in finite-size systems by applying a two-step quenching protocol, which offers an experimentally feasible approach to study Loschmidt echo zeros. Using the transverse Ising model as a test bed, we identify that the exact Loschmidt echo zeros can be always accessed by tuning the quench rate, when the quench is across the phase transition point. The associated rate function displays divergence at critical times, accompanying with the change of the dynamical topological order parameter. The critical times are influenced by the quench rate, system size, and momentum modes, embodying the interplay between finite-size effects and critical dynamics. Moreover, the generality of these observations is further confirmed in the XY and Haldane models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04802v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bound entanglement refers to entangled states that cannot be distilled into maximally entangled states and therefore cannot directly be used in many quantum information processing protocols. We identify a relationship between bound entanglement and the Markov gap, which is introduced within holography via the entanglement wedge cross section and is related to the fidelity of the partial Markov recovery problem. We prove that a bound entangled state must have a nonzero Markov gap. Conversely, for sufficiently large systems, a state with a weakly nonzero Markov gap typically has a bound entangled or separable marginal state, where entanglement is undistillable. Furthermore, this implies that the transition from a bound entangled to a separable state originates from the properties of states with a weakly nonzero Markov gap, which may be dual to non-perturbative effects from a holographic perspective. Our results shed light on the investigation of the Markov gap and enhance interdisciplinary applications of quantum information.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19424v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a matrix-product-state-based numerical approach for simulating systems composed of several qubits and a common one-dimensional waveguide. In the presented approach, the one-dimensional waveguide is modeled in real space. Thus, one can use the advantage of matrix-product states that are suited for simulating low-entangled one-dimensional systems. The price to pay is that the vacuum of the waveguide in this modeling becomes the Bogoliubov vacuum, and one has to consider a not-so-small local Hilbert space for bosonic degrees of freedom. To manage the large local Hilbert space, we adopt the recently proposed single-site schemes. We demonstrate the potential of the presented approach by simulating superradiant phenomena within the Hamiltonian dynamics.</description>

      <title>A Cost-Effective Layout-Aware Quantum Circuit Synthesis For Triangular, Square, and Heavy-Hex Layouts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum layout and the mapping of logical to physical qubits are crucial in quantum circuit synthesis for a real quantum computer. Circuits that include large $n$-bit Toffoli gates ($n \geq 3$), such as those designed from cost-expensive gates and hard-to-decompose Exclusive-or Sum of Products (ESOP) expressions, have complications of effective mappings into contemporary quantum layouts, such as the square grid and heavy-hex layouts. These complications are primarily caused by the limited connectivity among the physical qubits in such layouts, leading to the insertion of many additional SWAP gates. This paper introduces a new quantum circuit synthesis methodology by exploring the advantage of a Positive Davio lattice (PDL) as an intermediate representation to create our proposed triangular layout and layout-aware circuits. From these circuits, we introduce and form the SWAT gate, composed of a SWAP gate followed by a 3-bit Toffoli gate. To illustrate the usefulness of our method for existing industrial quantum layouts, we also introduce cost-effective mappings of the resulting circuits onto square grid and heavy-hex layouts without additional SWAP gates. This is done with the help of the SWAT gate. Our research highlights PDLs as an efficient tool for layout-aware quantum circuit synthesis.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic criteria for signaling in quantum channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20428v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Signaling quantum channels are fundamental to quantum communication, enabling the transfer of information from input to output states. In contrast, thermalisation erases information about the initial state. This raises a crucial question: How does the thermalising tendency of a quantum channel constrain its signaling power and vice versa? In this work, we address this question by considering three thermodynamic tasks associated with a quantum channel: the generation, preservation, and transmission of athermality. We provide faithful measures for athermality generation and athermality preservation of quantum channels, and prove that their difference quantifies athermality transmission. Analysing these thermodynamic tasks, we find that the signaling ability of a quantum channel is upper-bounded by its athermality preservation and lower-bounded by its athermality transmission, thereby establishing a fundamental relationship between signaling and thermodynamic properties of channels for quantum communication. We demonstrate this interplay for the example of the quantum switch, revealing an explicit trade-off between the signaling ability and athermality of the quantum channels it can implement.</description>

      <title>The Dual Role of Low-Weight Pauli Propagation: A Flawed Simulator but a Powerful Initializer for Variational Quantum Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms are often hindered by rugged optimization landscapes. In this Letter, we investigate the low-weight Pauli propagation (LWPP) algorithm and find that it serves as an unreliable energy estimator for variational circuits. However, we reveal a counterintuitive insight: the Pauli-weight truncation acts as a spectral filter, effectively smoothing out high-frequency local minima while preserving the global basin of attraction in the landscape. We identify this mechanism as landscape alignment, where the approximate landscape becomes a superior navigator compared to the rugged exact landscape. Benchmarks across diverse spin models and molecular systems demonstrate that LWPP-initialized optimization yields order-of-magnitude improvements in accuracy, often finding solutions inaccessible to direct exact optimization. This work reframes LWPP from a flawed simulator into a vital pre-optimizer that serves not only as a cheap classical substitute but also as an essential tool for addressing quantum optimization challenges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13462v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum walks are a powerful framework for the development of quantum algorithms, with lackadaisical quantum walks (LQWs) standing out as an efficient model for spatial search. In this work, we investigate how broken-link decoherence affects the performance of LQW-based search on a two-dimensional toroidal grid. We show through numerical simulations that, while decoherence drives the loopless walk toward a uniform distribution and eliminates its search capability, the inclusion of self-loops significantly mitigates this effect. In particular, even under noise, the marked vertex remains identifiable with probability well above uniform, demonstrating that self-loops enhance the robustness of LQWs in realistic scenarios. These findings extend the known advantages of LQWs from the noiseless setting to noisy environments, consolidating self-loops as a valuable resource for designing resilient quantum search algorithms.</description>

Abstract: We present a novel approach to chiral discrimination using gate-based quantum processors, addressing a key challenge in adapting conventional control techniques using modern quantum computing. Schemes such as stimulated rapid adiabatic passage (STIRAP) and shortcuts to adiabaticity (STAP) have shown strong potential for enantiomer discrimination; their reliance on analog and continuous-time control makes them incompatible with digital gate-based quantum computing architectures. Here, we adapt these protocols for quantum computers by discretizing their Gaussian-shaped pulses through Trotterization. We simulate the chiral molecule 1,2-propanediol and experimentally validate this gate-based implementation on IBM quantum hardware. Our results demonstrate that this approach is a viable foundation for advancing chiral discrimination protocols, preparing the way for quantum-level manipulation of molecular chirality on accessible quantum architectures.</description>

Abstract: Determining when quantum many-body systems admit simple, efficiently simulable structure is a central problem. High-temperature thermal states are a natural candidate for such simplicity, yet for bosons, the unbounded local Hilbert space and energy invalidate the usual expectation that large $T$ guarantees tractability. Here we investigate the resulting complexity boundary for interacting lattice bosons and show that the repulsive Bose--Hubbard class lies on the ``simple'' side. For a family with long-range hopping decaying as $r^{-\alpha}$, we prove convergence of a controlled cluster expansion, which implies (above an explicit temperature threshold) an efficient classical algorithm to approximate the partition function and a rigorous power-law clustering bound for connected correlations. More broadly, our results provide a first step toward charting complexity boundaries for high-temperature bosons and suggest the repulsive Bose--Hubbard class as a natural candidate cusp.</description>

Abstract: Solvable bosonic models provide a fundamental framework for describing light propagation in nonlinear media, including optical down-conversion processes that generate squeezed states of light and their higher-order generalizations. In quantum optics a central objective is to determine the time evolution of a given initial state. Exact analytic solution to the state-evolution problem is presented, applicable to a broad class of solvable bosonic models and arbitrary initial states. Moreover, the characteristic equation governing the energy spectrum is derived and the eigenstates are found in the form of continued fractions and as the principal minors of the associated Jacobi matrix. The results provide a solid analytical framework for discussion of exactly solvable bosonic models.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Lattice Surgery: Non-Clifford Gates via Non-Abelian Surface Codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In universal fault-tolerant quantum computing, implementing logical non-Clifford gates often demands substantial spacetime resources for many error-correcting codes, including the high-threshold surface code. A critical mission for realizing large-scale quantum computing is to develop simple and resource-efficient implementations of logical non-Clifford gates. We propose a novel way of implementing non-Clifford operations in the standard surface code based on hybrid lattice surgery. First we generalize the standard lattice surgery to hybrid lattice surgery, where operations of rough merge and rough split happen across different topological codes. Then we apply such procedures between Abelian and non-Abelian codes and show that this can provide non-Clifford operations in the standard surface code, in the form of a magic state or a non-Clifford gate teleportation. Complementing this, we provide a continuum topological field theory description of this hybrid lattice surgery utilizing interfaces between (2+1)d topological orders. From these considerations, we can generalize our protocol to non-Clifford gates and magic states at all finite levels of the Clifford hierarchy, as well as gates beyond the hierarchy. We also discuss protocols extending this framework to qutrits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25561v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computation with $d$-level quantum systems, also known as qudits, benefits from the possibility to use a richer computational space compared to qubits. However, for an arbitrary qudit-based hardware platform, the issue is that a generic qudit operation has to be decomposed into the sequence of native operations $-$ pulses that are adjusted to the transitions between two levels in a qudit. Typically, not all levels in a qudit are simply connected to each other due to specific selection rules. Moreover, the number of pulses plays a significant role, since each pulse takes a certain execution time and may introduce error. In this paper, we propose a resource-efficient algorithm to decompose single-qudit operations into the sequence of pulses that are allowed by qudit selection rules. Using the developed algorithm, the number of pulses is at most $d(d{-}1)/2$ for an arbitrary single-qudit operation. For specific operations, the algorithm could produce even fewer pulses. We provide a comparison of qudit decompositions for several types of trapped ions, specifically $^{171}\text{Yb}^+$, $^{137}\text{Ba}^+$ and $^{40}\text{Ca}^+$ with different selection rules, and also decomposition for superconducting qudits. Although our approach deals with single-qudit operations, the proposed approach is important for realizing two-qudit operations since they can be implemented as a standard two-qubit gate that is surrounded by efficiently implemented single-qudit gates.</description>

      <title>Robust Two-Qubit Geometric Phase Gates using Amplitude and Frequency Ramping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate a method for generating entanglement between trapped atomic ions based on adiabatically ramped state-dependent forces. By ramping both the amplitude of the state-dependent force and the motional mode frequencies, we realize an entangling operation that is robust to motional mode occupation and drifts in the mode frequencies. We measure Bell state fidelities above 0.99 across a broad range of ramp parameters and with motional occupations up to 10 phonons. This technique enables high-fidelity entangling operations without ground-state cooling, has a reduced calibration overhead, and is well suited for both quantum logic spectroscopy applications and scalable quantum computing architectures.</description>

      <title>Non-commutativity as a Universal Characterization for Enhanced Quantum Metrology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A central challenge in quantum metrology is to effectively harness quantum resources to surpass classical precision bounds. Although recent studies suggest that the indefinite causal order may enable sensitivities to attain the super-Heisenberg scaling, the physical origins of such enhancements remain elusive. Here, we introduce the nilpotency index $\mathcal{K}$, which quantifies the depth of non-commutativity between operators during the encoding process, can act as a fundamental parameter governing quantum-enhanced sensing. We show that a finite $\mathcal{K}$ yields an enhanced scaling of root-mean-square error as $N^{-(1+\mathcal{K})}$. Meanwhile, the requirement for indefinite causal order arises only when the nested commutators become constant. Remarkably, in the limit $\mathcal{K} \to \infty$, exponential precision scaling $N^{-1}e^{-N}$ is achievable. We propose experimentally feasible protocols implementing these mechanisms, providing a systematic pathway towards practical quantum-enhanced metrology.</description>

      <title>Experimental Blueprint for Distinguishing Decoherence from Objective Collapse</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transition from the quantum to the classical realm remains one of the most profound open questions in physics. While quantum theory predicts the existence of macroscopic superpositions, their apparent absence in the everyday world is attributed either to environmental decoherence or to an intrinsic mechanism for wave-function collapse. This work presents a quantitative and experimentally grounded framework for distinguishing these possibilities. We propose a levitated optomechanical platform capable of generating controllable Schrodinger-cat states in the center of mass motion of a dielectric nanosphere. A comprehensive master equation incorporates gas collisions, black-body radiation, and photon-recoil noise, establishing a calibrated environmental baseline. The Continuous Spontaneous Localization (CSL) model is embedded within the same framework, predicting a characteristic saturation of the decoherence rate with superposition size and a quadratic scaling with mass. A Bayesian inference protocol is outlined to discriminate collapse induced excess decoherence from environmental noise. Together these elements provide a concrete experimental blueprint for a decisive test of quantum linearity, either revealing new physics beyond standard quantum mechanics or setting the most stringent bounds to date on objective-collapse parameters.</description>

      <title>Boundary-driven quantum systems near the Zeno limit: steady states and long-time behavior</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12825v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study composite open quantum systems with a finite-dimensional state space ${\mathcal H}_A\otimes {\mathcal H}_B$ governed by a Lindblad equation $\rho'(t) = {\mathcal L}_\gamma \rho(t)$ where ${\mathcal L}_\gamma\rho = -i[H,\rho] + \gamma {\mathcal D} \rho$, and ${\mathcal D}$ is a dissipator ${\mathcal D}_A\otimes I$ acting non-trivially only on part $A$ of the system, which can be thought of as the boundary, and $\gamma$ is a parameter. It is known that the dynamics simplifies for large $\gamma$: after a time of order $\gamma^{-1}$, $\rho(t)$ is well approximated for times small compared to $\gamma^2$ by $\pi_A\otimes R(t)$ where $\pi_A$ is a steady state of ${\mathcal D}_A$, and $R(t)$ is a solution of $\frac{{\rm d}}{{\rm d}t}R(t) = {\mathcal L}_{P,\gamma}R(t)$ where ${\mathcal L}_{P,\gamma} R := -i[H_P,R] + \gamma^{-1} {\mathcal D}_P R$ with $H_P$ being a Hamiltonian on ${\mathcal H}_B$ and ${\mathcal D}_P$ being a Lindblad generator over ${\mathcal H}_B$. We prove this assuming only that ${\mathcal D}_A$ is ergodic and gapped. In order to better control the long time behavior, and study the steady states $\bar\rho_\gamma$, we introduce a third Lindblad generator ${\mathcal D}_P^\sharp$ that does not involve $\gamma$, but still closely related to ${\mathcal L}_\gamma$. We show that if ${\mathcal D}_P^\sharp$ is ergodic and gapped, then so is ${\mathcal L}_\gamma$ for all large $\gamma$, and if $\bar\rho_\gamma$ denotes the unique steady state for ${\mathcal L}_\gamma$, then $\lim_{\gamma\to\infty}\bar\rho_\gamma = \pi_A\otimes \bar R$ where $\bar R$ is the unique steady state for ${\mathcal D}_P^\sharp$. We show that there is a convergent expansion $\bar\rho_\gamma = \pi_A\otimes\bar R +\gamma^{-1} \sum_{k=0}^\infty \gamma^{-k} \bar n_k$ where, defining $\bar n_{-1} := \pi_A\otimes\bar R$, ${\mathcal D} \bar n_k = -i[H,\bar n_{k-1}]$ for all $k\geq 0$.</description>

      <title>Electrical Control of Optically Active Single Spin Qubits in ZnSe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21462v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electrons bound to shallow donors in ZnSe quantum wells are promising candidates for optically addressable spin qubits and single-photon sources. However, their optical coherence and indistinguishability are often limited by spectral broadening arising from charge fluctuations in the local environment. Here, we report electrical control of single donor qubits in ZnSe quantum wells. The applied field induces a DC Stark shift that tunes the emission energy over a range exceeding 30 times the inhomogeneous linewidth, effectively compensating for emitter-to-emitter variations. Concurrently, the field stabilizes trap occupancy, yielding a twofold reduction in optical linewidth and the suppression of spectral wandering. A statistical model based on trap dynamics qualitatively reproduces these observations and elucidates the mechanism of field-assisted charge noise suppression. Our results identify electrical control as a versatile pathway to significantly improve optical and spin addressability.</description>

      <title>A method for robust spin relaxometry in the presence of imperfect state preparation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22739v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin relaxometry based on quantum spin systems has developed as a valuable tool in medical and condensed matter systems, offering the advantage of operating without the need for external DC or RF fields. Spin relaxometry with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers has been applied to paramagnetic sensing using both single crystal diamond and nanodiamond materials. However, these methods often suffer from artifacts and systematic uncertainties, particularly due to imperfect spin state preparation, leading to artificially fast T$_1$ relaxation times. Current analysis techniques fail to adequately account for these issues, limiting the precision of parameter estimation. In this work, we introduce a minimal fitting procedure that enables more robust parameter estimation in the presence of imperfect spin polarization. Our model improves upon existing approaches by offering more accurate fits and provides a framework for efficiently parallelizing single-spin dynamics studies.</description>

Abstract: We present a complete characterization of diagonal unitary covariant (DU-covariant) superchannels, i.e. higher-order transformations transforming quantum channels into themselves. Necessary and sufficient conditions for complete positivity and trace preservation are derived and the canonical decomposition describing DU-covariant superchannels is provided. The presented framework unifies and extends known families of covariant quantum channels and enables explicit analysis of their action on physically relevant examples, including amplitude-damping, bit-flip, and Pauli channels. Our results provide a practical toolbox for symmetry-restricted higher-order quantum processes and offer a setting for exploring open problems such as the celebrated PPT$^2$ conjecture.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Topological Phase Discovery in Periodically Driven Systems via Floquet-Bloch State</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24822v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Floquet engineering offers an unparalleled platform for realizing novel non-equilibrium topological phases. However, the unique structure of Floquet systems, which includes multiple quasienergy gaps, poses a significant challenge to classification using conventional analytical methods. We propose a novel unsupervised machine learning framework that employs a kernel defined in momentum-time ($\boldsymbol{k},t$) space, constructed directly from Floquet-Bloch eigenstates. This approach is intrinsically data-driven and requires no prior knowledge of the underlying topological invariants, providing a fundamental advantage over prior methods that rely on abstract concepts like the micromotion operator or homotopic transformations. Crucially, this work successfully reveals the intrinsic topological characteristics encoded within the Floquet eigenstates themselves. We demonstrate that our method robustly and simultaneously identifies the topological invariants associated with both the $0$-gap and the $\pi$-gap across various symmetry classes (1D AIII, 1D D, and 2D A), establishing a robust methodology for the systematic classification and discovery of complex non-equilibrium topological matter.</description>

      <title>The Equivalence between Hardy-type paradox and Logical Contextuality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hardy-type paradoxes offer elegant, inequality-free proof of quantum contextuality. In this work, we introduce a unified logical formulation for general Hardy-type paradoxes, which we term logical Hardy-type paradoxes. We prove that for any finite scenario, the existence of a logical Hardy-type paradox is equivalent to logical contextuality. Specially, strong contextuality is equivalent to logical Hardy-type paradoxes with success probability SP = 1. These results generalize prior work on (2,k,2), (2,2,d), and n-cycle scenarios, and resolve a misconception that such equivalence does not hold for general scenarios [1]. We analyse the logical Hardy-type paradoxes on the (2,2,2) and (2,3,3) Bell scenarios, as well as the Klyachko-Can-Binicioglu-Shumovsky (KCBS) scenario. We show that the KCBS scenario admits only one kind of Hardy-type paradox, achieving a success probability of SP \approx 10.56% for a specific parameter setting.</description>

      <title>Photon blockade effect from synergistic optical parametric amplification and driving force in Kerr-medium single-mode cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work investigates photon blockade control in a hybrid quantum system containing a Kerr-nonlinear cavity coupled to an optical parametric amplifier (OPA). The dynamics are governed by a master equation derived from an effective Hamiltonian that includes cavity decay. To obtain analytical solutions, the system's quantum state is expanded in the Fock basis up to the two-photon level. Solving the steady-state Schrodinger equation yields probability amplitudes and the analytical conditions for optimal photon blockade. Results confirm that photon blockade is achievable with suitable parameters. Excellent agreement is found between the analytical solutions and numerical simulations for the steady-state, equal-time second-order correlation function, validating both the analytical method and the blockade effect. Numerically, the average intracavity photon number increases significantly under resonance, providing a theoretical pathway for enhancing single-photon source brightness. Furthermore, the driving phase is shown to regulate the optimal blockade region: it shifts the parabolic region within the two-dimensional parameter space of driving strength and OPA nonlinearity and can even reverse its opening direction. The influence of Kerr nonlinearity is also examined. Photon blockade remains robust across a wide range of Kerr strengths. Physical analysis attributes the effect to destructive quantum interference between two distinct excitation pathways that suppress two-photon states. While Kerr nonlinearity shifts the system's energy levels, it does not disrupt this interference mechanism, explaining the effect's stability over a broad parameter range.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18854v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The notorious fermion sign problem, arising from fermion statistics, presents a fundamental obstacle to the numerical simulation of quantum many-body systems. Here, we introduce a framework that circumvents the sign problem in the studies of quantum criticality and its associated phases by leveraging imaginary-time nonequilibrium critical dynamics. We demonstrate that the critical properties can be accurately determined from the system's short-time relaxation, a regime where the sign problem remains manageable for quantum Monte-Carlo (QMC) simulations. After validating this approach on two benchmark fermionic models, we apply it to the sign-problematic Hubbard model hosting SU(3)-symmetric Dirac fermions. We present the first numerically exact characterization of its quantum phase diagram, revealing a continuous transition between a Dirac semi-metal and a SU(3) antiferromagnetic phase. This transition defines an unconventional Gross-Neveu universality class that fundamentally reshapes current understanding of Gross-Neveu criticality. Our work provides a powerful tool for investigating sign-problematic systems and quantum criticality.</description>

      <title>Optically Switchable Fluorescence Enhancement at Critical Interparticle Distances</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11541v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Plasmonic nanostructures provide electric field localization to be used as a fluorescence enhancement tool for the closely located fluorophores. However, metallic structures exhibit non-radiative energy transfer at close proximity, which suppresses the boost in the photoluminescence spectrum due to inhomogeneous medium. Compensation to non-radiative losses is fundamentally restricted, therefore defining the critical interparticle distances, where the fluorescence enhancement is detectable hold utmost importance for device applications. In this work, we numerically identified the critical interparticle distances of a metal nanoparticle (MNP) and quantum emitters (QEs) with angstrom resolution by analyzing the interplay between quantum yield and non-radiative decay. By engaging a collimated light application on silver nanoparticle (AgNP) placed at a critical distance, we simulated an active fluorescence enhancement switch yielding observable 7-fold increase in fluorescence intensity. The provided free space simulation includes the complete response of AgNP with retardation and higher order multi-polar effects for which the previous analytical works fall short. While the model bridges the absorption and emission spectra via corresponding Stokes shift values and presents a general approach for the interaction of QEs and MNPs in Rayleigh regime, it can be extended to Mie regime for larger QEs and can be modified for dielectric device environment.</description>

Abstract: We study topological properties of a quantum mechanical system with $U(1)$-symmetry within the functional renormalisation group (fRG) approach. These properties include the vacuum energy structure and the topological susceptibility. Our approach works with a complexification of the flow equation, and specifically we embed the original symmetry into the complex plane, $U(1)\rightarrow \mathbb{C}$. We compute the effective potential of a given topological sector by restricting ourselves to field configurations with a given generalised non-trivial Chern-Simons numbers. The full potential is directly constructed from these sector potentials. Our results compare well with the benchmark results obtained from solving the corresponding Schr\"odinger equation.</description>

      <title>Variational and field-theoretical approach to exciton-exciton interactions and biexcitons in semiconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bound electron-hole pairs in semiconductors known as excitons are the subject of intense research due to their potential for optoelectronic devices and applications, especially in the realm of two-dimensional materials. While the properties of free excitons in these systems are well understood, a general description of the interactions between these quasiparticles is complicated due to their composite nature, which leads to important exchange processes that can take place between the identical fermions of different excitons. In this work, we employ a variational approach to study interactions between Wannier excitons and obtain an effective interaction potential between two ground-state excitons in a system of spin-degenerate electrons and holes. This potential is in general nonlocal in position space and depends on the combined spin configurations of the electrons and holes. When particularized to the case of hydrogen-like excitons with a heavy hole, this potential becomes local and exactly reproduces the Heitler-London result for two interacting hydrogen atoms. Thus, our result can be interpreted as a generalization of the Heitler-London potential to the case of arbitrary masses. We also show how including corrections due to excited states into the theory results in a van der Waals potential at large distances, which is expected due to the induced dipole-dipole nature of the interactions. Our approach is also applicable to more complicated systems with nonhydrogenic exciton series, such as layered semiconductors with Rytova-Keldysh interactions. Additionally, we use a path-integral formalism to develop a many-body theory for a dilute gas of excitons, resulting in an excitonic action that formally includes many-body interactions between excitons. While in this approach the field representing the excitons is exactly bosonic, we clarify how the internal exchange processes arise in...</description>

      <title>Can Newtonian Gravity Produce Quantum Entanglement?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23584v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate whether Newtonian gravity can generate quantum entanglement between mesoscopic quantum bodies modeled as superposed mass quadrupoles using three complementary approaches: mini-superspace, semiclassical gravity, and stochastic gravity. We systematically analyze gravitationally induced entanglement (GIE) mechanisms and the conditions under which they can arise. Our results support the GIE hypothesis by showing that the mini-superspace framework, which quantizes the parity of the gravitational tidal field, can entangle spatially separate quantum bodies. In contrast, the semiclassical and stochastic gravity models, in which the tidal gravitational field sourced by the quantum bodies remains classical, fail to entangle the final state. These findings clarify recent claims that classical gravity might induce entanglement, and reveal how perturbative treatments can lead to misleading conclusions.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Through Topological Defects: Reconciling Theory with Numerics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07974v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Present theoretical predictions for the entanglement entropy through topological defects are violated by numerical simulations. In order to resolve this, we introduce a paradigm shift in the preparation of reduced density matrices in the presence of topological defects, and emphasize the role of defect networks with which they can be dressed. We consider the cases of grouplike and duality defects in detail for the Ising model, and find agreement with all numerically found entanglement entropies. Since our construction functions at the level of reduced density matrices, it accounts for topological defects beyond the entanglement entropy to other entanglement measures.</description>

      <title>Lanczos Meets Orthogonal Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a direct correspondence between the Lanczos approach and the orthogonal polynomials approach in random matrix theory. In the large-$N$ and continuum limits, the average Lanczos coefficients and the recursion coefficients become equivalent, with the precise mapping $b(1-x)=\sqrt{R(x)}$ and $a(1-x)=S(x)$. As a result, the two formalisms yield identical expressions for the leading density of states. We further analyze the Krylov dynamics associated with the recursion coefficients and show that the orthogonal polynomials admit a natural interpretation as Krylov polynomials. This picture is realized explicitly in the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble, where all quantities can be computed analytically.</description>

      <title>Site-Order Optimization in the Density Matrix Renormalization Group via Multi-Site Rearrangement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22021v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the approaches based on matrix-product states (MPSs), such as the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method, the ordering of the sites crucially affects the computational accuracy. We investigate the performance of an algorithm that searches for the optimal site order by iterative local site rearrangement. We improve the algorithm by expanding the range of site rearrangement and apply it to a one-dimensional quantum Heisenberg model with random site permutation. The results indicate that increasing the range of the site rearrangement significantly improves the computational accuracy of the DMRG method. In particular, increasing the rearrangement range from two to three sites reduces the average relative error in the ground-state energy by 65% to 94% in the cases we tested. We also discuss the computational cost of the algorithm and its application as a preprocessing for MPS-based calculations.</description>

      <title>Magnetically Induced Transparency-Absorption and Normal-Anomalous Dispersion Characteristics of ${}^{87}\text{Rb}$ Medium or Any J-Type Configuration Atomic Vapors Subject to a Vector Magnetic Field and a Weak Resonant Pump</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02113v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have developed an analytical framework for magnetically induced transparency-absorption (MITA) and normal-anomalous dispersion (MINAD) in a weakly driven ${}^{87}\text{Rb}$ vapor, or any J-type three-level system, under a vector magnetic field. By solving the Bloch equations in the stationary, quasi-stationary, and short-pulse regimes, we obtained closed-form expressions for the atomic populations and coherences and identified a bifurcation in the oscillatory dynamics at zero longitudinal Zeeman splitting. The Fourier-domain analysis reveals alternating transparency/absorption and normal/anomalous dispersion with frequency-dependent sign reversals, enabling spectrally selective filtering and group-delay effects. Slow oscillatory behavior in the radio-frequency range makes the system suitable for weak magnetic-field sensing, while fast oscillations at optical frequencies suggest applications in spectral filtering and frequency-comb-like signal shaping. The results provide a theoretical basis for experimental observation of MITA/MINAD and for optimizing atomic-vapor platforms for precision magnetometry and related photonic functionalities.</description>

      <title>Addressing intramolecular vibrational redistribution in a single molecule through pump and probe surface-enhanced vibrational spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02117v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of accurate tools to characterize Intramolecular Vibrational Redistribution (IVR) is of major interest in chemistry. In this context, surface-enhanced vibrational spectroscopies stand up as well-established techniques to study molecular vibrational lines and populations with a sensitivity that can reach the singe-molecule level. However, to date, this possibility has not been fully developed to address IVR. Here, we establish a quantum mechanical framework based on molecular optomechanics that accounts for IVR, and adopt it to analyze strategies to optimize IVR characterization by vibrational spectroscopy. In particular, we model two different pump-and-probe configurations where the vibrational pumping is provided either by infrared laser illumination or by Stokes SERS. We show for the two pumping configurations the existence of clear signatures on the anti-Stokes SERS spectra of population transfer between coupled vibrational modes in a molecule. Our calculations adopt realistic molecular and SERS parameters, suggesting that these signatures of IVR are accessible at the single-molecule level with current experimental platforms.</description>

      <title>Exact Mobility Edges in a Disorder-Free Dimerized Stark Lattice with Effective Unbounded Hopping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02259v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a disorder-free one-dimensional single-particle Hamiltonian hosting an exact mobility edge (ME), placing the system outside the assumptions of no-go theorems regarding unbounded potentials. By applying a linear Stark potential selectively to one sublattice of a dimerized chain, we generate an effective Hamiltonian with unbounded, staggered hopping amplitudes. The unbounded nature of the hopping places the model outside the scope of the Simon-Spencer theorem, while the staggered scaling allows it to evade broader constraints on Jacobi matrices. We analytically derive the bulk spectrum in reciprocal space, identifying a sharp ME where the energy magnitude equals the inter-cell hopping strength. This edge separates a continuum of extended states from two distinct localized branches: a standard unbounded Wannier-Stark ladder and an anomalous bounded branch accumulating at the ME. The existence of extended states is supported by finite-size scaling of the inverse participation ratio up to system sizes $L \sim 10^9$. Furthermore, we propose an experimental realization using photonic frequency synthetic dimensions. Our numerical results indicate that the ME is robust against potential experimental imperfections, including frequency detuning errors and photon loss, establishing a practical path for observing MEs in disorder-free systems.</description>
