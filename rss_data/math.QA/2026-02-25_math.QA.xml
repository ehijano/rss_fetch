      <title>Quantum wreath products and $p$-adic general linear group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the pro-$p$ Iwahori-Hecke algebra and its Gelfand-Graev modules for the $p$-adic general linear group and its metaplectic covers. We develop the theory of quantum wreath products of skew polynomial type and use it to provide transparent descriptions of these Hecke algebras and their modules that were previously inaccessible through standard $p$-adic methods. We introduce the notion of (anti)spherical and Kashiwara-Miwa-Stern modules for these quantum wreath products for the first time and interpret the $p$-adic Gelfand-Graev modules in terms of these new modules. As an application, we study the structure theory for the corresponding $p$-adic pro-$p$ Schur algebras and obtain an explicit basis and multiplication rules. Moreover, we give algebraic (re)proofs of several results of $p$-adic interest including the existence of PBW basis for the pro-$p$ metaplectic and Iwahori-Hecke algebras, identification of the Iwahori-Schur algebra with the quantum affine Schur algebra, and failure of the local Shimura correspondence at the pro-$p$ level.</description>

      <title>Kazhdan-Lusztig bases of parabolic Hecke algebras and applications to Schur-Weyl duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With an eye to applications to type A and Schur-Weyl duality, we study Kazhdan-Lusztig bases for a general parabolic Hecke algebra. Parabolic Hecke algebras are idempotent subalgebras of Hecke algebras corresponding to parabolic subgroups, and for type A they coincide with the fused Hecke algebras appearing in a generalisation of the Schur-Weyl duality with the quantum group of GL(N). In this paper we investigate two different Kazhdan-Lusztig bases for parabolic Hecke algebras, together with the associated cells and the corresponding representations. We quickly specialise to type A, for which we describe the cells in terms of the RSK correspondence generalising thus the well-known description for the symmetric group. As a first application we recover the classification of irreducible representations of parabolic Hecke algebras of type A and provide a new construction of these representations. Next we turn to the Schur-Weyl duality and describe the kernel in terms of one the basis studied precedently. Moreover, we formulate some conjectures about a generator of these kernels in terms of Kazhdan-Lusztig basis elements, give some evidence and prove these conjectures in some special cases.</description>

      <title>Generating twisted Cherednik eigenfunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hamiltonians ${\cal H}^{a}_k$ of new integrable systems associated with the integer rays $(1,a)$ (commutative subalgebras) of Ding-Iohara-Miki (DIM) algebra in the $N$-body representation are closely related to commuting twisted Cherednik Hamiltonians $\mathfrak{C}_i^{(a)}$, ${\cal H}^{a}_k = \sum_{i=1}^N (\mathfrak{C}_i^{(a)})^k$. Moreover, symmetric combinations of eigenfunctions in the twisted Cherednik system were recently shown to produce the DIM Hamiltonian eigenstates. We explicitly construct these twisted Cherednik eigenfunctions recurrently by action of some (creation and permutation) operations. It resembles of a far-going generalization of Kirillov-Noumi operators, but exact relation remains to be specified.</description>

      <title>Heisenberg and Drinfeld doubles of Uq(gl(1|1)) and Uq(osp(1|2)) super-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01681v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Heisenberg double and the Drinfeld double of the Borel half of $Uq (gl(1|1))$ and of the $Uq (gl(1|1))$ when q is a root of unity. We also study the Borel half of Uq (osp(1|2)) for both cases when qis a root of unity and when it is not. We prove the isomorphism between the Heisenberg doubles and the handle algebras, which is missing in the literature, and extend the isomorphism to the graded Heisenberg doubles and the handle algebras in the context of the Z2-graded generalisation of Alekseev-Schomerus combinatorial quantisation of Chern-Simons theory [1, 2], as well as illustrate it on the example of the Heisenberg double of the $Uq (gl(1|1))$ Hopf algebra for q being a root of unity. In addition, we generalise an isomorphism between the Drinfeld double and the loop algebra from the Alekseev-Schomerus combinatorial quantisation to the graded setting.</description>

      <title>Multiplicative partial isometries, manageability, and C*-algebraic quantum groupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.01995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2002.01995v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generalizing the notion of a multiplicative unitary (in the sense of Baaj-Skandalis), which plays a fundamental role in the theory of locally compact quantum groups, we develop in this paper the notion of a multiplicative partial isometry. The axioms include the pentagon equation, but more is needed. Under suitable conditions (such as the "manageability"), it is possible to construct from it a pair of C*-algebras having the structure of a C*-algebraic quantum groupoid of separable type.
  Generalizing the notion of a multiplicative unitary operator, which plays a fundamental role in the theory of locally compact quantum groups, we develop in this paper the notion of a multiplicative partial isometry. The axioms include the pentagon equation, but more is needed. Under the "manageability" condition on a multiplicative partial isometry (modified from the Woronowicz's condition for a multiplicative unitary), it is possible to construct from it a pair of C*-algebras having almost the structure of a C*-algebraic quantum groupoid of separable type.</description>

      <title>Bijective solutions to the Pentagon Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20406v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A complete classification of all finite bijective set-theoretic solutions $(S,s)$ to the Pentagon Equation is obtained. First, it is shown that every such solution determines a semigroup structure on the set $S$ that is the direct product $E\times G$ of a semigroup of left zeros $E$ and a group $G$. Next, we prove that this leads to a decomposition of the set $S$ as a Cartesian product $X\times A\times G$, for some sets $X,A$ and to the discovery of a hidden group structure on $A$. Then an unexpected structure of a matched product of groups $A,G$ is found such that the solution $(S,s)$ can be explicitly described as a lift of a solution determined on the set $A\times G$ by this matched product of groups. Conversely, every matched product of groups leads to a family of solutions arising in this way. Moreover, a simple criterion for the isomorphism of two solutions is obtained. These results significantly extend those of Colazzo, Jespers, and Kubat, in their treatment of the involutive case. Furthermore, connections to solutions to the Yang--Baxter Equation and to the theory of skew braces are uncovered. The latter motivate a further investigation of the relationship between solutions to the Yang--Baxter Equation and the Pentagon Equation at the set-theoretical level.</description>

      <title>Shuffle Products, Degenerate Affine Hecke Algebras, and Quantum Toda Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09520v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit an identification of the quantum Toda lattice for $\mathrm{GL}_N$ and the truncated shifted Yangian of $\mathfrak{sl}_2$, as well as related constructions, from a purely algebraic point of view, bypassing the topological medium of the homology of the affine Grassmannian. For instance, we interpret the Gerasimov-Kharchev-Lebedev-Oblezin homomorphism into the algebra of difference operators via a finite analog of the Miura transform. This algebraic identification is deduced by relating degenerate affine Hecke algebras to the simplest example of a rational Feigin-Odesskii shuffle product. As a bonus, we obtain a presentation of the latter via a mirabolic version of the Kostant-Whittaker reduction.</description>

      <title>Generalized Schur limit, modular differential equations and quantum monodromy traces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02102v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore some aspects of the generalized Schur limit, defined in arXiv:2506.13764. Based on several examples, we conjecture that the generalized Schur limit as a function of $\alpha$ solves a modular linear differential equation of fixed order, with coefficients depending on $\alpha$. We also observe in examples that for Argyres-Douglas theories of type $(A_1,G)$ with $G=A_n,D_n$, the generalized Schur limit for certain negative integer values of $\alpha$, coincides with the trace of higher powers of the quantum monodromy operator. This hints at a more general correspondence between the wall-crossing invariant traces on the Coulomb branch and the generalized Schur limit, which is related to the Higgs branch.</description>
