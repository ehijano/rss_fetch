      <title>Embeddings of mapping tori for end-periodic graph maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: End-periodic homotopy equivalences of infinite, locally finite graphs serve as dimension-one analogs of the end-periodic automorphisms traditionally defined on infinite-type surfaces. We demonstrate that if $\Gamma$ is an infinite graph with finitely many ends, and $g \colon \Gamma \to \Gamma$ is end-periodic, then its mapping torus $Z_g$ admits a flowline-preserving homotopy equivalence with a finite 2-complex. With additional hypotheses on $g$, this compactified mapping torus subsequently embeds in the mapping torus of a homotopy equivalence on a finite-rank graph via a $\pi_1$-injective, flow-preserving map. We prove that every mapping class of $\Gamma$ arising from an end-periodic homotopy equivalence contains a representative whose mapping torus realizes such an embedding.</description>

      <title>3-manifolds with universal links are spherical</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine which orientable 3-manifolds are dominated by the 3-sphere. This characterization implies that the closed 3-manifolds that admit a universal link are spherical. Moreover, we show examples of complement universal links that are not universal.</description>

      <title>Local indicability in the presence of diagrammatic reducibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If a complex $X$ is a subcomplex of a diagrammatically reducible 2-complex $Y$ that has locally indicable fundamental group, then $X$ has locally indicable fundamental group. This is a consequence of the Corson-Trace characterization of diagrammatic reducibility. In this paper we use a Corson-Trace like characterization of diagrammatic reducibility away from a subcomplex to obtain a considerable stronger result. We apply this to the question of local indicability in the context of Whitehead's asphericity conjecture. We show that an injective labeled oriented tree (LOT) that is diagrammatically reducible of degree 2, and all its quotients are as well, is locally indicable.</description>

      <title>Aspherical 4-manifolds with positive Euler characteristic and their geography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an explicit construction of closed oriented aspherical smooth 4-manifolds with $\chi = \sigma = n$ for every positive integer $n$. This proves a conjecture of Edmonds by providing a closed oriented aspherical 4-manifold with Euler characteristic 1, and it shows that the real analogue of the Bogomolov-Miyaoka-Yau inequality fails for aspherical 4-manifolds. By the Hitchin-Thorpe inequality, these manifolds do not admit Einstein metrics. As a further consequence of our construction, we show that every closed aspherical 3-manifold with amenable fundamental group is virtually the $\pi_1$-injective boundary of an aspherical 4-manifold with vanishing Euler characteristic and vanishing simplicial volume, thereby answering questions of Edmonds and of L\"oh-Moraschini-Raptis up to finite covers.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Dehn Twists in the Outer Automorphism Group of a Free Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Dehn twists in the outer automorphism group of a finitely generated non-abelian free group. Our main result states that, under certain compatibility conditions, sufficiently large powers of finitely many Dehn twists generate a right-angled Artin group. The proof proceeds by analyzing the geometry of spheres, tori, and simple closed curves in a doubled handlebody. Along the way, we establish the bigon--bihedron criterion and an equivalent condition for commuting Dehn twists. Furthermore, we construct a compact topological space on which every Dehn twist acts parabolically.</description>

      <title>Shapes of surfaces that contain a great and a small circle through each point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.14438v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We classify the topological types of surfaces in the 3-dimensional unit sphere that contain both a great and a small circle through each point. In particular, these surfaces are homeomorphic to one of five normal forms and are either the pointwise product of circles in the unit quaternions or contain five concurrent circles. We classify the real singular loci of such surfaces and characterize how circles in the surface meet the self-intersection locus.</description>

      <title>Graphically discrete groups and rigidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.04843v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of graphical discreteness to group theory. A finitely generated group is graphically discrete if whenever it acts geometrically on a locally finite graph, the automorphism group of the graph is compact-by-discrete. Notable examples include finitely generated nilpotent groups, most lattices in semisimple Lie groups, and irreducible non-geometric 3-manifold groups. We show graphs of groups with graphically discrete vertex groups frequently have strong rigidity properties. We prove free products of one-ended virtually torsion-free graphically discrete groups are action rigid within the class of virtually torsion-free groups. We also prove quasi-isometric rigidity for many hyperbolic graphs of groups whose vertex groups are closed hyperbolic manifold groups and whose edge groups are non-elementary quasi-convex subgroups. This includes the case of two hyperbolic 3-manifold groups amalgamated along a quasi-convex malnormal non-abelian free subgroup. We provide several additional examples of graphically discrete groups and illustrate this property is not a commensurability invariant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01140v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a relative version of Gromov's Vanishing Theorem in the presence of amenable open covers with small multiplicity, extending a result of Li, L\"oh, and Moraschini. Our approach relies on Gromov's theory of multicomplexes.</description>
