      <title>Calibration-independent consistency test of BAO and SNIa data: update</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent paper, arXiv:2509.19899, we presented a new method to test the consistency between uncalibrated BAO and SNIa data through a common parameter, the Alcock-Paczynski variable. Using Gaussian Processes, we can determine if various datasets are consistent, independently of dark energy or modified gravity models, and of the sound horizon and SNIa peak magnitude. We found that the DES-Y5 SNIa data showed non-negligible tension with other datasets. However, the recent update DES-Dovekie removes this tension. We find that all uncalibrated data from DESI DR2 BAO and three SNIa datasets, Union3, Pantheon+, and DES-Dovekie, are consistent with each other within $\sim 1\sigma$.</description>

      <title>A shot in the dark: searching for dark substructures in the RX J0437+00 galaxy cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Obtaining a census of dark matter structures at low mass ($\leq 10^9 M_\odot$) can provide strong constraints on the nature of dark matter, though identifying such structures remains difficult. In this work, we study the galaxy cluster RX J0437.1+0043, taking advantage of its powerful "exotic" Hyperbolic-Umbilic (HU) lensing configuration to search for substructure candidates. Using a combination of high resolution imaging, IFU spectroscopy, and gravitational lensing modelling, we report on a tentative detection of a dark matter subhalo ($m_{\rm halo} = 2.25 \pm 0.94 \times 10^9 M_\odot$) near the vicinity of one of the largest HU images. We stress that this result is still preliminary and that deeper data and more advanced modelling techniques are needed to ultimately confirm this detection. Nevertheless, this work outlines the first steps towards understanding subhalo properties in dense cluster environments, developing HU cluster lenses as a potential new tool for investigating dark matter.</description>

      <title>TORRCH: Tomographic reconstruction of the reionization of cosmic hydrogen with Ly${\alpha}$ emitters and non-Ly${\alpha}$-selected galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tomographic reconstruction of reionization is a long-sought goal. It would move the field beyond global summary statistics, such as the volume-averaged ionised fraction, to direct, field-level constraints on the ionization topology. With this in mind, we present TORRCH (TOmographic Reconstruction of the Reionization of Cosmic Hydrogen), a deep-learning framework that reconstructs the neutral-hydrogen fraction field during the epoch of reionization from the spatial distributions of Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) and non-Ly$\alpha$-selected galaxies (NLSGs) at luminosity limits comparable to current surveys. Using hydrodynamical simulations post-processed with radiative transfer, we train a deterministic 3D U-Net on mock surveys spanning diverse reionization scenarios and predict the neutral-fraction field. We find that TORRCH recovers the large-scale ionization morphology from synthetic data comparable to current surveys with high fidelity, and reproduces both the one-point distribution and the 2D power spectrum of projected neutral fractions. The predicted galaxy-IGM cross-correlation is also captured well, including the expected small-scale anti-correlation and its decline towards zero at large separations. Reconstruction quality depends on tracer completeness, with deep joint LAE+NLSG samples yielding the most accurate morphology, while LAE-only selections retain bubble-scale topology but with reduced fidelity. Robustness tests show that the method is stable to variations in ionization conditions between training and test data, and to realistic redshift uncertainties. Our results suggest that galaxy-based tomography can potentially deliver reliable reionization maps across realistic survey redshift windows.</description>

      <title>Relaxing DESI DR2 BAO Constraints on $\sum m_\nu$ with Planck and SPT-3G 2018 in the Context of SPT D1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present constraints on the sum of neutrino masses $\sum m_\nu$ from a dataset incorporating the full SPT-3G 2018 TT/TE/EE+lensing spectra together with Planck PR4 lensing and low-$\ell$ parts of the Planck PR3 spectra. Using it as a baseline for the DESI DR2 BAO measurements, we arrive at a $95\%$ upper limit of $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.11$ eV, relaxing the tension between $\rm \Lambda$CDM and lower bounds on $\sum m_\nu$ based on neutrino oscillation experiments. When including DES Y1 weak lensing information and the Pantheon+ SNIa catalog, the limit is further loosened to $\sum m_\nu&lt;0.138$ eV with a slight preference for $\sum m_\nu&gt;0$. On contrast, replacing SPT-3G 2018 primary CMB and lensing spectra with ones from the SPT-3G 2019-2020 (D1) release tightens the overall constraint to $&lt;0.082$ eV and pushes the $\sum m_\nu$ posterior mode value to zero, indicating a preference for quasi-negative neutrino masses in line with the D1 analysis. This is a curious shift within SPT-3G measurements of the same field taken in 2018 and in 2019-2020 and processed with different analysis pipelines.</description>

      <title>MeerKAT observations of Abell 1775 and Abell 1795: the discovery of a hadronic radio halo?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Giant radio haloes are diffuse synchrotron sources typically found in merging galaxy clusters, while smaller mini-haloes occur in cool-core clusters. Both trace cosmic-ray electrons in the intracluster medium, though recent observations suggest their distinction is not always clear. We present new 903-1655 MHz MeerKAT observations of Abell 1775 and Abell 1795, both hosting cool cores and cold fronts. Combined with reprocessed 120-168 MHz LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey data, we perform imaging and spectral analyses of their radio emission. In both clusters, we detect radio haloes with distinct inner and outer components. In Abell 1775, the halo appears diffuse at 1.3 GHz, while LOFAR images reveal steep-spectrum filaments. In Abell 1795, the inner component corresponds to a previously reported mini-halo candidate, but the full structure extends to $\sim$1 Mpc with a spectral index of $\alpha=-1.08\pm0.06$. The presence of such a large, flat-spectrum halo in a dynamically relaxed cluster makes Abell 1795 an outlier relative to typical merging systems. This suggests that some relaxed clusters may still retain sufficient turbulence to sustain particle re-acceleration, or that hadronic interactions producing secondary electrons play a significant role. Together with other recent discoveries in cool-core systems, our results indicate that some large radio haloes may have been overlooked in past studies due to limited dynamic range near bright central AGN. Finally, we detect steep-spectrum emission south of Abell 1795's central AGN, tracing a 45 kpc X-ray and optical filament that terminates in an X-ray cavity, likely linked to a past AGN outburst.</description>

      <title>Unifying cluster and galaxy cosmology analyses using the galaxy-halo connection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxies and galaxy clusters trace the same cosmic density field, but their statistics have been modeled separately in cosmological analyses. We present a unified, simulation-based framework to model them using the galaxy-halo connection. Our analysis includes cluster lensing, galaxy clustering, and galaxy-cluster cross-correlation. We validate our method on the FLAMINGO hydrodynamic simulation. Relative to the cluster-only approach, combining these probes improves the $\sigma_8-\Omega_m$ figure of merit by a factor of 15. Our framework enables stringent tests of cosmological models and exploits small-scale information.</description>

      <title>XMM-Newton observations of ten high-redshift CAMIRA clusters of galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results from XMM-Newton observations of ten high-redshift ($0.81 &lt; z &lt; 1.17$) galaxy clusters selected from the CAMIRA catalog based on high richness ($N &gt; 40$). These massive clusters, identified in the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program field, provide an ideal sample for probing the dynamical state of the intracluster medium (ICM) in the early Universe. We performed uniform X-ray imaging and spectral analyses to measure the ICM temperature and bolometric luminosity, and investigated cluster morphology through offsets between the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) and the X-ray peak. Extended X-ray emission was detected from all targets, but only one system was classified as dynamically relaxed, indicating a low relaxed fraction ($\sim 10\%$) at high redshift. By combining this high-$z$ sample with a lower-redshift CAMIRA cluster sample, we derived scaling relations among richness, temperature, luminosity, and mass. The results are broadly consistent with predictions from both the self-similar model and the baseline model incorporating the mass--concentration relation. We find no significant redshift evolution, strengthening the view that cluster scaling relations are largely established by $z \sim 1$. We also examined the AGN fraction among member galaxies and found significantly higher AGN activity in high-redshift clusters, particularly in the outskirts, suggesting enhanced AGN triggering during early cluster assembly and a possible connection to the thermodynamic state of dynamically young clusters. These findings provide new insights into the formation and evolution of massive clusters and the thermodynamic history of the ICM, and complement large-area X-ray surveys such as eROSITA.</description>

      <title>Unveiling a Thin Filament of the Cosmic Web in the Ursa Major Supergroup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Filaments are crucial components of the cosmic web, representing the extensive and aligned distributions of galaxies and gas. Using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), we report the detection of a filament in the Ursa Major supergroup using atomic-hydrogen (HI) observations. This filament consists of sixteen various types of galaxies and five starless gas clumps, spanning a length of approximately 0.9 Mpc. Notably, it is extremely thin, with a thickness comparable to the diameter of a galaxy. We observed a galaxy-filament spin alignment and a velocity gradient within the filament. These findings strongly suggest a cold accretion flow along the filament, potentially contributing to the formation and growth of the galaxies. The thin filament, as a small group, is likely to be merged into the Ursa Major supergroup in the context of hierarchical structure formation.</description>

      <title>Cosmological analysis of a viable $f(R)$ gravity model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since viable $f(R)$ gravity models must reconcile early-universe inflation with late-time acceleration, we specifically study the dynamical behavior of such a theory during the matter-dominated to dark-energy-dominated transition epoch. By using $y_{H}(z)$ versus $z$ and the Hubble parameter, we solved the field equations. After appropriately choosing appropriate parameter values , we plotted a series of images. We mentioned that their current values are similar to latest observations data and $\Lambda$CDM-model values. Furthermore, we plotted the fitting of the distance modulus about this model using SN Ia observation data. Therefore we find that the $f(R)$ gravity model is consistent with the SN Ia data, meanwhile, explains the late-stage acceleration of the Universe. Finally, we used various diagnostic tools including $( r, s)$, $( r, q)$, $w_{D}-w'_{D}$ plane, growth rate analysis, statefinder hierarchy and $Om(z)$-diagnostic to evaluate the observational viability of our model, we perform a systematic comparison with the standard $\Lambda$CDM. We found that evolutionary images can be clearly distinguished this model from the $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <title>One H2 molecule per ten million H-atoms reveals sub-pc scale cold overdensities at z~4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the detection and analysis of H2 absorption at z = 4.24 towards the bright quasar J0007-5705, observed with the Very Large Telescope as part of the ESPRESSO QUasar Absorption Line Survey (EQUALS). The high resolving power, R~120000, enables the identification of extremely weak H2 lines in several rotational levels at a total column density of N(H2)~2x10^14 cm^-2, among the lowest ever measured in quasar absorption systems. Remarkably, this constitutes the highest-redshift H2 detection to date. Two velocity components are resolved, separated by only 3 km/s: a narrow (b~1.7 km/s) and a broader (b~6.2 km/s) component. Modelling the rotational population of H2 yields density of log nH/cm^-3 ~ 2.8 with temperature of ~40K (typical of the cold neutral medium) for the narrow component and log nH/cm^-3 ~ 1.4 , T~600K for the warmer, more turbulent component under a moderate ultraviolet (UV) field, suggesting at least several Mpc distance from the quasar. This system reveals the existence of tiny (down to ~0.01 pc), cold overdensities in the neutral medium. Their detection among only 7 damped Lyman-alpha systems in EQUALS suggests that they may be widespread yet usually remain undetected. H2 provides an exceptionally sensitive probe of these structures: even a minute molecular fraction produces measurable Lyman-Werner absorption lines along the extremely narrow optical beam -- the size of the quasar's accretion disc -- when observed at sufficiently high spectral resolution. High-resolution spectroscopy on extremely large telescopes may routinely detect and resolve such structures in the distant Universe, when 21-cm absorption will trace the collective contribution of many cold cloudlets toward larger radio background sources.</description>

      <title>When Primordial Black Holes Absorb During the Early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the evolution of primordial black holes (PBHs) formed in the early universe in the presence of a surrounding thermal bath. By incorporating the effects of thermal absorption, we show that PBHs can undergo significant mass growth, leading to extended lifetimes and substantial deviations from the standard Hawking evaporation scenario. We find a critical collapse efficiency, $\gamma_{\rm c} \simeq 0.395$, above which the PBH mass grows without bound. This correction has profound implications for both PBH-induced reheating and dark matter (DM) production. Specifically, we find that the reheating temperature can be suppressed, and the DM parameter space for the PBH reheating scenario can undergo $\mathcal{O}(10)$-$\mathcal{O}(10^4)$ corrections, depending on the PBH formation mass and collapse efficiency. Moreover, our results significantly shift the parameter space in which PBHs can account for the entirety of the DM. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive phenomenological study to incorporate thermal absorption into PBH evolution and quantify its impact on cosmological observables.</description>

      <title>Flux-ratio anomalies in cusp quasars reveal dark matter beyond CDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strongly lensed quasars in cusp configurations provide a uniquely sensitive probe of small-scale dark matter structure. Using the largest microlensing-free flux ratios for 17 quadruply imaged cusps, we combine these with extensive Monte Carlo simulations of mock lens realizations under cold dark matter (CDM), self-interacting dark matter (SIDM), and fuzzy dark matter (FDM) scenarios. Building on this, we propose a region (minor-axis and narrow major-axis cusp lenses) where flux-ratio anomalies persist even under globally parameterized models ("macromodels") with multipole freedom (capturing disk, asymmetric, or merger-driven structures). Within this region, J1042+1641 is $&gt;3\sigma$ incompatible with both CDM and SIDM. Our results yield a Bayes factor exceeding $100$, providing very strong evidence for FDM over even the most optimistic CDM and SIDM scenarios. As only 11 cusp lenses lie within this region, extending to larger samples will be essential for assessing its statistical generality and for decisively confirming these findings with future microlensing-free flux ratio data.</description>

      <title>Cosmography with $\Lambda$-Szekeres Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cosmological tensions present in the $\Lambda$ cold dark matter model that have emerged and strengthened over recent years motivate model independent approaches to analysing data. Cosmography is useful for interpreting data in cosmology without imposing assumptions about the field equations of gravity or the matter content in the Universe. Some cosmography methods, denoted covariant cosmography, go even further and stay agnostic to the underlying space-time metric. Due to their high level of generality, covariant cosmography methods can incorporate the anisotropies and inhomogeneities in the observer's vicinity, and may in turn inform about the associated curvature of the relevant structures in our cosmic neighbourhood. Thus, covariant cosmography is a powerful model-independent tool for analysing cosmological data while also enabling the mapping of our local cosmic neighbourhood. In order to be able to explore the covariant cosmography framework to its fullest, it must be tested in tractable models and simulations. In this paper we derive the cosmography of luminosity distance to fourth order in redshift and investigate it in the special case of axially symmetric Szekeres models. We compare the numerical results for the distance-redshift relations of synthetic observers placed within the Szekeres structures with the predictions from the cosmography, and comment on the found level of approximation of the cosmography in relation to other results in the litterature.</description>

      <title>A more inclusive effective dark fluid equation of state parameter: constraints from SKA and Euclid like surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We forecast constraints on an effective dark fluid equation of state parameter $w_{\rm eff}$ that encapsulates modified gravity theories that modifies both the Universe background expansion as well as its large scale structures growth. This is achieved through relating Friedmann equations' dark fluid pressure and density content, thus $w_{\rm eff}$, to modified gravity parameterized models by mean of the Newtonian potential equation parameter $\mu_0$, the gravitational slip parameter $\eta_0$ and a redshift dependent Hubble parameter $H_{0,{\rm bck}}$. We adopt next stage SKA survey specifications, alone or in combination with concurrently expected DR3 Euclid survey release, paying attention to the modeling and recipe of the implementation of the galaxy clustering and lensing probes obtained from the two surveys. We consider two data mock models: one with deviation of the intermediate parameters at the level of 10 \% (yielding however $w_{\rm eff}=-1.03$) and another sub-percently close to $\Lambda$CDM. We found that the three parameters deviation from $\Lambda$CDM could only be detected at 1 $\sigma$ from SKA alone, while this improves to $\sim$ 2 $\sigma$ when we combine with Euclid. An improvement of the order of 30\% on the bounds is reached after projecting the three parameters into a single $w_{\rm eff}$ parameter. However, this affects both cases and thus it does not change much, though it improves the level of detection with respect to $\Lambda$CDM values. We conclude that synergy from both surveys benefits to tighten our constraints, but also that our highly generalized parameterization, although impacting at both the background and the perturbation level, will be hard to disentangle from $\Lambda$CDM at the level at which our forecast is performed and it still needs, to the least, data from more advanced stages of the adopted surveys to hope reach this target.</description>

      <title>The shape function of the observed growth index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growth index $\gamma$ is a powerful trigger for detecting deviations from $\Lambda$CDM. However, its value is often determined by considering an asymptotic constant value that works for all redshift, or else following a chosen parameterisation. Here we formulate the growth index as function of three quantities that could be directly related to observables in redshift bins, $f\sigma_8(z_i)$, $f(z_i)$ and $H(z_i)$. We determine its value and its derivative at observed nodal center of redshift bins and use the shape function method, after showing insightful connection with its underlying governing virtual-work conservation principle, to construct a redshift dependence of the $\gamma$ without assuming a specific parameterization. We then use the resulting shape function to test if we can disentangle between different scenarios where there are discrepancies between its three constituent measured components. We also tested whether it can be used to rule out models of modified gravity, or extended parametric models of the growth index that capture more general behaviors with an additional parameter as function of the scale factor or dark energy. Adopting forecasted measurements from next generation surveys on the three quantities used to construct $\gamma$, we find that reported discrepancies between them could be detected with our method, but at the bins where the errors and lost of precision from our addition of degrees of freedom is small with respect to the deviation of $\gamma$. The same could be concluded for first order extensions to $\gamma$ or common modified gravity models, and to a lesser degree for dynamical dark energy models after supposing the latest DESI values. We conclude that this method is a strong tool to investigate cosmology in a model-independent way especially with forthcoming data delivered by further stage-IV surveys with more stringent uncertainties.(Abridged)</description>

      <title>Forecast on the generalised dark matter properties from a Euclid-like survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Stage~IV \textit{Euclid} mission will deliver spectroscopic galaxy redshifts together with photometric positions and shapes, enabling cosmological analyses through spectroscopic galaxy clustering (GCsp), photometric galaxy clustering (GCph), weak-lensing cosmic shear (WL), and their cross-correlation (XC). In this work we forecast the constraining power of a Euclid-like survey on the Generalised Dark Matter (GDM) parameters \(w_{\rm gdm}\) and \(c^{2}_{s,{\rm gdm}}\). Our analysis extends previous forecasting pipeline used for standard cold dark matter. For GCsp, we adopt a semi-analytic nonlinear RSD model, with free terms for each bin. For the photometric probes, we compute the nonlinear GDM matter power spectrum using dedicated simulations, and we modify the lensing and clustering window and the intrinsic-alignment prescription. We consider several survey configurations and explore three fiducial values of \(\sigma_8\) motivated by current CMB and low-redshift measurements. In an optimistic setting, for fiducial values \(\sigma_8 \simeq 0.81\) and \(\sigma_8 \simeq 0.77\), we find relative errors of \(4.01\%\) (GCsp), \(5.01\%\) (GCph+WL+XC), and \(1.96\%\) (all probes) on \(c^{2}_{s,{\rm gdm}}\), and \(3.26\%\) (GCph+WL+XC) and \(1.85\%\) (all probes) on \(w_{\rm gdm}\). For a lower fiducial value \(\sigma_8 \simeq 0.67\), that could strongly disfavor $\Lambda$GDM, we find constraints of \(5\%\) (GCsp), \(5\%\) (GCph+WL+XC), and \(2.45\%\) (all probes) on \(c^{2}_{s,{\rm gdm}}\), and \(3.43\%\) (GCph+WL+XC) and \(2.04\%\) (all probes) on \(w_{\rm gdm}\). We also found that, combining all probes, whether in the pessimistic or optimistic settings, a Euclid-like survey will be able to disentangle between the three scenarios. These results show that the survey will be able to constrain the GDM parameters and distinguish between normalisations of the matter fluctuations.(Abridged)</description>

      <title>Improving constraints on primordial non-Gaussianity from Quaia with a new cosmological observable: angular redshift fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Angular redshift fluctuations (ARF) are a new cosmological observable, recently proposed in the literature. It measures the 2D angular deviations of the average redshift of a given matter tracer under an input redshift shell. Since it depends on the galaxy bias, it can be used to constrain primordial non-Gaussianity through the scale-dependent bias effect. We analyze a sample of quasars built upon the Gaia satellite and unWISE data, Quaia, to measure the local non-Gaussianity parameter $f_{\rm NL}$. This sample is particularly suitable for measuring $f_{\rm NL}$ due to its large volume coverage. We measure the ARF power spectra from the Quaia catalog and combine their information with the 2D (projected) galaxy density and their cross-correlation with the $Planck$ PR4 CMB lensing maps lensing to jointly constrain $f_{\rm NL}$. Assuming the universality relation, we measure $f_{\rm NL} = -3 \pm 14$ at 68% confidence level by combining Quaia quasar angular density and ARF with the CMB lensing. This result is the second tightest constraint on $f_{\rm NL}$ using LSS two-point statistics to date and the best measurement achieved using two-point projected summary statistics, improving by $\sim$25% the previous measurement from Quaia. Our results motivate the inclusion of ARF as an additional cosmological observable in future 2D analysis of upcoming datasets from large surveys.</description>

      <title>Calibrating redshift distributions at $z&gt;2$ with Lyman-$\alpha$ forest cross-correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the feasibility of using Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) forests to calibrate the ensemble redshift distribution of the high-redshift tail ($2&lt;z&lt;3$) of photometric galaxies. We use \texttt{CoLoRe} simulations to create mock DESI 5-year Ly$\alpha$ forests and Rubin Observatory LSST 10-year photometric galaxies up to $z=3$, and measure the galaxy redshift distribution via their angular cross-correlations. Due to large redshift-space distortions in the Ly$\alpha$ forest, the conventional $n(z)$ estimator for clustering redshifts does not apply, and we develope a theoretical framework to model the angular cross-correlation directly. Using the simulations, we explore effects of instrumental noise, continuum fitting, and contamination in the Ly$\alpha$ forest, cross-correlation angular scales ($\theta$), and redshift bin size ($\Delta z$) on the signal-to-noise (SNR) of the measurements. We find that continuum fitting methods strongly impact the SNR of the measurements. With our baseline continuum fitting method, \texttt{LyCAN}, at angular scales $\theta\sim10$ arcmin and $\Delta z=0.1$, we measure the cross-correlation signal at $24\sigma$. If the shape of the redshift distribution and galaxy bias evolution are known well for $z&lt;2$, the cross-correlation can constrain the mean redshift of the galaxy sample to $\sigma_z/(1+\bar{z}) = 0.006$ at a mean redshift of $\bar{z}=2$. This demonstrates that Ly$\alpha$ cross-correlation is a reliable and promising method to calibrate the high-redshift tails of photometric Stage IV galaxy surveys.</description>

      <title>Probing dark matter interactions with a RES-NOVA prototype cryogenic detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the operation of a 13 g PbWO$_4$ crystal, grown from archaeological Pb and operated as a cryogenic calorimeter in an underground environment. Read out with a Ge thermistor, the detector achieves a low energy threshold and, for the first time, enables the derivation of a dark matter exclusion limit using PbWO$_4$ as target material, for both spin-dependent interactions on neutrons and spin-independent interactions. Although limited in mass and not representative of the final RES-NOVA detector design, this prototype demonstrates effective control of mechanical vibrations and low-energy noise in a cryogenic system, which is a key requirement for rare-event searches. The experiment therefore provides a proof of principle for the RES-NOVA detection concept, validating the use of archaeological Pb-based PbWO$_4$ crystals, low-background operation, and robust data-analysis procedures. These results establish a solid technological and methodological foundation for future RES-NOVA detectors employing larger target masses and advanced thermal readout technologies.</description>

      <title>Searching for Ultralight Scalar Dark Matter with Clocks in Low Earth Orbit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The density of ultralight dark matter can be modified in the vicinity of macroscopic bodies when the dark matter possesses quadratic couplings to the Standard Model. If these couplings are sufficiently strong, Earth's atmosphere acts to shield the dark matter, thereby limiting the effectiveness of laboratory-based experiments. Experiments performed at altitudes exceeding the dark matter de Broglie wavelength experience the same orbit-averaged field amplitude as in the absence of scattering. Quantum clocks are capable of detecting variations in fundamental parameters due to the dark matter background. If based on the International Space Station, they are therefore well-suited to probe dark matter masses $m_{\rm DM}\gtrsim 10^{-9} \text{\, eV}$. Moreover, when the dark matter de Broglie wavelength is smaller than Earth's radius ($m_{\rm DM} \gtrsim 10^{-10}$ eV), the dark matter profile around Earth exhibits a dipole feature. In Low Earth Orbits this dipole temporally modulates potential dark matter signals. This provides a powerful cross-check of the orbit-averaged effect and can enhance the sensitivity of these experiments. We find optical clocks could give rise to world-leading constraints in some cases. Orbiting nuclear clocks could probe even more of the parameter space inaccessible to ground-based experiments.</description>

      <title>Analysis of $M1$ capture in the $\alpha(d,\gamma)^6$Li reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An effective operator is exactly equivalent to the long-wavelength form of the $M1$ operator in transition matrix elements. It allows us to analytically and numerically analyze the $M1$ contribution to the $\alpha(d,\gamma)^6$Li reaction. Isoscalar $M1$ transitions from an initial $S$ wave are shown to be forbidden in radiative capture reactions when distortion is neglected in the initial state. A calculation in a three-body model with proton, neutron, and a structureless $\alpha$ interacting through effective forces leads to a negligible $M1$ $S$-factor at small energies. The dominant $M1$ contribution comes from transitions from an initial $S$ wave to isospin 1 components of the $^6$Li ground state. It is suggested that using this effective $M1$ operator in other models should clarify the origin of large discrepancies between $M1$ $S$-factors appearing in the literature.</description>

      <title>Illuminating the Physics of Cosmic Origin and Evolution: A UK Space Frontiers 2035 White Paper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the Universe's origins and evolution remains one of the most fundamental challenges in modern cosmology. This white paper explores three key science priorities in this field: unravelling the physics of cosmic inflation, investigating the accelerating expansion of the Universe, and precisely measuring the sum of the neutrino masses. Achieving these goals requires a dedicated survey to map the large-scale structure at high redshift in unprecedented detail. We describe how this can be achieved through a mission concept called SIRMOS, providing a high-throughput, highly multiplexed spectroscopic capability to obtain accurate redshifts for over 100 million galaxies over a wide sky area. Such a survey would leverage the deepest existing wide-area photometric catalogues for targeting, with spectra offering continuous 1.25-2.5~$\mu$m wavelength coverage at moderate resolution, allowing precise redshift measurements in the $1&lt;z&lt;4$ range with minimal bias. We outline the scientific opportunities this presents. Recent years have seen significant advances in instrumentation, including digital micromirror devices, complex telescope mirrors, large detector arrays, and data processing pipelines. While these technologies have been demonstrated in terrestrial applications, such a survey is a unique opportunity to apply these proven capabilities in space to address fundamental questions in cosmology. Participation in such a mission will simultaneously deliver a compelling science case, help align UK Space Agency and STFC strategies, demonstrate the UK's growing capability in end-to-end space missions, and strengthen the national space economy through high-value industrial participation.</description>

      <title>Improved measurements of the age of JWST galaxies at z=6-10</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.16772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) surveys, 31 galaxies with average redshift 7.3 are selected containing large Balmer break, Lyman-$\alpha$ break (V-shaped SED versus $\lambda$). Apart from Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and JWST-NIRCam (Near-infrared camera) photometry for these galaxies, there are JWST-NIRSpec (Near-infrared spectrograph) spectra for 13 galaxies and mid-infrared photometry (mostly JWST-MIRI) for 15 of them. Spectroscopical analyses included Balmer emission lines, Balmer + 4000 angstroms breaks or CaII lines. Spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting with photometry include old and young stellar populations, emission lines associated to HII regions, AGN, interstellar dust extinction and intergalactic extinction from neutral hydrogen. By adopting realistic extinction curves and taking into account the V-shaped SED and low emission at near infrared at rest, the analyses show that AGN contribution in these galaxies ('little red dots' most of them) should be small on average in the reddest wavelengths, though important for few of the 31 galaxies. Average age of the 31 galaxies: $0.61\pm 0.31$(95% CL) Gyr, while the average age of the $\Lambda $CDM universe is 0.70 Gyr. This corresponds to a formation epoch $z_{ form.}&gt;11.2$(97.5% CL). Reddest galaxies present largest ages. One of these very red galaxies gets an age incompatible to be younger than the age of the Universe within $&gt;4.7\sigma$. TP-AGB effect cannot explain this tension. None the less, there may be other uncertainties in the models, so this tension is a provisional result and further research is needed to confirm it.</description>

      <title>Extragalactic Planetary Nebulae (xPNe). Determining Distances out to 100 Mpc and the Renaissance of the PN Luminosity Function Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discrepancy of the Hubble parameter H0 as measured from the cosmic microwave background versus that found from traditional distance ladder measurements has produced considerable discussion about the need for another force in cosmology. However the significance of the discrepancy depends on understanding the systematic associated with crowding, metallicity effects, and extinction of the stellar tracers. Thus additional precision distance indicators in the local universe are desperately needed for investigating the H0 tension. The analysis of MUSE archival data makes the case that the Planetary Nebula Luminosity Function (PNLF) has become such an indicator, as the method can reach distances comparable to HST distances of Cepheid at a fraction of a cost, in terms of telescope time and ground-based. With new wide-field spectroscopic facilities it becomes possible to measure distances to early-type galaxies (ETGs) using the PNLF out to 100 Mpc distance, achieving a precise estimate for the H0 value which is independent of the Type Ia supernova calibration, with only single-epoch measurements.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of AGN feedback in the X-ray bright East and Southwest arms of M87, mapped by XRISM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the central galaxy in the nearest cluster, M87 provides the best spatial resolution for disentangling the complex interactions between AGN jets and the surrounding environment. We investigate the velocity structure of the multitemperature X-ray gas in M87, particularly in the eastern and southwestern arms associated with past AGN outbursts, using high-resolution spectroscopy from XRISM/Resolve. We analyze a mosaic of XRISM/Resolve observations covering the core of M87, fitting single- and multi-temperature models to spectra extracted from different regions and energy bands. We assess the line-of-sight velocities and velocity dispersions of the hotter ambient and cooler uplifted gas phases, and evaluate systematic uncertainties related to instrumental gain calibration. The hotter ICM phase, traced by Fe He-$\alpha$ emission, shows velocity dispersions below $\sim100$ km/s, and no significant velocity shifts between the arms and a relaxed offset region, suggesting limited dynamical impact from older AGN lobes. In contrast, the cooler gas phase appears to exhibit larger line of sight velocity gradients up to several hundred km/s as well as a higher velocity dispersion than the ambient hot phase, although these conclusions remain tentative pending improvements in the robustness of the gain calibration at lower energies. The first microcalorimeter-resolved map of gas dynamics in M87 supports the uplift scenario for the X-ray arms, with the cooler gas in the east and southwest seemingly moving in opposite directions along the line of sight. The kinetic energy is a small fraction of the gravitational potential energy associated with the gas uplift, and XRISM further suggests that AGN-driven motions may be short-lived in the hot ambient ICM. These constraints provide important input towards shaping future models of AGN feedback.</description>

      <title>Cosmic ray electron boosted light dark matter: Implications of LZ 2025 data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.16903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current multi-ton detectors put stringent constraints on the GeV-scale galactic dark matter, pushing the allowed cross-section almost towards the neutrino fog, yet remain mostly insensitive to the light dark matter. Cosmic rays can upscatter the non-relativistic halo dark matter particles, making a sub-population of them gain sufficient kinetic energy to be discernible in current direct search experiments. In this work, we explore this alternate strategy to probe sub-MeV electrophilic dark matter boosted by cosmic rays with the latest data of LZ 2025 (WS2024 run) and improve the constraint on the MeV scale dark matter by almost $\sim\mathcal{O}(1)$ compared to the previous XENONnT limit for energy-independent cross-section. Using realistic energy-dependent cross-sections, we also analyse such a scenario, where the associated mediator mass plays a crucial role in governing the event rate and hence the expected limits too. With energy-dependent cross-sections, our obtained limits also remain stronger than the existing constraints from current direct detection experiments. Even compared to the limits from the neutrino detectors with a larger target size, LZ 2025 can put stringent constraints in certain parameter space of the mediator, excluding the previously unexplored regions.</description>

      <title>CosmoSlider: An educational tool for cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how cosmological parameters influence the cosmic microwave background (CMB) power spectra is a central component of modern cosmology education, but interactive exploration is often limited by computational cost or technical complexity. We present CosmoSlider, a lightweight visualization tool that enables real-time exploration of CMB power spectra as multiple cosmological parameters are varied simultaneously. The tool employs a neural-network emulator implemented using TensorFlow Lite, allowing rapid evaluation of spectra without relying on large grids of precomputed models or on-demand execution of Einstein--Boltzmann solvers. CosmoSlider is available both as an iOS application and as a web-based tool, making it accessible across platforms and suitable for use in classrooms, lectures, and self-guided study. By providing immediate visual feedback, CosmoSlider supports the development of intuition for the physical processes underlying CMB anisotropies and serves as a complementary resource to traditional theoretical instruction.</description>

Abstract: In light of the recent results from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), which have provided a notable shift in the constraints on $(n_s, r)$ and placed several otherwise viable models of inflation in tension with the latest data, we investigate the possible effects that radiative corrections can have on $\xi$-attractor and $\alpha$-attractor models of inflation. These models, which share much in common with Starobinsky inflation, have likewise been put under pressure by these results. We find that percent (and even sub-percent) level radiative corrections can easily shift both of these classes of inflation models comfortably into the regions of parameter space favoured by the most recent constraints. However, the flexibility under such corrections calls into question to what extent it is possible to precisely pin down model-specific predictions for important cosmological observables.</description>

      <title>Eternal inflation near inflection points: a challenge to primordial black hole models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inflation with an inflection point potential is a popular model for producing primordial black holes. The potential near the inflection point is approximately flat, with a local maximum next to a local minimum, prone to eternal inflation. We show that a sufficient condition for eternal inflation is $\lambda_1 \leq 3$, where $\lambda_1$ is the index of the `exponential tail,' the lowest eigenvalue of the Fokker--Planck equation over a bounded region. We write $\lambda_1$ in terms of the model parameters for linear and quadratic regions. Wide quadratic regions inflate eternally if the second slow-roll parameter $\eta_V \geq -6$. We test example models from the literature and show this condition is satisfied; we argue eternal inflation is difficult to avoid in inflection point PBH models. Eternally inflating regions correspond to type II perturbations and form baby universes, hidden behind black hole horizons. These baby universes are inhomogeneous on large scales and dominate the multiverse's total volume. We argue that, if volume weighting is used, eternal inflation makes inflection point primordial black hole models incompatible with large-scale structure observations.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Constraints on Neutrino Masses in a Second-Order CPL Dark Energy Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16238v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent DESI results indicate a strong preference for dynamical dark energy (DE) when baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements are combined with supernovae (SNe) and cosmic microwave background (CMB) data using the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parameterization. We analyze the exponential (EXP) parameterization, which introduces a second-order correction to CPL. We determine and compare the 95% upper bounds on the sum of neutrino masses for three dark energy (DE) models -- $\Lambda$CDM, CPL, and EXP -- across four neutrino mass hierarchies (1 massive/2 massless, degenerate, normal, inverted) and multiple dataset combinations (CMB$+$BAO, CMB$+$BAO$+$PantheonPlus, CMB$+$BAO$+$DESY5), employing both Bayesian and frequentist frameworks with physical lower limits from oscillation experiments (0.059 eV and 0.11 eV). Our results show that CPL yields tighter ($\lesssim10$%) bounds compared to EXP. We further confirm earlier findings that neutrino mass constraints are only mildly sensitive to the assumed hierarchy and that the frequentist bounds are tighter than Bayesian ones. Furthermore, the imposed oscillation lower limits, the datasets used and the DE parameterizations play a crucial role in the inferred cosmological neutrino mass bounds. For the datasets, hierarchies, and DE parameterizations considered, we find no statistically significant evidence for nonzero neutrino mass consistent with oscillation lower limits.</description>

      <title>21 cm forest one-dimensional power spectrum as an indirect probe of dark matter particles and primordial black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the nature of dark matter (DM) particles remains a pivotal challenge in modern cosmology. Current cosmological research on these phenomena primarily utilizes cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations and other late-time probes, which predominantly focus on large scales. We introduce a novel probe, the 21 cm forest signal, which can be used to investigate DM properties on small scales during the epoch of reionization, thereby addressing the gap left by other cosmological probes. Annihilation and decay of DM particles, as well as Hawking radiation from PBHs, can heat the intergalactic medium (IGM). This heating suppresses the amplitude of the 21 cm forest 1D power spectrum. Therefore, the 1D power spectrum provides an effective method for constraining DM properties. However, astrophysical heating processes in the early universe can also affect the 21 cm forest 1D power spectrum. In this work, we assess the potential of using the SKA to observe the 21 cm forest 1D power spectrum for constraining DM properties, under the assumption that astrophysical heating can be constrained reliably by other independent probes. Under low astrophysical heating conditions, the 1D power spectrum could constrain the DM annihilation cross section and decay lifetime to $\langle\sigma v\rangle \sim {10^{-31}}\,{\rm cm^{3}\,s^{-1}}$ and $\tau \sim {10^{30}}\,{\rm s}$ for ${10}\,{\rm GeV}$ DM particles, and probe PBHs with masses $\sim {10^{15}}\,{\rm\,g}$ at abundances $f_{\mathrm{PBH}} \simeq 10^{-13}$. These constraints represent improvements of 5-6 orders of magnitude over current limits. Furthermore, the 21 cm forest 1D power spectrum has the potential to exceed existing bounds on sub-GeV DM and to probe PBHs with masses above $10^{18}\,{\rm g}$, which are otherwise inaccessible by conventional cosmological probes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08266v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the non-Gaussian features in the distribution of the matter power spectrum multipoles. Using the COVMOS method, we generate 100\,000 mock realisations of dark matter density fields in both real and redshift space across multiple redshifts and cosmological models. We derive an analytical framework linking the non-Gaussianity of the power spectrum distribution to higher-order statistics of the density field, including the trispectrum and pentaspectrum. We explore the effect of redshift-space distortions, the geometry of the survey, the Fourier binning, the integral constraint, and the shot noise on the skewness of the distribution of the power spectrum measurements. Our results demonstrate that the likelihood of the estimated matter power spectrum deviates significantly from a Gaussian assumption on nonlinear scales, particularly at low redshift. This departure is primarily driven by the pentaspectrum contribution, which dominates over the trispectrum at intermediate scales. We also examine the impact of the finiteness of the survey geometry in the context of the Euclid mission and find that both the shape of the survey and the integral constraint amplify the skewness.</description>

      <title>Photon rest mass from localized fast radio bursts with improved distribution of dispersion measure from extragalactic gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The assumption that photons are massless is a foundational postulate of modern physics, yet it remains subject to experimental verification. Fast radio bursts (FRBs), with their cosmological distances and precisely measured dispersion, offer an excellent laboratory for testing this hypothesis. In this work, we propose an improved distribution function for the dispersion measure arising from extragalactic gas and demonstrate that it provides an excellent fit to mock data. We then apply this distribution to constrain the photon rest mass under the $\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM, and $w_{0}w_{a}$CDM cosmological models, the last of which is favored by recent DESI baryon acoustic oscillation observations. The corresponding 1$\sigma$ upper limits on the photon mass are found to be $4.83\times10^{-51}\,\mathrm{kg}$, $4.71\times10^{-51}\,\mathrm{kg}$, and $4.86\times10^{-51}\,\mathrm{kg}$, respectively, which are the most stringent constraints derived from FRBs to date. These results indicate that the choice of cosmological model has only a minor impact on photon-mass bounds, demonstrate that FRBs provide robust and reliable constraints, and offer strong empirical support for the massless nature of the photon.</description>

      <title>Slow and fast collective neutrino oscillations: Invariants and reciprocity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.09650v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The flavor evolution of a neutrino gas can show ''slow'' or ''fast'' collective motion. In terms of the usual Bloch vectors to describe the mean-field density matrices of a homogeneous neutrino gas, the slow two-flavor equations of motion (EOMs) are $\dot{\mathbf{P}}_\omega=(\omega\mathbf{B}+\mu\mathbf{P})\times\mathbf{P}_\omega$, where $\omega=\Delta m^2/2E$, $\mu=\sqrt{2} G_{\mathrm{F}} (n_\nu+n_{\bar\nu})$, $\mathbf{B}$ is a unit vector in the mass direction in flavor space, and $\mathbf{P}=\int d\omega\,\mathbf{P}_\omega$. For an axisymmetric angle distribution, the fast EOMs are $\dot{\mathbf{D}}_v=\mu(\mathbf{D}_0-v\mathbf{D}_1)\times\mathbf{D}_v$, where $\mathbf{D}_v$ is the Bloch vector for lepton number, $v=\cos\theta$ is the velocity along the symmetry axis, $\mathbf{D}_0=\int dv\,\mathbf{D}_v$, and $\mathbf{D}_1=\int dv\,v\mathbf{D}_v$. We discuss similarities and differences between these generic cases. Both systems can have pendulum-like instabilities (soliton solutions), both have similar Gaudin invariants, and both are integrable in the classical and quantum case. Describing fast oscillations in a frame comoving with $\mathbf{D}_1$ (which itself may execute pendulum-like motions) leads to transformed EOMs that are equivalent to an abstract slow system. These conclusions carry over to three flavors.</description>

Abstract: We propose a novel experimental method for probing light dark matter candidates. We show that an electro-optical material's refractive index is modified in the presence of a coherently oscillating dark matter background. A high-precision resonant Michelson interferometer can be used to read out this signal. The proposed detection scheme allows for the exploration of an uncharted parameter space of dark matter candidates over a wide range of masses -- including masses exceeding a few tens of microelectronvolts, which is a challenging parameter space for microwave cavity haloscopes.</description>

      <title>LISA double white dwarf binaries as Galactic accelerometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Galactic double white dwarf (DWD) binaries are among the guaranteed sources for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), an upcoming space-based gravitational wave (GW) detector. Most DWDs in the LISA band are far from merging and emit quasimonochromatic GWs. As these sources are distributed throughout the Milky Way, they experience different accelerations in the Galactic gravitational potential, and therefore each DWD exhibits an apparent GW frequency chirp due to differential acceleration between the source and LISA. We examine how Galactic acceleration influences parameter estimation for these sources; and investigate how LISA observations could provide insight into the distribution of matter in the Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Density perturbations in nonminimally coupled gravity: symptoms of Lagrangian density ambiguity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The evolution of density perturbations is analysed in a modified theory of gravity with a nonminimal coupling between curvature and matter. We consider the broken degeneracy between the choices of matter Lagrangian for a perfect fluid, $\mathcal{L}_m=-\rho$ and $\mathcal{L}_m=p$, and determine the differences between their effects on the effective gravitational constant. We review the result for $\mathcal{L}_m=-\rho$ in the quasistatic approximation and show how it can lead to unphysical singular behaviour for late-time dominating models. This divergent regime can be avoided when considering the fully non-quasistatic perturbative equations, although the higher-order nature of the nonminimally coupled theory and the requirement of a physically viable effective gravitational constant strongly constrains the magnitude of these modifications to the action. We find that both of these issues can be removed when considering $\mathcal{L}_m=p$ at late times due to the pressureless nature of non-relativistic matter and provide predictions for inverse power-law models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07715v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We unveil the dynamical equivalence of field theories with non-canonical kinetic terms and canonical theories with a volume element invariant under transverse diffeomorphisms. The proof of the equivalence also reveals a subtle connection between the standard Legendre transformation and the so-called Clairaut equation. Explicit examples of canonizable theories include classes of $k$-essence, non-linear electrodynamics, or $f(R)$ theories. The equivalence can also be extended to the class of mimetic theories.</description>

      <title>Effects of dynamical capture on two equal-mass nonspinning black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19699v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamical captures of black holes are unique events that provide an exceptional opportunity to probe the strong-field regime of gravitational physics. In this article, we perform numerical relativity simulations to study the events of dynamical capture of two equal-mass nonspinning black holes. We consider a suite of scenarios within a range of initial linear momenta ($p/M=0.095-0.75$) and incidence angles ($\theta=6.36^\circ-2.83^\circ$), and study the emitted Weyl scalar ($\Psi_4$) of each case, as well as the spins and masses of the black holes before and after they merge. We provide a simple analytical model which accurately fits the gravitational-wave emission. We study the dependence of the time interval between the capture and the merger emissions with respect to the incidence angle, which can be well parametrized by a first-order divergent behavior, allowing us to find the angle that separates a scattering event from a dynamical capture. We also find that, in general, the parameters that model the first emission can be well described by linear or exponentially decaying functions in terms of the incidence angle, while others display more complex behaviors that offer valuable insights into the nature of these events.</description>

      <title>Potential divergence in tracing $\mu$ and $\tau$ flavors of astrophysical neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15127v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive general formulas for three flavor fractions $(\eta^{}_e , \eta^{}_\mu , \eta^{}_\tau)$ of the high-energy neutrinos originating from a remote astrophysical source by using their flavor ratios $(f^{}_e , f^{}_\mu , f^{}_\tau)$ observed at a neutrino telescope, and diagnose a potential divergence associated with $\eta^{}_\mu$ and $\eta^{}_\tau$ as an unavoidable consequence of the $\mu$-$\tau$ interchange symmetry exhibiting in the $3\times 3$ lepton flavor mixing matrix $U$. We present a complete set of analytical expressions for $(\eta^{}_e , \eta^{}_\mu , \eta^{}_\tau)$ as functions of two typical $\mu$-$\tau$ symmetry breaking parameters in the standard parametrization of $U$, and apply it to the recent IceCube all-sky neutrino flux data ranging from 5 TeV to 10 PeV in the assumption that the relevant sources have a common flavor composition. We also explain why only $\eta^{}_e$ and $\eta^{}_\mu + \eta^{}_\tau$ can be extracted from a precision measurement of $f^{}_e$ and $f^{}_\mu = f^{}_\tau$ in the exact $\mu$-$\tau$ flavor symmetry limit.</description>

      <title>JWST Confirmation of a Runaway Supermassive Black Hole via its Supersonic Bow Shock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04166v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present JWST/NIRSpec IFU observations of a candidate runaway supermassive black hole at the tip of a 62 kpc-long linear feature at z=0.96. The JWST data show a sharp kinematic discontinuity at the tip, with a radial velocity change of $\approx 600$ km/s across 0.1'' (1 kpc). The velocity gradient, together with the projected post-shock flow velocity of $\approx 300$ km/s, is well described by a simple shock-compression model of a supersonic object, with a velocity of $v_{BH} = 954^{+110}_{-126}$ km/s and an inclination $i=29^{+6}_{-3}$ deg. The previously puzzling kinematics along the linear feature, with the observed radial velocity decreasing from $\approx 300$ km/s near the tip to $\approx 100$ km/s closer to the former host galaxy, are naturally explained as gradual downstream mixing of shocked gas with the circumgalactic medium through turbulent entrainment. The bow shock interpretation is further supported by the morphology of the gas at the tip of the wake and an analysis of the [OIII]/H$\alpha$, [NII]/H$\alpha$, [SII]/H$\alpha$, and [SIII]/[SII] line ratios. The line ratios are consistent with fast radiative shocks and rapid cooling, with best-fit shock velocities that are in agreement with expectations from the black hole velocity and the shock geometry. Energy conservation over the lifetime of the wake suggests a SMBH mass of $M_{BH} \gtrsim 10^7$ M$_{\odot}$. These results confirm that the wake is powered by a supersonic runaway supermassive black hole, a long-predicted consequence of gravitational-wave recoil or multi-body ejection from galactic nuclei.</description>

      <title>GlueNN: gluing patchwise analytic solutions with neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05889v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the analysis of complex physical systems, the objective often extends beyond merely computing a numerical solution to capturing the precise crossover between different regimes and extracting parameters containing meaningful information. However, standard numerical solvers and conventional deep learning approaches, such as Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), typically operate as black boxes that output solution fields without disentangling the solution into its interpretable constituent parts. In this work, we propose GlueNN, a physics-informed learning framework that decomposes the global solution into interpretable, patchwise analytic components. Rather than approximating the solution directly, GlueNN promotes the integration constants of local asymptotic expansions to learnable, scale-dependent coefficient functions. By constraining these coefficients with the differential equation, the network effectively performs regime transition, smoothly interpolating between asymptotic limits without requiring ad hoc boundary matching. We demonstrate that this coefficient-centric approach reproduces accurate global solutions in various examples and thus directly extracts physical information that is not explicitly available through standard numerical integration.</description>

      <title>Exact general solutions for cosmological scalar field evolution in a vacuum-energy dominated expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15226v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive exact general solutions (as opposed to attractor particular solutions) for the evolution of a scalar field $\phi$ in a universe dominated by a background fluid with equation of state parameter $w_B = -1$, extending earlier work on exact solutions with $w_B &gt; -1$. Straightfoward exact solutions exist when the evolution is described by a linear differential equation, corresponding to constant, linear, and quadratic potentials. In the nonlinear case, exact solutions are derived for $V = V_0\ln \phi$, $V = V_0 \phi^{1/2}$ and $V = V_0/\phi$, and the logarithmic potential also yields an exact first integral. These complicated parametric solutions are considerably less useful than those derived previously for a universe dominated by a barotropic fluid such as matter or radiation with $w_B &gt; -1$. However, we generalize the slow-roll approximation and show that it applies to all sufficiently flat potentials in the case of a vacuum-dominated expansion, while it never applies when the universe is dominated by a background fluid with $w_B &gt; -1$.</description>

      <title>The FarView Low Frequency Radio Array on the Moon's Far Side: Science and Array Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16170v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: FarView is a proposed low frequency radio interferometer for deployment on the lunar far side, enabled by the Moon's radio quiet environment. Operating over 1-50 MHz inaccessible from Earth, FarView will open a new observational window and promote discovery class science in cosmology, heliophysics, Galactic and exoplanet astrophysics. The primary science is measurement of the redshifted 21 cm signal from the Cosmic Dark Ages (z=30-100), identified by the Astro2020 Decadal Survey as a priority cosmology discovery area. FarView will deliver 3D tomographic measurements and precision power spectra of neutral hydrogen in a largely linear regime, enabling tests of inflationary initial conditions, primordial non Gaussianity, dark matter properties, neutrino masses, and early dark energy. The reference design consists of 100000 crossed dipole antennas in a dense core-halo configuration spanning 200 sq km. A compact 4 km core with 83000 dipoles maximizes sensitivity to large scale cosmological modes, while 20000 halo elements extending to 14 km provide angular resolution and calibration for foreground characterization. Sensitivity forecasts indicate a 10-sigma detection of the Dark Ages 21 cm power spectrum at z=30 over five years of half duty cycle lunar night observations. An FFT-based EPIC beamformer is identified as an efficient signal processing architecture. Beyond cosmology, FarView will enable interferometric imaging of low frequency solar radio bursts, advancing space weather studies. Additional capabilities include stellar space weather observations, Galactic cosmic ray tomography via free-free absorption, and searches for auroral radio emission from exoplanet magnetospheres, a probe of exoplanet habitability. FarView represents a flagship class opportunity to establish the Moon as a platform for foundational astrophysics while delivering unique observational capabilities.</description>
