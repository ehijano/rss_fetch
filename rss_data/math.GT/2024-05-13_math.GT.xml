      <title>Left-orderability of Groups Acting on Bifoliated Planes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that any group acting faithfully on a bifoliated plane while preserving the orientations of both foliations is left-orderable. The proof utilizes a construction of a linear order on the set of ends of the leaf spaces, which takes advantage of the additional structure coming with a bifoliation. Moreover, we build an identification between ends of leaf spaces of the bifoliation and subsets of the boundary circle at infinity, and use it to give a condition for the equivalence between a faithful group action on a bifoliated plane and a faithful group action on the set of ends of the leaf spaces.</description>

      <title>Applications of the Painlev\'e-Kuratowski convergence: Lipschitz functions with converging Clarke subdifferentials and convergence of sets defined by converging equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we investigate two kinds of applications of the Painlev\'e-Kuratowski convergence of closed sets in analysis that are motivated also by questions from singularity theory. First, we generalise to Lipschitz functions the classical theorem stating that given a sequence of smooth functions with locally uniformly convergent derivatives, we obtain the local uniform convergence of the functions themselves (provided they were convergent at one point). Next we turn to the study of the behaviour of the fibres of a given function. We prove some general real counterparts of the Hurwitz theorem from complex analysis stating that the local uniform convergence of holomorphic functions implies the convergence of their sets of zeros. From the point of view of singularity theory our two theorems concern the convergence of the sets when their descriptions are convergent. They are also of interest in approximation theory.</description>

      <title>Invariants for singular links via the two parameter bt-algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a new invariant of singular links through representations of the singular braid monoid into the two parameters bt-algebra. Additionally, we recover this invariant by using the approach of Paris and Rabenda. Hence, we introduce the so called two parameter Singular bt-algebra. Finally, we provide the skein relations that define our invariant, and we prove that this invariant is more powerful than previous invariants of singular links in literature.</description>

      <title>Stable equivalence relations on 4-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kreck's modified surgery gives an approach to classifying smooth $2n$-manifolds up to stable diffeomorphism, i.e. up to connected sum with copies of $S^n \times S^n$. In dimension 4, we use a combination of modified and classical surgery to study various stable equivalence relations which we compare to stable diffeomorphism. Most importantly, we consider homotopy equivalence up to stabilisation with copies of $S^2 \times S^2$.
  As an application, we show that closed oriented homotopy equivalent 4-manifolds with abelian fundamental group are stably diffeomorphic. We give analogues of the cancellation theorems of Hambleton--Kreck for stable homeomorphism for homotopy up to stabilisations. Finally, we give a complete algebraic obstruction to the existence of closed smooth 4-manifolds which are homotopy equivalent but not simple homotopy equivalent up to connected sum with $S^2 \times S^2$.</description>

      <title>Random Unitary Representations of Surface Groups II: The large $n$ limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.03224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2101.03224v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Sigma_{g}$ be a closed surface of genus $g\geq 2$ and $\Gamma_{g}$ denote the fundamental group of $\Sigma_{g}$. We establish a generalization of Voiculescu's theorem on the asymptotic $*$-freeness of Haar unitary matrices from free groups to $\Gamma_{g}$. We prove that for a random representation of $\Gamma_{g}$ into $\mathsf{SU}(n)$, with law given by the volume form arising from the Atiyah-Bott-Goldman symplectic form on moduli space, the expected value of the trace of a fixed non-identity element of $\Gamma_{g}$ is bounded as $n\to\infty$. The proof involves an interplay between Dehn's work on the word problem in $\Gamma_{g}$ and classical invariant theory.</description>
