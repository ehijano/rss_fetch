      <title>On the differentiation of integrals in measure spaces along filters: II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a complete measure space of finite measure. The Lebesgue transform of an integrable function $f$ on $X$ encodes the collection of all the mean-values of $f$ on all measurable subsets of $X$ of positive measure. In the problem of the differentiation of integrals, one seeks to recapture $f$ from its Lebesgue transform. In previous work we showed that, in all known results, $f$ may be recaputed from its Lebesgue transform by means of a limiting process associated to an appropriate family of filters defined on the collection of all measurable subsets of $X$ of positive measure. The first result of the present work is that the existence of such a limiting process is equivalent to the existence of a Von Neumann-Maharam lifting of $X$.
  In the second result of this work we provide an independent argument that shows that the recourse to filters is a \textit{necessary consequence} of the requirement that the process of recapturing $f$ from its mean-values is associated to a \textit{natural transformation}, in the sense of category theory. This result essentially follows from the Yoneda lemma. As far as we know, this is the first instance of a significant interaction between category theory and the problem of the differentiation of integrals.
  In the Appendix we have proved, in a precise sense, that \textit{natural transformations fall within the general concept of homomorphism}. As far as we know, this is a novel conclusion: Although it is often said that natural transformations are homomorphisms of functors, this statement appears to be presented as a mere analogy, not in a precise technical sense. In order to achieve this result, we had to bring to the foreground a notion that is implicit in the subject but has remained hidden in the background, i.e., that of \textit{partial magma}.</description>

      <title>A note on the Fourier magnitude data and Sobolev embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Sobolev $H^s(\mathbb{R}^n)$, $s \in \mathbb{R}$, stability of the Fourier phase problem to recover $f$ from the knowledge of $|\hat{f}|$ with an additional Bessel potential $H^{t,p}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ a priori estimate when $t \in \mathbb{R}$ and $p \in [1,2]$. These estimates are related to the ones studied recently by Steinerberger in "On the stability of Fourier phase retrieval" J. Fourier Anal. Appl., 28(2):29, 2022. While our estimates in general are different, they share some comparable special cases and the main improvement given here is that we can remove an additional imaginary term and obtain sharper constants. We also consider these estimates for the quotient distances related to the non-uniqueness of the Fourier phase problem. Our arguments closely follow the Fourier analysis proof of the Sobolev embeddings for Bessel potential spaces with minor modifications.</description>

      <title>Relative weak compactness in infinite-dimensional Fefferman-Meyer duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $E$ be a Banach space such that $E'$ has the Radon-Nikod\'ym property. The aim of this work is to connect relative weak compactness in the $E$-valued martingale Hardy space $H^{1}(\mu,E)$ to a convex compactness criterion in a weaker topology, such as the topology of uniform convergence on compacts in measure. These results represent a dynamic version of the deep result of Diestel, Ruess, and Schachermayer on relative weak compactness in $L^{1}(\mu,E)$. In the reflexive case, we obtain a Kadec-Pe{\l}czy\'nski dichotomy for $H^{1}(\mu,E)$-bounded sequences, which decomposes a subsequence into a relatively weakly compact part, a pointwise weakly convexly convergent part, and a null part converging to zero uniformly on compacts in measure. As a corollary, we investigate a parameterized version of the vector-valued Koml\'os theorem without the assumption of $H^{1}(\mu,E)$-boundedness.</description>

      <title>Korevaar-Schoen $p$-energy forms and associated $p$-energy measures on fractals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct good $p$-energy forms on metric measure spaces as pointwise subsequential limits of Besov-type $p$-energy functionals under certain geometric/analytic conditions. Such forms are often called Korevaar-Schoen $p$-energy forms in the literature. As an advantage of our approach, the associated $p$-energy measures are obtained and investigated. We also prove that our construction is applicable to the settings of Kigami [Mem. Eur. Math. Soc. 5 (2023)] and Cao-Gu-Qiu [Adv. Math. 405 (2022), no. 108517], yields Korevaar-Schoen $p$-energy forms comparable to the $p$-energy forms constructed in these papers, and can be further modified in the case of self-similar sets to obtain self-similar $p$-energy forms keeping most of the good properties of Korevaar-Schoen ones.</description>

      <title>The Method of Invariant Sets of Descending Flow for Locally Lipschitz Functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the method of invariant sets of descending flow that proposed by Sun Jingxian for smooth functionals to the locally Lipschitz functionals. By this way, we obtain the existence results for the positive, negative and sign-changing critical points of the locally Lipschitz functionals, and apply these theoretical results to the study of differential inclusion problems with p-Laplacian. In order to obtain the above results,we develop some new techniques: 1) We establish the method of how to extend the pseudo-gradient field to the whole space on the premise of preserving the useful information of the local pseudo-gradient field; 2) In the case of set-valued mapping, a pseudo-gradient field is established to make both the cone and the negative cone being invariant sets of descending flow. To obtain our main results, a new class of (PS) condition is also proposed.</description>

      <title>Contraction properties and differentiability of $p$-energy forms with applications to nonlinear potential theory on self-similar sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce new contraction properties called the generalized $p$-contraction property for $p$-energy forms as generalizations of many well-known inequalities, such as Clarkson's inequalities, the strong subadditivity and the ``Markov property'' in the theory of nonlinear Dirichlet forms, and show that any $p$-energy form satisfying Clarkson's inequalities is Fr\'{e}chet differentiable. We also verify the generalized $p$-contraction property for $p$-energy forms constructed by Kigami [Mem. Eur. Math. Soc. 5 (2023)] and by Cao--Gu--Qiu [Adv. Math. 405 (2022), no. 108517]. As a general framework of $p$-energy forms taking into consideration the generalized $p$-contraction property, we introduce the notion of $p$-resistance form and investigate fundamental properties for $p$-harmonic functions with respect to $p$-resistance forms. In particular, some new estimates on scaling factors of $p$-energy forms are obtained by establishing H\"{o}lder regularity estimates for harmonic functions, and the $p$-walk dimensions of the generalized Sierpi\'{n}ski carpets and $D$-dimensional level-$l$ Sierpi\'{n}ski gasket are shown to be strictly greater than $p$.</description>

      <title>Symmetric functionals on simply generated symmetric spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present paper we suggest a construction of symmetric functionals on a large class of symmetric spaces over a semifinite von Neumann algebra. This approach establishes a bijection between the symmetric functionals on symmetric spaces and shift-invariant functionals on the space of bounded sequences. It allows to obtain a bijection between the classes of all continuous symmetric functionals on different symmetric spaces. Notably, we show that this mapping is not bijective on the class of all Dixmier traces. As an application of our results we prove an extension of the Connes trace formula for a wide class of operators and symmetric functionals.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a transport problem on an infinite metric graph and discuss its well-posedness and long-term behaviour under the condition that the mass flow is buffered in at least one of the vertices. In order to show the well-posedness of the problem, we employ the theory of $C_0$-semigroups and prove a Desch--Schappacher type perturbation theorem for dispersive semigroups. Investigating the long-term behaviour of the system, we prove irreducibility of the semigroup under the assumption that the underlying graph is strongly connected and an additional spectral condition on its adjacency matrix. Moreover, we employ recent results about the convergence of stochastic semigroups that dominate a kernel operator to prove that the solutions converge strongly to equilibrium. Finally, we prove that the solutions converge uniformly under more restrictive assumptions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.00315v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study decay rates for bounded $C_0$-semigroups from the perspective of $L^p$-infinite-time admissibility and related resolvent estimates. In the Hilbert space setting, polynomial decay of semigroup orbits is characterized by the resolvent behavior in the open right half-plane. A similar characterization based on $L^p$-infinite-time admissibility is provided for multiplication semigroups on $L^q$-spaces with $1 \leq q \leq p &lt; \infty$. For polynomially stable $C_0$-semigroups on Hilbert spaces, we also give a sufficient condition for $L^2$-infinite-time admissibility.</description>

Abstract: Let $K$ be a nonempty finite subset of the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^k$ $(k\ge 2)$. We prove that if a function $f\colon \mathbb{R}^k\to \mathbb{C}$ is such that the sum of $f$ on every congruent copy of $K$ is zero, then $f$ vanishes everywhere. In fact, a stronger, weighted version is proved. As a corollary we find that every finite subset $K$ of $\mathbb{R}^k$ having at least two elements is a Jackson set; that is, no subset of $\mathbb{R}^k$ intersects every congruent copy of $K$ in exactly one point.</description>

      <title>$\ell_1$ spreading models and the FPP for Ces\`aro mean nonexpansive maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18113v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a nonempty set in a Banach space $X$. A mapping $T\colon K\to K$ is called {\it $\mathfrak{cm}$-nonexpansive} if for any sequence $(x_i)_{i=1}^n$ and $y$ in $K$, one has $\|(1/n) \sum_{i=1}^n Tx_i -Ty\|\leq \|(1/n)\sum_{i=1}^n x_i - y\|$. As a subsclass of nonexpansive maps, the FPP for such maps is well-established in a great variety of spaces. The main result of this paper is a fixed point result relating $\mathfrak{cm}$-nonexpansiveness, $\ell_1$ spreading models and Schauder bases with not-so-large basis constants. As a result, we deduce that every Banach space with weak Banach-Saks property has the fixed point property for $\mathfrak{cm}$-nonexpansive maps.</description>

Abstract: We answer the recent problem posed by Baudier, Braga, Farah, Vignati, and Willett that asks whether the $\ell_\infty$-direct sum of the matrix algebras embeds into the uniform Roe algebra or the quasi-local algebra of a uniformly locally finite metric space. The answers are no and yes, respectively. Hence the inclusion of the uniform Roe algebra into the quasi-local algebra can be proper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03537v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study analysis on the cone of discrete Radon measures over a locally compact Polish space $X$. We discuss probability measures on the cone and the corresponding correlation measures and correlation functions on the sub-cone of finite discrete Radon measures over $X$. For this, we consider on the cone an analogue of the harmonic analysis on the configuration space developed in [12]. We also study elements of the difference calculus on the cone: we introduce discrete birth-and-death gradients and study the corresponding Dirichlet forms; finally, we discuss a system of polynomial functions on the cone which satisfy the binomial identity.</description>

      <title>Maximal weak Orlicz types and the strong maximal on von Neumann algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12061v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathbf{E}_n: \mathcal{M} \to \mathcal{M}_n$ and $\mathbf{E}_m: \mathcal{N} \to \mathcal{N}_m$ be two sequences of conditional expectations on finite von Neumann algebras. The optimal weak Orlicz type of the associated strong maximal operator $\mathcal{E} = (\mathbf{E}_n\otimes \mathbf{E}_m)_{n,m}$ is not yet known. In a recent work of Jose Conde and the two first-named authors, it was show that $\mathcal{E}$ has weak type $(\Phi, \Phi)$ for a family of functions including $\Phi(t) = t \, \log^{2+\varepsilon} t$, for every $\varepsilon &gt; 0$. In this article, we prove that the weak Orlicz type of $\mathcal{E}$ cannot be lowered below $L \log^2 L$, meaning that if $\mathcal{E}$ is of weak type $(\Phi, \Phi)$, then $\Phi(s) \not\in o(s \, \log^2 s)$. Our proof is based on interpolation. Namely, we use recent techniques of Cadilhac/Ricard to formulate a Marcinkiewicz type theorem for maximal weak Orlicz types. Then, we show that a weak Orlicz type lower than $L \log^2 L$ would imply a $p$-operator constant for $\mathcal{E}$ smaller than the known optimum as $p \to 1^{+}$.</description>
