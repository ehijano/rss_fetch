      <title>Uncertainty Quantification of Bacterial Microcompartment Permeability</title>

Abstract: $\textit{Salmonella}$ expresses bacterial microcompartments (MCPs) upon 1,2-propanediol exposure. MCPs are nanoscale protein-bound shells that encase enzymes for the cofactor-dependent 1,2-propanediol metabolism. They are hypothesized to limit exposure to the toxic intermediate, propionaldehyde, decrease cofactor involvement in competing reactions, and enhance flux. We construct a mass-action mathematical model of purified MCPs and calibrate parameters to measured metabolite concentrations. We constrain mass-action kinetic parameters to previously estimated Michaelis-Menten parameters. We identified two distinct fits with different dynamics in the pathway product, propionate, but similar goodness of fit. Across fits, we inferred that the MCP 1,2-propanediol and propionaldehyde permeability should be greater than $10^{-6}$ and $10^{-8}$ m/s, respectively. Our results identify parameter ranges consistent with prevailing theories that MCPs impose preferential diffusion to 1,2-propanediol over propionaldehyde, and sequester toxic propionaldehyde away from the cell cytosol. The bimodality of the posterior distribution arises from bimodality in the estimated coenzyme-A (CoA) permeability and inhibition rates. The MCP permeability to CoA was inferred to be either less than $10^{-8.8}$ m/s or greater than $10^{-7.3}$ m/s. In a high CoA permeability environment with low rates of CoA inhibition, enzymes produced metabolites by recycling (NAD+)/(NADH). In a low CoA permeability environment with high rates of CoA inhibition, enzymes required external NAD+/H to produce metabolites. Dynamics are consistent with prevailing hypotheses about MCP function to sequester toxic propionaldehyde, and additional collection of data points between 6 and 24 hours or characterization of enzyme inhibition rates could further reduce uncertainty and provide better permeability estimates.</description>

      <title>Bifurcations and multistability in inducible three-gene toggle switch networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Control of transcription presides over a vast array of biological processes including through gene regulatory circuits that exhibit multistability. Two- and three-gene network motifs are often found to be critical parts of the repertoire of metabolic and developmental pathways. Theoretical models of these circuits, however, typically vary parameters such as dissociation constants, transcription rates, and degradation rates without specifying precisely how these parameters are controlled biologically. In this paper, we examine the role of effector molecules, which can alter the concentrations of the active transcription factors that control regulation, and are ubiquitous to regulatory processes across biological settings. We specifically consider allosteric regulation in the context of extending the standard bistable switch to three-gene networks, and explore the rich multistable dynamics exhibited in these architectures as a function of effector concentrations. We then study how the conditions required for tristability and more complex dynamics, and the bifurcations in dynamic phase space upon tuning effector concentrations, evolve under various interpretations of regulatory circuit mechanics, the underlying activity of inducers, and perturbations thereof. Notably, the biological mechanism by which we model effector control over dual-function proteins transforms not only the phenotypic trend of dynamic tuning but also the set of available dynamic regimes. In this way, we determine key parameters and regulatory features that drive phenotypic decisions, and offer an experimentally tunable structure for encoding inducible multistable behavior arising from both single and dual-function allosteric transcription factors.</description>
