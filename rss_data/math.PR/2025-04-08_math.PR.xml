      <title>Ising model on preferential attachment models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Ising model on affine preferential attachment models with general parameters. We identify the thermodynamic limit of several quantities, arising in the large graph limit, such as pressure per particle, magnetisation, and internal energy for these models. Furthermore, for $m\geq 2$, we determine the inverse critical temperature for preferential attachment models as $\beta_c(m,\delta)=0$ when $\delta\in(-m,0]$, while, for $\delta&gt;0$,
  $$\beta_c(m,\delta)= {\rm atanh}\left\{ \frac{\delta}{2\big( m(m+\delta)+\sqrt{m(m-1)(m+\delta)(m+\delta+1)} \big)} \right\}~.$$
  Our proof for the thermodynamic limit of pressure per particle critically relies on the belief propagation theory for factor models on locally tree-like graphs, as developed by Dembo, Montanari, and Sun. It has been proved that preferential attachment models admit the P\'{o}lya point tree as their local limit under general conditions. We use the explicit characterisation of the P\'{o}lya point tree and belief propagation for factor models to obtain the explicit expression for the thermodynamic limit of the pressure per particle. Next, we use the convexity properties of the internal energy and magnetisation to determine their thermodynamic limits. To study the phase transition, we prove that the inverse critical temperature for a sequence of graphs and its local limit are equal. Finally, we show that $\beta_c(m,\delta)$ is the inverse critical temperature for the P\'{o}lya point tree with parameters $m$ and $\delta$, using results from Lyons who shows that the critical inverse temperature is closely related to the percolation critical threshold. This part of the proof heavily relies on the critical percolation threshold for P\'{o}lya point trees established earlier with Hazra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a critical simple exchangeable fragmentation-coagulation in slow regime where the coagulation rate and fragmentation rate are of the same order, we show that there exist phase transitions for its boundary behavior at infinity depending on the asymptotics of the difference between the two rates, and find rather sharp conditions for different boundary behaviors.</description>

      <title>A completion of counterexamples to the classical central limit theorem for pair- and triplewise independent and identically distributed random variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By the Lindeberg-L\'evy central limit theorem, standardized partial sums of a sequence of mutually independent and identically distributed random variables converge in law to the standard normal distribution. It is known that mutual independence cannot be relaxed to pairwise and even not triplewise independence. Counterexamples have been constructed for most marginal distributions: a recent construction works under a condition which excludes certain probability distributions with atomic parts, in particular discrete distributions in the `general position.' In the present paper, we show that this condition can be lifted: for any probability distribution $ F $ on the real line, which has finite variance and is not concentrated in a single point, there exists a sequence of triplewise independent random variables with distribution $ F $, such that its standardized partial sums converge in law to a distribution which is not normal. There is also scope for extension to $ k $-tuplewise independence.</description>

      <title>Tight Low Degree Hardness for Optimizing Pure Spherical Spin Glasses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove constant degree polynomial algorithms cannot optimize pure spherical $p$-spin Hamiltonians beyond the algorithmic threshold $\mathsf{ALG}(p)=2\sqrt{\frac{p-1}{p}}$. The proof goes by transforming any hypothetical such algorithm into a Lipschitz one, for which hardness was shown previously by the author and B. Huang.</description>

      <title>Limit distribution of errors in discretization of stochastic Volterra equations with multidimensional kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the limit distribution of discretization errors in stochastic Volterra equations (SVEs) with general multidimensional kernel structures. While prior studies, such as Fukasawa and Ugai (2023), were focused on one-dimensional fractional kernels, this research generalizes to broader classes, accommodating diagonal matrix kernels that include forms beyond fractional type. The main result demonstrates the stable convergence in law for the rescaled discretization error process, and the limit process is characterized under relaxed assumptions.</description>

      <title>Sharp threshold for network recovery from voter model dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the problem of recovering a latent directed Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graph $G^*\sim \mathcal G(n,p)$ from observations of discrete voter model trajectories on $G^*$, where $np$ grows polynomially in $n$. Given access to $M$ independent voter model trajectories evolving up to time $T$, we establish that $G^*$ can be recovered \emph{exactly} with probability at least $0.9$ by an \emph{efficient} algorithm, provided that \[ M \cdot \min\{T, n\} \geq C n^2 p^2 \log n \] holds for a sufficiently large constant $C$. Here, $M\cdot \min\{T,n\}$ can be interpreted as the approximate number of effective update rounds being observed, since the voter model on $G^*$ typically reaches consensus after $\Theta(n)$ rounds, and no further information can be gained after this point. Furthermore, we prove an \emph{information-theoretic} lower bound showing that the above condition is tight up to a constant factor. Our results indicate that the recovery problem does not exhibit a statistical-computational gap.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a mutliscale jump process introduced in a work by Crudu, Debussche, Muller and Radulescu. Using an adequate coupling, we are able to prove the strong convergence, for the uniform topology, to a piecewise deterministic Markov process. Under some additional regularity, we also obtain a central limit theorem and prove that the fluctuations of the continuous scale converge, in a weaker sense, to the solution of a stochastic differential equation.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness and Longtime Behavior of the Completely Positively Correlated Symbiotic Branching Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The symbiotic branching model in $\mathbb{R}$ describes the behavior of two branching populations migrating in space $\mathbb{R}$ in terms of a corresponding system of stochastic partial differential equations. The system is parametrized with a correlation parameter $\rho$, which takes values in $[-1,1]$ and governs the correlation between the branching mechanisms of the two populations. While existence and uniqueness for this system were established for $\rho \in [-1,1)$, weak uniqueness for the completely positively correlated case of $\rho = 1$ has been an open problem. In this paper, we resolve this problem, establishing weak uniqueness for the corresponding system of stochastic partial differential equations. The proof uses a new duality between the symbiotic branching model and the well-known parabolic Anderson model. Furthermore, we use this duality to investigate the long-term behavior of the completely positively correlated symbiotic branching model. We show that, under suitable initial conditions, after a long time, one of the populations dies out. We treat the case of integrable initial conditions and the case of bounded non-integrable initial conditions with well-defined mean.</description>

      <title>Stochastic differential equations driven by fractional Brownian motion: dependence on the Hurst parameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic models with fractional Brownian motion as source of randomness have become popular since the early 2000s. Fractional Brownian motion (fBm) is a Gaussian process, whose covariance depends on the so-called Hurst parameter $H\in (0,1)$. Consequently, stochastic models with fBm also depend on the Hurst parameter $H$, and the stability of these models with respect to $H$ is an interesting and important question. In recent years, the continuous (or even smoother) dependence on the Hurst parameter has been studied for several stochastic models, including stochastic integrals with respect to fBm, stochastic differential equations (SDEs) driven by fBm and also stochastic partial differential equations with fractional noise, for different topologies, e.g., in law or almost surely, and for finite and infinite time horizons. In this manuscript, we give an overview of these results with a particular focus on SDE models.</description>

      <title>Mixed memories in Hopfield networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the class of Hopfield models of associative memory with activation function $F$ and state space $\{-1,1\}^N$, where each vertex of the cube describes a configuration of $N$ binary neurons. $M$ randomly chosen configurations, called patterns, are stored using an energy function designed to make them local minima. If they are, which is known to depend on how $M$ scales with $N$, then they can be retrieved using a dynamics that decreases the energy. However, storing the patterns in the energy function also creates unintended local minima, and thus false memories. Although this has been known since the earliest work on the subject, it has only been supported by numerical simulations and non-rigorous calculations, except in elementary cases.
  Our results are twofold. For a generic function $F$, we explicitly construct a set of configurations, called mixed memories, whose properties are intended to characterise the local minima of the energy function. For three prominent models, namely the classical, the dense and the modern Hopfield models, obtained for quadratic, polynomial and exponential functions $F$ respectively, we give conditions on the growth rate of $M$ which guarantee that, as $N$ diverges, mixed memories are fixed points of the retrieval dynamics and thus exact minima of the energy. We conjecture that in this regime, all local minima are mixed memories.</description>

      <title>Renormalisation in the flow approach for singular SPDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the renormalisation of singular SPDEs in the flow approach recently developed by Duch using a bottom-up setting. We introduce a general ansatz based on decorated trees for the solution of the flow equation. The ansatz is renormalised in a recursive way, in the sense of the trees, via local extractions introduced for regularity structures. We derive the renormalised equation from this ansatz and show that the renormalisation scheme is identical to that appearing in the context of regularity structures, thus matching the BPHZ renormalisation.</description>

      <title>Emergence of microbial host dormancy during a persistent virus epidemic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a minimal stochastic individual-based model for a microbial population challenged by a persistent (lytic) virus epidemic. We focus on the situation in which the resident microbial host population and the virus population are in stable coexistence upon arrival of a single new ``mutant'' host individual. We assume that this mutant is capable of switching to a reversible state of dormancy upon contact with virions as a means of avoiding infection by the virus. At the same time, we assume that this new dormancy trait comes with a cost, namely a reduced individual reproduction rate. We prove that there is a non-trivial range of parameters where the mutants can nevertheless invade the resident population with strictly positive probability (bounded away from 0) in the large population limit. Given the reduced reproductive rate, such an invasion would be impossible in the absence of either the dormancy trait or the virus epidemic. We explicitly characterize the parameter regime where this emergence of a (costly) host dormancy trait is possible, determine the success probability of a single invader and the typical amount of time it takes the successful mutants to reach a macroscopic population size. We conclude this study by an investigation of the fate of the population after the successful emergence of a dormancy trait. Heuristic arguments and simulations suggest that after successful invasion, either both host types and the virus will reach coexistence, or the mutants will drive the resident hosts to extinction while the virus will stay in the system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the second order of the number of excursions of a simple random walk with a bias that drives a return toward the origin along the axes introduced by P. Andreoletti and P. Debs \cite{AndDeb3}. This is a crucial step toward deriving the asymptotic behavior of these walks, whose limit is explicit and reveals various characteristics of the process: the invariant probability measure of the extracted coordinates away from the axes, the 1-stable distribution arising from the tail distribution of entry times on the axes, and finally, the presence of a Bessel process of dimension 3, which implies that the trajectory can be interpreted as a random path conditioned to stay within a single quadrant.</description>

      <title>Indistinguishability of unbounded components in the occupied and vacant sets of Boolean models on symmetric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Boolean models on Riemannian symmetric spaces driven by homogeneous insertion- or deletion-tolerant point processes. We prove that in both the set covered by the balls (the occupied set) and its complement (the vacant set), one cannot distinguish unbounded components from each other by any isometry invariant component property. This implies the uniqueness monotonicity for the occupied and vacant sets of Poisson-Boolean models and an equivalence of non-uniqueness to the decay of connectivity for both sets. These results are continuum analogues of those by Lyons and Schramm arXiv:math/9811170. However, unlike the proof of the indistinguishability in arXiv:math/9811170, our proof does not rely on transience of unbounded components. We also prove the existence of a percolation phase transition for independent Poisson-Boolean model on unbounded connected components of both occupied and vacant sets and show transience of a random walk on the occupied set. Apart from some technical differences, we treat the occupied and the vacant sets of Boolean models within a single framework.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation for interacting particle systems with common noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the asymptotic behavior of the fluctuation process for large stochastic systems of interacting particles driven by both idiosyncratic and common noise with an interaction kernel \(k \in L^2(\R^d) \cap L^\infty(\R^d)\). Our analysis relies on uniform relative entropy estimates and Kolmogorov's compactness criterion to establish tightness and convergence of the fluctuation process. In this framework, an extension of the exponential law of large numbers is used to derive the necessary uniform estimates, while a conditional Fubini theorem is employed in the identification of the limit in the presence of common noise. We demonstrate that the fluctuation process converges in distribution to the unique solution of a linear stochastic evolution equation. This work extends previous fluctuation results beyond the classical Lipschitz framework.</description>

      <title>Discrete-to-continuum limits of semilinear stochastic evolution equations in Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the convergence of semilinear parabolic stochastic evolution equations, posed on a sequence of Banach spaces approximating a limiting space and driven by additive white noise projected onto the former spaces. Under appropriate uniformity and convergence conditions on the linear operators, nonlinear drifts and initial data, we establish convergence of the associated mild solution processes when lifted to a common state space. Our framework is applied to the case where the limiting problem is a stochastic partial differential equation whose linear part is a generalized Whittle-Mat\'ern operator on a manifold $\mathcal{M}$, discretized by a sequence of graphs constructed from a point cloud. In this setting, we obtain discrete-to-continuum convergence of solutions lifted to the spaces $L^q(\mathcal{M})$ for $q \in [2,\infty]$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive explicit representations for the (Siegmund-) dual and the time-reversed flow of generalized Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes whenever these exist. It turns out that the dual and the process corresponding to the reversed stochastic flow are again generalized Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes. Further, we observe that the stationary distribution of the dual process provides information about the hitting time of zero of the original process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the optimal control of an infinite-dimensional stochastic system governed by an SDE in a separable Hilbert space driven by cylindrical stable noise. We establish the existence and uniqueness of a mild solution to the associated HJB equation. This result forms the basis for the proof of the Verification Theorem, which is the subject of ongoing research and will provide a sufficient condition for optimality.</description>

      <title>Random Normed k-Means: A Paradigm-Shift in Clustering within Probabilistic Metric Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing approaches remain largely constrained by traditional distance metrics, limiting their effectiveness in handling random data. In this work, we introduce the first k-means variant in the literature that operates within a probabilistic metric space, replacing conventional distance measures with a well-defined distance distribution function. This pioneering approach enables more flexible and robust clustering in both deterministic and random datasets, establishing a new foundation for clustering in stochastic environments. By adopting a probabilistic perspective, our method not only introduces a fresh paradigm but also establishes a rigorous theoretical framework that is expected to serve as a key reference for future clustering research involving random data. Extensive experiments on diverse real and synthetic datasets assess our model's effectiveness using widely recognized evaluation metrics, including Silhouette, Davies-Bouldin, Calinski Harabasz, the adjusted Rand index, and distortion. Comparative analyses against established methods such as k-means++, fuzzy c-means, and kernel probabilistic k-means demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed random normed k-means (RNKM) algorithm. Notably, RNKM exhibits a remarkable ability to identify nonlinearly separable structures, making it highly effective in complex clustering scenarios. These findings position RNKM as a groundbreaking advancement in clustering research, offering a powerful alternative to traditional techniques while addressing a long-standing gap in the literature. By bridging probabilistic metrics with clustering, this study provides a foundational reference for future developments and opens new avenues for advanced data analysis in dynamic, data-driven applications.</description>

      <title>Matrix Chernoff concentration bounds for multipartite soft covering and expander walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove Chernoff style exponential concentration bounds for classical quantum soft covering generalising previous works which gave bounds only in expectation. Our first result is an exponential concentration bound for fully smooth multipartite classical quantum soft covering, extending Ahlswede-Winter's seminal result in several important directions. Next, we prove a new exponential concentration result for smooth unipartite classical quantum soft covering when the samples are taken via a random walk on an expander graph. The resulting expander matrix Chernoff bound complements the results of Garg, Lee, Song and Srivastava in important ways. We prove our new expander matrix Chernoff bound by generalising McDiarmid's method of bounded differences for functions of independent random variables to a new method of bounded excision for functions of expander walks. This new technical tool should be of independent interest.
  A notable feature of our new concentration bounds is that they have no explicit Hilbert space dimension factor. This is because our bounds are stated in terms of the trace distance of the sample averaged quantum state to the `ideal' quantum state. Our bounds are sensitive to certain smooth Renyi max divergences, giving a clear handle on the number of samples required to achieve a target trace distance. Using these novel features, we prove new one shot inner bounds for sending private classical information over different kinds of quantum wiretap channels with many non-interacting eavesdroppers that are independent of the Hilbert space dimensions of the eavesdroppers. Such powerful results were unknown earlier even in the fully classical setting.</description>

      <title>Pathwise Solvability and Bubbling in 2D Stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation on a periodic 2D domain, driven by infinite-dimensional Gaussian noise in a Sobolev class. We establish strong local well-posedness in the energy space and characterize blow-up at random times in terms of energy concentration at small scales (bubbling). By iteration, we construct pathwise global weak solutions, with energy evolving as a c{\`a}dl{\`a}g process, and prove uniqueness within this class. These results offer a stochastic counterpart to the deterministic concept of Struwe solutions. The approach relies on a transformation that leads to a magnetic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation with random gauge coefficients.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: QuickSort and the analysis of its expected run time was presented 1962 in a classical paper by C.A.R Hoare. There the run time analysis hinges on a by now well known recurrence equation for the expected run time, which in turn was justified by referring to ``the law of conditional expectations''. A probability space for the runs of the algorithms was not constructed. Subsequent textbooks treated the recurrence relation as self evident and present it until this day without proof. Here we give an inductive definition of the probability space for the runs of randomized QuickSort and subsequently derive the recurrence equation with a not completely trivial proof.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Studied are coupled KPZ equations with three control parameters $X,Y,T$. These equations are used in the context of stretched polymers in a random medium, for the spacetime spin-spin correlator of the isotropic quantum Heisenberg chain, and for exciton-polariton condensates. In an earlier article we investigated merely the diagonal $X=Y$, $T=1$. Then the stationary measure is delta-correlated Gaussian and the dynamical exponent equals $z = \tfrac{3}{2}$. We observed that the scaling functions of the dynamic correlator change smoothly when varying $X$. In this contribution, the analysis is extended to the whole $X$-$Y$-$T$ plane. Solutions are stable only if $XY \geq 0$. Based on numerical simulations, the static correlator still has rapid decay. We argue that the parameter space is foliated into distinct universality classes. They are labeled by $X$ and consist of half-planes parallel to the $Y$-$T$ plane containing the point $(X,X,1)$.</description>

      <title>Efficient Rejection Sampling in the Entropy-Optimal Range</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of generating a random variate $X$ from a finite discrete probability distribution $P$ using an entropy source of independent unbiased coin flips is considered. The Knuth and Yao complexity theory of nonuniform random number generation furnishes a family of "entropy-optimal" sampling algorithms that consume between $H(P)$ and $H(P)+2$ coin flips per generated output, where $H$ is the Shannon entropy function. However, the space complexity of entropy-optimal samplers scales exponentially with the number of bits required to encode $P$. This article introduces a family of efficient rejection samplers and characterizes their entropy, space, and time complexity. Within this family is a distinguished sampling algorithm that requires linearithmic space and preprocessing time, and whose expected entropy cost always falls in the entropy-optimal range $[H(P), H(P)+2)$. No previous sampler for discrete probability distributions is known to achieve these characteristics. Numerical experiments demonstrate performance improvements in runtime and entropy of the proposed algorithm compared to the celebrated alias method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that in any dimension $n$ there exists an origin-symmetric ellipsoid ${\mathcal{E}} \subset {\mathbb{R}}^n$ of volume $ c n^2 $ that contains no points of ${\mathbb{Z}}^n$ other than the origin, where $c &gt; 0$ is a universal constant. Equivalently, there exists a lattice sphere packing in ${\mathbb{R}}^n$ whose density is at least $cn^2 \cdot 2^{-n}$. Previously known constructions of sphere packings in ${\mathbb{R}}^n$ had densities of the order of magnitude of $n \cdot 2^{-n}$, up to logarithmic factors. Our proof utilizes a stochastically evolving ellipsoid that accumulates at least $c n^2$ lattice points on its boundary, while containing no lattice points in its interior except for the origin.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.11126v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Markov processes on the lattices with arbitrary dimension are omnipresent in statistical mechanics; however their algebraic description is complete only in dimension 1, for which linear algebra provides many tools complementary to the probabilistic approach: as an example, invariant measures are eigenvectors of the generator. In larger dimension, such algebraic tools are absent due to the more involved structure of boundaries. The present work fills this gap by providing a new and complete algebraic description of these models without any other assumption than the Markov property. In order to handle higher dimensions and higher products, the language of operads is used in order to focus on associativities and the geometric interpretation of the algebraic products. This formalism leads to a new parametrization of boundary conditions of Markov processes, with concrete computations. This parametrization is inspired matrix product states in the physics literature. Among others, a probabilistic application elaborated in this paper is the construction of translation-invariant infinite-volume Gibbs measures on the whole lattice by using Kolmogorov's extension; this provides a new alternative tool to the traditional analytical approaches of large size limits. Various models are considered as illustrations.</description>

Abstract: We study the 2d directed polymer in random environment in a novel *quasi-critical regime*, which interpolates between the much studied sub-critical and critical regimes. We prove Edwards-Wilkinson fluctuations throughout the quasi-critical regime, showing that the diffusively rescaled partition functions are asymptotically Gaussian. We deduce a corresponding result for the critical 2d Stochastic Heat Flow. A key challenge is the lack of hypercontractivity, which we overcome deriving new moment estimates.</description>

Abstract: We show weak existence and uniqueness in law for a general class of stochastic differential equations in $\mathbb{R}^d$, $d\ge 1$, with prescribed sub-invariant measure $\widehat{\mu}$. The dispersion and drift coefficients of the stochastic differential equation are allowed to be degenerate and discontinuous, and locally unbounded, respectively. Uniqueness in law is obtained via $L^1(\mathbb{R}^d,\widehat{\mu})$-uniqueness in a subclass of continuous Markov processes, namely right processes that have $\widehat{\mu}$ as sub-invariant measure and have continuous paths for $\widehat{\mu}$-almost every starting point. Weak existence is obtained for a broader class via the martingale problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16801v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the directed landscape is a black noise in the sense of Tsirelson and Vershik. As a corollary, we show that for any microscopic system in which the height profile converges in law to the directed landscape, the driving noise is asymptotically independent of the height profile. This decoupling result provides one answer to the question of what happens to the driving noise in the limit under the KPZ scaling, and illustrates a type of noise sensitivity for systems in the KPZ universality class. Such decoupling and sensitivity phenomena are not present in the intermediate-disorder or weak-asymmetry regime, thus illustrating a contrast from the weak KPZ scaling regime. Along the way, we prove a strong mixing property for the directed landscape on a bounded time interval under spatial shifts, with a mixing rate $\alpha(N)\leq Ce^{-dN^3}$ for some $C,d&gt;0$.</description>

As applications, we recover its transition density and study its long-time asymptotic behaviors. In addition, we also compare with previous results on transition densities for skew Brownian motions. We propose two approaches for generating quasi-random samples by approximating the cumulative distribution function and discuss their risk measurement application.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00532v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a two-type reducible branching Brownian motion, defined as a particle system on the real line in which particles of two types move according to independent Brownian motions and create offspring at a constant rate. Particles of type $1$ can give birth to particles of types $1$ and $2$, but particles of type $2$ only give birth to descendants of type $2$. Under some specific conditions, Belloum and Mallein in \cite{BeMa21} showed that the maximum position $M_t$ of all particles alive at time $t$, suitably centered by a deterministic function $m_t$, converge weakly. In this work, we are interested in the decay rate of the following upper large deviation probability, as $t\rightarrow\infty$, \[ {\mathbb P}(M_t\geq \theta m_t),\quad \theta&gt;1. \] We shall show that the decay rate function exhibits phase transitions depending on certain relations between $\theta$, the variance of the underlying Brownian motion and the branching rate.</description>

      <title>Dense networks of integrate-and-fire neurons: Spatially-extended mean-field limit of the empirical measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06325v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamics of spatially-structured networks of $N$ interacting stochastic neurons can be described by deterministic population equations in the mean-field limit. While this is known, a general question has remained unanswered: does synaptic weight scaling suffice, by itself, to guarantee the convergence of network dynamics to a deterministic population equation, even when networks are not assumed to be homogeneous or spatially structured? In this work, we consider networks of stochastic integrate-and-fire neurons with arbitrary synaptic weights satisfying a $O(1/N)$ scaling condition. Borrowing results from the theory of dense graph limits, or graphons, we prove that, as $N\to\infty$, and up to the extraction of a subsequence, the empirical measure of the neurons' membrane potentials converges to the solution of a spatially-extended mean-field partial differential equation (PDE). Our proof requires analytical techniques that go beyond standard propagation of chaos methods. In particular, we introduce a weak metric that depends on the dense graph limit kernel and we show how the weak convergence of the initial data can be obtained by propagating the regularity of the limit kernel along the dual-backward equation associated with the spatially-extended mean-field PDE. Overall, this result invites us to reinterpret spatially-extended population equations as universal mean-field limits of networks of neurons with $O(1/N)$ synaptic weight scaling.</description>

      <title>Moment-based approach for two erratic KPZ scaling limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06571v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recent paper of Tsai shows how the first few moments of a stochastic flow in the space of measures can completely determine its law. Here we give another proof of this result for the particular case of the one-dimensional multiplicative stochastic heat equation (mSHE), and then we investigate two corollaries. The first one recovers a recent result of Hairer on a ``variance blowup" problem related to the KPZ equation , albeit in a much weaker topology. The second one recovers a KPZ scaling limit result related to random walks in random environments, but in a weaker topology. In these two problems, we furthermore explain why it is hard to directly use the martingale characterization of the mSHE, the chaos expansion, or other known methods. Using the moment-based approach avoids technicalities, leading to a short proof.</description>

      <title>Decorrelation transition in the Wigner minor process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06549v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Wigner minor process, i.e. the eigenvalues of an $N\times N$ Wigner matrix $H^{(N)}$ together with the eigenvalues of all its $n\times n$ minors, $H^{(n)}$, $n\le N$. The top eigenvalues of $H^{(N)}$ and those of its immediate minor $H^{(N-1)}$ are very strongly correlated, but this correlation becomes weaker for smaller minors $H^{(N-k)}$ as $k$ increases. For the GUE minor process the critical transition regime around $k\sim N^{2/3}$ was analyzed by Forrester and Nagao (J. Stat. Mech.: Theory and Experiment, 2011) providing an explicit formula for the nontrivial joint correlation function. We prove that this formula is universal, i.e. it holds for the Wigner minor process. Moreover, we give a complete analysis of the sub- and supercritical regimes both for eigenvalues and for the corresponding eigenvector overlaps, thus we prove the decorrelation transition in full generality.</description>

      <title>CLT for LES of correlated Non-Hermitian Random Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22542v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider two $n\times n$ non-Hermitian random matrices such that the $ij$th entry of one matrix is correlated with the $ij$th entry of the other matrix. However, the entries of any particular matrix are i.i.d. random variables. We study the asymptotic behavior of the combined spectrum, and the limit of the linear eigenvalue statistic defined on the combined spectrum. We show that if the random variables are centered with variance $1/n$ and having finite moments, then the centered \textit{Linear Eigenvalue Statistics} (LESs) converge jointly to a bivariate Gaussian distribution. We assumed that the test function used in the LES belongs to Sobolev $H^{2+\delta}$ space. The variance of the limiting Gaussian distribution depends on correlation structure of the matrix entries and the fourth order mixed cumulants of the matrix entries. This generalizes the previous results by Rider, Silverstein (2006), Cipolloni, Erd\H{o}s, Schr\"oder (2023). In particular, we obtain the limiting LES of random centrosymmetric matrices.</description>

      <title>Rigorous results for timelike Liouville field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Liouville field theory has long been a cornerstone of two-dimensional quantum field theory and quantum gravity, which has attracted much recent attention in the mathematics literature. Timelike Liouville field theory is a version of Liouville field theory where the kinetic term in the action appears with a negative sign, which makes it closer to a theory of quantum gravity than ordinary (spacelike) Liouville field theory. Making sense of this "wrong sign" requires a theory of Gaussian random variables with negative variance. Such a theory is developed in this paper, and is used to prove the timelike DOZZ formula for the $3$-point correlation function when the parameters satisfy the so-called "charge neutrality condition". Expressions are derived also for the $k$-point correlation functions for all $k\ge 3$, and it is shown that these functions approach the correct semiclassical limits as the coupling constant is sent to zero.</description>

Abstract: We study Bregman divergences in probability density space embedded with the $L^2$-Wasserstein metric. Several properties and dualities of transport Bregman divergences are provided. In particular, we derive the transport Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence by a Bregman divergence of negative Boltzmann-Shannon entropy in $L^2$-Wasserstein space. We also derive analytical formulas and generalizations of transport KL divergence for one-dimensional probability densities and Gaussian families.</description>

      <title>On the Convergence Rate of Sinkhorn's Algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.06000v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Sinkhorn's algorithm for solving the entropically regularized optimal transport problem. Its iterate $\pi_{t}$ is shown to satisfy $H(\pi_{t}|\pi_{*})+H(\pi_{*}|\pi_{t})=O(t^{-1})$ where $H$ denotes relative entropy and $\pi_{*}$ the optimal coupling. This holds for a large class of cost functions and marginals, including quadratic cost with subgaussian marginals. We also obtain the rate $O(t^{-1})$ for the dual suboptimality and $O(t^{-2})$ for the marginal entropies. More precisely, we derive non-asymptotic bounds, and in contrast to previous results on linear convergence that are limited to bounded costs, our estimates do not deteriorate exponentially with the regularization parameter. We also obtain a stability result for $\pi_{*}$ as a function of the marginals, quantified in relative entropy.</description>

Abstract: We obtain the asymptotic behaviour of the longest increasing/non-decreasing subsequences in a random uniform multiset permutation in which each element in {1,...,n} occurs k times, where k may depend on n. This generalizes the famous Ulam-Hammersley problem of the case k=1. The proof relies on poissonization and a connection with variants of the Hammersley-Aldous-Diaconis particle system.</description>

      <title>The Transient Cost of Learning in Queueing Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07817v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Queueing systems are widely applicable stochastic models with use cases in communication networks, healthcare, service systems, etc. Although their optimal control has been extensively studied, most existing approaches assume perfect knowledge of the system parameters. This assumption rarely holds in practice where there is parameter uncertainty, thus motivating a recent line of work on bandit learning for queueing systems. This nascent stream of research focuses on the asymptotic performance of the proposed algorithms but does not provide insight on the transient performance in the early stages of the learning process.
  In this paper, we propose the Transient Cost of Learning in Queueing (TCLQ), a new metric that quantifies the maximum increase in time-averaged queue length caused by parameter uncertainty. We characterize the TCLQ of a single-queue multi-server system, and then extend these results to multi-queue multi-server systems and networks of queues. In establishing our results, we propose a unified analysis framework for TCLQ that bridges Lyapunov and bandit analysis, provides guarantees for a wide range of algorithms, and could be of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a simple identity relating the length spectrum of a Riemann surface to that of the same surface with an arbitrary number of additional cusps. Our proof uses the Brownian loop measure introduced by Lawler and Werner. In particular, we express the total mass of Brownian loops in a fixed free homotopy class on any Riemann surface in terms of the length of the geodesic representative for the complete constant curvature metric. This expression also allows us to write the electrical thickness of a compact set in $\mathbb C$ separating $0$ and $\infty$, or the Velling--Kirillov K\"ahler potential, in terms of the Brownian loop measure and the zeta-regularized determinant of Laplacian as a renormalization of the Brownian loop measure with respect to the length spectrum.</description>

      <title>Sampling with time-changed Markov processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study time-changed Markov processes to speed up the convergence of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. The time-changed process is defined by adjusting the speed of time of a base process via a user-chosen, state-dependent function. We explore the properties of such transformations and apply this idea to several Markov processes from the MCMC literature, such as Langevin diffusions and piecewise deterministic Markov processes, obtaining novel modifications of classical algorithms and also re-discovering known MCMC algorithms. We prove theoretical properties of the time-changed process under suitable conditions on the base process, focusing on connecting the stationary distributions and qualitative convergence properties such as geometric and uniform ergodicity, as well as a functional central limit theorem. We also provide a comparison with the framework of space transformations, clarifying the similarities between the approaches. Throughout the paper we give various visualisations and numerical simulations on simple tasks to gain intuition on the method and its performance. Finally, we provide numerical simulations to gain intuition on the method and its performance on benchmark problems. Our results indicate a performance improvement in the context of multimodal distributions and rare event simulation.</description>

      <title>The Mathematics of Questions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18992v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I report the existence of exactly one non-trivial solution to the equation $i(A,B)+i(A,\neg B)+i(\neg A,B)+i(\neg A,\neg B)= 0$, where $i(A,B)=\log\frac{P(A\text{ and }B)}{P(A)P(B)}$, and $P(A)$ is the probability of the proposition $A$. The equation specifies an information balance condition between two logical propositions, which is satisfied only by independence and by this new solution. The solution is a new elementary informational relationship between logical propositions, which we denote as $A \sim B$.
  The $\sim$ relation cannot be expressed as a relationship between probabilities without the use of complex numbers. It can, however, be greatly simplified by expressing each proposition as a combination of a question and an answer, for example, writing, ``All men are mortal'', as (Are all men mortal?, Yes).
  We will study the mathematics of questions and find out what role the $\sim$ relationship plays inside the algebra. We will find that, like propositions, questions can act on probability distributions. A proposition, $X$, can be given, setting $P(X)$ to 1. The question of $X$ can be raised, setting $P(X)$ to $1/2$. Giving the proposition adds information to the probability distribution, but raising the question takes information away. Introducing questions into probability theory makes it possible to represent subtraction of information as well as addition.
  We will examine how questions can be related to each other geometrically. Remarkably, the simplest way of orienting questions in space has the same structure as the simplest quantum system -- the two-state system. We will find that the essential mathematical structure of the two-state quantum system can be derived from the mathematics of questions, including non-commutativity, complementarity, wavefunction collapse, the Hilbert space representation and the Born rule, as well as quantum entanglement and non-locality.</description>

      <title>Deep Neural Nets as Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23982v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural networks are complex functions of both their inputs and parameters. Much prior work in deep learning theory analyzes the distribution of network outputs at a fixed a set of inputs (e.g. a training dataset) over random initializations of the network parameters. The purpose of this article is to consider the opposite situation: we view a randomly initialized Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) as a Hamiltonian over its inputs. For typical realizations of the network parameters, we study the properties of the energy landscape induced by this Hamiltonian, focusing on the structure of near-global minimum in the limit of infinite width. Specifically, we use the replica trick to perform an exact analytic calculation giving the entropy (log volume of space) at a given energy. We further derive saddle point equations that describe the overlaps between inputs sampled iid from the Gibbs distribution induced by the random MLP. For linear activations we solve these saddle point equations exactly. But we also solve them numerically for a variety of depths and activation functions, including $\tanh, \sin, \text{ReLU}$, and shaped non-linearities. We find even at infinite width a rich range of behaviors. For some non-linearities, such as $\sin$, for instance, we find that the landscapes of random MLPs exhibit full replica symmetry breaking, while shallow $\tanh$ and ReLU networks or deep shaped MLPs are instead replica symmetric.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01864v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the $W$-entropy formula and the monotonicity and rigidity theorem of the $W$-entropy for the heat flow on RCD$(K, N)$ and RCD$(K, n, N)$ spaces $(X, d, \mu)$, where $K\in \mathbb{R}$, $n\in \mathbb{N}$ is the geometric dimension of $(X, d, \mu)$ and $N\geq n$. We also prove the $K$-concavity of the Shannon entropy power on RCD$(K, N)$ spaces. As an application, we derive the Shannon entropy isoperimetric inequality and the Stam type logarithmic Sobolev inequality on RCD$(0, N)$ spaces with maximal volume growth condition. Finally, we prove the rigidity theorem for the Stam type logarithmic Sobolev inequality with sharp constant on noncollapsing RCD$(0, N)$ spaces.</description>
