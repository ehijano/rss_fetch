      <title>Parameter estimation for land-surface models using machine learning libraries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Neural Networks for Partial Differential Equations (NN4PDEs) approach is used to determine the parameters of a simple land-surface model using PyTorch's backpropagation engine. In order to test the inverse model, a synthetic dataset is created by running the model in forward mode with known parameter values to create soil temperature time series that can be used as observations for the inverse model. We show that it is not possible to obtain a reliable parameter estimation using a single observed soil temperature time series. Using measurements at two depths, reliable parameter estimates can be obtained although it is not possible to differentiate between latent and sensible heat fluxes. We apply the inverse model to urban flux tower data in Phoenix, United States, and show that the thermal conductivity, volumetric heat capacity, and the combined sensible-latent heat transfer coefficient can be reliably estimated using an observed value for the effective surface albedo. The resulting model accurately predicts the outgoing longwave radiation, conductive soil fluxes and the combined sensible-latent heat fluxes.</description>

      <title>Multi-parameter constraints on empirical infrasound period-yield relations for bolides and implications for planetary defense</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How effective are methods for estimating bolide energies from infrasound signal period-yield relationships? A single global period-energy relation can obscure significant variability introduced by parameters such as the atmospheric Doppler wind profile and the bolide's energy deposition profile as a function of altitude. Bolide speed, entry angle, burst altitude, and multi-episode fragmentation all may play a role in defining the detected period of the shockwave. By leveraging bolide light curve data from the Center for Near Earth Object Studies (CNEOS), we re-examined the period-energy relation as a function of these parameters. Through a bootstrap approach, we show that various event subsets can deviate from widely cited period-energy models and we identify which specific conditions most strongly reshape the period-energy scaling. The results define both the fidelity and reliability of period-energy relations when no additional data beyond the infrasound record is available and improve the outcome when supporting data from bolide trajectories and light curves are included. Ultimately, these findings expand the scope of earlier models, providing a nuanced and robust framework for infrasound-only yield estimation under a range of bolide scenarios.</description>

      <title>Sea ice floe segmentation in close-range optical imagery using active contour and foundation models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06641v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The size of sea ice floes is a key factor influencing ice coverage, albedo, wave propagation through ice-covered waters, and ocean-atmosphere energy exchanges. Floe size can be observed by processing visual-range imagery from ships, aircraft, or satellites. However, autonomously capturing floe boundaries from imagery remains challenging, particularly due to the heterogeneity of sea ice, which impairs boundary definition and reduces image clarity. This study evaluates the accuracy of sea ice floe segmentation using the gradient vector flow (GVF) algorithm, the deep learning-based Segment Anything Model (SAM), and a hybrid approach combining GVF and SAM. These methods are applied to the most extensive dataset of close-range, high-resolution sea ice imagery currently available, collected from cameras aboard an icebreaker during an Antarctic winter expedition. Spanning a wide range of ice conditions and image clarity, the dataset provides a rigorous test of segmentation approaches. Their performance is assessed in terms of floe detection accuracy, floe size distribution, and ice concentration, with results compared against a manually segmented benchmark. The findings indicate that SAM, when used in prompt-driven mode, offers the best balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. Its strong performance in estimating sea ice concentration and detecting floes, while maintaining close agreement with benchmark floe size distributions, makes it suitable for real-time applications and scalable analysis of large imagery datasets.</description>

      <title>Local Off-Grid Weather Forecasting with Multi-Modal Earth Observation Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12938v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Urgent applications like wildfire management and renewable energy generation require precise, localized weather forecasts near the Earth's surface. However, forecasts produced by machine learning models or numerical weather prediction systems are typically generated on large-scale regular grids, where direct downscaling fails to capture fine-grained, near-surface weather patterns. In this work, we propose a multi-modal transformer model trained end-to-end to downscale gridded forecasts to off-grid locations of interest. Our model directly combines local historical weather observations (e.g., wind, temperature, dewpoint) with gridded forecasts to produce locally accurate predictions at various lead times. Multiple data modalities are collected and concatenated at station-level locations, treated as a token at each station. Using self-attention, the token corresponding to the target location aggregates information from its neighboring tokens. Experiments using weather stations across the Northeastern United States show that our model outperforms a range of data-driven and non-data-driven off-grid forecasting methods. They also reveal that direct input of station data provides a phase shift in local weather forecasting accuracy, reducing the prediction error by up to 80% compared to pure gridded data based models. This approach demonstrates how to bridge the gap between large-scale weather models and locally accurate forecasts to support high-stakes, location-sensitive decision-making.</description>
