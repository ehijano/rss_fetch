      <title>Federal Reserve Communication and the COVID-19 Pandemic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we examine the Federal Reserve's communication strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic, comparing them with communication during previous periods of economic stress. Using specialized dictionaries tailored to COVID-19, unconventional monetary policy (UMP), and financial stability, combined with sentiment analysis and topic modeling techniques, we identify a distinct focus in Fed communication during the pandemic on financial stability, market volatility, social welfare, and UMP, characterized by notable contextual uncertainty. Through comparative analysis, we juxtapose the Fed's communication during the COVID-19 crisis with its responses during the dot-com and global financial crises, examining content, sentiment, and timing dimensions. Our findings reveal that Fed communication and policy actions were more reactive to the COVID-19 crisis than to previous crises. Additionally, declining sentiment related to financial stability in interest rate announcements and minutes anticipated subsequent accommodative monetary policy decisions. We further document that communicating about UMP has become the "new normal" for the Fed's Federal Open Market Committee meeting minutes and Chairman's speeches since the Global Financial Crisis, reflecting an institutional adaptation in communication strategy following periods of economic distress. These findings contribute to our understanding of how central bank communication evolves during crises and how communication strategies adapt to exceptional economic circumstances.</description>

      <title>Finding Core Balanced Modules in Statistically Validated Stock Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional threshold-based stock networks suffer from subjective parameter selection and inherent limitations: they constrain relationships to binary representations, failing to capture both correlation strength and negative dependencies. To address this, we introduce statistically validated correlation networks that retain only statistically significant correlations via a rigorous t-test of Pearson coefficients. We then propose a novel structure termed the largest strong-correlation balanced module (LSCBM), defined as the maximum-size group of stocks with structural balance (i.e., positive edge-ign products for all triplets) and strong pairwise correlations. This balance condition ensures stable relationships, thus facilitating potential hedging opportunities through negative edges. Theoretically, within a random signed graph model, we establish LSCBM's asymptotic existence, size scaling, and multiplicity under various parameter regimes. To detect LSCBM efficiently, we develop MaxBalanceCore, a heuristic algorithm that leverages network sparsity. Simulations validate its efficiency, demonstrating scalability to networks of up to 10,000 nodes within tens of seconds. Empirical analysis demonstrates that LSCBM identifies core market subsystems that dynamically reorganize in response to economic shifts and crises. In the Chinese stock market (2013-2024), LSCBM's size surges during high-stress periods (e.g., the 2015 crash) and contracts during stable or fragmented regimes, while its composition rotates annually across dominant sectors (e.g., Industrials and Financials).</description>

      <title>Deconstructing the Crystal Ball: From Ad-Hoc Prediction to Principled Startup Evaluation with the SAISE Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into startup evaluation represents a significant technological shift, yet the academic research underpinning this transition remains methodologically fragmented. Existing studies often employ ad-hoc approaches, leading to a body of work with inconsistent definitions of success, atheoretical features, and a lack of rigorous validation. This fragmentation severely limits the comparability, reliability, and practical utility of current predictive models.
  To address this critical gap, this paper presents a comprehensive systematic literature review of 57 empirical studies. We deconstruct the current state-of-the-art by systematically mapping the features, algorithms, data sources, and evaluation practices that define the AI-driven startup prediction landscape. Our synthesis reveals a field defined by a central paradox: a strong convergence on a common toolkit -- venture databases and tree-based ensembles -- but a stark divergence in methodological rigor. We identify four foundational weaknesses: a fragmented definition of "success," a divide between theory-informed and data-driven feature engineering, a chasm between common and best-practice model validation, and a nascent approach to data ethics and explainability.
  In response to these findings, our primary contribution is the proposal of the Systematic AI-driven Startup Evaluation (SAISE) Framework. This novel, five-stage prescriptive roadmap is designed to guide researchers from ad-hoc prediction toward principled evaluation. By mandating a coherent, end-to-end methodology that emphasizes stage-aware problem definition, theory-informed data synthesis, principled feature engineering, rigorous validation, and risk-aware interpretation, the SAISE framework provides a new standard for conducting more comparable, robust, and practically relevant research in this rapidly maturing domain</description>

      <title>The Cost of Coming Out</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03649v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fear of social stigma leads many individuals worldwide to hesitate in disclosing their sexual orientation. Since concealing identity is costly, it is crucial to understand the extent of anti-LGB sentiments and reactions to coming out. This paper uses an innovative data source from a popular online game together with a natural experiment to overcome existing data and endogeneity issues. We exploit exogenous variation in the identity of a character to identify the effects of coming out on players' revealed preferences for that character across diverse regions globally. Our findings reveal a substantial and persistent negative impact of coming out.</description>

      <title>International Comparisons: Multilateral Indices and Nonparametric Welfare Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16654v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multilateral index numbers, such as those used to make cross-country comparisons of prices and income, are fundamental objects in economics. However, these numbers can be challenging to interpret in terms of welfare due to a bias related to preference misspecification. To study this problem, I exploit the concept of a reference consumer and derive revealed preference bounds on their cost-of-living index. These bounds improve upon their classical counterparts, define a novel index, and permit an appraisal of existing indices. In an application I find that superlative indices outperform non-superlative ones, but my results support the interpretability of many contemporary methods.</description>

      <title>Automation, AI, and the Intergenerational Transmission of Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16078v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have sparked expectations of unprecedented productivity growth. However, by enabling senior workers to accomplish more tasks independently, AI may inadvertently reduce entry-level opportunities, raising concerns about how future generations will acquire essential expertise. This paper develops a model to examine how advanced automation affects the intergenerational transmission of knowledge. The analysis uncovers a critical trade-off: automating entry-level tasks yields immediate productivity gains but risks undermining long-term economic growth by eroding younger workers' acquisition of tacit skills. Back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that AI-driven entry-level automation could lower the long-run annual growth rate of U.S. per capita output by 0.05 to 0.35 percentage points, depending on the scale of automation. I further demonstrate that AI co-pilots -- systems providing scalable access to tacit-like expertise previously acquired only through direct experience -- can partially mitigate these adverse effects by assisting individuals who fail to develop adequate skills early in their careers. However, co-pilots are not always beneficial, as they may also weaken the incentives of junior workers to engage in hands-on learning. These findings challenge the optimistic view that AI will automatically sustain productivity growth, highlighting instead the importance of safeguarding or actively creating new entry-level opportunities to fully unlock AI's potential.</description>
