      <title>Learning in Random Utility Models Via Online Decision Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the Random Utility Model (RUM) in repeated stochastic choice settings where decision-makers lack full information about payoffs. We propose a gradient-based learning algorithm that embeds RUM into an online decision-making framework. Our analysis establishes Hannan consistency for a broad class of RUMs, meaning the average regret relative to the best fixed action in hindsight vanishes over time. We also show that our algorithm is equivalent to the Follow-The-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) method, offering an economically grounded approach to online optimization. Applications include modeling recency bias and characterizing coarse correlated equilibria in normal-form games</description>

      <title>The Implementability of Liberalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note shows that under the unrestricted domain, there exists a choice liberal and Nash implementable social choice rule if and only if there are at least three players and the outcome set is at least twice as large as the player set. A social choice rule is choice liberal if and only if for every player, there exists at least one pair of outcomes such that if this player strictly prefers one over the other, the one he prefers is socially desirable and the other one is not. A social choice rule is Nash implementable if and only if there exists a mechanism such that at every preference profile, the set of Nash equilibrium outcomes coincides with the set of socially desirable ones. The proof constructs an intuitive Nash implementing mechanism.</description>

      <title>Two-Person Cooperative Games with delta-Rationality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A player's payoff is modeled as consisting of two parts: a rational-value part and a distortion-value part. It is argued that the (total) payoff function should be used to explain and predict the behaviors of the players, while the rational value function should be used to conduct welfare analysis of the final outcome. We use the Nash demand game to illustrate our model.</description>

      <title>AI Plays? {\delta}-Rationality Games with Nash Equilibrium as Special Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A distortion function, which captures the payoff gap between a player's actual payoff and her true payoff, is introduced and used to analyze games. In our proposed framework, we argue that players' actual payoff functions should be used to explain and predict their behaviors, while their true payoff functions should be used to conduct welfare analysis of the outcomes.</description>

      <title>Do You Know What I Mean? A Syntactic Representation for Differential Bounded Awareness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Without the assumption of complete, shared awareness, it is necessary to consider communication between agents who may entertain different representations of the world. A syntactic (language-based) approach provides powerful tools to address this problem. In this paper, we define translation operators between two languages which provide a ``best approximation'' for the meaning of propositions in the target language subject to its expressive power. We show that, in general, the translation operators preserve some, but not all, logical operations. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a joint state space and a joint language, in which the subjective state spaces of each agent, and their individual languages, may be embedded. This approach allows us to compare languages with respect to their expressiveness and thus, with respect to the properties of the associated state space.</description>

      <title>Capturing Misalignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and formalize misalignment, a phenomenon of interactive environments perceived from an analyst's perspective where an agent holds beliefs about another agent's beliefs that do not correspond to the actual beliefs of the latter. We demonstrate that standard frameworks, such as type structures, fail to capture misalignment, necessitating new tools to analyze this phenomenon. To this end, we characterize misalignment through non-belief-closed state spaces and introduce agent-dependent type structures, which provide a flexible tool to understand the varying degrees of misalignment. Furthermore, we establish that appropriately adapted modal operators on agent-dependent type structures behave consistently with standard properties, enabling us to explore the implications of misalignment for interactive reasoning. Finally, we show how speculative trade can arise under misalignment, even when imposing the corresponding assumptions that rule out such trades in standard environments.</description>

      <title>Interventions Against Machine-Assisted Statistical Discrimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04585v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I study statistical discrimination driven by verifiable beliefs, such as those generated by machine learning, rather than by humans. When beliefs are verifiable, interventions against statistical discrimination can move beyond simple, belief-free designs like affirmative action, to more sophisticated ones, that constrain decision makers based on what they are thinking. I design a belief-contingent intervention I call common identity. I show that it is effective at eliminating equilibrium statistical discrimination, even when training data exhibit the various statistical biases that often plague algorithmic decision problems.</description>

      <title>Optimal sharing, equilibria, and welfare without risk aversion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03328v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines optimal risk sharing for empirically realistic risk attitudes, providing results on Pareto optimality, competitive equilibria, utility frontiers, and the first and second theorems of welfare. Empirical studies suggest, contrary to classical assumptions, that risk seeking is prevalent in particular subdomains, and is even the majority finding for losses, underlying for instance the disposition effect. We first analyze cases of expected utility agents, some of whom may be risk seeking. Yet more empirical realism is obtained by allowing agents to be risk averse in some subdomains but risk seeking in others, which requires generalizing expected utility. Here we provide first results, pleading for future research. Our main new tool for analyzing generalized risk attitudes is a counter-monotonic improvement theorem.</description>

      <title>Optimal Wage Band for Job Matching with Signaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01886v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study an optimal wage band problem in which a policymaker sets a wage band prior to a competitive matching labor market, where education signals worker ability. We first prove the uniqueness of the competitive signaling equilibrium under a general class of utility and profit functions. We also show that the optimal wage band problem is isomorphic to an optimal ability threshold problem, which is more tractable than the original formulation. Building on this theoretical foundation, we construct a parametric model and analyze the mechanisms through which the policymaker's choice of a wage band leads to improved welfare outcomes compared to a no-intervention scenario. The implications and mechanisms we identify, arising from the asymmetric information, contrast sharply with those in the existing literature. Finally, the generality of our framework makes it suitable for a wide range of competitive matching applications, where agents invest in costly signals under asymmetric information.</description>

      <title>Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Environmental Quality through Technical Change: A Free Dynamic Equilibrium Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06501v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the times we live in today, humanity faces unprecedented environmental challenges. The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) has opened new doors in our collective efforts to address our planet's pressing problems; however, many have doubts on the actual extent of impact that AI have on the environment. In particular, AI also assisting dirty production is a drawback that is largely absent from the literature. To investigate the impact of AI on the environment, we establish mathematical models to model the economy and the production process of goods based on outdated and advanced technologies. The secondary results are stated in the form of lemmas, the main results are stated in the form of theorems. From the theorems we conclude that AI may not on its own prevent an environmental disaster, a reason of which is its concurrent contribution to dirty production. With temporary government intervention, however, AI is able to avert an environmental disaster.</description>

      <title>Computing and Learning Stationary Mean Field Equilibria with Scalar Interactions: Algorithms and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mean field equilibrium (MFE) has emerged as a computationally tractable solution concept for large dynamic games. However, computing MFE remains challenging due to nonlinearities and the absence of contraction properties, limiting its reliability for counterfactual analysis and comparative statics. This paper focuses on MFE in dynamic models where agents interact through a scalar function of the population distribution, referred to as the scalar interaction function. Such models naturally arise in a wide range of applications involving market dynamics and strategic competition. The main contribution of this paper is to introduce iterative algorithms that leverage the scalar interaction structure and are guaranteed to converge to the MFE under mild assumptions. Leveraging this structure, we also establish an MFE existence result for non-compact state spaces and analytical comparative statics. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first algorithms with global convergence guarantees in such settings. Unlike existing approaches, our algorithms do not rely on monotonicity or contraction properties, significantly broadening their applicability. Furthermore, we provide a model-free algorithm that learns the MFE via simulation and reinforcement learning techniques such as Q-learning and policy gradient methods without requiring prior knowledge of payoff or transition functions. We apply our algorithms to classic models of dynamic competition, such as capacity competition, and to competitive models motivated by online marketplaces, including ridesharing and inventory competition, as well as to social learning models. We show how key market parameters influence equilibrium outcomes through reliable comparative statics in these representative models, providing insights into the design of competitive systems.</description>

      <title>Hua-Chen New Theory of Economic Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19134v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Between 1957-1985, Chinese mathematician Loo-Keng Hua pioneered economic optimization theory through three key contributions: establishing economic stability's fundamental theorem, proving the uniqueness of equilibrium solutions in economic systems, and developing a consumption-integrated model 50 days before his death. Since 1988, Mu-Fa Chen has been working on Hua's theory. He introduced stochastics, namely Markov chains, to economic optimization theory. He updated and developed Hua's model and came up with a new model (Chen's model) which has become the starting point of a new economic optimization theory. Chen's theory can be applied to economic stability test, bankruptcy prediction, product ranking and classification, economic prediction and adjustment, economic structure optimization. Chen's theory can also provide efficient algorithms that are programmable and intelligent. {Stochastics} is the cornerstone of Chen's theory. There is no overlap between Chen's theory, and the existing mathematical economy theory and the economics developments that were awarded Nobel Prizes in Economics between 1969 and 2024. The distinguished features of Chen's theory from the existing theories are quantitative, calculable, predictable, optimizable, programmable and can be intelligent. This survey provides a theoretical overview of the newly published monograph \cite{5rw24}. Specifically, the invariant of the economic structure matrix, also known as the Chen's invariant, was first published in this survey.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Ranked candidate voting method based on Phragmen's procedure is described that can be used to produce a top-down proportional candidate list. The method complies with the Droop proportionality criterion satisfied by Single Transferable Vote. It also complies with house monotonicity and coherence, which are the ranked-candidate analogs of the divisor methods properties of always avoiding the Alabama and New State paradoxes. The highest ranked candidate in the list is the Instant Runoff winner, which is in at least one Droop proportional set of N winners for all N.</description>

      <title>A Deterministic and Linear Model of Dynamic Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17012v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a model of infinite horizon linear dynamic optimization and obtain results concerning existence of solution and satisfaction of the competitive condition and transversality condition being unconditionally sufficient for optimality of a trajectory. We also show that under some mild restrictions the optimal trajectory satisfies the Euler condition and a related transversality condition. The optimal trajectory satisfies the functional equation of dynamic programming. Under an additional convexity assumption for the two-period constraint sets, we show that the optimal value function is concave and continuous. Linearity bites when it comes to the definition of optimal decision rules which can no longer be guaranteed to be single-valued. We show that if all the two-period constraint sets are convex, then the optimal decision rule is an upper semi-continuous correspondence. For linear cake-eating problems, we obtain monotonicity results for the optimal value function and a conditional monotonicity result for optimal decision rules. We also introduce the concept of a two-phase linear cake eating problem and obtain a necessary condition that must be satisfied by all solutions of such problems. We show that for a class of linear dynamic optimization problems, known as interlinked linear dynamic optimization problems, a slightly modified version of the functional equation of dynamic programming is satisfied.</description>
