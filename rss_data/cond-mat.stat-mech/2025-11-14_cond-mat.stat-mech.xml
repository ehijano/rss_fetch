      <title>Learning of Statistical Field Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recovering microscopic couplings directly from data provides a route to solving the inverse problem in statistical field theories, one that complements the traditional-often computationally intractable-forward approach of predicting observables from an action or Hamiltonian. Here, we propose an approach for the inverse problem that uniformly accommodates systems with discrete, continuous, and hybrid variables. We demonstrate accurate parameter recovery in several benchmark systems-including Wegner's Ising gauge theory, $\phi^4$ theory, Schwinger and Sine-Gordon models, and mixed spin-gauge systems, and show how iterating the procedure under coarse-graining reconstructs full non-perturbative renormalization-group flows. This gives direct access to phase boundaries, fixed points, and emergent interactions without relying on perturbation theory. We also address a realistic setting where full gauge configurations may be unavailable, and reformulate learning algorithms for multiple field theories so that they are recovered directly using observables such as correlations from scattering data or quantum simulators. We anticipate that our methodology will find widespread use in practical learning of field theories in strongly coupled regimes where analytical tools might fail.</description>

      <title>Exact fluctuation relation for open systems beyond the Jarzynski equality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive exact fluctuation equalities for open systems that recover free energy differences between two equilibrium endpoints connected by nonequilibrium processes with arbitrary dynamics and coupling. The exponential of the free energy difference is expressed in terms of ensemble averages of the Hamiltonian of mean force (HMF) shift and the chi-squared divergence between the initial and final marginal probability distribution of the open system. A trajectory counterpart of this relation follows from an asymptotic equilibration postulate, which treats relaxation to the final stationary canonical state as a boundary condition rather than as a consequence of constraints on the driven dynamics. In the frozen-coupling regime, the HMF shift reduces to the bare-system Hamiltonian shift, yielding a clear heat-work decomposition. The Jarzynski equality (JE) is recovered under the assumption of Hamiltonian dynamics for the combined system. We validate the theory on a dissipative, phase-space-compressing drive followed by an underdamped Langevin relaxation, where the assumptions underlying the JE break down, whereas our equality reproduces the exact free energy differences.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Thermodynamics of Cooperative Biomolecular Machines: Fluctuation Relations and Hidden Detailed Balance Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine a biomolecular machine involving a driven, observable process coupled to a hidden process in a kinetically cooperative manner. A stochastic thermodynamics framework is employed to analyze a fluctuation theorem for the first-passage time of the observable process under nonequilibrium steady-state conditions. Based on a generic kinetic model, we demonstrate that, along first-passage trajectories, entropy production remains constant when the changes in stochastic entropy and free energy of the machine are balanced, which corresponds to zero net hidden flux through the initial state manifold. Under this condition, which we define quite generally, this first-passage time fluctuation theorem can be established, with its violation serving as an experimentally detectable signature of hidden detailed balance breaking (which we subsequently characterize). In addition, using an enzymatic model, we show that the violation of our first-passage time fluctuation theorem can be thought of as a consequence of the breakdown of local detailed balance in the steps linking coarse-grained states that correspond to the initial and intermediate state manifolds. In the absence of hidden current, the fluctuation theorem is restored, and a mesoscopic local detailed balance condition can be established, which has implications for the thermodynamic analysis of driven, coarse-grained systems. This work sheds significant light on the unique connections between stochastic thermodynamic quantities and kinetic measurements in complex cooperative networks.</description>

      <title>Backbone three-point correlation function in the two-dimensional Potts model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the three-point correlation function of the backbone in the two-dimensional $Q$-state Potts model using the Fortuin-Kasteleyn (FK) representation. The backbone is defined as the bi-connected skeleton of an FK cluster after removing all dangling ends and bridges. To circumvent the severe critical slowing down in direct Potts simulations for large $Q$, we employ large-scale Monte Carlo simulations of the O$(n)$ loop model on the hexagonal lattice, which is regarded to correspond to the Potts model with $Q=n^2$. Using a highly efficient cluster algorithm, we compute the universal three-point amplitude ratios for the backbone ($R_\text{BB}$) and FK clusters ($R_\text{FK}$). Our computed $R_\text{FK}$ exhibits excellent agreement with exact conformal field theory predictions, validating the reliability of our numerical approach. In the critical regime, we find that $R_\text{BB}$ is systematically larger than $R_\text{FK}$. Conversely, along the tricritical branch, $R_\text{BB}$ and $R_\text{FK}$ coincide within numerical accuracy, strongly suggesting that $R_\text{BB}=R_\text{FK}$ holds throughout this regime. This finding mirrors the known equality of the backbone and FK cluster fractal dimensions at tricriticality, jointly indicating that both structures share the same geometric universality.</description>

      <title>Chromatic Zeros on the Limit $G^{(p,\ell)}_\infty$ of the Family $G^{(p,\ell)}_m$ of Hierarchical Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the continuous accumulation set ${\cal B}_q(p,\ell)$ of zeros of the chromatic polynomial $P(G^{(p,\ell)}_m,q)$ in the limit $m \to \infty$, on a family of graphs $G^{(p,\ell)}_m$ defined such that $G^{(p,\ell)}_m$ is obtained from $G^{(p,\ell)}_{m-1}$ by replacing each edge (i.e., bond) on $G^{(p,\ell)}_m$ by $p$ paths each of length $\ell$ edges, starting with the tree graph $T_2$. Our method uses the property that the chromatic polynomial $P(G,q)$ of a graph $G$ is equal to the $v=-1$ evaluation of the partition function of the $q$-state Potts model, together with (i) the property that $Z(G^{(p,\ell)}_m,q,v)$ can be expressed via an exact closed-form real-space renormalization (RG) group transformation in terms of $Z(G^{(p,\ell)}_{m-1},q,v')$, where $v'=F_{(p,\ell),q}(v)$ is a rational function of $v$ and $q$ and (ii) ${\cal B}_q(p,\ell)(v)$ is the locus in the complex $q$-plane that separates regions of different asymptotic behavior of the $m$-fold iterated RG transformation $F_{(p,\ell),q}(v)$ in the $m \to \infty$ limit. Thus, our results involve calculations of region diagrams in the complex $q$-plane showing the type of behavior that occurs in the $m \to \infty$ limit of the $m$-fold iterated RG transformation mapping $F_{(p,\ell),q}(v)$ starting with the initial value $v=v_0=-1$. Calculations are presented of the maximal point $q_c(G^{(p,\ell)}_\infty)$ at which the locus ${\cal B}_q$ crosses the real-$q$ axis, as well as several other points at which, depending on $p$ and $\ell$, the locus ${\cal B}_q$ crosses this axis. We give explicit results for a variety of $(p,\ell)$ cases and observe a number of interesting features. Calculations of the ground-state degeneracy of the Potts antiferromagnet at $q_c(G^{(p,\ell)}_\infty)$ are presented. This work extends a previous study with R. Roeder of the $(p,\ell)=(2,2)$ case to higher $p$ and $\ell$ values.</description>

      <title>A master equation approach to the n-coalescent problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given an evolutionary model, such as Wright--Fisher (WF) or Moran, the n-coalescent problem consists of going backward in time to find for example the time to the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) and the topology of the tree. In the literature, this problem is tackled mostly by computing directly the random variable t, time to reach the MRCA. I show here that by shifting the focus from the random variable t to the joined variable (n,t), where n is the number of ancestors at time t, the problem is greatly simplified. Indeed, P(n,t), the probability of this variable, obeys a simpler master equation that can be solved in a straightforward way for the most general model. This probability can then be used to compute relevant information of the n-coalescent, for both random variables $t_{n}$ (random time to reach a given state n) and $n_{t}$ (random number of ancestors at a given time t). The cumulative distribution function for $t_{1}$ for example is $P(1,t)$. I give in this article the general solution for continuous time models such as Moran and discrete time ones such as WF.</description>

      <title>Cooling the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model using thermofield double states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze a simple and efficient experimental protocol to cool the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model to low temperatures. The protocol utilizes local couplings between two copies of an SYK model to create a gapped adiabatic path, between a high temperature product state and a low temperature thermofield double state. By smoothly varying the coupling strength between these two limits, one efficiently cools the SYK model. We support these predictions-and demonstrate fast cooling to the low-temperature gravitational regime-via exact numerical solutions to the large-N equations of motion that govern the ground state and dynamical properties of the coupled system. Finally, we present a theoretical framework based upon eigenstate thermalization that provides a microscopic explanation for the efficacy of the cooling protocol; intriguingly, this suggests that the protocol may be applicable for cooling strongly-interacting quantum Hamiltonians more broadly.</description>

      <title>Mutual information as a measure of renormalizability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Renormalization is an essential technique in field-theoretic descriptions of natural phenomena, where the absence of a UV-complete description yields an abundance of divergent quantities. While the renormalization prescription has been thoroughly refined for equilibrium systems, consistently extending it to out-of-equilibrium systems is an active area of research. In this paper, we identify a mutual information-based measure of renormalizability that applies to quantum field theories both in and out of equilibrium. Specifically, we use mutual information to characterize correlations between infinitesimal shells in momentum space and show that the logarithmic derivative of mutual information with mode separation, at large mode separation, is a measure of renormalizability. We first consider Minkowski spacetime, where we introduce dynamics by performing an interaction quench, initializing the field in the free theory vacuum and then turning on the interaction. We show that the late-time mutual information relaxes to that for the interacting vacuum and the logarithmic derivative at large mode separation is negative for super-renormalizable theories, zero for renormalizable (marginal) theories, and positive for non-renormalizable theories. We then consider a conformally-coupled scalar field on the Poincar\'{e} patch of de Sitter spacetime, initializing the field in the Bunch-Davies vacuum in the asymptotic past. For different self-interactions and at any finite time, we find that the resulting mutual information has the same qualitative behavior as a function of mode separation, demonstrating that it can be used as a reliable indicator of renormalizability.</description>

      <title>Temporal quantum interference in many-body programmable atom arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum superposition famously manifests as spatial interference, epitomized by the double-slit experiment. Its less explored temporal analogue, St\"{u}ckelberg interference, arises in driven systems where phases accumulated along distinct time-domain pathways recombine. Extending this phenomenon to large interacting systems introduces a new complexity as delicate phase relationships are disrupted by many-body interactions. Here we experimentally achieve controllable vacuum-state freezing in programmable Rydberg arrays of up to 100 atoms through many-body St\"{u}ckelberg interference, with visibility exceeding $70\%$ and excitation suppression to $1\%$ despite periodic driving that would typically induce heating. Comparing single and dual-frequency protocols across multiple geometries, we show that simultaneous modulation of detuning and Rabi frequency dramatically enhances interference-driven freezing. Finite-range interaction tails play a decisive role, producing interference patterns which constrained $PXP$ models cannot capture. Our results establish temporal interference as a scalable microscopic mechanism for Floquet control, enabling predictive many-body state engineering in large-scale platforms.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Probes of Quantum Geometry in Gapless Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Much of our understanding of gapless many-body quantum systems stems from their low-energy descriptions as conformal field theories. This is especially true in 1+1 dimensions, where such theories have an infinite-dimensional parameter space induced by their conformal symmetry. We reveal the associated quantum geometry by considering finite systems driven by time-dependent conformal transformations. For small deformations, perturbation theory predicts absorption rates and linear responses that are intrinsically related to components of the quantum geometric tensor. For arbitrarily large but adiabatic deformations, we show that periodic drives give rise to nontrivial return amplitudes involving the quantum metric, beyond the familiar leading order that only features a Berry phase. Our field-theoretic findings are universal, comprising general relations between measurable quantities and quantum geometry that only depend on the central charge of the conformal symmetry. This is supported by both analytical results for quantum dynamics under certain Floquet drives, and numerical simulations of gapless lattice models.</description>

      <title>Circling crystals in chiral active matter with self-alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a crystal composed of active units governed by self-alignment and chirality. The first mechanism acts as an effective torque that aligns the particle orientation with its velocity, while the second drives individual particles along circular orbits. We find that even a weak degree of chirality, when coupled with self-alignment, induces collective motion of the entire crystal along circular trajectories in space. We refer to this phase as a circling crystal. When chirality outweigh self-alignment, the circular global motion is suppressed in favor of vortex-like regions of coordinated motion. This state is characterized by oscillating spatial velocity correlations, a power law decay of the energy spectrum, and oscillatory temporal correlations. Our findings can be tested experimentally in systems ranging from epithelial tissues to swarming robots, governed by chirality and self-alignment.</description>

      <title>Potential-Programmed Operando Ensembles Govern Nitrate Electroreduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrocatalyst surfaces continuously reorganize on the timescale of catalytic turnover, obscuring the identification of active sites under operando conditions and hindering rational catalyst design. Here, we resolve the operando Cu(111) electrolyte interface for nitrate-to-ammonia electroreduction (NO3RR) via a multiscale modeling framework accelerated by a coverage-aware machine-learning potential. Rather than a single "average coverage" site, the working interface is a potential-gated statistical ensemble of 34 interconverting adsorbate motifs between -0.10 and -1.00 V (vs. SHE). Potential-driven shifts in motif populations produce a volcano-shaped activity trend peaking at -0.70 V, where the site-normalized turnover frequency reaches 0.015 s-1 with nearly 100% Faradaic efficiency to ammonia. The activation barriers across &gt;150 transition states collapse into a single linear relationship with the excess charge on the reacting Cu atoms ({\Delta}qCu), identifying interfacial charge redistribution as a unifying kinetic descriptor. The maximum activity arises not from uniform moderate coverage but from a 2NO/2NH2 quadrilateral microensemble that tunes {\Delta}qCu to an intermediate value, simultaneously lowering the N-O cleavage and N-H formation barriers. Reconceptualizing "coverage" as an ensemble of local microenvironments decouples thermodynamic stability from catalytic productivity. This perspective furnishes a parameter-free strategy by controlling motif populations and interfacial charge via the potential to program high-coverage electrocatalysis beyond the NO3RR.</description>

      <title>Rotational Jamming of Optical Matter Driven by Chiral Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical matter (OM), composed of optically bound metallic particles, can be rotated by transferring the spin angular momentum (SAM) of chiral light to the assembly. Rotating OM is a promising platform for optical micromachines, with potential applications in plasmofluidics and soft robotics. Understanding the dynamic states of such Brownian, micro-mechanical systems is a relevant issue. One key problem is understanding kinetic jamming and clogging. Studies of driven multiparticle systems have revealed that under suboptimal driving, the systems can stop moving, showing jamming transitions. It is important to identify dynamic regimes where crowding competes with driving and is susceptible to jamming in the context of optical micromachines. Through experiments supported by numerical simulations, we reveal assemblies with well-defined hexagonal or triangular symmetry that efficiently harness the SAM of incident chiral light, resulting in stable rotation. However, as the plasmonic-particle assembly grows and its dimensions approach the beam waist, new particles can disrupt this order. This causes a transition to a fluid-like state with less-defined symmetry, correlated with a significant reduction in transferred torque, causing rotation to stagnate or cease. We suggest this behaviour is analogous to a rotational jamming transition, where the rotational motion is arrested. Our findings establish a clear relationship between the structural symmetry of the OM assembly and its ability to harness SAM, providing new insights into controlling chiral light-matter interactions and offering a novel platform for studying jamming transitions.</description>

Abstract: From the AdS/CFT dictionary, we derive a bulk dual of the work distribution defined by the two-point measurement on the boundary, yielding a bulk formulation of the Tasaki-Crooks fluctuation theorem. We argue that this not only provides a holographic prescription of the work distribution, but is also expected to capture some "mesoscopic" aspects of quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Flocking transition in phoretically interacting active particles with pinning disorder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies in the collective behavior of active colloids have shown that a global polar order may emerge due to long-ranged chemo-repulsive interactions between them. Here, we report the role of pinning disorder in the flocking transition for such a system. To this end, we study the problem of chemically interacting active colloids with some fraction of the colloids randomly pinned over space such that they can only rotate while phoretically interacting with other particles. Using this model, we investigate the sustenance of global polar order in the presence of quenched disorder. We quantify the flocking transition by studying the global polarization, and the role of finite-size effects. We find that in the crystalline flocking phase, even a small fraction of pinning can destroy spatial crystalline order, although polar order in the form of a liquid phase is maintained. It is observed that polar order is sustained in a system with a higher pinning fraction if the long-ranged repulsive force is subsequently increased. However, in absence of chemo-repulsive forces between particles, polar order drastically decreases even with a smaller pinning fraction. Overall, this work suggests a novel route of solid-to-liquid transition that can be induced via "translationally inert" obstacles, that rotate but do not translate whilst interacting with the bulk.</description>

      <title>Information phases of partial projected ensembles generated from random quantum states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The projected ensemble -- an ensemble of pure states on a subsystem conditioned on projective measurement outcomes on its complement -- provides a finer probe of ergodicity and information structure than the reduced density matrix of the subsystem in bipartite quantum states. This framework can be generalised to partial projected ensembles in tripartite settings, where outcomes from part of the measured subsystem are discarded, leading to ensembles of mixed states. We show that information measures defined for such ensembles, in particular the Holevo information, yield a more detailed characterisation of how quantum information is distributed between subsystems compared to conventional entanglement measures. Using exact analytical results supported by numerical results, we uncover a qualitative change in the scaling of the Holevo information with system size in partial projected ensembles generated by Haar-random states, as the relative sizes of the subsystem are varied. In one phase, the Holevo information decays exponentially with system size, while in the other it grows linearly, thereby defining distinct information phases separated by sharp transitions signalled by non-analyticities in the Holevo information. The exponentially decaying phase rigorously establishes the existence of a measurement-invisible quantum-correlated phase -- a manifestation of many-body information scrambling with no bipartite analogue. Finally, we contrast this information-phase diagram with the entanglement-phase structure of tripartite Haar-random states obtained from logarithmic negativity, and show that the Holevo information reveals additional fine structure beyond conventional entanglement measures.</description>

      <title>Critical Motility-Induced Phase Separation in Three Dimensions is Consistent with Ising Universality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09069v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identifying the universality class of critical active phase transitions has been the subject of recent interest and controversy. Resolving these controversies will require robust numerical investigations to determine whether active critical exponents point to novel universality classes or are consistent with established ones. Here, we conduct large-scale computer simulations and a finite-size scaling analysis of the motility-induced phase separation (MIPS) of active Brownian hard spheres in three dimensions (3D), finding that the static and dynamic critical exponents all closely match those of the 3D Ising universality class with a conserved scalar order parameter. This finding is corroborated by a fluctuating hydrodynamic description of the critical dynamics of the order parameter field which flows to the Wilson-Fisher fixed point in three dimensions. Our work suggests that 3D MIPS and likely the entire phase diagram of active Brownian hard spheres is similar to that of molecular passive fluids despite the absence of Boltzmann statistics.</description>

      <title>Temperature and conditions for thermalization after canonical quenches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider quenches of a quantum system that is prepared in a canonical equilibrium state of one Hamiltonian and then evolves unitarily in time under a different Hamiltonian. Technically, our main result is a systematic expansion of the pre- and post-quench canonical ensembles in the quench strength. We first demonstrate how this can be used to predict the system's temperature after the quench from equilibrium properties at the pre-quench temperature. For a thermalizing post-quench system, it furthermore allows us to calculate equilibrium observable expectation values. Finally, in the presence of additional conserved quantities besides the Hamiltonian, we obtain a hierarchy of necessary conditions for thermalization towards the (post-quench) canonical ensemble. At first order, these thermalization conditions have a nice geometric interpretation in operator space with the canonical covariance as a semi-inner product: The quench operator (difference between post- and pre-quench Hamiltonians) and the conserved quantity must be orthogonal in the orthogonal complement of the post-quench Hamiltonian. We illustrate the results numerically for a variety of setups involving integrable and nonintegrable models.</description>

      <title>Graph minor embedding can affect sampling degenerate ground states using quantum annealing</title>

Abstract: Quantum annealing, as currently implemented in hardware, cannot fairly sample all ground states. Graph minor embedding, which maps a problem to the hardware graph of quantum annealers, affects sampling all states. In this study, we demonstrate the influence of graph minor embedding on fair sampling of degenerate ground states. For two embedded models that introduce auxiliary variables, numerical simulations of Schr\"odinger evolution revealed that fairness varies significantly depending on the embedding, and the chain strength is related to ground-state fairness. Using perturbation theory, we found that chain strength determines the energy landscape around ground states, with flatter landscapes having higher probabilities of being obtained.</description>

      <title>Inferring Higher-Order Couplings with Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06108v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Maximum entropy methods, rooted in the inverse Ising/Potts problem from statistical physics, are widely used to model pairwise interactions in complex systems across disciplines such as bioinformatics and neuroscience. While successful, these approaches often fail to capture higher-order interactions that are critical for understanding collective behavior. In contrast, modern machine learning methods can model such interactions, but their interpretability often comes at a prohibitive computational cost. Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) provide a computationally efficient alternative by encoding statistical correlations through hidden units in a bipartite architecture. In this work, we introduce a method that maps RBMs onto generalized Potts models, enabling the systematic extraction of interactions up to arbitrary order. Leveraging large-$N$ approximations, made tractable by the RBM's structure, we extract effective many-body couplings with minimal computational effort. We further propose a robust framework for recovering higher-order interactions in more complex generative models, and introduce a simple gauge-fixing scheme for the effective Potts representation. Validation on synthetic data demonstrates accurate recovery of two- and three-body interactions. Applied to protein sequence data, our method reconstructs contact maps with high fidelity and outperforms state-of-the-art inverse Potts models. These results establish RBMs as a powerful and efficient tool for modeling higher-order structure in high-dimensional categorical data.</description>

      <title>Relativistic model of spontaneous wave-function localization induced by nonHermitian colored noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07050v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a quantum field theory based on random nonHermitian actions, which upon quantization lead to stochastic nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger dynamics for the state vector. In this framework, Lorentz and spacetime translation symmetries are preserved only in a statistical sense: the probability distribution of the action remains invariant under these transformations. As a result, the theory describes ensembles of quantum-state trajectories whose probability distributions remain invariant under changes of reference frame. As a concrete example, we augment the Dirac action with a purely imaginary term coupling the fermion density operator to a universal colored noise. This noise is constructed by solving the d'Alembert equation with white noise as its source, using a generalized stochastic calculus in 1+3 dimensions. We demonstrate that the colored noise drives stochastic localization of wave packets and derive the localization length analytically. Remarkably, the localization length decreases as the size of the observable universe increases. Our model thus provides a potential framework for relativistic spontaneous wave-function collapse. While establishing consistency with Born's law remains an open challenge, the present work constitutes a step toward embedding collapse models into a Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory.</description>

Abstract: Droplet formation has emerged as an essential concept for the spatiotemporal organisation of biomolecules in cells. However, classical descriptions of droplet dynamics based on passive liquid-liquid phase separation cannot capture the complex situation inside cells. This review discusses three distinct aspects that are crucial in cells: (i) biomolecules are diverse and individually complex, implying that cellular droplets possess complex internal behaviour, e.g., in terms of their material properties; (ii) the cellular environment contains many solid-like structures that droplets can wet; (iii) cells are alive and use fuel to drive processes out of equilibrium. We illustrate how these principles control droplet nucleation, growth, position, and count to unveil possible regulatory mechanisms in biological cells and other applications of phase separation.</description>

      <title>Berry connection and quantum geometry in time-dependent systems with instantaneous quantum integrable field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18396v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study many-body quantum geometric effects in time-dependent system with emergent quantum integrable field theory instantaneously. We establish a theorem stating that the Berry connection matrix thus all associated geometric quantities of the system can be precisely characterized by excitations up to two particles from the initial quantum integrable system. To illustrate the many-body geometric influence, we analyze an Ising chain subjected to both a small longitudinal field and a slowly rotating transverse field, whose low-energy physics in the scaling limit is instantaneously governed by the quantum $E_8$ integrable field theory. Focusing on the quantum geometric potential (QGP), we show the QGP continuously suppresses the instantaneous energy gaps with decreasing longitudinal field, thereby enhancing many-body Landau-Zener tunneling as evidenced by the Loschmidt echo and its associated spectral entropy. The critical threshold for the longitudinal field strength is determined,where the spectral entropy linearly increases with system size and exhibits hyperscaling behavior when approaching to the threshold. As the longitudinal field passes the threshold and decreases toward zero, the QGP continuously leads to vanishing instantaneous energy gaps involving more low-energy excitations, resulting in increasing spectral entropy indicative of many-body Landau-Zener tunneling. Our results unveil telltale quantum geometric signatures in time-dependent many-body systems, elucidating the intricate interplay between quantum geometry and dynamics.</description>

      <title>Macroscopicity and observational deficit in states, operations, and correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12738v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To understand the emergence of macroscopic irreversibility from microscopic reversible dynamics, the idea of coarse-graining plays a fundamental role. In this work, we develop a unified inferential framework for macroscopic states, that is, coarse descriptions of microscopic quantum systems that can be inferred from macroscopic measurements. Building on quantum statistical sufficiency and Bayesian retrodiction, we characterize macroscopic states through equivalent abstract (algebraic) and explicit (constructive) formulations. Central to our approach is the notion of observational deficit, which quantifies the degree of irretrodictability of a state relative to a prior and a measurement. This leads to a general definition of macroscopic entropy as an inferentially grounded measure of asymmetry under Bayesian inversion. We formalize this structure in terms of inferential reference frames, defined by the pair consisting of a prior and a measurement, which encapsulate the observer's informational perspective. We then formulate a resource theory of microscopicity, treating macroscopic states as free states and introducing a hierarchy of macroscopicity-non-generating operations. This theory unifies and extends existing resource theories of coherence, athermality, and asymmetry. Finally, we apply the framework to study quantum correlations under observational constraints, introducing the notion of observational discord and deriving necessary and sufficient conditions for their vanishing in terms of information recoverability. This work is dedicated to Professor Ryszard Horodecki on the occasion of his 80th birthday, in deep admiration and gratitude for his pioneering contributions to quantum information theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17786v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-trivial geometry of electronic Bloch states gives rise to topological insulators which are robust against sufficiently weak randomness inevitably present in any quantum material. However, increasing disorder triggers a quantum phase transition into a featureless normal insulator. As the underlying quantum critical point is approached from the topological side, small scattered droplets of normal insulators start to develop in the system and their coherent nucleation causes ultimate condensation into a trivial insulator. Unless disorder is too strong, the normal insulator accommodates disjoint tiny topological puddles. Furthermore, in the close vicinity of such a transition the emergent islands of topological and trivial insulators display spatial fractal structures, a feature that is revealed only by local topological markers. Here we showcase this (possibly) generic phenomenon that should be apposite to dirty topological crystals of any symmetry class in any dimension from the Bott index and local Chern marker for a square-lattice-based disordered Chern insulator model.</description>

      <title>Thermalization in open many-body systems and KMS detailed balance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Starting from a microscopic description of weak system-bath interactions, we derive from first principles a quantum master equation that does not rely on the well-known rotating wave approximation. This includes generic many-body systems, with Hamiltonians with vanishingly small energy spacings that forbid that approximation. The equation satisfies a general form of detailed balance, called KMS, which ensures exact convergence to the many-body Gibbs state. Unlike the more common notion of GNS detailed balance, this notion is compatible with the absence of the rotating wave approximation. We show that the resulting Lindbladian dynamics not only reproduces the thermal equilibrium point up to a small renormalization of the system Hamiltonian, but it also approximates the true system evolution with an error that grows at most linearly in time, giving an exponential improvement upon previous estimates. This master equation has quasi-local jump operators, can be efficiently simulated on a quantum computer, and reduces to the usual Davies dynamics in the limit of a coarse-graining time much larger than the inverse of the smallest frequency difference. With it, we provide a rigorous model of many-body thermalization relevant to both open quantum systems and quantum algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08820v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a regularized fluctuating lattice Boltzmann model (Reg-FLBM) for the D3Q27 lattice, which incorporates thermal fluctuations through Hermite-based projections to ensure compliance with the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. By leveraging the recursive regularization framework, the model achieves thermodynamic consistency for both hydrodynamic and ghost modes. Compared to the conventional single-relaxation-time BGK-FLBM, the Reg-FLBM provides improved stability and a more accurate description of thermal fluctuations. The implementation is optimized for large-scale parallel simulations on GPU-accelerated architectures, enabling systematic investigation of fluctuation-driven phenomena in mesoscale and nanoscale fluid systems.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a three-dimensional vectorial extension of the Hopfield associative-memory model in which each neuron is a unit vector on $S^2$ and synaptic couplings are $3\times 3$ blocks generated through a vectorial Hebbian rule. The resulting block-structured operator is mathematically analogous to the Hessian of amorphous solids and induces a rigid energy landscape with deep minima for stored patterns. Simulations and spectral analysis show that the vectorial network substantially outperforms the classical binary Hopfield model. For moderate connectivity, the critical storage ratio $\gamma_c$ grows approximately linearly with the coordination number $Z$, while for $Z\gtrsim 40$ a high-connectivity regime emerges in which $\gamma_c$ systematically exceeds the extrapolated low-$Z$ linear fit. At the same time, a persistent spectral gap separates pattern modes from the bulk and basins of attraction enlarge, yielding enhanced robustness to initialization noise. Thus geometric constraints combined with amorphous-solid-inspired structure produce associative memories with superior storage and retrieval performance, especially in the high-connectivity ($Z \gtrsim 20$-$30$) regime.</description>

      <title>Replicated liquid theory in $1+\infty$ dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a replicated liquid theory for structural glasses which exhibit spatial variation of physical quantities along one axis, say $z$-axis. The theory becomes exact with infinite transverse dimension $d-1 \to \infty$. It provides an exact free-energy functional with space-dependent glass order parameter $\Delta_{ab}(z)$. As a first application of the scheme, we study diverging lengths associated with dynamic/static glass transitions of hardspheres with/without confining cavity. The exponents agree with those obtained in previous studies on related mean-field models. Moreover, it predicts a non-trivial spatial profile of the glass order parameter $\Delta_{ab}(z)$ within the cavity which exhibits a scaling feature approaching the dynamical glass transition.</description>
