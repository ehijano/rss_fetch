      <title>A proof for a part of noncrossed product theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first examples of noncrossed product division algebras were given by Amitsur in 1972. His method is based on two basic steps: (1) If the universal division algebra $U(k,n)$ is a $G$-crossed product then every division algebra of degree $n$ over $k$ should be a $G$-crossed product; (2) There are two division algebras over $k$ whose maximal subfields do not have a common Galois group. In this note, we give a short proof for the second step in the case where $\chr k\nmid n$ and $p^3|n$.</description>

      <title>On Semi-Nil Clean Rings with Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the notion of \textit{semi-nil clean} rings, defined as those rings in which each element can be expressed as a sum of a periodic and a nilpotent element. Among our results, we show that if $R$ is a semi-nil clean ring that is either NI or one-sided perfect, then $R$ is periodic. Additionally, we demonstrate that every group ring $RG$ of a nilpotent group $G$ over a weakly 2-primal or one-sided perfect ring $R$ is semi-nil clean if and only if $R$ is periodic and $G$ is locally finite.
  Moreover, we also study those rings in which every unit is a sum of a periodic and a nilpotent element, calling them \textit{unit semi-nil clean} rings. As a remarkable result, we show that if $R$ is an algebraic algebra over a field, then $R$ is unit semi-nil clean if and only if $R$ is periodic.
  Besides, we explore those rings in which non-zero elements are a sum of a torsion element and a nilpotent element, naming them \textit{t-fine} rings, which constitute a proper subclass of the class of all fine rings. One of the main results is that matrix rings over t-fine rings are again t-fine rings.</description>

      <title>Categorical properties and homological conjectures for bounded extensions of algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21480v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An extension $B\subset A$ of finite dimensional algebras is bounded if the $B$-$B$-bimodule $A/B$ is $B$-tensor nilpotent, its projective dimension is finite and $\mathrm{Tor}_i^B(A/B, (A/B)^{\otimes_B j})=0$ for all $i, j\geq 1$. We show that for a bounded extension $B\subset A$, the algebras $A$ and $B$ are singularly equivalent of Morita type with level. Additionally, under mild conditions, their stable categories of Gorenstein projective modules and Gorenstein defect categories are equivalent, respectively. Some homological conjectures are also investigated for bounded extensions, including Auslander-Reiten conjecture, finististic dimension conjecture, Fg condition, Han's conjecture, and Keller's conjecture. Applications to trivial extensions and triangular matrix algebras are given.
  In course of proof, we give some handy criteria for a functor between module categories to induce triangle functors between stable categories of Gorenstein projective modules and Gorenstein defect categories, which generalise some known criteria, and hence might be of independent interest.</description>
