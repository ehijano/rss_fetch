      <title>Towards realistic ocean flow decomposition using optimal balance with time-averaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decomposing oceanic and atmospheric flow fields into their slowly evolving balanced components and fast evolving wave components is essential for understanding processes like spontaneous wave emission. To study these processes, the decomposition into the linear geostrophic (slow) and non-geostrophic (fast) components is not precise enough. More precise methods, such as optimal balance and nonlinear normal mode decomposition, account for nonlinear effects, but their application has so far been limited to idealized model configurations that exclude irregular lateral boundaries, depth variations, a varying Coriolis parameter, or other environmental conditions. Here, we address these limitations by modifying the optimal balance method such that it is applicable to more realistic model setups. The modification employs a time-averaging procedure to project onto the linear geostrophic component, eliminating the need for a Fourier transformation as required in the original optimal balance method. We demonstrate analytically and experimentally that the new method converges to the original method when either the time-averaging period or the number of optimal balance iterations increases. We test the new method using a two-dimensional single-layer model and a three-dimensional non-hydrostatic model with varying initial conditions and Rossby numbers ranging from 0.03 to 0.5. In all tested configurations, the differences between balanced states obtained from the new method and those from the original method become exponentially small. Optimal balance with time-averaging thus comes forth as a promising new flow decomposition tool for complex flows.</description>

      <title>Carbon Trapping Efficiency of Hydropower Reservoirs under the Influence of a Tropical Climate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sedimentation in hydroelectric reservoirs is strongly impacted by anthropogenic activities within their upstream drainage basins. These activities, encompassing soil erosion and various other human-induced actions, have significant consequences for sedimentation patterns. This issue has been a subject of prolonged study, as sedimentation directly undermines the water storage capacity of reservoirs, consequently diminishing the overall efficiency of hydroelectric operations. Several scientists have dedicated their efforts to addressing the matter of reservoir sedimentation. This pursuit has led to the formulation of an indicator known as Sediment Trap Efficiency (STE), serving as a metric that quantifies the proportion of sedimentation within reservoirs relative to the influx of sediment from their upstream sources. This study seeks to present findings pertaining to carbon trapping efficiency observed across seven hydroelectric reservoirs in Brazil. The objective is to demonstrate the substantial relevance of carbon accumulation within these aquatic environments within the context of the carbon balance frameworks previously established.</description>

      <title>Meteorological assessment of vertical axis wind turbine energy generation potentials across two Swiss cities in complex terrain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wind energy is the most mature renewable energy technology, however, its exploitation in cities is often met with skepticism. Thanks to their ability to operate effectively at low wind from any direction, vertical axis wind turbines (VAWTs) offer an attractive opportunity for wind energy harvesting in cities, but limited evidence exists on their potential in complex urban environments, and the role of different geographical settings, local meteorological conditions, and urban characteristics remains unclear. Here we use realistic Weather Research and Forecast model high-resolution wind speed simulations alongside representative VAWT power curves to quantify the range of micro-generation potentials at the annual, seasonal, and diurnal scale across two Swiss cities (Lausanne and Geneva) residing in complex terrain. Our results show that Lausanne generally experiences higher (+24%) wind speed than Geneva. Both cities present the greatest micro-generation potential during the summer months, although Lausanne shows non-negligible potential also during the wintertime. Wind speed is higher during the nighttime in Lausanne and during the daytime in Geneva, due to the different interaction between the local lake-breeze circulation and the synoptic flow. Simulated performance of case-study VAWTs is dominated by cut-in wind speed and power curve inflection point. On average, in 2022, an individual VAWT would have produced 2665 kWh of total annual electricity, equivalent to 16.5 square meters of photovoltaic panels. These results highlight the need for research on urban wind energy featuring detailed city-scale assessments that account for urban heterogeneities and regional circulation patters, to inform future planning investment and engineering development.</description>

      <title>WSSM: Geographic-enhanced hierarchical state-space model for global station weather forecast</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Global Station Weather Forecasting (GSWF), a prominent meteorological research area, is pivotal in providing timely localized weather predictions. Despite the progress existing models have made in the overall accuracy of the GSWF, executing high-precision extreme event prediction still presents a substantial challenge. The recent emergence of state-space models, with their ability to efficiently capture continuous-time dynamics and latent states, offer potential solutions. However, early investigations indicated that Mamba underperforms in the context of GSWF, suggesting further adaptation and optimization. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we introduce Weather State-space Model (WSSM), a novel Mamba-based approach tailored for GSWF. Geographical knowledge is integrated in addition to the widely-used positional encoding to represent the absolute special-temporal position. The multi-scale time-frequency features are synthesized from coarse to fine to model the seasonal to extreme weather dynamic. Our method effectively improves the overall prediction accuracy and addresses the challenge of forecasting extreme weather events. The state-of-the-art results obtained on the Weather-5K subset underscore the efficacy of the WSSM</description>

      <title>Changes over time in the 100-year return value of climate model variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We assess evidence for changes in tail characteristics of wind, solar irradiance and temperature variables output from CMIP6 global climate models (GCMs) due to climate forcing. We estimate global and climate zone annual maximum and annual means for period (2015, 2100) from daily output of seven GCMs for daily wind speed, maximum wind speed, solar irradiance and near-surface temperature. We calculate corresponding annualised data for individual locations within neighbourhoods of the North Atlantic and Celtic Sea region. We consider output for three climate scenarios and multiple climate ensembles. We estimate non-stationary extreme value models for annual extremes, and non-homogeneous Gaussian regressions for annual means, using Bayesian inference. We use estimated statistical models to quantify the distribution of (i) the change in 100-year return value for annual extremes, and (2) the change in annual mean, over the period (2025, 2125). To summarise results, we estimate linear mixed effects models for observed variation of (i) and (ii). Evidence for changes in the 100-year return value for annual maxima of solar irradiance and temperature is much stronger than for wind variables over time and with climate scenario.</description>

      <title>ORCAst: Operational High-Resolution Current Forecasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present ORCAst, a multi-stage, multi-arm network for Operational high-Resolution Current forecAsts over one week. Producing real-time nowcasts and forecasts of ocean surface currents is a challenging problem due to indirect or incomplete information from satellite remote sensing data. Entirely trained on real satellite data and in situ measurements from drifters, our model learns to forecast global ocean surface currents using various sources of ground truth observations in a multi-stage learning procedure. Our multi-arm encoder-decoder model architecture allows us to first predict sea surface height and geostrophic currents from larger quantities of nadir and SWOT altimetry data, before learning to predict ocean surface currents from much more sparse in situ measurements from drifters. Training our model on specific regions improves performance. Our model achieves stronger nowcast and forecast performance in predicting ocean surface currents than various state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Distilling Machine Learning's Added Value: Pareto Fronts in Atmospheric Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The added value of machine learning for weather and climate applications is measurable through performance metrics, but explaining it remains challenging, particularly for large deep learning models. Inspired by climate model hierarchies, we propose that a full hierarchy of Pareto-optimal models, defined within an appropriately determined error-complexity plane, can guide model development and help understand the models' added value. We demonstrate the use of Pareto fronts in atmospheric physics through three sample applications, with hierarchies ranging from semi-empirical models with minimal parameters to deep learning algorithms. First, in cloud cover parameterization, we find that neural networks identify nonlinear relationships between cloud cover and its thermodynamic environment, and assimilate previously neglected features such as vertical gradients in relative humidity that improve the representation of low cloud cover. This added value is condensed into a ten-parameter equation that rivals deep learning models. Second, we establish a machine learning model hierarchy for emulating shortwave radiative transfer, distilling the importance of bidirectional vertical connectivity for accurately representing absorption and scattering, especially for multiple cloud layers. Third, we emphasize the importance of convective organization information when modeling the relationship between tropical precipitation and its surrounding environment. We discuss the added value of temporal memory when high-resolution spatial information is unavailable, with implications for precipitation parameterization. Therefore, by comparing data-driven models directly with existing schemes using Pareto optimality, we promote process understanding by hierarchically unveiling system complexity, with the hope of improving the trustworthiness of machine learning models in atmospheric applications.</description>
