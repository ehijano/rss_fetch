      <title>High-frequency lead-lag relationships in the Chinese stock index futures market: tick-by-tick dynamics of calendar spreads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lead-lag relationships, integral to market dynamics, offer valuable insights into the trading behavior of high-frequency traders (HFTs) and the flow of information at a granular level. This paper investigates the lead-lag relationships between stock index futures contracts of different maturities in the Chinese financial futures market (CFFEX). Using high-frequency (tick-by-tick) data, we analyze how price movements in near-month futures contracts influence those in longer-dated contracts, such as next-month, quarterly, and semi-annual contracts. Our findings reveal a consistent pattern of price discovery, with the near-month contract leading the others by one tick, driven primarily by liquidity. Additionally, we identify a negative feedback effect of the "lead-lag spread" on the leading asset, which can predict returns of leading asset. Backtesting results demonstrate the profitability of trading based on the lead-lag spread signal, even after accounting for transaction costs. Altogether, our analysis offers valuable insights to understand and capitalize on the evolving dynamics of futures markets.</description>

      <title>Estimation of bid-ask spreads in the presence of serial dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17401v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Starting from a basic model in which the dynamic of the transaction prices is a geometric Brownian motion disrupted by a microstructure white noise, corresponding to the random alternation of bids and asks, we propose moment-based estimators along with their statistical properties. We then make the model more realistic by considering serial dependence: we assume a geometric fractional Brownian motion for the price, then an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process for the microstructure noise. In these two cases of serial dependence, we propose again consistent and asymptotically normal estimators. All our estimators are compared on simulated data with existing approaches, such as Roll, Corwin-Schultz, Abdi-Ranaldo, or Ardia-Guidotti-Kroencke estimators.</description>

      <title>Navigating Uncertainty in ESG Investing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02163v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The widespread confusion among investors regarding Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) rankings assigned by rating agencies has underscored a critical issue in sustainable investing. To address this uncertainty, our research has devised methods that not only recognize this ambiguity but also offer tailored investment strategies for different investor profiles. By developing ESG ensemble strategies and integrating ESG scores into a Reinforcement Learning (RL) model, we aim to optimize portfolios that cater to both financial returns and ESG-focused outcomes. Additionally, by proposing the Double-Mean-Variance model, we classify three types of investors based on their risk preferences. We also introduce ESG-adjusted Capital Asset Pricing Models (CAPMs) to assess the performance of these optimized portfolios. Ultimately, our comprehensive approach provides investors with tools to navigate the inherent ambiguities of ESG ratings, facilitating more informed investment decisions.</description>
