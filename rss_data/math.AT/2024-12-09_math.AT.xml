      <title>Finiteness and finite domination in stratified homotopy theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study compactness and finiteness of an $\infty$-category $\mathcal{C}$ equipped with a conservative functor to a finite poset $P$. We provide sufficient conditions for $\mathcal{C}$ to be compact in terms of strata and homotopy links of $\mathcal{C}\rightarrow P$. Analogous conditions for $\mathcal{C}$ to be finite are also given. From these, we deduce that, if $X\rightarrow P$ is a conically stratified space with the property that the weak homotopy type of its strata, and of strata of its local links, are compact (respectively finite) $\infty$-groupoids, then $\text{Exit}_P(X)$ is compact (respectively finite). This gives a positive answer to a question of Porta and Teyssier. If $X\rightarrow P$ is equipped with a conically smooth structure (e.g. a Whitney stratification), we show that $\text{Exit}_P(X)$ is finite if and only the weak homotopy types of the strata of $X\rightarrow P$ are finite. The aforementioned characterization relies on the finiteness of $\text{Exit}_P(X)$, when $X\rightarrow P$ is compact and conically smooth. We conclude our paper by showing that the analogous statement does not hold in the topological category. More explicitly, we provide an example of a compact $C^0$-stratified space whose exit paths $\infty$-category is compact, but not finite. This stratified space was constructed by Quinn. We also observe that this provides a non-trivial example of a $C^0$-stratified space which does not admit any conically smooth structure.</description>

      <title>Super-Polynomial Growth of the Generalized Persistence Diagram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Generalized Persistence Diagram (GPD) for multi-parameter persistence naturally extends the classical notion of persistence diagram for one-parameter persistence. However, unlike its classical counterpart, computing the GPD remains a significant challenge. The main hurdle is that, while the GPD is defined as the M\"obius inversion of the Generalized Rank Invariant (GRI), computing the GRI is intractable due to the formidable size of its domain, i.e., the set of all connected and convex subsets in a finite grid in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with $d \geq 2$. This computational intractability suggests seeking alternative approaches to computing the GPD.
  In order to study the complexity associated to computing the GPD, it is useful to consider its classical one-parameter counterpart, where for a filtration of a simplicial complex with $n$ simplices, its persistence diagram contains at most $n$ points. This observation leads to the question: 'Given a $d$-parameter simplicial filtration, could the cardinality of its GPD (specifically, the support of the GPD) also be bounded by a polynomial in the number of simplices in the filtration?' This is the case for $d=1$, where we compute the persistence diagram directly at the simplicial filtration level. If this were also the case for $d\geq2$, it might be possible to compute the GPD directly and much more efficiently without relying on the GRI.
  We show that the answer to the question above is negative, demonstrating the inherent difficulty of computing the GPD. More specifically, we construct a sequence of $d$-parameter simplicial filtrations where the cardinalities of their GPDs are not bounded by any polynomial in the the number of simplices. Furthermore, we show that several commonly used methods for constructing multi-parameter filtrations can give rise to such "wild" filtrations.</description>

      <title>Barcoding Invariants and Their Equivalent Discriminating Power</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The persistence barcode (equivalently, the persistence diagram), which can be obtained from the interval decomposition of a persistence module, plays a pivotal role in applications of persistent homology. For multi-parameter persistent homology, which lacks a complete discrete invariant, and where persistence modules are no longer always interval decomposable, many alternative invariants have been proposed. Many of these invariants are akin to persistence barcodes, in that they assign (possibly signed) multisets of intervals. Furthermore, those invariants assign any interval decomposable module to its corresponding multiset of intervals. Naturally, identifying the relationships among invariants of this type, or ordering them by their discriminating power, is a fundamental question. To address this, we formalize the notion of barcoding invariants and compare their discriminating powers. Notably, this formalization enables us to prove that all barcoding invariants with the same basis possess equivalent discriminating power. One implication of our result is that introducing a new barcoding invariant does not add any value in terms of its generic discriminating power, even if the new invariant is distinct from the existing barcoding invariants. This suggests the need for a more flexible and adaptable comparison framework for barcoding invariants. Along the way, we generalize several recent results on the discriminative power of invariants for poset representations within our unified framework.</description>

      <title>Constructing projective modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss elements of a social history of the theory of projective modules over commutative rings. We attempt to study the question: how did the theory of projective modules become one of "mainstream" focus in mathematics? To do this, we begin in what one might call the pre-history of projective modules, describing the mathematical culture into which the notion of projective module was released. These recollections involve four pieces: (a) analyzing aspects of the theory of fiber bundles, as it impinges on algebraic geometry, (b) understanding the rise of homological techniques in algebraic topology, (c) describing the influence of category-theoretic ideas in topology and algebra and (d) revisiting the story of the percolation of sheaf-theoretic ideas through algebraic geometry.
  We will then argue that it was this unique confluence of mathematical events that allowed projective modules to emerge as objects of central mathematical importance. More precisely, we will first argue that, in the context of social currents of the time, projective modules initially were isolated as objects of purely technical convenience reflecting the aesthetic sensibilities of the creators of the fledgling theory of homological algebra. Only later did they transcend this limited role to become objects of "mainstream importance" due to influence from the theory of algebraic fiber bundles and the theory of sheaves. Along the way, we aim to show how strong personal ties emanating from the Bourbaki movement and its connections in mathematical centers including Paris, Princeton and Chicago were essential to the entrance, propagation and mainstream mathematical acceptance of the theory.</description>

      <title>Mixup Barcodes: Quantifying Geometric-Topological Interactions between Point Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We combine standard persistent homology with image persistent homology to define a novel way of characterizing shapes and interactions between them. In particular, we introduce: (1) a mixup barcode, which captures geometric-topological interactions (mixup) between two point sets in arbitrary dimension; (2) simple summary statistics, total mixup and total percentage mixup, which quantify the complexity of the interactions as a single number; (3) a software tool for playing with the above.
  As a proof of concept, we apply this tool to a problem arising from machine learning. In particular, we study the disentanglement in embeddings of different classes. The results suggest that topological mixup is a useful method for characterizing interactions for low and high-dimensional data. Compared to the typical usage of persistent homology, the new tool is sensitive to the geometric locations of the topological features, which is often desirable.</description>
