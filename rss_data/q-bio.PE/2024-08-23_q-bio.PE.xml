      <title>Sex chromosome evolution: The classical paradigm and so much beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sex chromosomes have independently evolved in species with separate sexes in most lineages across the tree of life. However, the well-accepted canonical model of sex chromosome evolution is not universally supported. There is no single trajectory for sex chromosome formation and evolution across the tree of life, suggesting the underlying mechanisms and evolutionary forces are diverse and lineage specific. We review the diversity of sex chromosome systems, describe the canonical model of sex chromosome evolution, and summarize studies challenging various aspects of this model. They include evidence that many lineages experience frequent sex chromosome turnovers or maintain homomorphic sex chromosomes over long periods of time, suggesting sex chromosome degeneration is not inevitable. Sometimes the sex-limited Y/W chromosomes expand before they contract in size. Both transposable elements and gene gains could contribute to this size expansion, which further challenges gene loss being the hallmark of sex chromosome degeneration. Finally, empirical support for the role of sexually antagonistic selection as a driver of recombination suppression on sex chromosomes remains elusive. We summarize models that result in loss of recombination without invoking sexually antagonistic selection, which have not been empirically verified yet, and suggest future avenues for sex chromosome research.</description>

      <title>Self-Organization in Computation &amp; Chemistry: Return to AlChemy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How do complex adaptive systems, such as life, emerge from simple constituent parts? In the 1990s Walter Fontana and Leo Buss proposed a novel modeling approach to this question, based on a formal model of computation known as $\lambda$ calculus. The model demonstrated how simple rules, embedded in a combinatorially large space of possibilities, could yield complex, dynamically stable organizations, reminiscent of biochemical reaction networks. Here, we revisit this classic model, called AlChemy, which has been understudied over the past thirty years. We reproduce the original results and study the robustness of those results using the greater computing resources available today. Our analysis reveals several unanticipated features of the system, demonstrating a surprising mix of dynamical robustness and fragility. Specifically, we find that complex, stable organizations emerge more frequently than previously expected, that these organizations are robust against collapse into trivial fixed-points, but that these stable organizations cannot be easily combined into higher order entities. We also study the role played by the random generators used in the model, characterizing the initial distribution of objects produced by two random expression generators, and their consequences on the results. Finally, we provide a constructive proof that shows how an extension of the model, based on typed $\lambda$ calculus, \textcolor{black}{could simulate transitions between arbitrary states in any possible chemical reaction network, thus indicating a concrete connection between AlChemy and chemical reaction networks}. We conclude with a discussion of possible applications of AlChemy to self-organization in modern programming languages and quantitative approaches to the origin of life.</description>

      <title>Bayesian mixture models for phylogenetic source attribution from consensus sequences and time since infection estimates</title>

Abstract: In stopping the spread of infectious diseases, pathogen genomic data can be used to reconstruct transmission events and characterize population-level sources of infection. Most approaches for identifying transmission pairs do not account for the time passing since divergence of pathogen variants in individuals, which is problematic in viruses with high within-host evolutionary rates. This prompted us to consider possible transmission pairs in terms of phylogenetic data and additional estimates of time since infection derived from clinical biomarkers. We develop Bayesian mixture models with an evolutionary clock as signal component and additional mixed effects or covariate random functions describing the mixing weights to classify potential pairs into likely and unlikely transmission pairs. We demonstrate that although sources cannot be identified at the individual level with certainty, even with the additional data on time elapsed, inferences into the population-level sources of transmission are possible, and more accurate than using only phylogenetic data without time since infection estimates. We apply the approach to estimate age-specific sources of HIV infection in Amsterdam MSM transmission networks between 2010-2021. This study demonstrates that infection time estimates provide informative data to characterize transmission sources, and shows how phylogenetic source attribution can then be done with multi-dimensional mixture models.</description>

      <title>Two competing populations with a common environmental resource</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01437v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Feedback-evolving games is a framework that models the co-evolution between payoff functions and an environmental state. It serves as a useful tool to analyze many social dilemmas such as natural resource consumption, behaviors in epidemics, and the evolution of biological populations. However, it has primarily focused on the dynamics of a single population of agents. In this paper, we consider the impact of two populations of agents that share a common environmental resource. We focus on a scenario where individuals in one population are governed by an environmentally ``responsible" incentive policy, and individuals in the other population are environmentally ``irresponsible". An analysis on the asymptotic stability of the coupled system is provided, and conditions for which the resource collapses are identified. We then derive consumption rates for the irresponsible population that optimally exploit the environmental resource, and analyze how incentives should be allocated to the responsible population that most effectively promote the environment via a sensitivity analysis.</description>

      <title>Good Modelling Software Practices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.21051v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Frequently in socio-environmental sciences, models are used as tools to represent, understand, project and predict the behaviour of these complex systems. Along the modelling chain, Good Modelling Practices have been evolving that ensure -- amongst others -- that models are transparent and their results replicable. Whenever such models are represented in software, Good Modelling meet Good Software Practices, such as a tractable development workflow, good code, collaborative development and governance, continuous integration and deployment; and they meet Good Scientific Practices, such as attribution of copyrights and acknowledgement of intellectual property, publication of a software paper and archiving. Too often in existing socio-environmental model software, these practices have been regarded as an add-on to be considered at a later stage only; modellers have shied away from publishing their model as open source out of fear that having to add good practices is too demanding. We here argue for making a habit of following a list of simple and not so simple practices early on in the implementation of the model life cycle. We contextualise cherry-picked and hands-on practices for supporting Good Modelling Practice, and we demonstrate their application in the example context of the Viable North Sea fisheries socio-ecological systems model.</description>
