      <title>Self-induced nonreciprocity from asymmetric photonic topological insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic topological insulators and self-induced nonreciprocity based on nonlinear effects in asymmetric structures have garnered increased attention due to their potential applications in quantum information technologies and advanced photonic integrated circuits. In this study, we combine these two fields and present asymmetric photonic crystal designs based on all-dielectric checkerboard structures forming topological interfaces. The resulting topological photonic structures lead to the emergence of a narrowband leaky mode in their linear transmission response accompanied by an edge state with topological protection. The incorporation of the nonlinear optical Kerr effect in the system results to spectral tunability and transmission nonreciprocity in the induced topological edge states as the input beam intensity is increased due to the introduction of asymmetric defects along the interface. We envision that the findings presented in our work will lead to tunable photonic topological insulators with nonreciprocal response that promise to provide new avenues for the development of next-generation photonic devices and quantum optical technologies.</description>

      <title>Designing across domains with declarative thinking: Insights from the 96-Eyes ptychographic imager project</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents a practitioner's reflection on applying declarative, 5th generation, problem formulation language (5GL) to de novo imaging system design, informed by experiences across the interdisciplinary research in academia and cross-functional product development within the private sector. Using the 96-Eyes project: 96-camera parallel multi-modal imager for high-throughput drug discovery as a representative case, I illustrate how project requirements, ranging from hardware constraints to life sciences needs, can be formalized into machine-readable problem statements to preserve mission-critical input from diverse domain stakeholders. This declarative approach enhances transparency, ensures design traceability, and minimizes costly misalignment across optical, algorithmic, hardware-accelerated compute, and life sciences teams.
  Alongside the technical discussion of 5GL with real-world code examples, I reflect on the practical barriers to adopting 5GL in environments where imperative, 3rd-generation languages (3GL) remain the default medium for inter-team collaboration. Rather than offering an one-size-fits-all solution, these learned lessons highlight how programming paradigms implicitly shapes research workflows through existing domain hierarchies. The discussion aims to invite further explorations into how declarative problem formulations can facilitate innovation in settings where concurrent R\&amp;{}D workflows are gaining traction, as opposed to environments where sequential, phase-driven workflows remain the norm.</description>

      <title>Berry Curvature Dipole-Induced Chiral Terahertz Gain and Lasing in Bulk Tellurium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the use of Berry curvature dipole in $n$-doped Tellurium as a mechanism for achieving terahertz amplification and lasing by applying a DC electric field. When the electrical bias and wave vector are aligned along the trigonal $c$-axis, the right-handed circularly polarized mode experiences amplification at relatively low bias, while the left-handed mode is attenuated. Furthermore, when the electrical bias and wave vector are orthogonal to the $c$-axis, the structure supports elliptically polarized eigenmodes that also exhibit gain under suitable bias conditions, where the degree of ellipticity is tunable by the applied bias. We also investigate lasing conditions for a Fabry-Perot cavity incorporating biased Te as an active medium. Due to the resonance in the dielectric permittivity of Tellurium, there are discrete lasing intervals. Our results show that bulk chiral Tellurium could be used as an electrically tunable, polarization-selective gain medium for micrometer-scale terahertz lasers, with lasing achievable at bias fields below the material's breakdown threshold, paving the way towards new terahertz devices.</description>

      <title>Plasmon-enhanced ultrafast time-resolved spectroscopy of NV-containing diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated ultrafast nonlinear optical effects in nitrogen-vacancy (NV)-containing diamond which is in contact with a gold-coated blazed diffraction grating using a pump-probe reflectivity technique. The reflectivity change caused by optical Kerr effect and two-photon absorption was enhanced several times because of the electric field enhancement induced by the propagating surface plasmon (PSP). Furthermore, by performing measurements with varying the incident angle of the pump beam and numerical simulations of the electric field using the Finite Difference Time Domain method, signal enhancement due to the PSP was confirmed both experimentally and theoretically. This study paves the way for applications based on enhanced nonlinear optical effects in diamond.</description>

      <title>Energy-Efficient Precoding for Dense VCSEL-Based OWC Systems Under a Cooperative Broadcast Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As 6G and beyond aim for sustainable, high-capacity wireless connectivity, optical wireless communication (OWC) has emerged as a compelling solution.Recent advances in vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) arrays have significantly enhanced OWC performance, enabling high-speed, low-power data transmission. However, dense VCSEL deployments introduce challenges related to interference and energy efficiency (EE). This paper proposes a scalable precoding framework for EE maximization in fully cooperative VCSEL-based OWC broadcast systems. We formulate a non-convex optimization problem to design the precoding matrix under practical optical constraints while guaranteeing minimum user rates. To solve this, we apply Dinkelbach's method to handle the fractional objective and the inner approximation technique to iteratively convexify and solve the problem. Simulation results show that our approach consistently outperforms regularized zero-forcing in terms of EE, particularly in large-scale deployments, demonstrating its potential for next-generation sustainable dense OWC networks.</description>

      <title>Robust Circularly Polarized Luminescence via Quasi-Bound States in the Continuum in Intrinsic Chiral Silicon Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a circularly polarized photoluminescence emission, with dissymmetry factors $g_\mathrm{PL}$ over 0.1, from achiral organic dye molecules by leveraging quasi-bound states in the continuum (quasi-BICs) and surface lattice resonances (SLRs) in intrinsic silicon chiral metasurfaces. We find that the $g_\mathrm{PL}$ associated with the quasi-BIC mode remains robust against variations in emission angle and dye thickness owing to its strong lateral field confinement. In contrast, the $g_\mathrm{PL}$ of the SLR mode exhibits sign inversion depending on the emission energy and dye layer thickness. The experimental results are supported by mode decomposition analysis, helicity density analysis, and near-field spatial distribution of the electric field. These findings illustrate the relevance of the emitter's layer thickness in optimizing the emission of circularly polarized light. They also elaborate on the robustness of chiral quasi-BICs, offering insights into chiral light-matter interactions and advancing the design of circularly polarized light-emitting devices.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Nonlinear Pulse Dynamics in Multimode Silicon Nitride Waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an open-source multimode nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation-based simulation to investigate spatiotemporal nonlinear pulse propagation in thin-film silicon nitride (SiN) waveguides. Using this framework, we analyze femtosecond pulse evolution under diverse excitation conditions in a 6 {\mu}m wide SiN waveguide supporting six TE modes. Our results reveal that mode selection and power distribution critically govern nonlinear coupling, soliton fission, and dispersive wave generation, leading to broadband spectra exceeding 3 {\mu}m. Our findings reveal that input mode engineering is a powerful strategy for tailoring ultrafast nonlinear dynamics in integrated photonic platforms, with applications in supercontinuum generation, frequency combs, and programmable nonlinear optics.</description>

      <title>MEMS chip-based single proof-mass triaxial fiber-optic accelerometer with ultra-low noise level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-precision triaxial acceleration detection holds critical applications in seismic wave detection, geological resource exploration, and aerospace systems. Fabry-Perot (FP) optical sensors have gained widespread adoption in these domains due to their compact footprint and immunity to electromagnetic interference. Nevertheless, conventional three-axis measurements predominantly rely on assembling multiple single-axis transducers, introducing limitations such as increased device volume and misalignment errors. In this paper, we demonstrate a MEMS based monolithically integrated triaxial optical accelerometer that integrates a compact size with minimal noise and low crosstalk. The triaxial sensing structure employs a shared proof mass, achieving significant miniaturization compared to conventional multi-chip assembled triaxial optical accelerometers. In-plane sensing is realized through folded spring beams, while out-of-plane detection utilizes U-shaped suspension beams with widened central segments to suppress cross-axis sensitivity and enhance mechanical responsivity. Experimental results demonstrate that an operational bandwidth of 1\sim35 Hz, a minimum detectable acceleration of 4.12 ng/\sqrt{Hz}, and crosstalk below 0.023\%. The compact sensor footprint measures 16 mm \times 16 mm \times 0.5 mm. This optical accelerometer achieves nano-g resolution in the three-axis direction, demonstrating strong potential for applications in seismic wave detection and other precision vibration monitoring fields.</description>

      <title>Photo-Thermally Tunable Photon-Pair Generation in Dielectric Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photon-pair sources based on spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM) in integrated photonics are often spectrally static. We demonstrate and model a fundamental thermo-optical mechanism that modulates photon-pair generation in amorphous silicon (a-Si) thin films and metasurfaces via SFWM. Femtosecond-pulsed excitation yields g2(0) higher than 400 in unpatterned a-Si, confirming high-purity nonclassical emission. Resonant a-Si metasurfaces produce photon pairs at rates exceeding 3.8 kHz under 0.6 mW pump power through Mie-type modes. Pump absorption induces localized heating that redshifts resonances, altering modal overlap and SFWM efficiency, leading to deviations from the quadratic power scaling expected in the undepleted regime. Coupled electromagnetic and heat-transfer simulations quantitatively reproduce these trends. Polarization-resolved measurements show nearly isotropic nonlinear responses, with 3 times higher third-order susceptibility of a-Si compared to poly-Si. This work positions a-Si as a bright, CMOS-compatible quantum photonics platform and identifies thermo-optical detuning as a key mechanism that should be considered-and potentially harnessed-in integrated photon-pair sources.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically design a hybrid plasmonic dielectric refractive index biosensor comprising ametal insulator metal (MIM) bus waveguide evanescently coupled to a silicon core resonator. The geometry is optimized with a genetic algorithm (GA) using Ansys Lumerical FDTD simulations, targeting maximal sensitivity and figure of merit while minimizing the resonance linewidth. The optimized device achieves a sensitivity of 1276 nm/RIU, a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 11.89nm, a quality factor of 221, and a figure of merit of 107 RIU1 (defined as S/FWHM). These results demonstrate precise discrimination of small refractive index variations and support the sensors applicability to label free biochemical and medical diagnostics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-Pixel Imaging enables reconstructing objects using a single detector through sequential illuminations with structured light patterns. We propose a bilevel optimisation method for learning task-specific, binary illumination patterns, optimised for applications like single-pixel fluorescence microscopy. We address the non-differentiable nature of binary pattern optimisation using the Straight-Through Estimator and leveraging a Total Deep Variation regulariser in the bilevel formulation. We demonstrate our method on the CytoImageNet microscopy dataset and show that learned patterns achieve superior reconstruction performance compared to baseline methods, especially in highly undersampled regimes.</description>

      <title>Efficient and scalable inter-module switching for distributed quantum computing architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computers of the future will likely be modular by necessity or by design. Modularity is inevitable if the substrate cannot support the desired error-correction code due to its planar geometry or manufacturing constraints resulting in a limited number of logical qubits per module. Even if the computer is compact enough there may be functional requirements to distribute the quantum computation substrate over distant regions of varying scales. In both cases, matter-based quantum information, such as spins, ions or neutral atoms, is the most conveniently transmitted or mediated by photonic interconnects. To avoid long algorithm execution times and reduce errors, each module of a universal quantum computer should be dynamically interconnected with as many other modules as possible. This task relies on an optical switching network providing any-to-any or sufficiently high simultaneous connectivity. In this work we construct several novel and decentralized switching schemes based on the properties of the Generalized Mach-Zehnder Interferometer (GMZI) that are more economic and less noisy compared to commonly considered alternatives while achieving the same functionality.</description>

      <title>Work extraction from a quantum battery charged through an array of coupled cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the problem of work extraction from a cavity-based quantum battery that is remotely charged via a transmission line composed of an array of coupled single-mode cavities. For uniform coupling along the line, we show that the ergotropy of the battery, evaluated at the point of maximum power transfer, decreases with the length of the charging line and vanishes beyond a critical size. By carefully engineering the initial state of the charger, nonzero ergotropy can still be harvested even beyond this critical length. We further examine scenarios in which the charging line is initialized in an entangled state, as well as configurations with nonuniform, parabolically varying coupling strengths. In the latter case, we demonstrate that high ergotropy values can be restored, highlighting the potential of spatially engineered interactions to enhance quantum battery performance.</description>

      <title>First-Principles-Informed Non-Hermitian Hamiltonian for Guided Resonances in Photonic Crystal Slabs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a first-principles--informed non-Hermitian Hamiltonian formalism for guided resonances in photonic crystal slabs, derived from Maxwell's equations via a generalized guided-mode expansion. By expanding the electromagnetic fields over the complete mode basis of an unpatterned slab and systematically integrating out radiative Fabry-P\'erot channels, we obtain the analytical operator structure of the Hamiltonian, which treats guided-mode coupling and radiation losses on equal footing. For specific geometries, the Hamiltonian coefficients can be computed from numerical mode profiles or extracted from full-wave simulations, enabling accurate modeling without phenomenological assumptions. As a case study, we investigate hexagonal lattices with both preserved and broken $C_6$ symmetry, demonstrating predictive agreement for complex band structures, near-field distributions, and far-field polarization patterns. In particular, the formalism reproduces symmetry-protected bound states in the continuum (BICs) at the $\Gamma$ point, accidental off-$\Gamma$ BICs near the $\Gamma$ point, and the emergence of chiral exceptional points (EPs). It also captures the tunable behavior of eigenmodes near the $K$ point, including Dirac-point shifts and the emergence of quasi-BICs or bandgap openings, depending on the nature of $C_6$ symmetry breaking. This approach enables predictive and efficient modeling of complex photonic resonances, revealing their topological and symmetry-protected characteristics in non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Distributed acoustic sensing for ocean applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18344v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extensive monitoring of acoustic activities is important for many fields, including biology, security, oceanography, and Earth science. Distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) is an evolving technique for continuous, wide-coverage measurements of mechanical vibrations, which is suited to ocean applications. DAS illuminates an optical fiber with laser pulses and measures the backscattered wave due to small random variations in the refractive index of the material. External stimuli, such as mechanical strain due to acoustic wavefields impinging on the fiber-optic cable, modulate the backscattered wave. Continuous measurement of the backscattered signal provides a distributed sensing modality of the impinging wavefield. Considering the potential use of existing telecommunication fiber-optic cables deployed across the oceans, DAS has emerged as a promising technology for monitoring the underwater soundscape. This review presents advances in DAS in the last decade and details the underlying physics from electromagnetic to mechanical and eventually acoustic quantities. To guide the use of DAS for ocean applications, the effect of DAS acquisition parameters in signal processing is explained. Finally, DAS is demonstrated on data from the Ocean Observatories Initiative Regional Cabled Array for the detection of sound sources, such as whales, ships, and earthquakes.</description>

      <title>First Steps Toward the Development of a Straight-Line Reference Alignment System for Future Accelerators at CERN Using Pseudo-Nondiffracting Layer Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15234</link>

Abstract: This paper presents experimental results that allow for the performance evaluation of a straight-line reference alignment system based on pseudo-nondiffracting Layer beams. Sensors, developed specifically for this system, feature four linear CMOS chips and a square aperture. This allows for simultaneous measurements along the beam path without disrupting the laser reference. Measurements, conducted over a distance of 2 m from the first to the last sensor, were compared with a laser tracker measurement to assess the sensor performance. The alignment reference generated by the Layer Beams exhibited a repeatability and reproducibility root-mean-square error (RMSE) of less than 30 ${\mu}$m. The relative alignment precision for a known displacement was validated with a standard deviation of 4.3 ${\mu}$m. The results highlight the underlying sources of noise, which are induced mainly by the cover glass, the protective film of the pixels, and the dark noise of the CMOS chips. Solutions to address these challenges are proposed. Additionally, a proof-of-concept for future development of a radiation-hard sensor utilizing optical fiber matrices is demonstrated. The RMSE of the reference position detection introduced by the fiber matrix remained below 1.3 ${\mu}$m. This would allow the sensor to be used reliably in high-radiation environments typical for accelerator facilities. This study serves as a foundational step toward developing a robust straight-line reference alignment system based on pseudo-nondiffracting Layer beams intended for deployment in the accelerator facilities.</description>

      <title>Time-bin encoded quantum key distribution over 120 km with a telecom quantum dot source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) with deterministic single photon sources has been demonstrated over intercity fiber and free-space channels. The previous implementations relied mainly on polarization encoding schemes, which are susceptible to birefringence, polarization-mode dispersion and polarization-dependent loss in practical fiber networks. In contrast, time-bin encoding offers inherent robustness and has been widely adopted in mature QKD systems using weak coherent laser pulses. However, its feasibility in conjunction with a deterministic single-photon source has not yet been experimentally demonstrated. In this work, we construct a time-bin encoded QKD system employing a high-brightness quantum dot (QD) single-photon source operating at telecom wavelength. Our proof-of-concept experiment successfully demonstrates the possibility of secure key distribution over fiber link of 120 km, while maintaining extraordinary long-term stability over 6 hours of continuous operation. This work provides the first experimental validation of integrating a quantum dot single-photon source with time-bin encoding in a telecom-band QKD system. In addition, it demonstrates the highest secure key rate among the time-bin QKDs based on single-photon sources. This development signifies a substantial advancement in the establishment of a robust and scalable QKD network based on solid-state single-photon technology</description>

      <title>Citation Issues in Wave Mechanics Theory of Microwave Absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06522v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The wave mechanics theory of microwave absorption challenges the long-standing impedance-matching and quarter-wavelength paradigms by demonstrating that conventional models mistakenly conflate bulk material parameters with thin-film phenomena. Drawing on a corpus of 35 peer-reviewed papers and preprints, the study performs a citation-pattern analysis and a logical audit of established theory. Results reveal a striking asymmetry in scholarly engagement, only a handful of supportive or neutral citations appear amid widespread silence, alongside critical logical flaws in impedance matching, notably its inconsistent treatment of penetration, reflection, and absorption from film. By re-framing absorption as a wave-mechanics process governed by interference at parallel interfaces, the wave mechanics framework restores energy-conservation consistency and provides experimentally verified design rules for film thickness, phase response, and broadband performance. The paper further situates the citation neglect within broader issues of peer-review bias and paradigm inertia, illustrating how cargo-cult scientific practices can impede theoretical progress. Recommendations are offered for researchers, editors, and institutions to foster open discourse, rigorously test competing models, and update curricula and design tools accordingly.</description>
