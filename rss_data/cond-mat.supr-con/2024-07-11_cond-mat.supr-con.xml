      <title>Doping dependence and multichannel mediators of superconductivity: Calculations for a cuprate model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study two aspects of the superconductivity in a cuprate model system, its doping dependence and the influence of competing pairing mediators. We first include electron-phonon interactions beyond Migdal's approximation and solve self-consistently, as a function of doping and for an isotropic electron-phonon coupling, the full-bandwidth, anisotropic vertex-corrected Eliashberg equations under a non-interacting state approximation for the vertex correction. Our results show that such pairing interaction supports the experimentally observed $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave symmetry of the superconducting gap, but only in a narrow doping interval of the hole-doped system. Depending on the coupling strength, we obtain realistic values for the gap magnitude and superconducting critical temperature $T_c$ close to optimal doping, rendering the electron-phonon mechanism an important candidate for mediating superconductivity in this model system. Second, for a doping near optimal hole doping, we study multichannel superconductivity, by including both vertex-corrected electron-phonon interaction and spin and charge fluctuations as pairing mechanisms. We find that both mechanisms cooperate to support an unconventional $d$-wave symmetry of the order parameter, yet the electron-phonon interaction is mainly responsible for the Cooper pairing and high critical temperature $T_c$. Spin fluctuations are found to have a suppressing effect on the gap magnitude and critical temperature due to their repulsive interaction at small coupling wave vectors.</description>

      <title>Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya spin-spin interaction from mixed-parity superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interacting impurity spins adsorbed on surfaces have been suggested as basic components for applications in quantum computation and spintronics. Such spins usually prefer a parallel or antiparallel configuration, but weakly non-collinear alignments are possible due to the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) that arises in the presence of relativistic spin-orbit coupling. Here, we show that an effective DMI can emerge purely from superconducting correlations without any spin-orbit interaction. We give an analytical proof and provide a numerical study which shows that DMI arises in mixed-parity superconductors solely from the superconducting pairing. These results enable a way to engineer spin textures using the superconducting phase transition.</description>

      <title>Real-space d-wave superconductivity from weak attraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that even a weak out-of-plane attraction, V -&gt; 0, can form real-space pairs in the body-centered tetragonal lattice despite the presence of a Hubbard repulsion and a fully developed three-dimensional kinetic energy. In the hole channel, the pairs have d orbital symmetry which, following Bolgoliubov's argument, translates into a d-symmetric macroscopic superconducting order parameter. The findings help to understand key features of La_{2-x}Sr_xCuO_4 and further support the real-space mechanism of superconductivity in cuprates. The rules of real-space superconductivity are formulated at the end.</description>

      <title>Electronic Correlation and Pseudogap-like Behavior of High-Temperature Superconductor La3Ni2O7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-temperature superconductivity (HTSC) remains one of the most challenging and fascinating mysteries in condensed matter physics. Recently, superconductivity with transition temperature exceeding liquid-nitrogen temperature is discovered in La3Ni2O7 at high pressure, which provides a new platform to explore the unconventional HTSC. In this work, using high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and ab-initio calculation, we systematically investigate the electronic structures of La3Ni2O7 at ambient pressure. Our experiments are in nice agreement with ab-initio calculations after considering an orbital-dependent band renormalization effect. The strong electron correlation effect pushes a flat band of d_(z^2 ) orbital component below the Fermi level (EF), which is predicted to locate right at EF under high pressure. Moreover, the d_(x^2-y^2 ) band shows a pseudogap-like behavior with suppressed spectral weight and diminished quasiparticle peak near EF. Our findings provide important insights into the electronic structure of La3Ni2O7, which will shed light on the understanding of the unconventional superconductivity in nickelates.</description>

      <title>Decomposition of multilayer superconductivity with interlayer pairing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that multilayer superconductivity with interlayer pairing may naturally decompose into a series of weakly-coupled bilayer and trilayer superconducting blocks in order to minimize its total free energy. Our work is motivated by the recent proposal of interlayer pairing induced by the interlayer superexchange interaction of nearly half-filled $d_{z^2}$ orbitals in the bilayer and trilayer nickelate superconductors. We explore general properties of interlayer pairing superconductivity and perform systematic Ginzburg-Landau analyses of an effective multilayer model. For real materials, our results imply strong superconducting order parameter modulation and short coherence length along the $z$ axis (perpendicular to the layers). This reveals a unique feature of multilayer superconductivity with interlayer pairing and provides a basic framework for future experimental and theoretical investigations.</description>

      <title>Quantum circuit refrigerator based on normal-superconductor quantum dots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In quantum dot junctions capacitively coupled to a resonator, electron tunneling through the quantum dot can be used to transfer heat between different parts of the system. This includes cooling or heating the electrons in electrodes and absorbing or emitting photons in the resonator mode. Such systems can be driven into a nonequilibrium state by applying either a voltage bias or a temperature gradient across the electrodes coupled to the quantum dot, or by employing an external coherent pump to excite the resonator. In this study, we present a semiclassical theory to describe the steady state of these structures. We employ a combination of the Floquet-nonequilibrium Green's functions method and semiclassical laser theory to analyze a normal metal-quantum dot-superconductor junction coupled to a resonator. Our investigation focuses on key parameters such as the average photon number and phase shift in the resonator, the charge current in the quantum dot, and the heat fluxes among different components of the system. We explore how photon-assisted Andreev reflection and quasiparticle tunneling in the quantum dot can refrigerate the resonator mode and the normal metal electrode. We also examine the influence of finite voltage and thermal biases on these processes.</description>

      <title>Normal state magneto transport properties of FeSe$_{0.5}$Te$_{0.5}$ superconductor: The role of topological surface states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Doped Iron Chalcogenide (FeCh) superconductors are extensively studied in the context of topological superconductivity. However, the evidence of topological surface states in electrical transport measurements of the doped FeCh system is yet warranted. In the present letter, we performed angle-dependent magneto transport measurements on a single crystal of a doped FeCh system, i.e., FeSe$_{0.5}$Te$_{0.5}$. A non-saturating linear magnetoresistance (MR) has been observed under the magnetic field up to 14 T in the normal state of FeSe$_{0.5}$Te$_{0.5}$. The MR is shown to possess anisotropy, which indicates the presence of topological surface states in FeSe$_{0.5}$Te$_{0.5}$. Angle-dependent Magneto-conductivity (MC) at low magnetic fields has been modelled by Hikami Larkin Nagaoka (HLN) formalism, which shows the presence of weak antilocalization (WAL) effect in FeSe$_{0.5}$Te$_{0.5}$. The observed WAL effect is found to be 2D in nature through angle-dependent magneto transport measurements. Theoretical calculations based on Density Functional Theory (DFT) are also performed to get more confidence on the presence of topological surface states in FeSe$_{0.5}$Te$_{0.5}$.</description>

      <title>Topological flat bands, valley polarization, and interband superconductivity in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene with proximitized spin-orbit couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study theoretically the magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene with proximity-induced Ising and Rashba spin-orbit couplings on the top layer. Topological flat bands (with three distinct phases) are generically realized by the spin-orbit couplings. Using a mean field analysis, we find that (partial) valley polarization prevails for a wide range of doping, suppressing the usual superconductivity with a pairing between time-reversal partners. Remarkably, we uncover that observable unconventional intervalley interband phonon-mediated superconductivity (with the highest $T_c\approx 1.2$K) can coexist with strong valley imbalance due to the approximate Fermi surface nesting between two flat bands not related by time-reversal symmetry, and the dominant pairing is an intersublattice Ising pairing, corresponding to a mixture of $p$- and $d$-waves. In contrast, the intrasublattice Ising phonon-mediated superconductivity with $s$- and $f$-wave mixing emerges in the absence of valley imbalance. Our work reveals an unprecedented route of realizing unconventional superconductivity.</description>

Abstract: A remarkable feature of topological superconductors is the emergence of Majorana fermions in electron systems. Whereas the emergent Majorana fermions share the self-anti-particle property with Majorana fermions in particle physics, they may have essentially different electromagnetic properties. In this paper, we argue the electromagnetic response of spinful Majorana fermions in topological superconductors. We present a general theory of the electromagnetic response of spinful Majorana fermions in topological superconductors and clarify how the pairing symmetry is encoded in the electromagnetic response. As an application, we predict the sublattice-dependent dipole (Ising)-type magnetic response of corner Majorana fermions in iron-based superconductors.</description>

      <title>Treatment of the strongly correlated topological superconductors through the $su(2|1)$ path-integral technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07022v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that topological superconductivity can be produced by strong electron-electron (e-e) interaction in two minimal one (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) models containing only nearest neighbor hopping and suitable superconducting order parameters. The presence of the strong e-e interaction constrains each atomic site to be either empty or singly occupied. One can treat this scenario by fractionalizing the electrons into spin and charge degrees of freedom. We use the coherent state symbols associated with the lowest irreducible representation of the $su(2|1)$ superalgebra spanned by the Hubbard operators to solve the proposed models, as they implicitly take into account both the single particle occupation constraint and the fractionalization of the electrons. Our two example display the emergence of topological superconductivity in an 1D nanowire with extended $s$-wave superconductivity, and in a 2D square lattice with $p$-wave superconductivity.</description>
