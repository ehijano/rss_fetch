      <title>A Morphological Model to Separate Resolved--unresolved Sources in the DESI Legacy Surveys: Application in the LS4 Alert Stream</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Separating resolved and unresolved sources in large imaging surveys is a fundamental step to enable downstream science, such as searching for extragalactic transients in wide-field time-domain surveys. Here we present our method to effectively separate point sources from the resolved, extended sources in the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Legacy Surveys (LS). We develop a supervised machine-learning model based on the Gradient Boosting algorithm \texttt{XGBoost}. The features input to the model are purely morphological and are derived from the tabulated LS data products. We train the model using $\sim$$2\times10^5$ LS sources in the COSMOS field with HST morphological labels and evaluate the model performance on LS sources with spectroscopic classification from the DESI Data Release 1 ($\sim$$2\times10^7$ objects) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 17 ($\sim$$3\times10^6$ objects), as well as on $\sim$$2\times10^8$ Gaia stars. A significant fraction of LS sources are not observed in every LS filter, and we therefore build a ``Hybrid'' model as a linear combination of two \texttt{XGBoost} models, each containing features combining aperture flux measurements from the ``blue'' ($gr$) and ``red'' ($iz$) filters. The Hybrid model shows a reasonable balance between sensitivity and robustness, and achieves higher accuracy and flexibility compared to the LS morphological typing. With the Hybrid model, we provide classification scores for $\sim$$3\times10^9$ LS sources, making this the largest ever machine-learning catalog separating resolved and unresolved sources. The catalog has been incorporated into the real-time pipeline of the La Silla Schmidt Southern Survey (LS4), enabling the identification of extragalactic transients within the LS4 alert stream.</description>

      <title>Changing methodologies in solar physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study attempts to establish a basis for understanding how methods used in research in solar physics have evolved since World War II (WWII). The goal is to begin to explore if and how the changing research environment affects the training of young scientists, and the future of solar physics research at our institutions. A strategy based upon a sample of 650 PhD theses is used to seek possible trends over 8 decades, with the aim of uncovering any correlations between methods used and measures of success. Necessarily subjective, results depend on how methods are defined, and how success is measured. Although a brief justification of the choices made is attempted, trying mainly to avoid pitfalls such as counting citations, it is clear that further assessment is required. The statistical analysis is based upon necessarily subjective categorization and the inference of likelihoods of two different distributions being drawn from the same underlying distribution. The statistics seem to reflect historical events, such as the Kennedy Moonshot program and the associated SKYLAB mission, with changes delayed by a few years. The data suggest that impactful advances are becoming more rare. Yet the methods used have changed little barring those related to obvious technological advances (e.g. the advent of spacecraft, adaptive optics). A follow-up study to explore the 100,000+ publications in solar physics through machine learning seems warranted.</description>

      <title>Hidden magnetic fields of the quiet Sun derived from Hanle depolarization of lines of the "second solar spectrum" at the limb from Pic du Midi observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is based on a dataset of many strongly polarized solar lines belonging to the ''second solar spectrum'', i.e. the spectrum near the limb in linear scattering polarization. The observations were done at the Pic du Midi Turret Dome in 2006. The solar spectra were recorded at high spectral resolution (R = 400000) with the spectrograph slit orthogonal to the solar limb, so that $\mu$ = cos$\theta$ continuously varied from 0 .0 to 0.45. The crystal liquid polarimeter delivered the linear polarization rate (Q/I). Strong lines such as CaII 3934 {\AA}, CaI 4227 {\AA}, SrI 4607 {\AA}, SrII 4078 {\AA}, BaII 4554 {\AA} were studied. We measured the Hanle depolarization with the help of models predicting the polarization envelope with no magnetic field and we got values in the range 13-25 Gauss for the unresolved turbulent magnetic field, and we found that it often decreases towards the limb, revealing an altitude gradient. This present analysis was not yet published and spectra shown here become freely available to the research community.</description>

      <title>AstroMLab 4: Benchmark-Topping Performance in Astronomy Q&amp;A with a 70B-Parameter Domain-Specialized Reasoning Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: General-purpose large language models, despite their broad capabilities, often struggle with specialized domain knowledge, a limitation particularly pronounced in more accessible, lower-parameter versions. This gap hinders their deployment as effective agents in demanding fields such as astronomy. Building on our prior work with AstroSage-8B, this study introduces AstroSage-70B, a significantly larger and more advanced domain-specialized natural-language AI assistant. It is designed for research and education across astronomy, astrophysics, space science, astroparticle physics, cosmology, and astronomical instrumentation. Developed from the Llama-3.1-70B foundation, AstroSage-70B underwent extensive continued pre-training on a vast corpus of astronomical literature, followed by supervised fine-tuning and model merging. Beyond its 70-billion parameter scale, this model incorporates refined datasets, judiciously chosen learning hyperparameters, and improved training procedures, achieving state-of-the-art performance on complex astronomical tasks. Notably, we integrated reasoning chains into the SFT dataset, enabling AstroSage-70B to either answer the user query immediately, or first emit a human-readable thought process. Evaluated on the AstroMLab-1 benchmark -- comprising 4,425 questions from literature withheld during training -- AstroSage-70B achieves state-of-the-art performance. It surpasses all other tested open-weight and proprietary models, including leading systems like o3, Gemini-2.5-Pro, Claude-3.7-Sonnet, Deepseek-R1, and Qwen-3-235B, even those with API costs two orders of magnitude higher. This work demonstrates that domain specialization, when applied to large-scale models, can enable them to outperform generalist counterparts in specialized knowledge areas like astronomy, thereby advancing the frontier of AI capabilities in the field.</description>

      <title>A 1.8 m class pathfinder Raman LIDAR for the Northern Site of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory -- Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Barcelona Raman LIDAR (BRL) will provide continuous monitoring of the aerosol extinction profile along the line of sight of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO). It will be located at its Northern site (CTAO-N) on the Observatorio del Roque de Los Muchachos. This article presents the performance of the pathfinder Barcelona Raman LIDAR (pBRL), a prototype instrument for the final BRL. Power budget simulations were carried out for the pBRL operating. under various conditions, including clear nights, moon conditions, and dust intrusions. The LIDAR PreProcessing (LPP) software suite is presented, which includes several new statistical methods for background subtraction, signal gluing, ground layer and cloud detection and inversion, based on two elastic and one Raman lines. Preliminary test campaigns were conducted, first close to Barcelona and later at CTAO-N, albeit during moonlit nights only. The pBRL, under these non-optimal conditions, achieves maximum ranges up to about 35 km, range resolution of about 50 m for strongly absorbing dust layers, and 500 m for optically thin clouds with the Raman channel only, leading to similar resolutions for the LIDAR ratios and Angstrom exponents. Given the reasonable agreement between the extinction coefficients obtained from the Raman and elastic lines independently, an accuracy of aerosol optical depth retrieval in the order of 0.05 can be assumed with the current setup. The results show that the pBRL can provide valuable scientific results on aerosol characteristics and structure, although not all performance requirements could be validated under the conditions found at the two test sites. Several moderate hardware improvements are planned for its final upgraded version [truncated].</description>

      <title>Proof-of-Principle Experiment on a Displacement-Noise-Free Neutron Interferometer for Gravitational Wave Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The displacement-noise-free interferometer (DFI) is designed to eliminate all displacement-induced noise while retaining sensitivity to gravitational wave (GW) signals. Ground-based DFIs suffer from physical arm-length limitations, resulting in poor sensitivity at frequencies below 1 kHz. To address this, previous research introduced a neutron-based DFI, which replaces laser light with neutrons and achieves exceptional sensitivity down to a few hertz. In this study, we conducted a proof-of-principle experiment using a pulsed neutron source at the Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex (J- PARC). Despite practical constraints that led to deviations from the ideal experimental design, we optimized the setup and developed a novel analysis method that successfully cancels displacement noise while preserving simulated GW signals. This work presents the first successful demonstration of a neutron DFI and a neutron interferometer for GW detection.</description>

      <title>The Backup Program of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument's Milky Way Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Milky Way Backup Program (MWBP), a survey currently underway with the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) on the Nicholas U. Mayall 4-m Telescope, works at the margins of the DESI Main surveys to obtain spectra of millions of additional stars from the Gaia catalog. Efficiently utilizing twilight times (&lt;18 deg) and poor weather conditions, the MWBP extends the range of stellar sources studied to both brighter magnitudes and lower Galactic latitude and declination than the stars studied in DESI's Main Milky Way Survey. While the MWBP prioritizes candidate giant stars selected from the Gaia catalog (using color and parallax criteria), it also includes an unbiased sample of bright stars (i.e., 11.2 &lt; G &lt; 16 mag) as well as fainter sources (to G &lt; 19 mag). As of March 1, 2025, the survey had obtained spectra of ~7 million stars, approximately 1.2 million of which are included in the DESI Data Release 1. The full survey, when completed, will cover an area of more than 21,000 square degrees and include approximately 10 million Gaia sources, roughly equal to the number of stellar spectra obtained through the DESI Main Survey, while only utilizing &lt;9% of all DESI observing time.</description>

      <title>Searching for extreme mass ratio inspirals in LISA: from identification to parameter estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is a planned space-based observatory designed to detect gravitational waves (GWs) within the millihertz frequency range. LISA is anticipated to observe the inspiral of compact objects into black holes at the centers of galaxies, so called extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs). However, the extraction of these long-lived complex signals is challenging due to the large size and multimodality of the search space. In this study, we introduce a new search strategy that allows us to find EMRI signals in noisy data from wide priors all the way to performing parameter estimation. This work is an important step in understanding how to extract EMRIs from future LISA data.</description>

Abstract: We present Vela, an efficient, modular, easy-to-use Bayesian pulsar timing and noise analysis package written in Julia. Vela provides an independent, efficient, and parallelized implementation of the full non-linear pulsar timing and noise model along with a Python binding named pyvela. One-time operations such as data file input, clock corrections, and solar system ephemeris computations are performed by pyvela with the help of the PINT pulsar timing package. Its reliability is ensured via careful design utilizing Julia's type system, strict version control, and an exhaustive test suite. This paper describes the design and usage of Vela focusing on the narrowband paradigm.</description>

      <title>Serial MultiView: an efficient approach to mitigating atmospheric spatial-structure errors for VLBI astrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10978v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Atmospheric propagation errors are a main constraint on the accuracy of Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) astrometry. For relative astrometry, differential techniques can mitigate these errors, but their effectiveness diminishes with decreasing elevation and increasing angular separations between target and calibrator, among others. The MultiView technique addresses atmospheric spatial-structure errors by observing multiple calibrators around the target and interpolating at the target position, thereby reducing atmospheric errors more effectively than phase-referencing with only one calibrator. The first MultiView realisation at 1.6GHz involved cyclically observing all calibrators and the target, fitting a phase plane from calibrator solutions in each cycle, and is a well-established technique. This implementation reduces on-target time and is constricted by the short atmospheric coherence time at high frequencies. We propose a new realisation, serial MultiView, which rotates the phase plane iteratively based on the time series of calibrator residual phases. This new strategy obviates the necessity of observing all calibrators within each cycle, thereby shortening the observing cycle and offering considerable potential at higher frequencies where the temporal structure is the dominant source of errors. Additionally, by incorporating time-domain information in the iterations, phase ambiguities can be accurately and automatically identified. We verify the astrometric accuracy of serial MultiView at 5GHz by comparing it to conventional MultiView, achieving &lt;10uas error in RA direction, and show the calibration overhead can be reduced in both approaches. This approach enables efficient, high-accuracy differential astrometry and artifact-reduced imaging for astrophysical studies, and we provide a user-friendly tool for it.</description>

Abstract: Vela.jl is a package for performing Bayesian pulsar timing &amp; noise analysis written in Julia and Python. In the wideband paradigm of pulsar timing, simultaneous time of arrival and dispersion measure measurements are derived from a radio observation using frequency-resolved integrated pulse profiles and templates without splitting the observation into multiple frequency sub-bands. We describe the implementation of the wideband timing paradigm in Vela.jl, and demonstrate its usage using the NANOGrav 12.5-year wideband data of PSR J1923+2515. Vela.jl is the first software package to provide this functionality.</description>

      <title>The NANOGrav 15 Yr Data Set: Removing Pulsars One by One from the Pulsar Timing Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14846v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evidence has emerged for a stochastic signal correlated among 67 pulsars within the 15-year pulsar-timing data set compiled by the NANOGrav collaboration. Similar signals have been found in data from the European, Indian, Parkes, and Chinese PTAs. This signal has been interpreted as indicative of the presence of a nanohertz stochastic gravitational wave background. To explore the internal consistency of this result we investigate how the recovered signal strength changes as we remove the pulsars one by one from the data set. We calculate the signal strength using the (noise-marginalized) optimal statistic, a frequentist metric designed to measure correlated excess power in the residuals of the arrival times of the radio pulses. We identify several features emerging from this analysis that were initially unexpected. The significance of these features, however, can only be assessed by comparing the real data to synthetic data sets. After conducting identical analyses on simulated data sets, we do not find anything inconsistent with the presence of a stochastic gravitational wave background in the NANOGrav 15-year data. The methodologies developed here can offer additional tools for application to future, more sensitive data sets. While this analysis provides an internal consistency check of the NANOGrav results, it does not eliminate the necessity for additional investigations that could identify potential systematics or uncover unmodeled physical phenomena in the data.</description>

      <title>ChronoFlow: A Data-Driven Model for Gyrochronology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12244</link>

Abstract: Gyrochronology is a technique for constraining stellar ages using rotation periods, which change over a star's main sequence lifetime due to magnetic braking. This technique shows promise for main sequence FGKM stars, where other methods are imprecise. However, the observed dispersion in rotation rates for similar coeval stars has historically been difficult to characterize. To properly understand this complexity, we have assembled the largest standardized data catalog of rotators in open clusters to date, consisting of $\approx$8,000 stars across 30 open clusters/associations spanning ages of 1.5 Myr to 4 Gyr. We have also developed ChronoFlow: a flexible data-driven model which accurately captures observed rotational dispersion. We show that ChronoFlow can be used to accurately forward model rotational evolution, and to infer both cluster and individual stellar ages. We recover cluster ages with a statistical uncertainty of 0.06 dex ($\approx$15%), and individual stellar ages with a statistical uncertainty of 0.7 dex. Additionally, we conducted robust systematic tests to analyze the impact of extinction models, cluster membership, and calibration ages. These contribute an additional 0.06 dex of uncertainty in cluster age estimates, resulting in a total error budget of 0.08 dex. We apply ChronoFlow to estimate ages for M34, NGC 2516, NGC 6709, and the Theia 456 stellar stream. Our results show that ChronoFlow can precisely estimate the ages of coeval stellar populations, and constrain ages for individual stars. Furthermore, its predictions may be used to inform physical spin down models. ChronoFlow is publicly available at https://github.com/philvanlane/chronoflow.</description>

      <title>The polarimetric response of the Nan\c{c}ay Radio Telescope and its impact on precision pulsar timing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04990</link>

Abstract: In \citet{Guillemot2023} we presented a new method for calibrating pulsar observations conducted with the Nan\c{c}ay decimetric Radio Telescope (NRT), which significantly improved NRT polarimetric measurements and pulsar timing quality for data taken after this method was developed, in November 2019. Results hinted at a dependence of the polarimetric response of the NRT on the observed direction. We investigated this potential dependence, since unaccounted variations of the instrumental response could degrade polarimetric measurements. Additionally, we aimed to develop a method for properly calibrating NRT pulsar observations conducted before November 2019. We conducted three series of observations of bright pulsars over wide declination ranges, in a special observation mode in which the feed horn rotates by $\sim$ 180$^\circ$ degrees across the observation, enabling us to determine the full polarimetric response of the NRT while modeling potential variations of calibration parameters with hour angle and declination. In addition, we used the METM technique to improve the calibration of pre-November 2019 data. From the analysis of the series of observations of bright pulsars with horn rotation, we found that the polarimetric response of the NRT does not appear to vary with hour angle or declination. On the other hand, the new METM-based calibration method appears to significantly improve the calibration of pre-November 2019 data. By analyzing NRT data on a selection of millisecond pulsars we found that the new polarimetric profiles are more homogeneous, they generally have larger signal-to-noise ratios, and found that the TOA data for these MSPs are more accurate and contain lower levels of noise, especially when combining the new calibration method with the \textit{Matrix Template Matching} (MTM) method for extracting TOAs from pulsar observations.</description>

      <title>Towards Realistic Detection Pipelines of Taiji: New Challenges in Data Analysis and High-Fidelity Simulations of Space-Borne Gravitational Wave Antenna</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16500v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Taiji, a Chinese space-based gravitational wave detection project, aims to explore the millihertz gravitational wave universe with unprecedented sensitivity, targeting astrophysical and cosmological sources including Galactic binaries, massive black hole binaries, extreme mass-ratio inspirals, and stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds, etc. These observations are expected to provide transformative insights into astrophysics, cosmology, and fundamental physics. However, Taiji's data analysis faces unique challenges distinct from ground-based detectors like LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA, such as the overlap of numerous signals, extended data durations, more rigorous accuracy requirements for the waveform templates, non-negligible subdominant waveform complexities, incompletely characterized noise spectra, non-stationary noises, and various data anomalies. This paper presents the second round of Taiji Data Challenge, a collection of simulation datasets designed as a shared platform for resolving these critical data analysis problems. The current platform distinguishes from previous works by the systematic integration of orbital dynamics based on the full drag-free and attitude control simulation, extended noise sources, more sophisticated and overlapping gravitational wave signals, second-generation time-delay interferometry and the coupling effect of time-varying armlengths, etc. Concurrently released is the open-source toolkit Triangle (available at https://github.com/TriangleDataCenter), which offers the capabilities for customized simulation of signals, noises and other instrumental effects. By taking a step further towards realistic detection, Taiji Data Challenge II and Triangle altogether serve as a new testbed, supporting the development of Taiji's global analysis and end-to-end pipelines, and ultimately bridging the gaps between observation and scientific objectives.</description>
