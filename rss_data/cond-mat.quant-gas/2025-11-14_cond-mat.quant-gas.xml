      <title>Functional renormalization group study of a dissipative Bose--Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the phase diagram of a one-dimensional dissipative Bose-Hubbard model using the nonperturbative functional renormalization group (FRG). Each lattice site is coupled to an independent bath, generating long-range temporal interactions that encode non-Markovian dissipation. For a broad class of bath spectra -- ohmic, sub-ohmic, and super-ohmic -- we identify two competing low-energy regimes: a Luttinger-liquid line of fixed points and a dissipative fixed point characterized by finite compressibility, vanishing superfluid stiffness, and universal scaling exponents, separated by a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. The FRG framework is essential here, as it provides access to the complete renormalization group flow and all fixed points from a single microscopic action, beyond the reach of perturbative or variational methods. This work establishes a unified and systematically improvable framework for describing dissipative quantum phases in one dimension.</description>

      <title>Mediated interactions in mixtures of ultracold atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe recent theoretical and experimental developments on mediated interactions in mixtures of bosonic and fermionic atoms. We discuss how particle-hole excitations of a Fermi sea can induce long-range interactions between heavy impurities or atoms in a Bose-Einstein condensate. Conversely, phonon excitations of a Bose-Einstein condensate induce interactions between fermionic atoms. These mediated interactions exhibit different short-range and long-range scaling regimes with distance and, if strong enough, can induce fermion superfluidity. We discuss the prospects for observing new phenomena that could arise from mediated interactions. Experimentally, we outline recent studies of the 133Cs-6Li Bose-Fermi mixture, a platform well-suited for investigating fermion-mediated interactions. A Cs Bose-Einstein condensate immersed in a degenerate Li Fermi gas is prepared with tunable interspecies interactions. In the weak-coupling regime, precision measurements of condensate properties reveal fermion-mediated attractions between bosons, matching theoretical predictions. In the strong-coupling regime, we observe suppression and revival of sound modes and novel many-body resonances. Altogether, we aim to highlight both instances where experiment and theory agree well, and promising prospects to engineer long-range interactions in atomic quantum gases.</description>

      <title>Interaction-induced Dimension Reduction for Bound States in Microwave-Shielded Ultracold Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate tetratomic and hexatomic bound states of ultracold molecules dressed by an elliptic microwave field. We show that these bound states can be accurately described by effective one-dimensional (1D) models incorporating high-order angular fluctuations, despite the physical system is in three-dimensional (3D) free space. By comparing with exact solutions of the full 3D system, we identify the validity region of such 1D description in the parameter plane of ellipticity and coupling strength of microwave field. The hard-core character of these effective models enables a duality between bosonic and fermionic molecules in real and spectral space, while their momentum distributions remain distinct. Our results have demonstrated an effective dimension reduction in microwave-shielded molecular systems, which is purely due to the intrinsic interaction anisotropy rather than any external confinement. Extending to large systems, our results suggest a self-bound single-molecule array as the ground state of both bosonic and fermionic molecular gases.</description>

      <title>Generalized Gross-Pitaevskii Equation for 2D Bosons with Attractive Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and investigate a generalized Gross-Pitaevskii equation for two-dimensional (2D) attractive Bose systems. First, we demonstrate that it accurately captures key properties of universal bound states in free space commonly referred to as quantum droplets. We then apply the framework to predict the existence of universal excited states, including vortex configurations, which may be more accessible to experimental investigation than the ground state. Additionally, we investigate breathing modes and quench dynamics in trapped geometries. Our results establish a robust theoretical foundation for exploring both static and dynamical phenomena in finite 2D Bose systems, offering guidance for the design of future experimental protocols.</description>

      <title>Tuning the Critical Current in Toroidal Superfluids via Controllable Impurities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We combine numerical and experimental approaches to study how impurities affect the maximum superflow in an annular Bose-Einstein condensate. By tuning the impurity density, we achieve precise control over the stability of persistent currents which increases with the impurity number. In the unstable regime, the complex vortex motion within the impurity landscape, characterized by pinning and unpinning events, governs the timescale of the current decay and its final value. Our work establishes atomic superfluids as a pristine platform for exploring universal mechanisms of superflow stabilization and decay, paving the way for atomtronic quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Competition of fermion pairing, magnetism, and charge order in the spin-doped attractive Hubbard gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tension between fermion pairing and magnetism affects numerous strongly correlated electron systems, from high-temperature cuprates to twisted bilayer graphene. Exotic forms of fermion pairing and superfluidity are predicted when attraction between fermions competes with spin doping. Here, we follow the evolution of fermion pairing and charge and spin order in a spin-imbalanced attractive Hubbard gas of fermionic $^{40}$K atoms, covering a wide range of densities, magnetizations, and interactions with single-atom resolution. At low spin imbalance and weak interactions, we find a mixture of nonlocal fermion pairs coexisting with itinerant excess fermions. For stronger interactions an effective hard-core Bose-Fermi mixture emerges. Spin doping drives a crossover from charge-density wave correlations to a Fermi liquid of polarons. Beyond a certain spin imbalance and interaction strength, we find evidence for the onset of combined spin- and pair-density wave order, a possible precursor for the existence of magnetized superfluidity in the attractive Hubbard system.</description>

      <title>Cooling the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model using thermofield double states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze a simple and efficient experimental protocol to cool the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model to low temperatures. The protocol utilizes local couplings between two copies of an SYK model to create a gapped adiabatic path, between a high temperature product state and a low temperature thermofield double state. By smoothly varying the coupling strength between these two limits, one efficiently cools the SYK model. We support these predictions-and demonstrate fast cooling to the low-temperature gravitational regime-via exact numerical solutions to the large-N equations of motion that govern the ground state and dynamical properties of the coupled system. Finally, we present a theoretical framework based upon eigenstate thermalization that provides a microscopic explanation for the efficacy of the cooling protocol; intriguingly, this suggests that the protocol may be applicable for cooling strongly-interacting quantum Hamiltonians more broadly.</description>

      <title>A Gross-Pitaevskii theory for an excitonic incompressible Bose solid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that interlayer excitons in double-layer semiconductor heterostructures can form a Bose solid, which is an incompressible supersolid characterized by exactly one boson per lattice site. This exciton Bose solid would be the first realization of an incompressible supersolid, unlike the generally compressible cluster supersolids seen in dipolar quantum gases. Capturing its characteristics and associated emergent phenomena requires extending the Gross-Pitaevskii formalism to include strong two-particle correlations and exclude exciton self-interactions. We develop such a formalism, we apply it across experimentally accessible exciton densities and interlayer separations, and we show that it incorporates both superfluid and incompressible supersolid ground states. This extended framework allows us to determine the superfluid-supersolid transition and explore the low-temperature properties of the exciton supersolid across its complete parameter space.</description>

      <title>User Manual for MOLSCAT, BOUND and FIELD, Version 2025.0: programs for quantum scattering properties and bound states of interacting pairs of atoms and molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.06755</link>
      <description>arXiv:1903.06755v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: MOLSCAT is a general-purpose package for performing non-reactive quantum scattering calculations for atomic and molecular collisions using coupled-channel methods. Simple atom-molecule and molecule-molecule collision types are coded internally and additional ones may be handled with plug-in routines. Plug-in routines may include external magnetic, electric or photon fields (and combinations of them). Simple interaction potentials are coded internally and more complicated ones may be handled with plug-in routines.
  BOUND is a general-purpose package for performing calculations of bound-state energies in weakly bound atomic and molecular systems using coupled-channel methods. It solves the same sets of coupled equations as MOLSCAT, and can use the same plug-in routines if desired, but with different boundary conditions.
  FIELD is a development of BOUND that locates external fields at which a bound state exists with a specified energy. One important use is to locate the positions of magnetically tunable Feshbach resonance positions in ultracold collisions.

      <title>Non-commutative effective field theory of the lowest Landau level superfluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03528v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A 2+1D superfluid in a rapidly rotating trap forms an array of vortices, with collective excitations called Tkachenko modes. Du et al. (2024) argued from an effective field theory viewpoint that these excitations are described by a field theory living on a non-commutative space. We elucidate the microscopic origin of these non-commutative fields, and present a novel derivation of the effective field theory for this superfluid using a lowest Landau level projected coherent state path integral approach. Besides conceptual clarity, this approach makes quantitative predictions about the long-wavelength, low-energy behavior in terms of the microscopic parameters of the short-range interacting lowest Landau level superfluid -- relevant to trapped Bose-Einstein condensate experiments.</description>

      <title>Extended $s$-wave pairing from an emergent Feshbach resonance in bilayer nickelate superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13960v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the discovery of unconventional superconductivity in cuprates, unraveling the pairing mechanism of charge carriers in doped antiferromagnets has been a long-standing challenge. Motivated by the discovery of high-T$_c$ superconductivity in nickelate bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (LNO), we study a minimal mixed dimensional (MixD) $t-J$ model supplemented with a repulsive Coulomb interaction $V$. When hole-doped, previous numerical simulations revealed that the system exhibits strong binding energies, with a phenomenology resembling a BCS-to-BEC crossover accompanied by a Feshbach resonance between two distinct types of charge carriers. Here, we perform a mean-field analysis that enables a direct observation of the BCS-to-BEC crossover as well as microscopic insights into the crossover region and the pairing symmetry for two-dimensional bilayers. We benchmark our mean-field description by comparing it to density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations in quasi-one dimensional settings and find remarkably good agreement. For the two-dimensional system relevant to LNO our mean-field calculations predict a BCS pairing gap with an extended $s$-wave symmetry, directly resulting from the pairing mechanism's Feshbach-origin. Our analysis hence gives insights into pairing in unconventional superconductors and, further, can be tested in currently available ultracold atom experiments.</description>

      <title>Superradiant Peak Emission Rate and Time in Quantum Emitter Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09985v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Determining the peak photon emission time and rate for an ensemble of $N$ quantum systems undergoing collective superradiant decay typically requires tracking the time evolution of the density operator. Generally, the dimension of the density operator grows exponentially ($\sim \! 2^N$) with the number of emitters, in the absence of any symmetries such as in Dicke superradiance with full or partial permutational symmetry. We present a detailed study of the superradiant peak emission rate and time for initially fully excited quantum emitter ensembles, for one-, two- and three-dimensional arrays in free-space and emitter chains coupled to waveguide reservoirs. For few emitters ($N\lesssim 14$) we utilize the full quantum master equation, and for mesoscopic emitter numbers ($N\lesssim 400$) we use a second- and third-order cumulant expansion of the operator averages to track the time evolution of the system.</description>
