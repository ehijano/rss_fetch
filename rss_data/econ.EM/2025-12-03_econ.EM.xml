      <title>Opening the Black Box: Nowcasting Singapore's GDP Growth and its Explainability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Timely assessment of current conditions is essential especially for small, open economies such as Singapore, where external shocks transmit rapidly to domestic activity. We develop a real-time nowcasting framework for quarterly GDP growth using a high-dimensional panel of approximately 70 indicators, encompassing economic and financial indicators over 1990Q1-2023Q2. The analysis covers penalized regressions, dimensionality-reduction methods, ensemble learning algorithms, and neural architectures, benchmarked against a Random Walk, an AR(3), and a Dynamic Factor Model. The pipeline preserves temporal ordering through an expanding-window walk-forward design with Bayesian hyperparameter optimization, and uses moving block-bootstrap procedures both to construct prediction intervals and to obtain confidence bands for feature-importance measures. It adopts model-specific and XAI-based explainability tools. A Model Confidence Set procedure identifies statistically superior learners, which are then combined through simple, weighted, and exponentially weighted schemes; the resulting time-varying weights provide an interpretable representation of model contributions. Predictive ability is assessed via Giacomini-White tests. Empirical results show that penalized regressions, dimensionality-reduction models, and GRU networks consistently outperform all benchmarks, with RMSFE reductions of roughly 40-60%; aggregation delivers further gains. Feature-attribution methods highlight industrial production, external trade, and labor-market indicators as dominant drivers of Singapore's short-run growth dynamics.</description>

      <title>Unbiased Estimation of Multi-Way Gravity Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maximum likelihood estimators, such as the Poisson Pseudo-Maximum Likelihood (PPML), suffer from the incidental parameter problem: a bias in the estimation of structural parameters that arises from the joint estimation of structural and nuisance parameters. To address this issue in multi-way gravity models, we propose a novel, asymptotically unbiased estimator. Our method reframes the estimation as a series of classification tasks and is agnostic to both the number and structure of fixed effects. In sparse data environments, common in the network formation literature, it is also computationally faster than PPML. We provide empirical evidence that our estimator yields more accurate point estimates and confidence intervals than PPML and its bias-correction strategies. These improvements hold even under model misspecification and are more pronounced in sparse settings. While PPML remains competitive in dense, low-dimensional data, our approach offers a robust alternative for multi-way models that scales efficiently with sparsity. The method is applied to estimate the effect of a policy reform on spatial accessibility to health care in France.</description>

      <title>Identification of Multivariate Measurement Error Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops new identification results for multidimensional continuous measurement-error models where all observed measurements are contaminated by potentially correlated errors and none provides an injective mapping of the latent distribution. Using third order cross moments, the paper constructs a three way tensor whose unique decomposition, guaranteed by Kruskal theorem, identifies the factor loading matrices. Starting with a linear structure, the paper recovers the full distribution of latent factors by constructing suitable measurements and applying scalar or multivariate versions of Kotlarski identity. As a result, the joint distribution of the latent vector and measurement errors is fully identified without requiring injective measurements, showing that multivariate latent structure can be recovered in broader settings than previously believed. Under injectivity, the paper also provides user-friendly testable conditions for identification. Finally, this paper provides general identification results for nonlinear models using a newly-defined generalized Kruskal rank - signal rank - of intergral operators. These results have wide applicability in empirical work involving noisy or indirect measurements, including factor models, survey data with reporting errors, mismeasured regressors in econometrics, and multidimensional latent-trait models in psychology and marketing, potentially enabling more robust estimation and interpretation when clean measurements are unavailable.</description>

      <title>Implicit score-driven filters for time-varying parameter models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an observation-driven modeling framework that permits time variation in the model parameters using an implicit score-driven (ISD) update. The ISD update maximizes the logarithmic observation density with respect to the parameter vector, while penalizing the weighted L2 norm relative to a one-step-ahead predicted parameter. This yields an implicit stochastic-gradient update. We show that the popular class of explicit score-driven (ESD) models arises if the observation log density is linearly approximated around the prediction. By preserving the full density, the ISD update globalizes favorable local properties of the ESD update. Namely, for log-concave observation densities, whether correctly specified or not, the ISD filter is stable for all learning rates, while its updates are contractive in mean squared error toward the (pseudo-)true parameter at every time step. We demonstrate the usefulness of ISD filters in simulations and empirical illustrations in finance and macroeconomics.</description>
