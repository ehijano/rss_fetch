      <title>Importance of accounting for student identities and intersectionality for creating equitable and inclusive physics learning environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research focuses on the experiences of seven undergraduate women who were majoring in physics at a small liberal arts college. In the semi-structured, empathetic interviews we conducted, the women discuss how they decided to major in physics, their interactions with their peers and instructors, who has supported them during their physics trajectory, and suggestions that would improve their experiences in physics. We use Standpoint Theory and focus on the experiences of undergraduate women to get a holistic perspective of how they became interested in physics, how they have been supported in their physics journey as well as identify any challenges that they faced in their undergraduate physics program due to their identity. Using synergistic frameworks such as the domains of power and the Holistic Ecosystem for Learning Physics in an Inclusive and Equitable Environment (HELPIEE), we analyze how those in the position of power, e.g., instructors, can play important roles in establishing and maintaining safe, equitable, and inclusive environments for students, which is especially important for historically marginalized students such as women and ethnic and racial minority students in physics. Using these frameworks, we compare the experiences of these women with those in Johnson's research at a small college and our prior investigation at a large research university. We also discuss the suggestions provided by the undergraduate women to implement in the future to support current and future undergraduate women in physics and astronomy. Their suggestions are separated as personal advice for peers and suggestions for physics instructors.</description>

      <title>Introducing Quantum Entanglement to First-Year Students: Resolving the Trilemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.12043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.12043v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While quantum mechanics (QM) is covered at length in introductory physics textbooks, the concept of quantum entanglement is typically not covered at all, despite its importance in the rapidly growing area of quantum information science and its extensive experimental confirmation. Thus, physics educators are left to their own devices as to how to introduce this important concept. Regardless of how a physics educator chooses to introduce quantum entanglement, they face a trilemma involving its mysterious Bell-inequality-violating correlations. They can compromise on the the completeness of their introduction and simply choose not to share that fact, totally ignoring the 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics. They can frustrate their more curious students by introducing the mystery and simply telling them that the QM formalism with its associated (equally mysterious) conservation law maps beautifully to the experiments, so there is nothing else that needs to be said. Or, they can compromise the rigor of their presentation and attempt to resolve the mystery by venturing into the metaphysical quagmire of competing QM interpretations. Herein, we resolve this trilemma in precisely the same way that Einstein resolved the mysteries of time dilation and length contraction that existed in the late nineteenth century. That is, we resort to "principle" explanation based on the mathematical consequences of "empirically discovered" facts. Indeed, our principle account of quantum entanglement is even based on the same principle Einstein used, i.e., the relativity principle or "no preferred reference frame." Thus, this principle resolution of the trilemma is as complete, satisfying, analytically rigorous, and accessible as the standard introduction of special relativity for first-year physics students.</description>

      <title>Blended learning: A data-literate science teacher is a better teacher</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02953v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the importance of blended learning in contemporary physics and, more generally, STEM education. In this contribution, we summarize current pedagogical models of blended learning, such as rotational and flexible non-rotational models, and customizable configurations of physical and virtual learning spaces. With the inevitable integration of digital technology as one of the pillars of blended learning, teachers find themselves in an unprecedented position to not only obtain data more frequently but also analyze it and adjust instruction accordingly. Consequently, we discuss a crucial element of blended learning effectiveness: data management and usage. In this context, data literacy for teaching emerges as an essential skill for effective blended learning, encompassing the ability to transform various data types into actionable instructional knowledge and practices. In other words, current research in physics education shows that a data-literate science teacher is a more prosperous and effective teacher.</description>
