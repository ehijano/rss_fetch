      <title>JCMT Constraints on the Early-Time HCN and CO Emission and HCN Temporal Evolution of 3I/ATLAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interstellar objects (ISOs), particularly those with cometary activity, provide unique insight into the primordial physical and chemical conditions present during the formation of the planetary system in which they originated. Observations in the sub-mm regime allow for direct measurements of several parent molecules released from the comet nucleus into the coma. Here we present observations of the third ISO, 3I/ATLAS, with the `\=U`\=u heterodyne receiver on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT), which targeted emission from HCN($J = 3 - 2$) and CO($J = 2 - 1$). Our observations, taken between 16 July 2025 and 21 July 2025 (UT), when 3I/ATLAS was at a heliocentric distance between 4.01 and 3.84 au, provide the earliest sub-mm constraints on its activity. We do not detect HCN or CO in these epochs, with 3$\sigma$ upper-limits on the production rates of $Q(HCN) &lt; 1.7 \times 10^{24}$ s$^{-1}$ at $r_h = 4.01 - 3.97$ au and $Q(CO) &lt; 1.1 \times 10^{27}$ s$^{-1}$ at $r_h = 3.94 - 3.84$ au, respectively. We combine this HCN limit with later JCMT observations of HCN to constrain its temporal evolution. Fitting the HCN detections with a $Q(HCN) \propto r_h^{-n}$ model and accounting for the upper-limits yields $n = 12.7^{+6.9}_{-2.5}$. This slope is steeper than those of typical Solar System comets, but consistent with the production rate slopes measured for other species in the coma of 3I/ATLAS.</description>

      <title>The Dependence of Earth Milankovitch Cycles on Martian Mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Milankovitch cycles of Earth result from gravitational interactions with other bodies in the Solar System. These interactions lead to slow changes in the orbit and angular momentum vector of Earth, and correspondingly influence Earth's climate evolution. Several studies have shown that Mars may play a significant role in these Milankovitch cycles, such as the 2.4 Myr eccentricity cycle related to perihelion precession dynamics. Here we provide the results of a detailed dynamical analysis that explores the Earth Milankovitch cycles as a function of the Martian mass to quantify the extent that Mars influences variations in Earth's orbital eccentricity, the longitude of perihelion, the longitude of the ascending node, and obliquity (axial tilt). Our results show that, although the 405 kyr long-eccentricity metronome driven by $g_2$ (Venus) and $g_5$ (Jupiter) persists at all Mars masses, the $\sim$100 kyr short-eccentricity bands driven by $g_4$ (Mars) lengthen and gain power as Mars becomes more massive, consistent with enhanced coupling among inner-planet $g$-modes. The 2.4 Myr grand cycle is absent when Mars approaches zero mass, reflecting the movement of $g_4$ with the Martian mass. Meanwhile, Earth's obliquity cycles driven by $s_3$ (Earth) and $s_4$ (Mars) lengthen from the canonical $\sim$41 kyr with increasing Mars mass, relocating to a dominant 45--55 kyr band when the mass of Mars is an order of magnitude larger than its present value. These results establish how Mars' mass controls the architecture of Earth's climate-forcing spectrum and that the Milankovitch spectrum of an Earth-like planet is a sensitive, interpretable probe of its planetary neighborhood.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Occurrence of ZLK-Induced White Dwarf Pollution with Dissipative Precession</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (ZLK) oscillations, induced by bound, perturbative companions to white dwarfs, have been suggested as a dynamical mechanism that may contribute to white dwarf pollution. To trigger ZLK oscillations, however, a 3-body system must reach a sufficiently large mutual inclination between orbits. The occurrence of these high-mutual-inclination configurations can be curtailed by dissipative precession at the protoplanetary disk stage, which pushes exoplanet-hosting close binary systems toward preferential orbit-orbit alignment. In this work, we constrain the fraction of white dwarfs with binary companions that can undergo ZLK-driven pollution given the effects of dissipative precession. To accrete pollution via ZLK oscillations, a white dwarf binary system must be sufficiently inclined and the characteristic timescale of the oscillations must be sufficiently short to perturb material within the white dwarf's cooling age. Considering a sample of 4400 known white dwarf/main sequence binaries, we find that $50-70\%$ have favorable parameters for ZLK pollution, depending on the orbital separation of the polluting body. While the conditions for oscillations are favorable, the tendency for ZLK to result in massive but more infrequent polluters likely restricts the rates of ZLK-induced pollution among the observed population. In general, dissipative precession is a limiting factor in pollution rates for more closely separated binaries (initial separations $&lt;500-800$~au), while ZLK timescale constraints are most limiting for wider binaries.</description>

      <title>SCExAO/CHARIS and Gaia Direct Imaging and Astrometric Discovery of a Superjovian Planet 3--4 lambda/D from the Accelerating Star HIP 54515</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the discovery of a superjovian planet around the young A5 star HIP 54515, detected using precision astrometry from the \textit{Hipparcos Gaia Catalogue of Accelerations} and high-contrast imaging with SCExAO/CHARIS from the recently-commenced \surveyname\ program. SCExAO/CHARIS detects HIP 54515 b in five epochs 0\farcs{}145--0\farcs{}192 from the star ($\sim$3--4 $\lambda$/D at 1.65 $\mu m$), exhibiting clockwise orbital motion. HIP 54515 b lies near the M/L transition with a luminosity of log(L/L$_{\rm \odot}$) $\sim$ -3.52 $\pm$ 0.03.
  Dynamical modeling constrains its mass and mass ratio to be ${17.7}_{-4.9}^{+7.6}$ $M_{\rm Jup}$ and ${0.0090}_{-0.0024}^{+0.0036}$ and favors a $\sim$25 au semimajor axis. HIP 54515 b adds to a growing list of superjovian planets with moderate eccentricities (e $\approx$ 0.4). Now the third planet discovered from surveys combining high-contrast extreme adaptive optics imaging with precision astrometry, HIP 54515 b should help improve empirical constraints on the luminosity evolution and eccentricity distribution of the most massive planets. It may also provide a key technical test of the Roman Space Telescope Coronagraph Instrument's performance in the low stellar flux, small angular separation limit and a demonstration of its ability to yield constrainable planet spectral properties.</description>

      <title>Segmented-Polynomial-fitting Least Squares (SPLS): An optimized algorithm to find Earth twins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting Earth twins remains challenging because their shallow, long-period transits are difficult to distinguish from background noise. Motivated by the challenge, we developed Segmented-Polynomial-fitting Least Squares (SPLS), a new algorithm that simultaneously fits planetary transits and background trends using a segmented double polynomial model. Prior to signal detection, the optimal polynomial order for the trend component is selected using Bayes factor-based model comparison. During the periodogram search, the Signal Detection Efficiency metric is used to assess signal significance. The algorithm is accelerated by a three-step approximation and nonlinear parameter sampling tailored to SPLS. We compare the performance of SPLS with traditional detrending-detection approaches across different orbital periods, signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), planet radii and stellar noise levels on an injection-recovery test. When detecting signals with periods between 10 and 480 days and SNRs below 9, SPLS achieves at least a 22.6% higher true positive rate than other methods at the same 10% false positive rate. Using the threshold determined from the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve analysis, our method also recovers the most true signals while yielding the fewest false positives among all injected samples, and reaches a 97% recovery fraction in Kepler confirmed single-planet systems. The tests demonstrate that SPLS improves the detection of transiting planets, particularly for low-SNR, long-period signals. It offers the potential for finding Earth twins in future applications to data from Kepler, TESS, and upcoming PLATO and Earth 2.0 missions.</description>

      <title>Quantification of abundance uncertainties in chemical models of exoplanet atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chemical models are routinely used to predict the atmospheric composition of exoplanets and compare it with the composition retrieved from observations, but little is known about the reliability of the calculated composition. We carried out a sensitivity analysis to quantify the uncertainties in the abundances calculated by a state-of-the-art chemical atmosphere model of the widely observed planets WASP-33b, HD209458b, HD189733b, WASP-39b, GJ436b, and GJ1214b. We found that the abundance uncertainties in the observable atmosphere are relatively small, below one order of magnitude and in many cases below a factor of two, where vertical mixing is a comparable or even larger source of uncertainty than (photo)chemical kinetics. In general, planets with a composition close to chemical equilibrium have smaller abundance uncertainties than planets whose composition is dominated by photochemistry. Some molecules, such as H2O, CO, CO2, and SiO, show low abundance uncertainties, while others such as HCN, SO2, PH3, and TiO have more uncertain abundances. We identified several critical albeit poorly constrained processes involving S-, P-, Si-, and Ti-bearing species whose better characterization should lead to a global improvement in the accuracy of models. Some of these key processes are the three-body association reactions S + H2, Si + O, NH + N, and N2H2 + H; the chemical reactions S + OH --&gt; SO + H, NS + NH2 --&gt; H2S + N2, P + PH --&gt; P2 + H, and N + NH3 --&gt; N2H + H2; and the photodissociation of molecules such as P2, PH2, SiS, CH, and TiO.</description>

      <title>Stellar chemistry and planet size: insights from GALAH DR4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The well-known correlation between stellar metallicity and planet occurrence is strongest for giant planets, but weaker for smaller planets, suggesting that detailed elemental patterns beyond [Fe/H] may be relevant. Using abundances from the fourth data release of the GALAH spectroscopic survey, we analyzed 104 host stars with 141 confirmed transiting planets. We divide planets at 2.6 Earth radii, the theoretical threshold radius above which planets are unlikely to be pure-water worlds. We find that large-planet hosts are enriched by approximately 0.2 dex in iron and show a possible excess of highly volatile elements (C, N, O), though these measurements are affected by observational limitations, whereas small-planet hosts exhibit an enhanced contribution of the classical rock-forming elements (Mg, Si, Ca, Ti) relative to iron, corresponding to a modest [Rock/Fe] offset of 0.06 dex, which is statistically significant, with a p value of 10^{-4}. These offsets remain significant for alternative radius cuts. A matched control sample of non-planet-host stars shows only weak and mostly statistically insignificant similar trends, confirming that the stronger chemical signatures are linked to the planetary characteristics. As our study relies on transiting planets, it mainly probes short-period systems (periods shorter than 100 days). These results refine the planet-metallicity relation, highlighting the role of the relative balance between iron, volatiles, and rock-forming elements in planet formation.</description>

      <title>Convective Heat Transport Asymptotic Law in an $\alpha^2$ dynamo model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar activity and planetary magnetospheres are powered by an underlying dynamo mechanism generated by magnetoconvection coupled with rotation. In astrophysical contexts, magnetoconvection typically occurs in parameter regimes that are currently inaccessible to direct numerical simulations (DNS). We investigate convective heat transfer in a magneto-convection and dynamo model under extreme parameter conditions, specifically high Rayleigh and Prandtl numbers, in a plasma flow with maximum kinetic helicity compatible with fast-rotating objects.
  Our approach to studying magneto-convection and dynamo mechanisms employs a simplified thermally driven shell model. Magnetic polarity reversals are obtained by including a pitchfork bifurcation term in the large-scale magnetic field equation, while nonlinear dynamics are described by a shell model formulation. The low computational cost of the model allows us to explore the asymptotic behavior of convective heat transfer in regimes beyond those reached by current DNS. Our results reveal that the Nusselt number $Nu$ -- a dimensionless measure of convective heat transport -- generally increases with turbulence, following a power-law scaling and showing a strong correlation with Ra and Pr. This relationship appears to be more pronounced than that observed in non-magnetized fluids, suggesting that magnetic fields may significantly enhance convective heat transfer.
  Despite the assumption to neglect spatial information such as density stratification -- an assumption that is necessary in the shell model approach -- our model captures the gross dynamical features of turbulent magnetoconvection in asymptotic regimes. It allows for a broad exploration of parameter space, indicating that magnetic fields may play a central role in modulating heat transport in stellar and planetary interiors.</description>

      <title>The SPHINX M dwarf Spectral Grid. II. New Model Atmospheres and Spectra to Derive Fundamental Properties of mid-to-late type M-dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02269v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: M-dwarfs are the most dominant stars in the Galaxy. Their interiors and atmospheres exhibit complex processes including dust condensation, convective feedback, and magnetic activity-driven heterogeneity. Standard stellar characterization methods often struggle to capture these coupled effects. Part I of this series introduced SPHINX I, a validated grid of self-consistent radiative-convective model atmospheres and spectra for M-dwarfs with up-to-date molecular opacities suitable for early-to-mid M-dwarfs. Here, we present SPHINX II, which extends the model grid to cover mid-to-late type M-dwarfs, including both gray and physically motivated condensate cloud treatments and shorter convective mixing lengths. We validate SPHINX II using 39 benchmark FGK+M binary systems observed with SpeX IRTF (Mann et al. 2014) and apply it to 32 mid-to-late-type M-dwarfs from the SpeX Prism Library. SPHINX II yields improved fits that are statistically consistent with empirical benchmarks, achieving precisions of 0.078 dex in metallicity and 0.13 dex in C/O. Across the model grid, condensate cloud mass peaks between 2100-2400 K, decreasing sharply toward both cooler and hotter temperatures. We find the onset of the cloud-free regime around 2900 K, and below 2100 K, we see formation of deep/buried clouds. As a case study, we also model Trappist-1 and show that even mass-limited silicate grains subtly modify its emergent spectrum, suppressing near-infrared flux and reddening the mid-infrared slope via shallow cloud formation near 1e-2 bar. In sum, SPHINX II provides an improved framework for constraining the fundamental properties of mid-to-late M-dwarfs.</description>

      <title>Spectropolarimetric characterisation of exoplanet host stars in preparation of the $Ariel$ mission II. The magnetised wind environment of TOI-1860, DS Tuc A, and HD 63433</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We update the status of the spectropolarimetric campaign dedicated to characterise the magnetic field properties of a sample of known exoplanet-hosting stars included in the current target list of the $Ariel$ mission. We analysed spectropolarimetric data collected for 15 G-M type stars with Neo-Narval, HARPSpol, and SPIRou to assess the detectability of the large-scale magnetic field. For three stars we reconstructed the magnetic field topology and its temporal evolution via Zeeman-Doppler imaging (ZDI). Such reconstructions were then used to perform 3D MHD simulations of the stellar wind and environment impinging on the hosted exoplanets. We detected the magnetic field of six stars. Of these, we performed ZDI reconstructions for the first time of TOI-1860 and DS Tuc A, and for the second time of HD 63433, providing temporal information of its large-scale magnetic field. Consistently with previous results on young ($\rm\sim 50-100~Myr$) solar-like stars, the large-scale magnetic field is moderately strong (30-60 G on average) and complex, with a significant fraction of magnetic energy in the toroidal component and high-order poloidal components. We found the orbit of TOI-1860 b to be almost completely sub-Alfv\'enic, the orbits of DS Tuc A b and HD 63433 d to be trans-Alfv\'enic, and the orbits of HD 63433 b and c to be super-Alfv\'enic. We obtained marginal detections of the magnetic field for TOI-836 and TOI-2076, and detections for TOI-1136, but the number of observations is not sufficient for magnetic mapping. A magnetic star-planet connection can occur for most of TOI-1860 b's orbit. This can happen more sporadically for DS Tuc A b and HD 63433 c given the lower fraction of their orbit in the sub-Alfv\'enic regime. The orbit of HD 63433 c is nevertheless more sub-Alfv\'enic than previously simulated owing to the temporal evolution of the stellar magnetic field.</description>

      <title>WASP-39b: exo-Saturn with patchy cloud composition, moderate metallicity, and underdepleted S/O</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.08492v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: WASP-39b is one of the first extrasolar giant gas planets that has been observed within the JWST ERS program. Fundamental properties that may enable the link to exoplanet formation differ amongst retrieval methods, for example metallicity and mineral ratios.
  In this work, the formation of clouds in the atmosphere of WASP-39b is explored to investigate how inhomogeneous cloud properties (particle sizes, material composition, opacity) may be for this intermediately warm gaseous exoplanet. WASP-39b's atmosphere has a comparable day-night temperature median with sufficiently low temperatures that clouds may form globally. The presence of clouds on WASP-39b can explain observations without resorting to a high (&gt; 100x solar) metallicity atmosphere for a reduced vertical mixing efficiency. The assessment of mineral ratios shows an under-depletion of S/O due to condensation compared to C/O, Mg/O, Si/O, Fe/O ratios. Vertical patchiness due to heterogeneous cloud composition challenges simple cloud models. An equal mixture of silicates and metal oxides is expected to characterise the cloud top. Further, optical properties of Fe and Mg silicates in the mid-infrared differ significantly which will impact the interpretation of JWST observations. We conclude that WASP-39b's atmosphere contains clouds and the underdepletion of S/O by atmospheric condensation processes suggest the use of sulphur gas species as a possible link to primordial element abundances. Over-simplified cloud models do not capture the complex nature of mixed-condensate clouds in exoplanet atmospheres. The clouds in the observable upper atmosphere of WASP-39b are a mixture of different silicates and metal oxides. The use of constant particles sizes and/or one-material cloud particles alone to interpret spectra may not be sufficient to capture the full complexity available through JWST observations.</description>

      <title>MINDS. Anatomy of a water-rich, inclined, brown dwarf disk: lack of abundant hydrocarbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11424v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 2MASS J04381486+2611399 (or J0438) is one of the few young brown dwarfs (BD) with a highly inclined ($i\!\sim\!70^\circ$) disk. Here we report results from JWST-MIRI MRS, HST-ACS and ALMA Band 7 observations. Despite its late spectral type (M7.25), the spectrum of J0438 resembles those of inner disks around earlier-type stars (K1-M5, T Tauri stars), with a volatile reservoir lacking hydrocarbons (except for acetylene, C$_2$H$_2$) and dominated by water. Other identified species are H$_2$, CO$_2$, HCN, [Ar$^{+}$], and [Ne$^{+}$]. The dominance of water over hydrocarbons is driven by multiple factors such as disk dynamics, young disk age, low accretion rate and possible inner disk clearing. J0438 appears highly dynamic, showing a seesaw-like variability and extended emission in H$_2 \,\,\, S$(1), $S$(3), $S$(5), [Ne$^{+}$] and CO ($J=3-2$). Interestingly, the CO emission reaches up to 400 au from the brown dwarf, suggesting ongoing infalling/outflowing activity impacting the disk chemistry. These observations underscore the combined power of MIRI, HST and ALMA in characterizing the chemical diversity and dynamics of brown dwarf disks.</description>

      <title>HD 44892: The youngest (or oldest?) gas-harbouring debris disc around an intermediate mass star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19860v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first detections of gas around a 2.1 Myr old debris disc-bearing intermediate-mass star, HD 44892. Gas is detected both in $^{12}$CO (2-1) emission through ALMA Band 6 observations and in absorption in Ca II K and H, seen with high-resolution UVES spectroscopy. $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O (2-1) are not detected. The star exhibits a 12 $\mu$m fractional excess of $7.86^{+0.11}_{-2.27}$, placing it in the transition stage between protoplanetary and debris discs. Our detection of 1.3 mm emission yields the dust mass of 0.019$\pm$0.009 $M_{\oplus}$ assuming 115 K temperature. The $^{13}$CO non-detection places an upper limit on CO gas mass of $\sim$10$^{-2}$ $M_{\oplus}$. The $^{12}$CO detection yields a CO gas mass of (7.86$\pm$2.05)$\times$10$^{-5}$ $M_{\oplus}$ or (1.62$\pm$0.17)$\times$10$^{-4}$ $M_{\oplus}$ assuming a gas temperature of 20 K or 50 K, respectively. These should be considered as lower limits since $^{12}$CO emission may be optically thick. With UVES, we find variability in Ca II K and H lines, which can be interpreted by transiting circumstellar gas, ruling out interstellar absorption as their origin. Both the dust mass, which is within an order of magnitude of HD 141569, and the gas mass derived here indicate a late gas dispersal stage of the protoplanetary disc. Through our analysis we deem the alternative age of 800 Myr unlikely.</description>

      <title>On the planetary forcing of the Solar dynamo: Evidence from a Lagrangian framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18939v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Whether planetary motions influence the solar magnetic cycle has remained an open question due to the lack of a rigorous physical mechanism. Here we develop a Lagrangian framework based on the Virial theorem to show that planetary orbital angular momentum modulates the Sun's rotation through barycentric dynamics, consistent with angular momentum conservation. Using Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) applied to sunspot number (SSN) and terrestrial length-of-day (LOD) records spanning the past 250 years, we identify two non-linear trends plus 11 common pseudo-cycles whose periods match those of planetary resonances (LR$^{*}$). We then demonstrate that a reduced nonlinear $\alpha-\Omega$ dynamo model, forced solely by the summed planetary right ascension RA(t), reproduces both the Schwabe cycle and its multi-decadal envelope, including the Dalton Minimum and the Modern Maximum. These results provide strong evidence, based on a physically-grounded model, that the solar dynamo is weakly forced by planetary motion, suggesting that the solar dynamo, classically viewed as autonomous, may in fact behave as a synchronized system.</description>

      <title>Radiation damage to the Hubble Space Telescope during two Solar cycles, and correction of Charge Transfer Inefficiency using ArCTIc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05057v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: From 2002 to 2025, the Hubble Space Telescope's Advanced Camera for Surveys has suffered in the harsh radiation environment above the protection of the Earth's atmosphere. We track the degradation of its image quality, as Solar protons and galactic cosmic rays have damaged its photosensitive charge-coupled device (CCD) imaging sensors. The rate of damage in low Earth orbit is modulated by $18.5^{+4.5}_{-0.5}$ per cent during an 11 year Solar cycle, peaking $430^{+11}_{-5}$ days after Solar minimum as recorded in the number of sunspots. The type of damage is consistent with defects in the silicon lattice that have all stabilised into one of three configurations. We also present the open-source Algorithm for Charge Transfer Inefficiency correction (ArCTIc) v7. This models the (instantaneous or gradual) capture of photoelectrons into lattice defects, and their release after (a discrete set or continuum of) characteristic time delays, which creates spurious trailing in an image. Calibrated using the trailing of hot pixels, and applied during post-processing of astronomical images, ArCTIc can correct 99.5% of Charge Transfer Inefficiency trailing averaged over the camera's lifetime, and 99.9% of trailing in the worst-affected recent data.</description>

      <title>Sequential Convex Programming for Multimode Spacecraft Trajectory Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19505v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spacecraft equipped with multiple propulsion modes or systems can offer enhanced performance and mission flexibility compared with traditional configurations. Despite these benefits, the trajectory optimization of spacecraft utilizing such configurations remains a complex challenge. This paper presents a sequential convex programming (SCP) approach for the optimal design of multi-mode and multi-propulsion spacecraft trajectories. The method extends the dynamical linearization within SCP using sparse automatic differentiation, enabling efficient inclusion of multiple propulsion modes or systems without complex manual reformulation while maintaining comparable computational efficiency. New constraint formulations are introduced to ensure selection of a single propulsion mode at each time step and limit the total number of modes used. The approach is demonstrated for (i) a low-thrust Earth-67P rendezvous using the SPT-140 thruster with 20 discrete modes, and (ii) an Earth-Mars transfer employing both a low-thrust engine and a solar sail. Results confirm that the proposed method can efficiently compute optimal trajectories for these scenarios.</description>
