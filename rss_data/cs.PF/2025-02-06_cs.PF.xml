      <title>Kino-PAX: Highly Parallel Kinodynamic Sampling-based Planner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06807v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sampling-based motion planners (SBMPs) are effective for planning with complex kinodynamic constraints in high-dimensional spaces, but they still struggle to achieve real-time performance, which is mainly due to their serial computation design. We present Kinodynamic Parallel Accelerated eXpansion (Kino-PAX), a novel highly parallel kinodynamic SBMP designed for parallel devices such as GPUs. Kino-PAX grows a tree of trajectory segments directly in parallel. Our key insight is how to decompose the iterative tree growth process into three massively parallel subroutines. Kino-PAX is designed to align with the parallel device execution hierarchies, through ensuring that threads are largely independent, share equal workloads, and take advantage of low-latency resources while minimizing high-latency data transfers and process synchronization. This design results in a very efficient GPU implementation. We prove that Kino-PAX is probabilistically complete and analyze its scalability with compute hardware improvements. Empirical evaluations demonstrate solutions in the order of 10 ms on a desktop GPU and in the order of 100 ms on an embedded GPU, representing up to 1000 times improvement compared to coarse-grained CPU parallelization of state-of-the-art sequential algorithms over a range of complex environments and systems.</description>

      <title>CITER: Collaborative Inference for Efficient Large Language Model Decoding with Token-Level Routing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01976v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models have achieved remarkable success in various tasks but suffer from high computational costs during inference, limiting their deployment in resource-constrained applications. To address this issue, we propose a novel CITER (\textbf{C}ollaborative \textbf{I}nference with \textbf{T}oken-l\textbf{E}vel \textbf{R}outing) framework that enables efficient collaboration between small and large language models (SLMs &amp; LLMs) through a token-level routing strategy. Specifically, CITER routes non-critical tokens to an SLM for efficiency and routes critical tokens to an LLM for generalization quality. We formulate router training as a policy optimization, where the router receives rewards based on both the quality of predictions and the inference costs of generation. This allows the router to learn to predict token-level routing scores and make routing decisions based on both the current token and the future impact of its decisions. To further accelerate the reward evaluation process, we introduce a shortcut which significantly reduces the costs of the reward estimation and improving the practicality of our approach. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that CITER reduces the inference costs while preserving high-quality generation, offering a promising solution for real-time and resource-constrained applications.</description>
