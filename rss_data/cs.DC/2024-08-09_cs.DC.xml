      <title>In-situ data extraction for pathway analysis in an idealized atmosphere configuration of E3SM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an approach for characterizing source-impact pathways, the interactions of a set of variables in space-time due to an external forcing, in climate models using in-situ analyses that circumvent computationally expensive read/write operations. This approach makes use of a lightweight open-source software library we developed known as CLDERA-Tools. We describe how CLDERA-Tools is linked with the U.S. Department of Energy's Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) in a minimally invasive way for in-situ extraction of quantities of interested and associated statistics. Subsequently, these quantities are used to represent source-impact pathways with time-dependent directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). The utility of CLDERA-Tools is demonstrated by using the data it extracts in-situ to compute a spatially resolved DAG from an idealized configuration of the atmosphere with a parameterized representation of a volcanic eruption known as HSW-V.</description>

      <title>Addressing Model and Data Heterogeneity in Multimodal Large Language Model Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in a wide range of AI applications. Yet, training multimodal LLMs suffers from low efficiency and scalability, due to the inherent model heterogeneity and data heterogeneity across different modalities.
  We present MMScale, an efficient and adaptive framework to reform the training of multimodal large language models on large-scale clusters. MMScale exploits the system characteristics of multimodal LLM training to achieve high efficiency and scalability. The core of MMScale is the adaptive resource allocation and data-aware reordering techniques to eliminate the model and data heterogeneity respectively. We also tailor system optimizations for multimodal LLM training to offload certain operations from the GPU training. We evaluate MMScale across different sizes of multimodal LLMs on a large-scale production cluster with thousands of GPUs. The experimental results show that MMScale achieves 54.7% Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU) when training a 72B multimodal LLM on 1172 GPUs and outperforms Megatron-LM by up to 2.2$\times$ on throughput. The ablation study shows the main techniques of MMScale are both effective and lightweight.</description>

      <title>Partial Experts Checkpoint: Efficient Fault Tolerance for Sparse Mixture-of-Experts Model Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As large language models continue to scale up, the imperative for fault tolerance in distributed deep learning systems intensifies, becoming a focal area of AI infrastructure research. Checkpoint has emerged as the predominant fault tolerance strategy, with extensive studies dedicated to optimizing its efficiency. However, the advent of the sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model presents new challenges for traditional checkpoint techniques due to the substantial increase in model size, despite comparable computational demands to dense models. Breaking new ground in the realm of efficient fault tolerance for MoE model training, we introduce a novel Partial Experts Checkpoint (PEC) mechanism alongside a corresponding PEC fault-tolerant system. Our approach strategically checkpoints a selected subset of experts, thereby significantly reducing the checkpoint size for MoE models to a level comparable with that of dense models. The empirical analysis on our 8-expert GPT-MoE model demonstrates that the proposed PEC approach facilitates a substantial 54.2% decrease in the size of non-redundant checkpoint (no data-parallel duplication), without compromising the final model quality. Moreover, our PEC fault-tolerant system achieves a 76.9% reduction in checkpoint workload per data-parallel distributed rank, thereby correspondingly diminishing the checkpointing time and facilitating complete overlap with the training process.</description>

      <title>Towards SLO-Optimized LLM Serving via Automatic Inference Engine Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A service-level objective (SLO) is a target performance metric of service that cloud vendors aim to ensure. Delivering optimized SLOs can enhance user satisfaction and improve the competitiveness of cloud vendors. As large language models (LLMs) are gaining increasing popularity across various fields, it is of great significance to optimize SLOs for LLM inference services. In this paper, we observe that adjusting the parameters of LLM inference engines can improve service performance, and the optimal parameter configurations of different services are different. Therefore, we propose SCOOT, an automatic performance tuning system to optimize SLOs for each LLM inference service by tuning the parameters of the inference engine. We first propose a generalized formulation of the tuning problem to handle various objectives and constraints between parameters, and SCOOT exploits the Bayesian optimization (BO) technique to resolve the problem via exploration and exploitation. Moreover, SCOOT adopts a random forest to learn hidden constraints during the tuning process to mitigate invalid exploration. To improve the tuning efficiency, SCOOT utilizes the parallel suggestion to accelerate the tuning process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SCOOT can significantly outperform existing tuning techniques in SLO optimization while greatly improving the tuning efficiency.</description>

      <title>Sparse Spiking Neural-like Membrane Systems on Graphics Processing Units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The parallel simulation of Spiking Neural P systems is mainly based on a matrix representation, where the graph inherent to the neural model is encoded in an adjacency matrix. The simulation algorithm is based on a matrix-vector multiplication, which is an operation efficiently implemented on parallel devices. However, when the graph of a Spiking Neural P system is not fully connected, the adjacency matrix is sparse and hence, lots of computing resources are wasted in both time and memory domains. For this reason, two compression methods for the matrix representation were proposed in a previous work, but they were not implemented nor parallelized on a simulator. In this paper, they are implemented and parallelized on GPUs as part of a new Spiking Neural P system with delays simulator. Extensive experiments are conducted on high-end GPUs (RTX2080 and A100 80GB), and it is concluded that they outperform other solutions based on state-of-the-art GPU libraries when simulating Spiking Neural P systems.</description>

      <title>Large-Scale Graphs Community Detection using Spark GraphFrames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the emergence of social networks, online platforms dedicated to different use cases, and sensor networks, the emergence of large-scale graph community detection has become a steady field of research with real-world applications. Community detection algorithms have numerous practical applications, particularly due to their scalability with data size. Nonetheless, a notable drawback of community detection algorithms is their computational intensity~\cite{Apostol2014}, resulting in decreasing performance as data size increases. For this purpose, new frameworks that employ distributed systems such as Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark which can seamlessly handle large-scale graphs must be developed. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for community detection algorithms, i.e., K-Cliques, Louvain, and Fast Greedy, developed using Apache Spark GraphFrames. We test their performance and scalability on two real-world datasets. The experimental results prove the feasibility of developing graph mining algorithms using Apache Spark GraphFrames.</description>

      <title>Zero-Delay QKV Compression for Mitigating KV Cache and Network Bottlenecks in LLM Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In large-language models, memory constraints in the key-value cache (KVC) pose a challenge during inference, especially with long prompts. In this work, we observed that compressing KV values is more effective than compressing the model regarding accuracy and job completion time (JCT). However, quantizing KV values and dropping less-important tokens incur significant runtime computational time overhead, delaying JCT. These methods also cannot reduce computation time or high network communication time overhead in sequence-parallelism (SP) frameworks for long prompts. To tackle these issues, based on our insightful observations from experimental analysis, we propose ZeroC, a Zero-delay QKV Compression system that eliminates time overhead and even reduces computation and communication time of the model operations. ZeroC innovatively embeds compression and decompression operations within model operations and adaptively determines compression ratios at a hybrid layer-token level. Further, it enables a communication-efficient SP inference framework. Trace-driven experiments demonstrate that ZeroC achieves up to 80% lower average JCT, 35% lower average perplexity, and 2.8x higher throughput with the same latency compared to state-of-the-art compression methods. ZeroC also reduces the average JCT of current LLM serving systems by up to 91% with the constraint of 0.1 perplexity increase. We open-sourced the code.</description>

      <title>Reducing Matroid Optimization to Basis Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In combinatorial optimization, matroids provide one of the most elegant structures for algorithm design. This is perhaps best identified by the Edmonds-Rado theorem relating the success of the simple greedy algorithm to the anatomy of the optimal basis of a matroid [Edm71; Rad57]. As a response, much energy has been devoted to understanding a matroid's favorable computational properties. Yet surprisingly, not much is understood where parallel algorithm design is concerned. Specifically, while prior work has investigated the task of finding an arbitrary basis in parallel computing settings [KUW88], the more complex task of finding the optimal basis remains unexplored. We initiate this study by reexamining Bor\r{u}vka's minimum weight spanning tree algorithm in the language of matroid theory, identifying a new characterization of the optimal basis by way of a matroid's cocircuits as a result. Furthermore, we then combine such insights with special properties of binary matroids to reduce optimization in a binary matroid to the simpler task of search for an arbitrary basis, with only logarithmic asymptotic overhead. Consequentially, we are able to compose our reduction with a known basis search method of [KUW88] to obtain a novel algorithm for finding the optimal basis of a binary matroid with only sublinearly many adaptive rounds of queries to an independence oracle. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first parallel algorithm for matroid optimization to outperform the greedy algorithm in terms of adaptive complexity, for any class of matroid not represented by a graph.</description>

      <title>Orchestrating Quantum Cloud Environments with Qonductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe Qonductor, a cloud orchestrator for hybrid quantum-classical applications that run on heterogeneous hybrid resources. Qonductor exposes the $Qonductor~API$, a high-level and hardware-agnostic API for customizable hybrid application development and execution, that abstracts away the complexity of hybrid resource management. To guide hybrid resource management, the $resource~estimator$ accurately estimates execution fidelity and runtime to generate and offer resource plans. The $hybrid~scheduler$ leverages the resource plans to automate job scheduling on hybrid resources and balance the tradeoff between users' objectives of high fidelity and low runtimes and the cloud operator's objective of resource efficiency.
  We implement an open-source prototype of Qonductor by building on top of Kubernetes and evaluate it using more than 7000 real quantum runs on the IBM quantum cloud to simulate real cloud workloads. Qonductor achieves up to 54\% lower job completion times (JCTs) while sacrificing 6\% fidelity, balances the load across QPU which increases quantum resource utilization by up to 66\%, and scales with increasing system sizes and loads.</description>

      <title>Low-Depth Spatial Tree Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12953v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Contemporary accelerator designs exhibit a high degree of spatial localization, wherein two-dimensional physical distance determines communication costs between processing elements. This situation presents considerable algorithmic challenges, particularly when managing sparse data, a pivotal component in progressing data science. The spatial computer model quantifies communication locality by weighting processor communication costs by distance, introducing a term named energy. Moreover, it integrates depth, a widely-utilized metric, to promote high parallelism. We propose and analyze a framework for efficient spatial tree algorithms within the spatial computer model. Our primary method constructs a spatial tree layout that optimizes the locality of the neighbors in the compute grid. This approach thereby enables locality-optimized messaging within the tree. Our layout achieves a polynomial factor improvement in energy compared to utilizing a PRAM approach. Using this layout, we develop energy-efficient treefix sum and lowest common ancestor algorithms, which are both fundamental building blocks for other graph algorithms. With high probability, our algorithms exhibit near-linear energy and poly-logarithmic depth. Our contributions augment a growing body of work demonstrating that computations can have both high spatial locality and low depth. Moreover, our work constitutes an advancement in the spatial layout of irregular and sparse computations.</description>

      <title>FT K-means: A High-Performance K-means on GPU with Fault Tolerance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: K-means is a widely used algorithm in clustering, however, its efficiency is primarily constrained by the computational cost of distance computing. Existing implementations suffer from suboptimal utilization of computational units and lack resilience against soft errors. To address these challenges, we introduce FT K-means, a high-performance GPU-accelerated implementation of K-means with online fault tolerance. We first present a stepwise optimization strategy that achieves competitive performance compared to NVIDIA's cuML library. We further improve FT K-means with a template-based code generation framework that supports different data types and adapts to different input shapes. A novel warp-level tensor-core error correction scheme is proposed to address the failure of existing fault tolerance methods due to memory asynchronization during copy operations. Our experimental evaluations on NVIDIA T4 GPU and A100 GPU demonstrate that FT K-means without fault tolerance outperforms cuML's K-means implementation, showing a performance increase of 10\%-300\% in scenarios involving irregular data shapes. Moreover, the fault tolerance feature of FT K-means introduces only an overhead of 11\%, maintaining robust performance even with tens of errors injected per second.</description>

Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) is one of the emerging technologies that has grabbed the attention of researchers from academia and industry. The idea behind Internet of things is the interconnection of internet enabled things or devices to each other and to humans, to achieve some common goals. In near future IoT is expected to be seamlessly integrated into our environment and human will be wholly solely dependent on this technology for comfort and easy life style. Any security compromise of the system will directly affect human life. Therefore security and privacy of this technology is foremost important issue to resolve. In this paper we present a thorough study of security problems in IoT and classify possible cyberattacks on each layer of IoT architecture. We also discuss challenges to traditional security solutions such as cryptographic solutions, authentication mechanisms and key management in IoT. Device authentication and access controls is an essential area of IoT security, which is not surveyed so far. We spent our efforts to bring the state of the art device authentication and access control techniques on a single paper.</description>

      <title>OpenLB User Guide: Associated with Release 1.6 of the Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11752v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: OpenLB is an object-oriented implementation of LBM. It is the first implementation of a generic platform for LBM programming, which is shared with the open source community (GPLv2). Since the first release in 2007, the code has been continuously improved and extended which is documented by thirteen releases as well as the corresponding release notes which are available on the OpenLB website (https://www.openlb.net). The OpenLB code is written in C++ and is used by application programmers as well as developers, with the ability to implement custom models OpenLB supports complex data structures that allow simulations in complex geometries and parallel execution using MPI, OpenMP and CUDA on high-performance computers. The source code uses the concepts of interfaces and templates, so that efficient, direct and intuitive implementations of the LBM become possible. The efficiency and scalability has been checked and proved by code reviews. This user manual and a source code documentation by DoxyGen are available on the OpenLB project website.</description>

      <title>FOOL: Addressing the Downlink Bottleneck in Satellite Computing with Neural Feature Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16677v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nanosatellite constellations equipped with sensors capturing large geographic regions provide unprecedented opportunities for Earth observation. As constellation sizes increase, network contention poses a downlink bottleneck. Orbital Edge Computing (OEC) leverages limited onboard compute resources to reduce transfer costs by processing the raw captures at the source. However, current solutions have limited practicability due to reliance on crude filtering methods or over-prioritizing particular downstream tasks.
  This work presents FOOL, an OEC-native and task-agnostic feature compression method that preserves prediction performance. FOOL partitions high-resolution satellite imagery to maximize throughput. Further, it embeds context and leverages inter-tile dependencies to lower transfer costs with negligible overhead. While FOOL is a feature compressor, it can recover images with competitive scores on quality measures at lower bitrates. We extensively evaluate transfer cost reduction by including the peculiarity of intermittently available network connections in low earth orbit. Lastly, we test the feasibility of our system for standardized nanosatellite form factors. We demonstrate that FOOL permits downlinking over 100x the data volume without relying on prior information on the downstream tasks.</description>
