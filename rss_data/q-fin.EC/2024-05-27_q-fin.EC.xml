      <title>The Impact of Social Media on Music Demand: Evidence from a Quasi-Natural Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The digital age has significantly changed how music is consumed, promoted, and monetized. Social media platforms like TikTok are playing a pivotal role in this transformation. This shift has sparked a debate within the music industry: While some stakeholders see social media platforms like TikTok as opportunities to boost songs to viral status, others raise concerns about potential cannibalization effects, fearing that such exposure might reduce revenue from streaming services like Spotify. In this paper, we evaluate the effect of a song's presence - or absence - on social media on its demand on music streaming services using a quasi-natural experiment: Universal Music Group's (UMG) - one of "The Big 3" record labels - decision to remove its entire content library from TikTok in February 2024. We use representative samples covering close to 50% of the US and 94% of the German streaming markets, employing a difference-in-differences approach to compare the streaming consumption of songs that were removed from TikTok with those that were not. We find that UMG's removal of music from TikTok led to a 2-3% increase in streams on audio platforms for affected songs, indicating substitution effects. However, this average treatment effect masks significant heterogeneity: older songs and songs with less promotional support elsewhere saw a decrease in streaming consumption, suggesting that TikTok helps consumers discover or rediscover content that is not top of mind for consumers.</description>

      <title>Digital finance, Bargaining Power and Gender Wage Gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of internet technology has catalyzed the rapid development of digital finance, significantly impacting the optimization of resource allocation in China and exerting a substantial and enduring influence on the structure of employment and income distribution. This research utilizes data sourced from the Chinese General Social Survey and the Digital Financial Inclusion Index to scrutinize the influence of digital finance on the gender wage disparity in China. The findings reveal that digital finance reduces the gender wage gap, and this conclusion remains robust after addressing endogeneity problem using instrumental variable methods. Further analysis of the underlying mechanisms indicates that digital finance facilitates female entrepreneurship by lowering financing barriers, thereby promoting employment opportunities for women and also empowering them to negotiate higher wages. Specially, digital finance enhances women's bargaining power within domestic settings, therefore exerts a positive influence on the wages of women. Sub-sample regressions demonstrate that women from economically disadvantaged backgrounds, with lower human capital, benefit more from digital finance, underscoring its inclusive nature. This study provides policy evidence for empowering vulnerable groups to increase their wages and addressing the persistent issue of gender income disparity in the labor market.</description>

      <title>Serving economic prosperity: economic impact assessments (EIA) on Earth observation-based services and tools by SERVIR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an era where informed decision-making is paramount for sustainable development and effective resource management, the role of Earth observations (EO) in shaping economic landscapes cannot be overstated. EO, facilitated by satellites, sensors, and data analytics, is a cornerstone for evidence-based policymaking, risk mitigation, and resource allocation. SERVIR is a joint initiative of US Agency for International Development and NASA. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of relevant economic impact assessment (EIA) work, summarizes SERVIRs potential interests in EIA, and identifies how and where EIA could improve how SERVIR quantifies and communicates the impact of its services.</description>

      <title>Labor Market Effects of the Venezuelan Refugee Crisis in Brazil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.04201v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use administrative panel data on the universe of Brazilian formal workers to investigate the labor market effects of the Venezuelan crisis in Brazil, focusing on the border state of Roraima. The results using difference-in-differences show that the monthly wages of Brazilians in Roraima increased by around 2 percent, which was mostly driven by those working in sectors and occupations with no refugee involvement. The study finds negligible job displacement for Brazilians but finds evidence of native workers moving to occupations without immigrants. We also find that immigrants in the informal market offset the substitution effects in the formal market.</description>

      <title>Power sector effects of alternative options for de-fossilizing heavy-duty vehicles -- go electric, and charge smartly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.16629v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Various options are discussed to de-fossilize heavy-duty vehicles (HDV), including battery-electric vehicles (BEV), electric road systems (ERS), and indirect electrification via hydrogen fuel cells or e-fuels. We investigate their power sector implications in future scenarios of Germany with high renewable energy shares, using an open-source capacity expansion model and route-based truck traffic data. Power sector costs are lowest for flexibly charged BEV that also carry out vehicle-to-grid operations, and highest for e-fuels. If BEV and ERS-BEV are not optimally charged, power sector costs increase, but are still substantially lower than in scenarios with hydrogen or e-fuels. This is because indirect electrification is less energy efficient, which outweighs potential flexibility benefits. BEV and ERS-BEV favor solar photovoltaic energy, while hydrogen and e-fuels favor wind power and increase fossil electricity generation. Results remain qualitatively robust in sensitivity analyses.</description>

      <title>Economic DAO Governance: A Contestable Control Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16980v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we propose a new form of DAO governance that uses a sequential auction mechanism to overcome entrenched control issues that have emerged for DAOs by creating a regime of temporary contestable control. The mechanism avoids potential public choice problems inherent in voting approaches but at the same time provides a vehicle that can enhance and secure value than inheres to DAO voting and other DAO non-market governance procedures. It is robust to empty voting and is code feasible. It facilitates the ability of DAOs to meet their normative and operational goals in the face of diverse regulatory approaches. Designed to shift control to the party with the most promising business plan, at the same time it distributes surplus in a way that tends to promote investment by other parties.</description>
