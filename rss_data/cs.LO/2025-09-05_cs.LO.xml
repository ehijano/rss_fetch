      <title>A Cegar-centric Bounded Reachability Analysis for Compositional Affine Hybrid Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reachability analysis of compositional hybrid systems, where individual components are modeled as hybrid automata, poses unique challenges. In addition to preserving the compositional semantics while computing system behaviors, algorithms have to cater to the explosion in the number of locations in the parallel product automaton. In this paper, we propose a bounded reachability analysis algorithm for compositional hybrid systems with piecewise affine dynamics, based on the principle of counterexample guided abstraction refinement (CEGAR). In particular, the algorithm searches for a counterexample in the discrete abstraction of the composition model, without explicitly computing a product automaton. When a counterexample is discovered in the abstraction, its validity is verified by a refinement of the state-space guided by the abstract counterexample. The state-space refinement is through a symbolic reachability analysis, particularly using a state-of-the-art algorithm with support functions as the continuous state representation. In addition, the algorithm mixes different semantics of composition with the objective of improved efficiency. Step compositional semantics is followed while exploring the abstract (discrete) state-space, while shallow compositional semantics is followed during state-space refinement with symbolic reachability analysis. Optimizations such as caching the results of the symbolic reachability analysis, which can be later reused, have been proposed. We implement this algorithm in the tool SAT-Reach and demonstrate the scalability benefits.</description>

      <title>Simplicity Lies in the Eye of the Beholder: A Strategic Perspective on Controllers in Reactive Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the game-theoretic approach to controller synthesis, we model the interaction between a system to be controlled and its environment as a game between these entities, and we seek an appropriate (e.g., winning or optimal) strategy for the system. This strategy then serves as a formal blueprint for a real-world controller. A common belief is that simple (e.g., using limited memory) strategies are better: corresponding controllers are easier to conceive and understand, and cheaper to produce and maintain.
  This invited contribution focuses on the complexity of strategies in a variety of synthesis contexts. We discuss recent results concerning memory and randomness, and take a brief look at what lies beyond our traditional notions of complexity for strategies.</description>

      <title>Janus-faces of temporal constraint languages: a dichotomy of expressivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Bodirsky-K\'ara classification of temporal constraint languages stands as one of the earliest and most seminal complexity classifications within infinite-domain Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs), yet it remains one of the most mysterious in terms of algorithms and algebraic invariants for the tractable cases. We show that those temporal languages which do not pp-construct EVERYTHING (and thus by the classification are solvable in polynomial time) have, in fact, very limited expressive power as measured by the graphs and hypergraphs they can pp-interpret. This limitation yields many previously unknown algebraic consequences, while also providing new, uniform proofs for known invariance properties. In particular, we show that such temporal constraint languages admit $4$-ary pseudo-Siggers polymorphisms -- a result that sustains the possibility that the existence of such polymorphisms extends to the much broader context of the Bodirsky-Pinsker conjecture.</description>

      <title>Oruga: An Avatar of Representational Systems Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Humans use representations flexibly. We draw diagrams, change representations and exploit creative analogies across different domains. We want to harness this kind of power and endow machines with it to make them more compatible with human use. Previously we developed Representational Systems Theory (RST) to study the structure and transformations of representations. In this paper we present Oruga (caterpillar in Spanish; a symbol of transformation), an implementation of various aspects of RST. Oruga consists of a core of data structures corresponding to concepts in RST, a language for communicating with the core, and an engine for producing transformations using a method we call structure transfer. In this paper we present an overview of the core and language of Oruga, with a brief example of the kind of transformation that structure transfer can execute.</description>

      <title>Domain size asymptotics for Markov logic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Markov logic network (MLN) determines a probability distribution on the set of structures, or ``possible worlds'', with an arbitrary finite domain. We study the properties of such distributions as the domain size tends to infinity. Three types of concrete examples of MLNs will be considered, and the properties of random structures with domain sizes tending to infinity will be studied: (1) Arbitrary quantifier-free MLNs over a language with only one relation symbol which has arity 1. In this case we give a pretty complete characterization of the possible limit behaviours of random structures. (2) An MLN that favours graphs with fewer triangles (or more generally, fewer k-cliques). As a corollary of the analysis a ``$\delta$-approximate 0-1 law'' for first-order logic is obtained. (3) An MLN that favours graphs with fewer vertices with degree higher than a fixed (but arbitrary) number. The analysis shows that depending on which ``soft constraints'' an MLN uses the limit behaviour of random structures can be quite different, and the weights of the soft constraints may, or may not, have influence on the limit behaviour. It will also be demonstrated, using (1), that quantifier-free MLNs and lifted Bayesian networks (in a broad sense) are asymptotically incomparable, roughly meaning that there is a sequence of distributions on possible worlds with increasing domain sizes that can be defined by one of the formalisms but not even approximated by the other. In a rather general context it is also shown that on large domains the distribution determined by an MLN concentrates almost all its probability mass on a totally different part of the space of possible worlds than the uniform distribution does.</description>

      <title>Extensional and Non-extensional Functions as Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03536v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Following Milner's seminal paper, the representation of functions as processes has received considerable attention. For pure $\lambda$-calculus, the process representations yield (at best) non-extensional $\lambda $-theories (i.e., $\beta$ rule holds, whereas $\eta$ does not).

In the paper, we study how to obtain extensional representations, and how to move between extensional and non-extensional representations. Using Internal $\pi$, $\mathrm{I}\pi$ (a subset of the $\pi$-calculus in which all outputs are bound), we develop a refinement of Milner's original encoding of functions as processes that is parametric on certain abstract components called wires. These are, intuitively, processes whose task is to connect two end-point channels. We show that when a few algebraic properties of wires hold, the encoding yields a $\lambda$-theory. Exploiting the symmetries and dualities of $\mathrm{I}\pi$, we isolate three main classes of wires. The first two have a sequential behaviour and are dual of each other; the third has a parallel behaviour and is the dual of itself. We show the adoption of the parallel wires yields an extensional $\lambda$-theory; in fact, it yields an equality that coincides with that of B\"ohm trees with infinite $\eta$. In contrast, the other two classes of wires yield non-extensional $\lambda$-theories whose equalities are those of the L\'evy-Longo and B\"ohm trees.</description>

      <title>Positive Sharing and Abstract Machines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14131v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wu's positive $\lambda$-calculus is a recent call-by-value $\lambda$-calculus with sharing coming from Miller and Wu's study of the proof-theoretical concept of focalization. Accattoli and Wu showed that it simplifies a technical aspect of the study of sharing; namely it rules out the recurrent issue of renaming chains, that often causes a quadratic time slowdown.
  In this paper, we define the natural abstract machine for the positive $\lambda$-calculus and show that it suffers from an inefficiency: the quadratic slowdown somehow reappears when analyzing the cost of the machine. We then design an optimized machine for the positive $\lambda$-calculus, which we prove efficient. The optimization is based on a new slicing technique which is dual to the standard structure of machine environments.</description>

      <title>Compositional Verification of Almost-Sure B\"uchi Objectives in MDPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the verification of almost-sure B\"uchi objectives in MDPs with a known, compositional structure based on string diagrams. In particular, we ask whether there is a strategy that ensures that a B\"uchi objective is almost-surely satisfied. We first show that proper exit sets -- the sets of exits that can be reached within a component without losing locally -- together with the reachability of a B\"uchi state are a sufficient and necessary statistic for the compositional verification of almost-sure B\"uchi objectives. The number of proper exit sets may grow exponentially in the number of exits. We define two algorithms: (1) A straightforward bottom-up algorithm that computes this statistic in a recursive manner to obtain the verification result of the entire string diagram and (2) a polynomial-time iterative algorithm which avoids computing all proper exit sets by performing iterative strategy refinement.</description>

      <title>Polygraphs: From Rewriting to Higher Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00429v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Polygraphs are a higher-dimensional generalization of the notion of directed graph. Based on those as unifying concept, this monograph on polygraphs revisits the theory of rewriting in the context of strict higher categories, adopting the abstract point of view offered by homotopical algebra. The first half explores the theory of polygraphs in low dimensions and its applications to the computation of the coherence of algebraic structures. It is meant to be progressive, with little requirements on the background of the reader, apart from basic category theory, and is illustrated with algorithmic computations on algebraic structures. The second half introduces and studies the general notion of n-polygraph, dealing with the homotopy theory of those. It constructs the folk model structure on the category of strict higher categories and exhibits polygraphs as cofibrant objects. This allows extending to higher dimensional structures the coherence results developed in the first half.</description>

      <title>Axiomatics of Restricted Choices by Linear Orders of Sets with Minimum as Fallback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03315v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study how linear orders can be employed to realise choice functions for which the set of potential choices is restricted, i.e., the possible choice is not possible among the full powerset of all alternatives. In such restricted settings, constructing a choice function via a relation on the alternatives is not always possible. However, we show that one can always construct a choice function via a linear order on sets of alternatives, even when a fallback value is encoded as the minimal element in the linear order. The axiomatics of such choice functions are presented for the general case and the case of union-closed input restrictions. Restricted choice structures have applications in knowledge representation and reasoning, and here we discuss their applications for theory change and abstract argumentation.</description>

      <title>Structure Transfer: an Inference-Based Calculus for the Transformation of Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03249v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Representation choice is of fundamental importance to our ability to communicate and reason effectively. A major unsolved problem, addressed in this paper, is how to devise representational-system (RS) agnostic techniques that drive representation transformation and choice. We present a novel calculus, called structure transfer, that enables representation transformation across diverse RSs. Specifically, given a source representation drawn from a source RS, the rules of structure transfer allow us to generate a target representation for a target RS. The generality of structure transfer comes in part from its ability to ensure that the source representation and the generated target representation satisfy any specified relation (such as semantic equivalence). This is done by exploiting schemas, which encode knowledge about RSs. Specifically, schemas can express preservation of information across relations between any pair of RSs, and this knowledge is used by structure transfer to derive a structure for the target representation which ensures that the desired relation holds. We formalise this using Representational Systems Theory, building on the key concept of a construction space. The abstract nature of construction spaces grants them the generality to model RSs of diverse kinds, including formal languages, geometric figures and diagrams, as well as informal notations. Consequently, structure transfer is a system-agnostic calculus that can be used to identify alternative representations in a wide range of practical settings.</description>
