      <title>Advanced Artificial Intelligence Algorithms in Cochlear Implants: Review of Healthcare Strategies, Challenges, and Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) plays a pivotal role in our daily lives, offering utility not only for interacting with machines but also for facilitating communication for individuals with either partial or profound hearing impairments. The process involves receiving the speech signal in analogue form, followed by various signal processing algorithms to make it compatible with devices of limited capacity, such as cochlear implants (CIs). Unfortunately, these implants, equipped with a finite number of electrodes, often result in speech distortion during synthesis. Despite efforts by researchers to enhance received speech quality using various state-of-the-art signal processing techniques, challenges persist, especially in scenarios involving multiple sources of speech, environmental noise, and other circumstances. The advent of new artificial intelligence (AI) methods has ushered in cutting-edge strategies to address the limitations and difficulties associated with traditional signal processing techniques dedicated to CIs. This review aims to comprehensively review advancements in CI-based ASR and speech enhancement, among other related aspects. The primary objective is to provide a thorough overview of metrics and datasets, exploring the capabilities of AI algorithms in this biomedical field, summarizing and commenting on the best results obtained. Additionally, the review will delve into potential applications and suggest future directions to bridge existing research gaps in this domain.</description>

      <title>Distributed collaborative anomalous sound detection by embedding sharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To develop a machine sound monitoring system, a method for detecting anomalous sound is proposed. In this paper, we explore a method for multiple clients to collaboratively learn an anomalous sound detection model while keeping their raw data private from each other. In the context of industrial machine anomalous sound detection, each client possesses data from different machines or different operational states, making it challenging to learn through federated learning or split learning. In our proposed method, each client calculates embeddings using a common pre-trained model developed for sound data classification, and these calculated embeddings are aggregated on the server to perform anomalous sound detection through outlier exposure. Experiments showed that our proposed method improves the AUC of anomalous sound detection by an average of 6.8%.</description>

      <title>VoiceCraft: Zero-Shot Speech Editing and Text-to-Speech in the Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce VoiceCraft, a token infilling neural codec language model, that achieves state-of-the-art performance on both speech editing and zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) on audiobooks, internet videos, and podcasts. VoiceCraft employs a Transformer decoder architecture and introduces a token rearrangement procedure that combines causal masking and delayed stacking to enable generation within an existing sequence. On speech editing tasks, VoiceCraft produces edited speech that is nearly indistinguishable from unedited recordings in terms of naturalness, as evaluated by humans; for zero-shot TTS, our model outperforms prior SotA models including VALLE and the popular commercial model XTTS-v2. Crucially, the models are evaluated on challenging and realistic datasets, that consist of diverse accents, speaking styles, recording conditions, and background noise and music, and our model performs consistently well compared to other models and real recordings. In particular, for speech editing evaluation, we introduce a high quality, challenging, and realistic dataset named RealEdit. We encourage readers to listen to the demos at https://jasonppy.github.io/VoiceCraft_web.</description>

      <title>Isometric Neural Machine Translation using Phoneme Count Ratio Reward-based Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional Automatic Video Dubbing (AVD) pipeline consists of three key modules, namely, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Neural Machine Translation (NMT), and Text-to-Speech (TTS). Within AVD pipelines, isometric-NMT algorithms are employed to regulate the length of the synthesized output text. This is done to guarantee synchronization with respect to the alignment of video and audio subsequent to the dubbing process. Previous approaches have focused on aligning the number of characters and words in the source and target language texts of Machine Translation models. However, our approach aims to align the number of phonemes instead, as they are closely associated with speech duration. In this paper, we present the development of an isometric NMT system using Reinforcement Learning (RL), with a focus on optimizing the alignment of phoneme counts in the source and target language sentence pairs. To evaluate our models, we propose the Phoneme Count Compliance (PCC) score, which is a measure of length compliance. Our approach demonstrates a substantial improvement of approximately 36% in the PCC score compared to the state-of-the-art models when applied to English-Hindi language pairs. Moreover, we propose a student-teacher architecture within the framework of our RL approach to maintain a trade-off between the phoneme count and translation quality.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving End-to-End Spoken Language Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spoken language understanding (SLU), one of the key enabling technologies for human-computer interaction in IoT devices, provides an easy-to-use user interface. Human speech can contain a lot of user-sensitive information, such as gender, identity, and sensitive content. New types of security and privacy breaches have thus emerged. Users do not want to expose their personal sensitive information to malicious attacks by untrusted third parties. Thus, the SLU system needs to ensure that a potential malicious attacker cannot deduce the sensitive attributes of the users, while it should avoid greatly compromising the SLU accuracy. To address the above challenge, this paper proposes a novel SLU multi-task privacy-preserving model to prevent both the speech recognition (ASR) and identity recognition (IR) attacks. The model uses the hidden layer separation technique so that SLU information is distributed only in a specific portion of the hidden layer, and the other two types of information are removed to obtain a privacy-secure hidden layer. In order to achieve good balance between efficiency and privacy, we introduce a new mechanism of model pre-training, namely joint adversarial training, to further enhance the user privacy. Experiments over two SLU datasets show that the proposed method can reduce the accuracy of both the ASR and IR attacks close to that of a random guess, while leaving the SLU performance largely unaffected.</description>

      <title>Towards auditory attention decoding with noise-tagging: A pilot study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Auditory attention decoding (AAD) aims to extract from brain activity the attended speaker amidst candidate speakers, offering promising applications for neuro-steered hearing devices and brain-computer interfacing. This pilot study makes a first step towards AAD using the noise-tagging stimulus protocol, which evokes reliable code-modulated evoked potentials, but is minimally explored in the auditory modality. Participants were sequentially presented with two Dutch speech stimuli that were amplitude modulated with a unique binary pseudo-random noise-code, effectively tagging these with additional decodable information. We compared the decoding of unmodulated audio against audio modulated with various modulation depths, and a conventional AAD method against a standard method to decode noise-codes. Our pilot study revealed higher performances for the conventional method with 70 to 100 percent modulation depths compared to unmodulated audio. The noise-code decoder did not further improve these results. These fundamental insights highlight the potential of integrating noise-codes in speech to enhance auditory speaker detection when multiple speakers are presented simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Music to Dance as Language Translation using Sequence Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synthesising appropriate choreographies from music remains an open problem. We introduce MDLT, a novel approach that frames the choreography generation problem as a translation task. Our method leverages an existing data set to learn to translate sequences of audio into corresponding dance poses. We present two variants of MDLT: one utilising the Transformer architecture and the other employing the Mamba architecture. We train our method on AIST++ and PhantomDance data sets to teach a robotic arm to dance, but our method can be applied to a full humanoid robot. Evaluation metrics, including Average Joint Error and Frechet Inception Distance, consistently demonstrate that, when given a piece of music, MDLT excels at producing realistic and high-quality choreography. The code can be found at github.com/meowatthemoon/MDLT.</description>

      <title>Training Generative Adversarial Network-Based Vocoder with Limited Data Using Augmentation-Conditional Discriminator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A generative adversarial network (GAN)-based vocoder trained with an adversarial discriminator is commonly used for speech synthesis because of its fast, lightweight, and high-quality characteristics. However, this data-driven model requires a large amount of training data incurring high data-collection costs. This fact motivates us to train a GAN-based vocoder on limited data. A promising solution is to augment the training data to avoid overfitting. However, a standard discriminator is unconditional and insensitive to distributional changes caused by data augmentation. Thus, augmented speech (which can be extraordinary) may be considered real speech. To address this issue, we propose an augmentation-conditional discriminator (AugCondD) that receives the augmentation state as input in addition to speech, thereby assessing the input speech according to the augmentation state, without inhibiting the learning of the original non-augmented distribution. Experimental results indicate that AugCondD improves speech quality under limited data conditions while achieving comparable speech quality under sufficient data conditions. Audio samples are available at https://www.kecl.ntt.co.jp/people/kaneko.takuhiro/projects/augcondd/.</description>

      <title>As Good As A Coin Toss Human detection of AI-generated images, videos, audio, and audiovisual stimuli</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As synthetic media becomes progressively more realistic and barriers to using it continue to lower, the technology has been increasingly utilized for malicious purposes, from financial fraud to nonconsensual pornography. Today, the principal defense against being misled by synthetic media relies on the ability of the human observer to visually and auditorily discern between real and fake. However, it remains unclear just how vulnerable people actually are to deceptive synthetic media in the course of their day to day lives. We conducted a perceptual study with 1276 participants to assess how accurate people were at distinguishing synthetic images, audio only, video only, and audiovisual stimuli from authentic. To reflect the circumstances under which people would likely encounter synthetic media in the wild, testing conditions and stimuli emulated a typical online platform, while all synthetic media used in the survey was sourced from publicly accessible generative AI technology.
  We find that overall, participants struggled to meaningfully discern between synthetic and authentic content. We also find that detection performance worsens when the stimuli contains synthetic content as compared to authentic content, images featuring human faces as compared to non face objects, a single modality as compared to multimodal stimuli, mixed authenticity as compared to being fully synthetic for audiovisual stimuli, and features foreign languages as compared to languages the observer is fluent in. Finally, we also find that prior knowledge of synthetic media does not meaningfully impact their detection performance. Collectively, these results indicate that people are highly susceptible to being tricked by synthetic media in their daily lives and that human perceptual detection capabilities can no longer be relied upon as an effective counterdefense.</description>

      <title>Encoding of lexical tone in self-supervised models of spoken language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interpretability research has shown that self-supervised Spoken Language Models (SLMs) encode a wide variety of features in human speech from the acoustic, phonetic, phonological, syntactic and semantic levels, to speaker characteristics. The bulk of prior research on representations of phonology has focused on segmental features such as phonemes; the encoding of suprasegmental phonology (such as tone and stress patterns) in SLMs is not yet well understood. Tone is a suprasegmental feature that is present in more than half of the world's languages. This paper aims to analyze the tone encoding capabilities of SLMs, using Mandarin and Vietnamese as case studies. We show that SLMs encode lexical tone to a significant degree even when they are trained on data from non-tonal languages. We further find that SLMs behave similarly to native and non-native human participants in tone and consonant perception studies, but they do not follow the same developmental trajectory.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, a group of finite sequences and its variants were proposed to use in conducting signal analysis; we called the developed signal analysis methods arbitrary discrete Fourier analysis (ADFA), Mel-scale discrete Fourier analysis (MDFA) and constant Q analysis (CQA). The effectiveness of three signal analysis methods were then validated by testing their performance on a replayed speech detection benchmark (i.e., the ASVspoof 2019 Physical Access) along with a state-of-the-art model. Comparable performance to the best reported systems were shown by the experimental results with three signal analysis methods. Furthermore, the CQA method shown its efficiency with less computation time in compared to the convention method constant Q transform (CQT), which is commonly used in spoofed and fake speech detection and music processing.</description>

      <title>A unified front-end framework for English text-to-speech synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.10666v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The front-end is a critical component of English text-to-speech (TTS) systems, responsible for extracting linguistic features that are essential for a text-to-speech model to synthesize speech, such as prosodies and phonemes. The English TTS front-end typically consists of a text normalization (TN) module, a prosody word prosody phrase (PWPP) module, and a grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) module. However, current research on the English TTS front-end focuses solely on individual modules, neglecting the interdependence between them and resulting in sub-optimal performance for each module. Therefore, this paper proposes a unified front-end framework that captures the dependencies among the English TTS front-end modules. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in all modules.</description>

      <title>BigVSAN: Enhancing GAN-based Neural Vocoders with Slicing Adversarial Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02836v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative adversarial network (GAN)-based vocoders have been intensively studied because they can synthesize high-fidelity audio waveforms faster than real-time. However, it has been reported that most GANs fail to obtain the optimal projection for discriminating between real and fake data in the feature space. In the literature, it has been demonstrated that slicing adversarial network (SAN), an improved GAN training framework that can find the optimal projection, is effective in the image generation task. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of SAN in the vocoding task. For this purpose, we propose a scheme to modify least-squares GAN, which most GAN-based vocoders adopt, so that their loss functions satisfy the requirements of SAN. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that SAN can improve the performance of GAN-based vocoders, including BigVGAN, with small modifications. Our code is available at https://github.com/sony/bigvsan.</description>

      <title>Spiking-LEAF: A Learnable Auditory front-end for Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09469v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Brain-inspired spiking neural networks (SNNs) have demonstrated great potential for temporal signal processing. However, their performance in speech processing remains limited due to the lack of an effective auditory front-end. To address this limitation, we introduce Spiking-LEAF, a learnable auditory front-end meticulously designed for SNN-based speech processing. Spiking-LEAF combines a learnable filter bank with a novel two-compartment spiking neuron model called IHC-LIF. The IHC-LIF neurons draw inspiration from the structure of inner hair cells (IHC) and they leverage segregated dendritic and somatic compartments to effectively capture multi-scale temporal dynamics of speech signals. Additionally, the IHC-LIF neurons incorporate the lateral feedback mechanism along with spike regularization loss to enhance spike encoding efficiency. On keyword spotting and speaker identification tasks, the proposed Spiking-LEAF outperforms both SOTA spiking auditory front-ends and conventional real-valued acoustic features in terms of classification accuracy, noise robustness, and encoding efficiency.</description>
