      <title>Automating proton PBS treatment planning for head and neck cancers using policy gradient-based deep reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proton pencil beam scanning (PBS) treatment planning for head and neck (H&amp;N) cancers is a time-consuming and experience-demanding task where a large number of planning objectives are involved. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has recently been introduced to the planning processes of intensity-modulated radiation therapy and brachytherapy for prostate, lung, and cervical cancers. However, existing approaches are built upon the Q-learning framework and weighted linear combinations of clinical metrics, suffering from poor scalability and flexibility and only capable of adjusting a limited number of planning objectives in discrete action spaces. We propose an automatic treatment planning model using the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm and a dose distribution-based reward function for proton PBS treatment planning of H&amp;N cancers. Specifically, a set of empirical rules is used to create auxiliary planning structures from target volumes and organs-at-risk (OARs), along with their associated planning objectives. These planning objectives are fed into an in-house optimization engine to generate the spot monitor unit (MU) values. A decision-making policy network trained using PPO is developed to iteratively adjust the involved planning objective parameters in a continuous action space and refine the PBS treatment plans using a novel dose distribution-based reward function. Proton H&amp;N treatment plans generated by the model show improved OAR sparing with equal or superior target coverage when compared with human-generated plans. Moreover, additional experiments on liver cancer demonstrate that the proposed method can be successfully generalized to other treatment sites. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first DRL-based automatic treatment planning model capable of achieving human-level performance for H&amp;N cancers.</description>

      <title>How to Build the Virtual Cell with Artificial Intelligence: Priorities and Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cell is arguably the smallest unit of life and is central to understanding biology. Accurate modeling of cells is important for this understanding as well as for determining the root causes of disease. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), combined with the ability to generate large-scale experimental data, present novel opportunities to model cells. Here we propose a vision of AI-powered Virtual Cells, where robust representations of cells and cellular systems under different conditions are directly learned from growing biological data across measurements and scales. We discuss desired capabilities of AI Virtual Cells, including generating universal representations of biological entities across scales, and facilitating interpretable in silico experiments to predict and understand their behavior using Virtual Instruments. We further address the challenges, opportunities and requirements to realize this vision including data needs, evaluation strategies, and community standards and engagement to ensure biological accuracy and broad utility. We envision a future where AI Virtual Cells help identify new drug targets, predict cellular responses to perturbations, as well as scale hypothesis exploration. With open science collaborations across the biomedical ecosystem that includes academia, philanthropy, and the biopharma and AI industries, a comprehensive predictive understanding of cell mechanisms and interactions is within reach.</description>

      <title>Active learning for energy-based antibody optimization and enhanced screening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10964v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate prediction and optimization of protein-protein binding affinity is crucial for therapeutic antibody development. Although machine learning-based prediction methods $\Delta\Delta G$ are suitable for large-scale mutant screening, they struggle to predict the effects of multiple mutations for targets without existing binders. Energy function-based methods, though more accurate, are time consuming and not ideal for large-scale screening. To address this, we propose an active learning workflow that efficiently trains a deep learning model to learn energy functions for specific targets, combining the advantages of both approaches. Our method integrates the RDE-Network deep learning model with Rosetta's energy function-based Flex ddG to efficiently explore mutants. In a case study targeting HER2-binding Trastuzumab mutants, our approach significantly improved the screening performance over random selection and demonstrated the ability to identify mutants with better binding properties without experimental $\Delta\Delta G$ data. This workflow advances computational antibody design by combining machine learning, physics-based computations, and active learning to achieve more efficient antibody development.</description>
