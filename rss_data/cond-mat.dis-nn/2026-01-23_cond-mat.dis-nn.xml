      <title>Learning Nonlinear Heterogeneity in Physical Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical neural networks typically train linear synaptic weights while treating device nonlinearities as fixed. We show the opposite - by training the synaptic nonlinearity itself, as in Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) architectures, we yield markedly higher task performance per physical resource and improved performance-parameter scaling than conventional linear weight-based networks, demonstrating ability of KAN topologies to exploit reconfigurable nonlinear physical dynamics.
  We experimentally realise physical KANs in silicon-on-insulator devices we term 'Synaptic Nonlinear Elements' (SYNEs), operating at room temperature, 0.1-1 microampere currents, and 2 MHz speeds with no observed degradation over 10^13 measurements and months-long timescales.
  We demonstrate nonlinear function regression, classification, and prediction of Li-Ion battery dynamics from noisy real-world multi-sensor data. Physical KANs outperform equivalently-parameterised software multilayer perceptron networks across all tasks, with up to two orders of magnitude fewer parameters, and two orders of magnitude fewer devices than linear weight based physical networks. These results establish learned physical nonlinearity as a hardware-native computational primitive for compact and efficient learning systems, and SYNE devices as effective substrates for heterogenous nonlinear computing.</description>

      <title>Non-zero Momentum Implies Long-Range Entanglement When Translation Symmetry is Broken in 1D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A result by Gioia and Wang [Phys Rev X 12, 031007 (2022)] showed that translationally symmetric states having nonzero momentum are necessarily long range entangled (LRE). Here, we consider the question: can a notion of momentum for non-translation symmetric states directly encode the nature of their entanglement, as it does for translation symmetric states? We show the answer is affirmative for 1D systems, while higher dimensional extensions and topologically ordered systems require further work. While Gioia and Wang's result applies to states connected via finite depth quantum circuits to a translation symmetric state, it is often impractical to find such a circuit to determine the nature of the entanglement of states that break translation symmetry. Here, instead of translation eigenstates, we focus on the many-body momentum distribution and the expectation value of the translation operator in many-body states of systems having broken translation symmetry. We show that in the continuum limit the magnitude of the expectation value of the translation operator $|&lt;T&gt;|$ necessarily goes to $1$ for delocalized states, a proxy for LRE states in 1D systems. This result can be seen as a momentum-space version of Resta's formula for the localization length. We investigate how accurate our results are in different lattice models with and without well-defined continuum limits. To that end, we introduce two models: a deterministic version of the random dimer model, illustrating the role of the thermodynamic and continuum limits for our result at a lattice level, and a simplified version of the Aubry-Andre model, with commensurate hopping for both momentum and position space. Finally, we use the random dimer model as a test case for the accuracy of $|&lt;T&gt;|$ as a localization (and thus entanglement) probe for 1D periodic lattice models without a well-defined continuum limit.</description>

      <title>Structural constraints on mobility edges in one-dimensional quasiperiodic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobility edges commonly arise in one-dimensional quasiperiodic systems once exact self-duality is broken, yet their origin is typically understood only at the level of individual Hamiltonians. Here we show that mobility edge positions are not independent spectral features of individual Hamiltonians, but are structurally constrained across quasiperiodic Hamiltonians related by an isospectral duality. Using a bichromatic Aubry--Andr\'e model as a minimal setting, we demonstrate that this constraint is encoded in an exact identity for Lyapunov exponents derived from the Thouless formula. As a consequence, the mobility edge positions are restricted to a reduced set of energies. In the self-dual limit, these mobility edge positions coincide at a single localization--delocalization transition. This structural constraint enforces a linear critical scaling of the physical Lyapunov spectrum near the self-dual point. Numerical results confirm a critical exponent consistent with the standard Aubry--Andr\'e value of $\nu = 1$, while simultaneously revealing a novel, non-universal energy-dependent prefactor.</description>

      <title>Partitioning networks into clusters of synchronized nodes via the message-passing algorithm: an unbiased scalable approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Partitioning large networks into stable clusters of synchronized nodes is a challenging task. Recent approaches based on spectral analysis can provide exact results on specific dynamics but remain unfeasible for very large networks. Moreover, within a stochastic framework, it is unclear which dynamics should be chosen to study synchronization. Here we propose an unbiased and scalable method based on the message-passing algorithm. By exploiting the collective behavior emerging across critical points of an effective Ising-like model, we identify dynamically coherent clusters of synchronized nodes and illustrate the approach on some large real-world networks. We find that, unlike continuous-time dynamics, abrupt desyncrhronization occurs even in simple graphs, without the need to invoke higher order interactions. However, when noise is included, the transition to synchronization becomes smoother and proceeds through the formation of plateaus, albeit at the cost of requiring larger coupling strengths.</description>

      <title>Studying energy-resolved transport with wavepacket dynamics on quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Probing energy-dependent transport in quantum simulators requires preparing states with tunable energy and small energy variance. Existing approaches often study quench dynamics of simple initial states, such as computational basis states, which are far from energy eigenstates and therefore limit the achievable energy resolution. In this work, we propose using wavepackets to probe transport properties with improved energy resolution. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, we prepare and evolve wavepackets on Quantinuum's H2-2 quantum computer and identify an energy-dependent localization transition in the Anderson model on an 8x7 lattice--a finite-size mobility edge. We observe that a wavepacket initialized at low energy remains spatially localized under time evolution, while a high-energy wavepacket delocalizes, consistent with the presence of a mobility edge. Crucial to our experiments is an error mitigation strategy that infers the noiseless output bit string distribution using maximum-likelihood estimation. Compared to post-selection, this method removes systematic errors and reduces statistical uncertainty by up to a factor of 5. We extend our methods to the many-particle regime by developing a quantum algorithm for preparing quasiparticle wavepackets in a one-dimensional model of interacting fermions. This technique has modest quantum resource requirements, making wavepacket-based studies of transport in many-body systems a promising application for near-term quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Dynamical stability for dense patterns in discrete attractor neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10383v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural networks storing multiple discrete attractors are canonical models of biological memory. Previously, the dynamical stability of such networks could only be guaranteed under highly restrictive conditions. Here, we derive a theory of the local stability of discrete fixed points in a broad class of networks with graded neural activities and in the presence of noise. By directly analyzing the bulk and the outliers of the Jacobian spectrum, we show that all fixed points are stable below a critical load that is distinct from the classical \textit{critical capacity} and depends on the statistics of neural activities in the fixed points as well as the single-neuron activation function. Our analysis highlights the computational benefits of threshold-linear activation and sparse-like patterns.</description>

      <title>Dynamical mean field approach to associative memory model with non-monotonic transfer functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Hopfield associative memory model stores random patterns in synaptic couplings according to Hebb's rule and retrieves them through gradient descent on an energy function. This conventional setting, where neurons are assumed to have monotonic transfer functions, has been central to understanding associative memory. Morita (1993, Neural Netw. 6 115), however, showed that introducing non-monotonic transfer functions can dramatically enhance retrieval performance. While this phenomenon has been qualitatively examined, a full quantitative theory remains elusive due to the difficulty of analysis in the absence of an underlying energy function. In this work, we apply dynamical mean-field theory to the discrete-time synchronous retrieval dynamics of the non-monotonic model, which succeeds in accurately characterizing its macroscopic dynamical properties. We also derive conditions for retrieval states, and clarify their relation to previous studies. Our results provide new insights into the non-equilibrium retrieval dynamics of associative memory models.</description>
