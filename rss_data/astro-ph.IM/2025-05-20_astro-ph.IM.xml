      <title>GIGAPYX sensor performance in space environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of the GIGAPYX-4600 image sensor in space environment, more specifically under different types of irradiations (protons and heavy ions). The GIGAPYX-4600 is a state-of-the-art 46M pixel multi-purpose, backside illuminated CMOS image sensor. The sensor features high-speed (200 fps), low-noise (&lt; 2e-rms), rolling shutter readout. It has been fabricated using 65 nm node CMOS technology, making use of capacitive deep trench isolation, thus exhibiting good MTF as well as excellent dark current characteristics. The GIGAPYX image sensor family is meant to be easily scalable thanks to a novel use of stitching technology. The assessed sensor features an impressive 46 Mpixels, but the sensor family is meant to be scaled up to 220 M pixels. The idea of this study was to investigate the radiation hardness of a commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) image sensor that could be suitable for space-borne applications, such as earth observation or satellite vicinity surveillance. In the near future a radiation hard readout electronic for this sensor family will be made available off-the-shelf by Pyxalis. This presentation will overview the different sensor key performances evolutions after proton irradiation up to a total fluence of 2.3e11 p+/cm${}^2$ (62 MeV): dark current, dark current non-uniformity (DCNU), noise, non-linearity, saturation charge and photo-response non-uniformity (PRNU). As expected, degradations mostly occur on the dark current, DCNU and temporal noise. The orders of magnitude of the degradation are in the range of the already published high performance CIS technologies. Results obtained from heavy ions irradiations will demonstrate that the GIGAPYX is not only latch-up free at least up to 57 Mev.cm2/mg, but resistant to the blooming effects induced by a SET at pixel level thanks to its capacitive deep trench isolations. Various SEE effects have been studied, demonstrating encouraging results for such COTS device in order to fly, in particular in GEO orbit. All these radiations results will be used as inputs in designing space camera based on the GIGAPYX sensors, compatible with multiple-mission types.</description>

      <title>Narrowing RIFT: Focused simulation-based-inference for interpreting exceptional GW sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Rapid Iterative FiTting (RIFT) parameter inference algorithm provides a simulation-based inference approach to efficient, highly-parallelized parameter inference for GW sources. Previous editions of RIFT have conservatively optimized for robust inference about poorly constrained observations. In this paper, we summarize algorithm enhancements and operating point choices to enable inference for more exceptional compact binaries. Using the previously-reported RIFT/asimov interface to efficiently perform analyses on events with reproducible settings consistent with past work, we demonstrate that the latest version of RIFT can efficiently analyze events with multiple costly models including the effects of precession or eccentricity.</description>

      <title>Improving the discovery of near-Earth objects with machine-learning methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the digest2 parameters for candidates of the Near-Earth Object Confirmation Page (NEOCP) that were reported between 2019 and 2024. Our study proposes methods for significantly reducing the inclusion of non-NEO objects on the NEOCP. Despite the substantial increase in near-Earth object (NEO) discoveries in recent years, only about half of the NEOCP candidates are ultimately confirmed as NEOs. Therefore, much observing time is spent following up on non-NEOs. Furthermore, approximately 11% of the candidates remain unconfirmed because the follow-up observations are insufficient. These are nearly 600 cases per year. To reduce false positives and minimize wasted resources on non-NEOs, we refine the posting criteria for NEOCP based on a detailed analysis of all digest2 scores. We investigated 30 distinct digest2 parameter categories for candidates that were confirmed as NEOs and non-NEOs. From this analysis, we derived a filtering mechanism based on selected digest2 parameters that were able to exclude 20% of the non-NEOs from the NEOCP while maintaining a minimal loss of true NEOs. We also investigated the application of four machine-learning (ML) techniques, that is, the gradient-boosting machine (GBM), the random forest (RF) classifier, the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) classifier, and neural networks (NN) to classify NEOCP candidates as NEOs or non-NEOs. Based on digest2 parameters as input, our ML models achieved a precision of approximately 95% in distinguishing between NEOs and non-NEOs. Results. Combining the digest2 parameter filter with an ML-based classification model, we demonstrate a significant reduction in non-NEOs on the NEOCP that exceeds 80%, while limiting the loss of NEO discovery tracklets to 5.5%. Importantly, we show that most follow-up tracklets of initially misclassified NEOs are later correctly identified as NEOs.</description>

      <title>PIRATES -- a machine-learning framework for polarized, interferometric image reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical interferometric image reconstruction is a challenging, ill-posed optimization problem which usually relies on heavy regularization for convergence. Conventional algorithms regularize in the pixel domain, without cognizance of spatial relationships or physical realism, with limited utility when this information is needed to reconstruct images. Here we present PIRATES (Polarimetric Image Reconstruction AI for Tracing Evolved Structures), the first image reconstruction algorithm for optical polarimetric interferometry. PIRATES has a dual structure optimized for parsimonious reconstruction of high fidelity polarized images and accurate reproduction of interferometric observables. The first stage, a convolutional neural network (CNN), learns a physically meaningful prior of self-consistent polarized scattering relationships from radiative transfer images. The second stage, an iterative fitting mechanism, uses the CNN as a prior for subsequent refinement of the images with respect to their polarized interferometric observables. Unlike the pixel-wise adjustments of traditional image reconstruction codes, PIRATES reconstructs images in a latent feature space, imparting a structurally derived implicit regularization. We demonstrate that PIRATES can reconstruct high fidelity polarized images of a broad range of complex circumstellar environments, in a physically meaningful and internally consistent manner, and that latent space regularization can effectively regularize reconstructed images in the presence of realistic noise.</description>

      <title>Advanced modelling of Night Sky Background light for Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A significant source of noise for Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs), which are designed to measure air showers caused by astrophysical gamma rays, is optical light emitted from the night sky. This Night Sky Background (NSB) influences IACT operating times and their sensitivity. Thus, for scheduling observations and instrument simulation, an accurate estimate of the NSB is important. A physics-driven approach to simulating wavelength-dependent, per-photomultiplier-pixel NSB was developed. It includes contributions from scattered moonlight, starlight, diffuse galactic light, zodiacal light, and airglow emission. It also accounts for the absorption and scattering of optical light in the atmosphere and telescope-specific factors such as mirror reflectivity, photon detection efficiency, and focal length. The simulated results are corrected for pointing inaccuracies and individual pixel sensitivities and compared to data from the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) IACT array. The software package developed for this analysis will be made publicly available. Validation against H.E.S.S.\ data shows small deviations from the prediction, attributable to airglow and atmospheric variability. Per-Pixel predictions provide a good match to the data, with the relative 90\% error range being [-21\%, 19\%]. Compared to the existing standard modelling approach of assuming a constant background, where the relative 90\% error range was [-64\%, 48\%], this is a significant improvement.</description>

      <title>Seismic Isolation of Optical Tables Using Piezo Actuators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Seismic isolation is crucial for gravitational wave detectors as it minimizes ground vibrations, enabling the detection of faint gravitational wave signals. An active seismic isolation platform for precision measurement experiments is described. The table features piezo actuation along five degrees of freedom: three translational actuations and two tip-tilt degrees of freedom along the horizontal axes. It is stiff in rotation about the vertical axes. A seismometer is used to sense table motion. Piezo actuators are used to suppress seismic noise with feedback control bandwidth of 0.3 to 3 Hz. Suppression levels ranging from 21 to 36 dB of seismic noise within the frequency range of 0.5 to 1.3 Hz are demonstrated, as measured by a witness seismometer on the table, with the suppression direction along the axis of the longitudinal translation of the suspended mirror on the table. The suppression results in 1 $\mathrm{\mathrm{nm/\sqrt{Hz}}}$ residual horizontal motion at 1 Hz. Limitations such as tilt-to-translation coupling that prevent actuation over the desired range of 0.03 to 3 Hz are discussed.</description>

      <title>Inflight calibration of SRG/ART-XC point spread function at large off-axis angles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The knowledge of the point spread function (PSF) of the Mikhail Pavlinsky Astronomical Roentgen Telescope - X-ray Concentrator (ART-XC) telescope aboard the Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) observatory plays an especially crucial role in the detection of point X-ray sources in the all-sky survey and the studies of extended X-ray objects with low surface brightness. In this work, we calibrate the far off-axis shape of the ART-XC PSF using in-flight data of Sco X-1 and the Crab Nebula, in all-sky survey or scan mode, respectively. We demonstrate that the so-called "slewing" ART-XC PSF (in contrast to the on-axis PSF), in convolution with the detector pixels, is consistent with ground calibration performed at the Marshall Space Flight Center, and can be used to model the PSF up to large off-axis distances in all-sky survey or scan modes. The radial profile of the Crab Nebula in the 4-12 keV band shows an extended structure out to ~150" and is consistent with Sco X-1 at larger off-axis angles. Finally, we performed an analytic parametrization of the slewing ART-XC PSF as a function of energy.</description>

      <title>Coherent injection of magnetic noise and its impact on gravitational-wave searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Correlated noise sources, particularly magnetic noise, form a risk to future gravitational-wave searches aimed at detecting the gravitational-wave background. Potential noise contamination is investigated by making noise projections which typically rely on an accurate measurement of the coupling strength of the noise to the detector. To make these projections, we inject, for the first time, broadband, coherent magnetic noise between two gravitational-wave detectors, LIGO Hanford and LIGO Livingston, separated by several thousands of kilometers. We describe the noise injection as well as its impact on the analysis pipelines and investigate the accuracy of noise projection techniques used in the past decade. Finally, we present a proof-of-concept demonstration of noise subtraction using Wiener filtering, while also highlighting potential risks associated with this method. This unique data set with correlated noise caused by magnetic field fluctuations in two gravitational-wave detectors, as well as in an array of witness sensors, provides an excellent testing ground for additional future studies. Ultimately, this study demonstrates that Wiener filtering is effective and can be applied in the eventual detection of the gravitational-wave background by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration.</description>

      <title>Observing the Sun with the Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST): Forecasting Full-disk Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) has revolutionised the field of solar millimetre astronomy with its high angular resolution and cadence. However, with a limited field of view (FOV), targeted observations of highly dynamic phenomena such of flares are challenging. A large aperture single-dish telescope with a large FOV, such as the future Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST), would prove useful in observing such phenomena, as one could scan the full solar disk on shorter timescales. We aimed to explore what FOVs, detector counts, and scan strategies are suitable for AtLAST to push the required full-disk scan times below 1 minute, enabling regular observations of dynamic solar phenomena. Utilising the maria code, we were able to simulate solar observations with AtLAST, and thoroughly explored how instrumental properties and scanning strategies affect the full-disk observations in the planned frequency bands. We find the double-circle scan pattern, currently employed at ALMA for full-disk mapping to also be an acceptable way of scanning the Sun with AtLAST. Using small to intermediately sized instruments (1000 - 50,000 detector elements), the estimated observational cadence would be less than 1 minute across AtLAST's frequency range with a reasonable pixel spacing. Using instruments with larger FOVs ($\gtrapprox 0.25^\circ$, equivalent to $\gtrapprox$ 1 R$_\odot$), we find a simple circular scan to be more efficient, achieving cadences on second time scales, but requiring more detector elements ($\gtrapprox$ 100,000). We find that a large FOV single-dish telescope such as AtLAST could provide the solar millimetre community with hitherto unachievable observations, namely full-disk observations at high cadence and adequate resolution. With cadences potentially down to seconds, such an instrument would be ideal in the study of quickly evolving solar phenomena.</description>

      <title>Spatially resolved stellar populations and emission lines properties in nearby galaxies with J-PLUS -- I. Method and first results for the M101 group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatially resolved maps of stellar populations and nebular emission are key tools for understanding the physical properties and evolutionary stages of galaxies. We aim to characterize the spatially resolved stellar population and emission line properties of galaxies in the M101 group using Javalambre Photometric Local Universe Survey (J-PLUS) data. The datacubes first go through pre-processing steps, which include masking, noise suppression, PSF homogenization, and spatial binning. The improved data are then analyzed with the spectral synthesis code \alstar, which has been previously shown to produce excellent results with the unique 12 bands filter system of J-PLUS and S-PLUS. We produce maps of stellar mass surface density ($\Sigma_\star$), mean stellar age and metallicity, star formation rate surface density ($\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$), dust attenuation, and emission line properties such as fluxes and equivalent widths of the main optical lines. Relations among these properties are explored. All galaxies exhibit a well-defined age-$\Sigma_\star$ relation, except for the dwarfs. Similarly, all of the galaxies follow local $\Sigma_\star$-$\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ star-forming MS relations, with specific star formation rates that grow for less massive systems. A stellar $\Sigma_\star$-metallicity relation is clearly present in M101, while other galaxies have either flatter or undefined relations. Nebular metallicities correlate with $\Sigma_\star$ for all galaxies. This study demonstrates the ability of J-PLUS to perform IFS-like analysis of galaxies, offering robust spatially resolved measurements of stellar populations and emission lines over large fields of view. The M101 group analysis showcases the potential for expanding such studies to other groups and clusters, contributing to the understanding of galaxy evolution across different environments.</description>

      <title>Insufficient evidence for DMS and DMDS in the atmosphere of K2-18 b. From a joint analysis of JWST NIRISS, NIRSpec, and MIRI observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent JWST observations of the temperate sub-Neptune K2-18 b have been interpreted as suggestive of a liquid water ocean with possible biological activity. Signatures of DMS and DMDS have been claimed in the near-infrared (using the NIRISS and NIRSpec instruments) and mid-infrared (using MIRI). However, the statistical significance of the atmospheric imprints of these potential biomarkers has yet to be quantified from a joint analysis of the entire planet spectrum. We test the robustness of the proposed DMS/DMDS detections by simultaneously modeling the NIRISS and NIRSpec observations jointly with the MIRI spectrum, considering different data reductions and modeling choices. We use three well-tested pipelines to re-reduce the JWST observations, and two retrieval codes to analyze the resulting transmission spectra as well as previously published data. Our joint analysis of the panchromatic (0.6 - 12 um) spectrum of K2-18 b finds insufficient evidence for the presence of DMS and/or DMDS in the atmosphere of the planet. Furthermore, other molecules containing methyl functional groups (e.g., ethane) with absorption bands similar to DMS/DMDS provide an equally good fit to the data. We find that any marginal preferences are the result of limiting the number of molecules considered in the model and oversensitivity to small changes between data reductions. Our results confirm that there is no statistical significance for DMS or DMDS in K2-18 b's atmosphere. While previous works have demonstrated this on MIRI or NIRISS/NIRSpec observations alone, our analysis of the full transmission spectrum does not support claims of potential biomarkers. Using the best-fitting model including DMS/DMDS on the published data, we estimate that ~25 more MIRI transits would be needed for a 3-sigma rejection of a flat line relative to DMS/DMDS features in the planet's mid-infrared transmission spectrum.</description>

Abstract: Low-loss deposited dielectrics are beneficial for the advancement of superconducting integrated circuits for astronomy. In the microwave band ($\mathrm{\sim}$1$\unicode{x2013}$10 GHz) the cryogenic and low-power dielectric loss is dominated by two-level systems. However, the origin of the loss in the millimeter-submillimeter band ($\mathrm{\sim}$0.1$\unicode{x2013}$1 THz) is not understood. We measured the loss of hydrogenated amorphous SiC (a-SiC:H) films in the 0.27$\unicode{x2013}$100 THz range using superconducting microstrip resonators and Fourier-transform spectroscopy. The agreement between the loss data and a Maxwell-Helmholtz-Drude dispersion model suggests that vibrational modes above 10 THz dominate the loss in the a-SiC:H above 200 GHz.</description>

      <title>Improving source positions in the OCARS catalog: A first approach</title>

Abstract: OCARS (Optical Characteristics of Astrometric Radio Sources) is a compiled catalog of various additional data associated with astrometric radio sources whose coordinates have been determined from very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations. It contains source coordinates, object type, redshift, optical and near-infrared magnitudes. Until now, OCARS source coordinates were simply copied from input catalogs and, as a result, were systematically inhomogeneous. This work is the first attempt to obtain a unified set of radio source coordinates aligned to the International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF), more specically to the third ICRF release, ICRF3. Comparison of the source coordinates in the old OCARS version as of December 2024 and the new OCARS version as of March 2025 with the ICRF3-SX catalog using the vector spherical harmonics (VSH) technique showed almost complete elimination of systematic errors in new OCARS positions relative to the ICRF3 frame.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Luminosity Function and Delay-Time Distribution of Short Gamma-Ray Bursts for Multimessenger Gravitational-Wave Detection Rate Estimation</title>

Abstract: In this work, we analyze the most recent short gamma-ray burst (sGRB) sample detected by the \emph{Fermi} satellite to reassess the sGRB luminosity function and formation rate. Using the empirical redshift-luminosity correlation, we first determine the pseudo redshifts of 478 sGRBs. Then, we use the maximum likelihood method to constrain the luminosity function and formation rate of sGRBs under various delay-time distribution models, finding the Gaussian delay model statistically preferred over the power-law and lognormal delay models based on theDeviance Information Criterion. The local formation rate of sGRBs is $R_{\mathrm{sGRB}}(0)=1.37_{-0.27}^{+0.30}$ $\mathrm{Gpc^{-3}\,yr^{-1}}$, largely independent of the adopted delay-time distribution model. Additionally, we investigate the potential for joint detection of sGRBs and their gravitational wave (GW) counterparts from binary neutron star mergers using both current and future GRB and GW facilities. For sGRB detection, we consider three existing satellites: \emph{Fermi}, the Space-based multi-band astronomical Variable Objects Monitor (\emph{SVOM}), and the Einstein Probe (\emph{EP}). For GW detection, we examine two International GW Networks (IGWN): a four-detector network consisting of LIGO Hanford, Livingston, Virgo, and KAGRA (IGWN4) and an upcoming five-detector network that includes these four detectors plus LIGO India (IGWN5). Incorporating the angular dependence of sGRB jet emission energy, our results show that for different delay-time distribution models, the joint sGRB and GW detection rates for \emph{Fermi}, \emph{SVOM}, and \emph{EP} with IGWN4 (IGWN5) lie within 0.19--0.27 $\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$ (0.93--1.35 $\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$), 0.07--0.10 $\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$ (0.51--0.79 $\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$), and 0.01--0.03 $\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$ (0.15--0.27 $\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$), respectively.</description>

      <title>Coherence DeepClean: Toward autonomous denoising of gravitational-wave detector data</title>

Abstract: Technical and environmental noise in ground-based laser interferometers designed for gravitational-wave observations like Advanced LIGO, Advanced Virgo and KAGRA, can manifest as narrow (&lt;1Hz) or broadband ($10'$s or even $100'$s of Hz) spectral lines and features in the instruments' strain amplitude spectral density. When the sources of this noise cannot be identified or removed, in cases where there are witness sensors sensitive to this noise source, denoising of the gravitational-wave strain channel can be performed in software, enabling recovery of instrument sensitivity over affected frequency bands. This noise hunting and removal process can be particularly challenging due to the wealth of auxiliary channels monitoring the interferometry and the environment and the non-linear couplings that may be present. In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis approach and corresponding cyberinfrastructure to promptly identify and remove noise in software using machine learning techniques. The approach builds on earlier work (referred to as DeepClean) in using machine learning methods for linear and non-linear regression of noise. We demonstrate how this procedure can be operated and optimized in a tandem fashion close to online data taking; it starts off with a coherence monitoring analysis that first singles out and prioritizes witness channels that can then be used by DeepClean. The resulting denoised strain by DeepClean reflects a 1.4\% improvement in the binary neutron star range, which can translate into a 4.3\% increase in the sensitive volume. This cyber infrastructure we refer to as Coherence DeepClean, or CDC, is a significant step toward autonomous operations of noise subtraction for ground-based interferometers.</description>

      <title>Inferring Fireball Velocity Profiles and Characteristic Parameters of Meteoroids from Incomplete Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10715v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extracting additional information from old or incomplete fireball datasets remains a challenge. To address missing point-by-point observations, we introduce a method for estimating atmospheric flight parameters of meteoroids using metaheuristic optimization techniques. Using a fireball catalog from the European Fireball Network (EN), we reconstruct velocity profiles, meteoroid bulk densities, mass loss rates, and ablation and ballistic coefficients, based on the initial and terminal points' height, velocity, and mass with the purely dynamical $\alpha$-$\beta$ model. Additionally, the method's performance is compared to the Meteorite Observation and Recovery Project (MORP) derived fits, confirming the robustness of the computed parameters for objects with asteroidal compositions. Our findings show that $\alpha$-$\beta$ model yields parameters consistent with the photometric and dynamic mass estimates in the EN catalog for $P_E$ type I events. However, in the implementation proposed here, $\alpha$-$\beta$ model encounters limitations in accurately representing the final deceleration of more fragile high-velocity meteoroids. This is likely due to challenges in representing complex fragmentation processes by fitting only two points, even when initial and terminal residuals are minimal. The retrieved $\alpha$-$\beta$ distribution differs from the one derived from MORP data, likely due to the imposed mass constraints, which strongly influence the results, especially the bulk density. The results suggest that $P_E$ constraints reduce fitting accuracy (from 90% to 44%), while flexibility and freedom from assumptions improve $\alpha$-$\beta$ performance. The method yields 26% of the events compatible with the catalog $P_E$ classification. Our approach is well-suited for interpreting historical or sparse datasets.</description>
