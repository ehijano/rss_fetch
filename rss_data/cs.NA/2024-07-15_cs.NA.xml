      <title>FEM on nonuniform meshes for nonlocal Laplacian: Semi-analytic Implementation in One Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we compute stiffness matrix of the nonlocal Laplacian discretized by the piecewise linear finite element on nonuniform meshes, and implement the FEM in the Fourier transformed domain. We derive useful integral expressions of the entries that allow us to explicitly or semi-analytically evaluate the entries for various interaction kernels. Moreover, the limiting cases of the nonlocal stiffness matrix when the interactional radius $\delta\rightarrow0$ or $\delta\rightarrow\infty$ automatically lead to integer and fractional FEM stiffness matrices, respectively, and the FEM discretisation is intrinsically compatible. We conduct ample numerical experiments to study and predict some of its properties and test on different types of nonlocal problems. To the best of our knowledge, such a semi-analytic approach has not been explored in literature even in the one-dimensional case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we address a foundational question in the theoretical analysis of the Deep Ritz Method (DRM) under the over-parameteriztion regime: Given a target precision level, how can one determine the appropriate number of training samples, the key architectural parameters of the neural networks, the step size for the projected gradient descent optimization procedure, and the requisite number of iterations, such that the output of the gradient descent process closely approximates the true solution of the underlying partial differential equation to the specified precision?</description>

      <title>Numerical approximation of ergodic BSDEs using non linear Feynman-Kac formulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we study the numerical approximation of a class of ergodic Backward Stochastic Differential Equations. These equations are formulated in an infinite horizon framework and provide a probabilistic representation for elliptic Partial Differential Equations of ergodic type. In order to build our numerical scheme, we put forward a new representation of the PDE solution by using a classical probabilistic representation of the gradient. Then, based on this representation, we propose a fully implementable numerical scheme using a Picard iteration procedure, a grid space discretization and a Monte-Carlo approximation. Up to a limiting technical condition that guarantee the contraction of the Picard procedure, we obtain an upper bound for the numerical error. We also provide some numerical experiments that show the efficiency of this approach for small dimensions.</description>

      <title>A Numerical Study of WENO Approximations to Sharp Propagating Fronts for Reaction-Diffusion Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many reaction-diffusion systems in various applications exhibit traveling wave solutions that evolve on multiple spatio-temporal scales. These traveling wave solutions are crucial for understanding the underlying dynamics of the system. In this work, we present sixth-order weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) methods within the finite difference framework to solve reaction-diffusion systems. The WENO method allows us to use fewer grid points and larger time steps compared to classical finite difference methods. Our focus is on solving the reaction-diffusion system for the traveling wave solution with the sharp front. Although the WENO method is popular for hyperbolic conservation laws, especially for problems with discontinuity, it can be adapted for the equations of parabolic type, such as reaction-diffusion systems, to effectively handle sharp wave fronts. Thus, we employed the WENO methods specifically developed for equations of parabolic type. We considered various reaction-diffusion equations, including Fisher's, Zeldovich, Newell-Whitehead-Segel, bistable equations, and the Lotka-Volterra competition-diffusion system, all of which yield traveling wave solutions with sharp wave fronts. Numerical examples in this work demonstrate that the central WENO method is highly more accurate and efficient than the commonly used finite difference method. We also provide an analysis related to the numerical speed of the sharp propagating front in the Newell-Whitehead-Segel equation. The overall results confirm that the central WENO method is highly efficient and is recommended for solving reaction-diffusion equations with sharp wave fronts.</description>

      <title>Efficient energy-stable parametric finite element methods for surface diffusion flow and applications in solid-state dewetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Currently existing energy-stable parametric finite element methods for surface diffusion flow and other flows are usually limited to first-order accuracy in time. Designing a high-order algorithm for geometric flows that can also be theoretically proven to be energy-stable poses a significant challenge. Motivated by the new scalar auxiliary variable approach [F.Huang, J.Shen, Z.Yang, SIAM J. SCI. Comput., 42 (2020), pp. A2514-A2536], we propose novel energy-stable parametric finite element approximations for isotropic/anisotropic surface diffusion flows, achieving both first-order and second-order accuracy in time. Additionally, we apply the algorithms to simulate the solid-state dewetting of thin films. Finally, extensive numerical experiments validate the accuracy, energy stability, and efficiency of our developed numerical methods. The designed algorithms in this work exhibit strong versatility, as they can be readily extended to other high-order time discretization methods (e.g., BDFk schemes). Meanwhile, the algorithms achieve remarkable computational efficiency and maintain excellent mesh quality. More importantly, the algorithm can be theoretically proven to possess unconditional energy stability, with the energy nearly equal to the original energy.</description>

      <title>A novel direct Helmholtz solver in inhomogeneous media based on the operator Fourier transform functional calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents novel numerical algorithms based on pseudodifferential operators ($\Psi$DO) for fast, direct solution of the Helmholtz equation in one-, two- and three-dimensional inhomogeneous unbounded media. The proposed approach relies on an Operator Fourier Transform (OFT) representation of $\Psi$DO which frame the problem of computing the inverse Helmholtz operator, with a spatially-dependent wave speed, in terms of two sequential applications of an inverse square root $\Psi$DO. The OFT representation of the action of the square root $\Psi$DO, in turn, can be effected as a superposition of solutions of a pseudo-temporal initial-boundary-value problem for a paraxial equation. The OFT framework offers several advantages over traditional direct and iterative approaches for the solution of the Helmholtz equation. The operator integral transform is amenable to standard quadrature methods and the required pseudo-temporal paraxial equation solutions can be obtained using any suitable numerical method. A specialized quadrature is derived to evaluate the OFT efficiently and an alternating direction implicit method, used in conjunction with standard finite differences, is used to solve the requisite component paraxial equation problems. Numerical studies, in 1, 2, and 3 spatial dimensions, are presented to confirm the expected OFT-based Helmholtz solver convergence rate. In addition, the efficiency and versatility of our proposed approach is demonstrated by tackling nontrivial wave propagation problems, including 2D plane wave scattering from a geometrically complex inhomogeneity, 3D scattering from turbulent channel flow and plane wave transmission through a spherically-symmetric gradient-index acoustic lens. All computations, even the latter lens problem which involves solving the Helmholtz equation with more than one billion complex unknowns, are performed in a single workstation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-driven model reduction methods provide a nonintrusive way of constructing computationally efficient surrogates of high-fidelity models for real-time control of soft robots. This work leverages the Lagrangian nature of the model equations to derive structure-preserving linear reduced-order models via Lagrangian Operator Inference and compares their performance with prominent linear model reduction techniques through an anguilliform swimming soft robot model example with 231,336 degrees of freedom. The case studies demonstrate that preserving the underlying Lagrangian structure leads to learned models with higher predictive accuracy and robustness to unseen inputs.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Influence of Combined Lung and Kidney Support Using a Cardiovascular Model and Sensitivity Analysis-Informed Parameter Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Combined extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) pose complex hemodynamic challenges in intensive care. In this study, a comprehensive lumped parameter model (LPM) is developed to simulate the cardiovascular system, incorporating ECMO and CRRT circuit dynamics. The model is used to analyze nine CRRT-ECMO connection schemes under varying flow conditions. Using a robust parameter identification framework based on global sensitivity analysis (GSA) and multi-start gradient-based optimization, we calibrated the model on 30 clinical data points from eight veno-arterial ECMO patients.
  Our results indicate that CRRT has a significant impact on the cardiovascular system, with changes in pulmonary artery pressure of up to 202.5 %, highly dependent on ECMO flow. The GSA proved to be a powerful tool to improve the parameter estimation process. The established parameter estimation framework is fast and robust without the need for hyperparameter tuning and improves the parameter estimation process with an R^2&gt;0.98 between simulation and experimental data. It uses modeling methods that could pave the way for real-time applications in intensive care.
  This open-source framework provides a valuable tool for the systematic evaluation of combined ECMO and CRRT, which can be used to develop standardized treatment protocols and improve patient outcomes in critical care. In addition, as a digital twin, this model also provides a good basis for addressing research questions related to mechanical circulatory and respiratory support.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Eigenvalue Computation for Nuclear Structure Calculations via Perturbative Corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new method for computing the lowest few eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenvectors of a nuclear many-body Hamiltonian represented in a truncated configuration interaction subspace, i.e., the no-core shell model (NCSM). The method uses the hierarchical structure of the NCSM Hamiltonian to partition the Hamiltonian as the sum of two matrices. The first matrix corresponds to the Hamiltonian represented in a small configuration space, whereas the second is viewed as the perturbation to the first matrix. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the first matrix can be computed efficiently. Perturbative corrections to the eigenvectors of the first matrix can be obtained from the solutions of a sequence of linear systems of equations defined in the small configuration space. These correction vectors can be combined with the approximate eigenvectors of the first matrix to construct a subspace from which more accurate approximations of the desired eigenpairs can be obtained. We call this method a Subspace Projection with Perturbative Corrections (SPPC) method. We show by numerical examples that the SPPC method can be more efficient than conventional iterative methods for solving large-scale eigenvalue problems such as the Lanczos, block Lanczos and the locally optimal block preconditioned conjugate gradient (LOBPCG) method. The method can also be combined with other methods to avoid convergence stagnation.</description>

      <title>A Deep BSDE approximation of nonlinear integro-PDEs with unbounded nonlocal operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning for partial differential equations (PDEs) is a hot topic. In this paper we introduce and analyse a Deep BSDE scheme for nonlinear integro-PDEs with unbounded nonlocal operators -problems arising in e.g. stochastic control and games involving infinite activity jump-processes. The scheme is based on a stochastic forward-backward SDE representation of the solution of the PDE and (i) approximation of small jumps by a Gaussian process, (ii) simulation of the forward part, and (iii) a neural net regression for the backward part. Unlike grid-based schemes, it does not suffer from the curse of dimensionality and is therefore suitable for high dimensional problems. The scheme is designed to be convergent even in the infinite activity/unbounded nonlocal operator case. A full convergence analysis is given and constitutes the main part of the paper.</description>

      <title>Tensor Decompositions for Count Data that Leverage Stochastic and Deterministic Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.14341v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is growing interest to extend low-rank matrix decompositions to multi-way arrays, or tensors. One fundamental low-rank tensor decomposition is the canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD). The challenge of fitting a low-rank, nonnegative CPD model to Poisson-distributed count data is of particular interest. Several popular algorithms use local search methods to approximate the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of the Poisson CPD model. This work presents two new algorithms that extend state-of-the-art local methods for Poisson CPD. Hybrid GCP-CPAPR combines Generalized Canonical Decomposition (GCP) with stochastic optimization and CP Alternating Poisson Regression (CPAPR), a deterministic algorithm, to increase the probability of converging to the MLE over either method used alone. Restarted CPAPR with SVDrop uses a heuristic based on the singular values of the CPD model unfoldings to identify convergence toward optimizers that are not the MLE and restarts within the feasible domain of the optimization problem, thus reducing overall computational cost when using a multi-start strategy. We provide empirical evidence that indicates our approaches outperform existing methods with respect to converging to the Poisson CPD MLE.</description>

Abstract: We propose a high order unfitted finite element method for solving timeharmonic Maxwell interface problems. The unfitted finite element method is based on a mixed formulation in the discontinuous Galerkin framework on a Cartesian mesh with possible hanging nodes. The $H^2$ regularity of the solution to Maxwell interface problems with $C^2$ interfaces in each subdomain is proved. Practical interface-resolving mesh conditions are introduced under which the hp inverse estimates on three-dimensional curved domains are proved. Stability and hp a priori error estimate of the unfitted finite element method are proved. Numerical results are included to illustrate the performance of the method.</description>

      <title>Deep Finite Volume Method for Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.06863v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Deep Finite Volume Method (DFVM), an innovative deep learning framework tailored for solving high-order (order \(\geq 2\)) partial differential equations (PDEs). Our approach centers on a novel loss function crafted from local conservation laws derived from the original PDE, distinguishing DFVM from traditional deep learning methods. By formulating DFVM in the weak form of the PDE rather than the strong form, we enhance accuracy, particularly beneficial for PDEs with less smooth solutions compared to strong-form-based methods like Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). A key technique of DFVM lies in its transformation of all second-order or higher derivatives of neural networks into first-order derivatives which can be comupted directly using Automatic Differentiation (AD). This adaptation significantly reduces computational overhead, particularly advantageous for solving high-dimensional PDEs. Numerical experiments demonstrate that DFVM achieves equal or superior solution accuracy compared to existing deep learning methods such as PINN, Deep Ritz Method (DRM), and Weak Adversarial Networks (WAN), while drastically reducing computational costs. Notably, for PDEs with nonsmooth solutions, DFVM yields approximate solutions with relative errors up to two orders of magnitude lower than those obtained by PINN. The implementation of DFVM is available on GitHub at \href{https://github.com/Sysuzqs/DFVM}{https://github.com/Sysuzqs/DFVM}.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically stable Particle-in-Cell methods for the magnetized Vlasov--Poisson equations in orthogonal curvilinear coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In high-temperature plasma physics, a strong magnetic field is usually used to confine charged particles. Therefore, for studying the classical mathematical models of the physical problems it needs to consider the effect of external magnetic fields. One of the important model equations in plasma is the Vlasov-Poisson equation with an external magnetic field. This equation usually has multi-scale characteristics and rich physical properties, thus it is very important and meaningful to construct numerical methods that can maintain the physical properties inherited by the original systems over long time. This paper extends the corresponding theory in Cartesian coordinates to general orthogonal curvilinear coordinates, and proves that a Poisson-bracket structure can still be obtained after applying the corresponding finite element discretization. However, the Hamiltonian systems in the new coordinate systems generally cannot be decomposed into sub-systems that can be solved accurately, so it is impossible to use the splitting methods to construct the corresponding geometric integrators. Therefore, this paper proposes a semi-implicit method for strong magnetic fields and analyzes the asymptotic stability of this method.</description>

      <title>Unconditionally positivity-preserving approximations of the Ait-Sahalia type model: Explicit Milstein-type schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16975v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present article aims to design and analyze efficient first-order strong schemes for a generalized A\"{i}t-Sahalia type model arising in mathematical finance and evolving in a positive domain $(0, \infty)$, which possesses a diffusion term with superlinear growth and a highly nonlinear drift that blows up at the origin. Such a complicated structure of the model unavoidably causes essential difficulties in the construction and convergence analysis of time discretizations. By incorporating implicitness in the term $\alpha_{-1} x^{-1}$ and a corrective mapping $\Phi_h$ in the recursion, we develop a novel class of explicit and unconditionally positivity-preserving (i.e., for any step-size $h&gt;0$) Milstein-type schemes for the underlying model. In both non-critical and general critical cases, we introduce a novel approach to analyze mean-square error bounds of the novel schemes, without relying on a priori high-order moment bounds of the numerical approximations. The expected order-one mean-square convergence is attained for the proposed scheme. The above theoretical guarantee can be used to justify the optimal complexity of the Multilevel Monte Carlo method. Numerical experiments are finally provided to verify the theoretical findings.</description>

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have recently emerged as a promising way to compute the solutions of partial differential equations (PDEs) using deep neural networks. However, despite their significant success in various fields, it remains unclear in many aspects how to effectively train PINNs if the solutions of PDEs exhibit stiff behaviors or high frequencies. In this paper, we propose a new method for training PINNs using variable-scaling techniques. This method is simple and it can be applied to a wide range of problems including PDEs with rapidly-varying solutions. Throughout various numerical experiments, we will demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for these problems and confirm that it can significantly improve the training efficiency and performance of PINNs. Furthermore, based on the analysis of the neural tangent kernel (NTK), we will provide theoretical evidence for this phenomenon and show that our methods can indeed improve the performance of PINNs.</description>
