      <title>Acoustic topological Jackiw-Rebbi states at symmetry broken interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological insulators, a fundamental concept in modern condensed matter physics, support localized states at the interfaces between insulators exhibiting different topological phases, which conventionally rely on explicit symmetry breaking. Here, we propose a mechanism to induce a real-space topological phase transition by spontaneous symmetry breaking, thereby constructing an acoustic metagrating to generate nontrivial Jackiw-Rebbi states characterized by robust imaginary band degeneracy. Our experimental implementation verifies the acoustic delocalized interface state with a constant phase jump, demonstrating enhanced high-directivity topological radiation. We foresee that our findings may spark interest in engineering new acoustic topological devices.</description>

      <title>Shot-noise in strongly-correlated double quantum spin Hall edges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the effects of interactions on the edges of ``double" quantum spin Hall insulators (DQSHIs), motivated by recent experiments on moir\'e twisted metal dichalcogenides. Without interactions, a DQSHI can be understood as two identical copies of a conventional quantum spin Hall insulator. If interactions are present and $s^z$-spin is conserved, we show that there are two possible phases for the DQSHI edge. First is a weakly-correlated edge which has two pairs of helical modes and is adiabatically equivalent to two conventional quantum spin Hall edges. Second is a strongly-correlated edge with only one pair of helical modes. The strongly-correlated edge also has a gap to single-electrons, but is gapless to pairs of electrons. In a quantum point contact geometry, this single-electron gap leads to a Fano factor of $2$ in shot noise measurements, compared to a Fano factor of $1$ for a weakly-correlated edge.</description>

      <title>Gyrotropic magnetic effect in metallic chiral magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the gyrotropic magnetic effect (GME), the low-frequency limit of optical gyrotropy, in metals and semimetals coupled to chiral spin textures. In these systems, the chiral spin texture which lacks inversion symmetry can imprint itself upon the electronic structure through Hund's coupling, leading to novel low-frequency optical activity. Using perturbation theory and numerical diagonalization of both relativistic and non-relativistic models of conduction electrons coupled to spin textures, we analyze how the GME manifests in both single-$q$ and multi-$q$ textures. Analytical expressions for the rotatory power are derived in terms of universal scaling functions. Estimates based on realistic material parameters reveal an experimentally viable range of values for the rotatory power. The GME arises from the orbital and spin magnetic moments of conduction electrons, with the orbital part closely tied to Berry curvature and playing a significant role in relativistic metals but not so in non-relativistic metals where there is no inherent Berry curvature. The spin contribution to the GME can be significant in non-relativistic metals with a large Fermi energy. Our work establishes the GME as a sensitive probe of magnetic chirality and symmetry breaking in metallic chiral magnets.</description>

      <title>Terahertz Landau level spectroscopy of Dirac fermions in millimeter-scale twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exotic electronic physics including correlated insulating states and fractional Chern insulators have been observed in twisted bilayer graphene in a magnetic field when the Fermi velocity vanishes, however a question remains as to the stability of these states which is controlled by the gap to the first excited state. Free-space terahertz magneto-optics can directly probe the gap to charge excitations which bounds the stability of electronic states, but this measurement has thus-far been inaccessible due to the micron size of twisted bilayer graphene samples, while the wavelength of terahertz light is up to a millimeter. Here we leverage advances in fabrication to create twisted bilayer graphene samples over 5 mm x 5 mm in size with a uniform twist angle and study the magnetic field dependence of the cyclotron resonance by a complex Faraday rotation experiment in p-doped large angle twisted bilayer graphene. These measurements directly probe charge excitations in inter-Landau level transitions and determine the Fermi velocity as a function of twist angle.</description>

      <title>Magnons in the strained Heisenberg-Kitaev magnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The properties of magnons hosted in strained Heisenberg-Kitaev magnets are investigated using numerical and analytical calculations. Considering that deformation fields modulate the coupling parameters, we find a general expression for the weakly strained magnon Hamiltonian that depends on the (symmetric) strain tensor. We numerically tested our results in finite nanoribbon structures. We found that uniaxial deformations make the bulk bands more dispersive while topologically protected in-gap edge modes become nonreciprocal at the boundary of the Brillouin Zone. On the other hand, when applying a twist deformation, the simultaneous modulation of both Heisenberg and Kitaev parameters enables the apparition of flat bands, promoting the presence of non-propagative topologically protected magnonic edge states, whose properties strongly depends on the strain strength. In addition, the characteristic localization of magnon edge modes is preserved, which allows for testing the robustness of the bulk-boundary correspondence under lattice deformations. Our results contribute to a major understanding of Heisenberg-Kitaev magnets and how applying different strains allows for precise control over magnon properties.</description>

      <title>Density Functional Tight-Binding Enables Tractable Studies of Quantum Plasmonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Routine investigations of plasmonic phenomena at the quantum level present a formidable computational challenge due to the large system sizes and ultrafast timescales involved. This Feature Article highlights the use of density functional tight-binding (DFTB), particularly its real-time time-dependent formulation (RT-TDDFTB), as a tractable approach to study plasmonic nanostructures from a purely quantum mechanical purview. We begin by outlining the theoretical framework and limitations of DFTB, emphasizing its efficiency in modeling systems with thousands of atoms over picosecond timescales. Applications of RT-TDDFTB are then explored in the context of optical absorption, nonlinear harmonic generation, and plasmon-mediated photocatalysis. We demonstrate how DFTB can reconcile classical and quantum descriptions of plasmonic behavior, capturing key phenomena such as size-dependent plasmon shifts and plasmon coupling in nanoparticle assemblies. Finally, we showcase DFTB's ability to model hot carrier generation and reaction dynamics in plasmon-driven \ch{H2} dissociation, underscoring its potential to model photocatalytic processes. Collectively, these studies establish DFTB as a powerful, yet computationally efficient tool to probe the emergent physics of materials at the limits of space and time.</description>

      <title>Impact of Broken Inversion Symmetry on Molecular States in multi-Weyl fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study inversion-symmetry (IS) breaking in impurity dimers coupled to topological multi-Weyl systems in the low-energy dispersion domain. In the IS-preserved multi-Weyl semimetal phase, Hubbard bands split into symmetric and antisymmetric molecular-like subbands. Breaking IS induces a transition to a multi-Weyl metal, lifting the degeneracy of the Weyl node and closing the pseudogap. This causes opposite energy shifts: valence-band symmetric (antisymmetric) subbands red- (blue-) shift, reversing in the conduction band until a degeneracy point. Beyond this threshold, symmetric bands flatten near band cutoffs, whereas antisymmetric bands form quasi-zero energy modes asymptotically approaching -yet never crossing- the Fermi level. Crucially, identical molecular symmetries maintain nondegeneracy even as energy separation vanishes with stronger IS breaking. Our results demonstrate symmetry-selective mechanisms for topological molecular states in multi-Weyl systems.</description>

      <title>On-chip calibrated radio-frequency measurement at cryogenic temperatures for determination of SrTiO3-based capacitor properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing has emerged as a promising technology for next-generation information processing, utilizing semiconductor quantum dots as one of the candidates for quantum bits. Radio-frequency (rf) reflectometry plays an important role in the readout of quantum dots but requires a precise rf measurement technique at cryogenic temperatures. While cryogenic calibration techniques, essential for rf reflectometry, have been developed, on-chip calibration near the device remains an important challenge. In this study, we develop an on-chip calibrated rf measurement system operating at 4K for characterizing SrTiO3-based varactors, which are promising components for tunable impedance matching circuits. Our system enables accurate measurements by eliminating errors associated with long rf circuit lines. We investigate the effects of annealing conditions, crystal orientation, and Ca doping of SrTiO3 crystals on the varactor properties in the frequency range for rf reflectometry. Our results provide insights for optimizing these components for cryogenic rf applications in quantum information processing systems.</description>

      <title>Spin-Exchange Induced Spillover on Poor Man's Majoranas in Minimal Kitaev Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The "Poor Man's Majoranas" (PMMs) [Phys. Rev. B 86, 134528 (2012)] devoid of topological protection can "spill over" from one edge into another of the minimal Kitaev chain when perturbed electrostatically. As aftermath, this leads to a delocalized Majorana fermion (MF) at both the edges. Additionally, according to recent differential conductance measurements in a pair of superconducting and spinless quantum dots (QDs), such a PMM picture was brought to reality [Nature 614, 445 (2023) and Nature 630, 329 (2024)]. Based on this scenario, we propose the spillover of the PMM when its QD is exchange coupled to a quantum spin $S$. We show that if this QD is perturbed by the exchange coupling $J$, solely the half $2S+1$ $(2S+2)$ of the fine structure stays explicit for a fermionic (bosonic) $S.$ Concurrently, the other half squeezes itself as the delocalized MF zero-mode. Particularly, turning-off the superconductivity the multiplicity $2S+1$ holds regardless the spin statistics. Meanwhile, the PMM spillover induced by $J$ becomes a statistics dependent effect. Hence, our findings contribute to the comprehension of spin-phenomena interplay with superconductivity in minimal Kitaev chains, offering insights for future quantum computing devices hosting PMMs.</description>

      <title>Moir\'e Band Engineering in Twisted Trilayer WSe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic theoretical study on the structural and electronic properties of twisted trilayer transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) WSe$_2$, where two independent moir\'e patterns form between adjacent layers. Using a continuum approach, we investigate the optimized lattice structure and the resulting energy band structure, revealing fundamentally different electronic behaviors between helical and alternating twist configurations. In helical trilayers, lattice relaxation induces $\alpha\beta$ and $\beta\alpha$ domains, where the two moir\'e patterns shift to minimize overlap, while in alternating trilayers, $\alpha\alpha'$ domains emerge with aligned moir\'e patterns. A key feature of trilayer TMDs is the summation of moir\'e potentials from the top and bottom layers onto the middle layer, effectively doubling the potential depth. In helical trilayers, this mechanism generates a Kagome lattice potential in the $\alpha\beta$ domains, giving rise to flat bands characteristic of Kagome physics. In alternating trilayers, the enhanced potential confinement forms deep triangular quantum wells, distinct from those found in bilayer systems. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a moderate perpendicular electric field can switch the layer polarization near the valence band edge, providing an additional degree of tunability. In particular, it enables tuning of the hybridization between orbitals on different layers, allowing for the engineering of diverse and controllable electronic band structures. Our findings highlight the unique role of moir\'e potential summation in trilayer systems, offering a broader platform for designing moir\'e-based electronic and excitonic phenomena beyond those achievable in bilayer TMDs.</description>

Abstract: We calculate the magnon dispersion spectra of the two-dimensional zigzag van der Waals antiferromagnet NiPS$_3$ for monolayer, bilayer, and bulk systems as a function of an external magnetic field. We calculate the exchange and anisotropy constants in our spin model by first principles. We can accurately explain the transition from a collinear to a canted ground state for a magnetic field applied normal to the (in-plane) easy-axis, and a spin-flop transition when the field is parallel to it. A topologically protected Dirac nodal line is present and robust with respect to both external and anisotropy fields.</description>

      <title>A foundry-fabricated spin qubit unit cell with in-situ dispersive readout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin qubits based on semiconductor quantum dots are a promising prospect for quantum computation because of their high coherence times and gate fidelities. However, scaling up those structures to the numbers required by fault-tolerant quantum computing is currently hampered by a number of issues. One of the main issues is the need for single-shot low-footprint qubit readout. Here, we demonstrate the single-shot in situ measurement of a compact qubit unit-cell. The unit cell is composed of two electron spins with a controllable exchange interaction. We report initialization, single-shot readout and two-electron entangling gate. The unit cell was successfully operated at up to 1 K, with state-of-the-art charge noise levels extracted using free induction decay. With its integrated readout and high stability, this foundry fabricated qubit unit cell demonstrates strong potential for scalable quantum computing architectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extracting the Hamiltonian of nanoscale quantum magnets from experimental measurements is a significant challenge in correlated quantum matter. Here we put forward a machine learning strategy to extract the spin Hamiltonian from inelastic spectroscopy with scanning tunneling microscopy, and we demonstrate this methodology experimentally with an artificial nanoscale molecular magnet based on cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPC) molecules on NbSe$_2$. We show that this technique allows to directly extract the Hamiltonian parameters of a quantum magnet from the differential conductance, including the substrate-induced spatial variation of the different exchange couplings. Our methodology leverages a machine learning algorithm trained on exact quantum many-body simulations with tensor networks of finite quantum magnets, leading to a methodology that can be used to predict the Hamiltonian of CoPC quantum magnets of arbitrary size. Our results demonstrate how quantum many-body methods and machine learning enable learning a microscopic description of nanoscale quantum many-body systems with scanning tunneling spectroscopy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermiticity appears ubiquitously in various open classical and quantum systems and enriches classification of topological phases. However, the role of nonsymmorphic symmetry, crystalline symmetry accompanying fractional lattice translations, has remained largely unexplored. Here, we systematically classify non-Hermitian topological crystalline phases protected by nonsymmorphic symmetry and reveal unique phases that have no counterparts in either Hermitian topological crystalline phases or non-Hermitian topological phases protected solely by internal symmetry. Specifically, we elucidate the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and $\mathbb{Z}_4$ non-Hermitian topological phases and their associated anomalous boundary states characterized by distinctive complex-valued energy dispersions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vibrational dynamics of adsorbate molecules in single-molecule junctions depend critically on the geometric structure and electronic interactions between molecule and substrate. Vibrations, excited mechanochemically or by external stimuli, dissipate energy into substrate electrons and phonons. Energy dissipation leads to the broadening of spectral lines, vibrational lifetimes, and the coupling between molecular and substrate phonons. It affects molecular manipulation, giving rise to nanoscale friction, and contributes to scanning probe and surface spectroscopy signals. We present an approach to disentangle adsorbate vibrational dynamics in non-contact junctions by employing density functional theory, machine learning, and non-adiabatic molecular dynamics. Focusing on the CO-functionalised Cu surfaces representing a single-molecule junction, a widely studied system in scanning probe and energy dissipation experiments, we reveal strong vibrational mode specificity governed by the interplay of electron-phonon and phonon-phonon coupling. Electron-phonon relaxation rates vary by two orders of magnitude between modes and sensitively depend on the tip-substrate geometry. We find evidence of a weak non-additive effect between both energy dissipation channels, where electron-phonon coupling enhances phonon-phonon coupling. Our predicted vibrational lifetimes agree with infrared spectroscopy and helium scattering experiments. Finally, we outline how our findings can inform and enhance scanning probe experiments.</description>

      <title>Soft-X-ray momentum microscopy of nonlinear magnon interactions below 100-nm wavelength</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnons represent quantised collective motions of long-range ordered spins. For wavelength below 100 nm, exchange interactions dominate their physics, which gives rise to a so far unexplored regime of nonlinearities and couplings between magnons and other quasiparticles. Besides their selective excitation, also the detection of such short-wavelength spin waves remains a challenge of current research and technology. Here, we probe the amplitude and wave vector of magnons by means of quasi-elastic resonant soft-X-ray scattering. This Magnon Momentum Microscopy (MMM) can access magnons directly in momentum space with remarkable sensitivity and high photon efficiency up to THz frequencies and down to few-nanometre wavelengths. The two-dimensional information obtained by this light-scattering-based technique is especially valuable for studying the nonlinear interactions of exchange-dominated magnons within technologically relevant thin-film samples. In doing so, we uncover a rich variety of deeply nonlinear magnon interactions, highlighting their potential for applications in novel computing schemes. With its intrinsic element-selectivity and ability to probe also buried layers, soft-X-ray MMM has the potential to establish itself as an advanced tool for ultrabroadband studies of short-wavelength magnonics.</description>

      <title>Optical Activity of Group III-V Quantum Dots Directly Embedded in Silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optically active III-V group semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are the leading element of the upcoming safe quantum communication. However, the entire electronic and IT infrastructure relies on silicon-based devices, with silicon also providing a natural platform for photonic integration. Combining semiconductor optics with silicon electronics is thus a major technological challenge. This obstacle cannot be directly solved because silicon is optically inactive. Interfacing III-V quantum dots with silicon is thus a sought-after solution. A radical approach is to embed III-V material grains directly into silicon. The first realization of such technology was developed, and it gave InAs and core-shell InAs/GaAs QDs embedded in Si with bright and narrow single-QD emission lines. No theory has been given, though, and, as we show here, it is not even obvious if and how such QDs can be optically active. We first use general arguments, also supported by atomistic calculations, that InAs/Si QDs cannot confine both carrier types unless the structural strain is mostly relaxed, meaning many defects at the interface. This explains the lack of light emission from those dots. Then we show that the InAs/GaAs/Si QDs can confine both carrier types. Their electron states are, however, highly influenced by $k$-space valley mixing, which impacts emission spectra and deteriorates optical properties. We propose to overcome this by adding an additional wider-bandgap material layer.</description>

      <title>Modification of the scattering mechanisms in bilayer graphene in proximity to a molecular thin film probed in the mesoscopic regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum coherent effects can be probed in multilayer graphene through electronic transport measurements at low temperatures. In particular, bilayer graphene is known to be susceptible to quantum interference corrections of the conductivity, presenting weak localization at all electronic densities, and dependent on different scattering mechanisms as well as on the trigonal warping of the electron dispersion near the K and K' valleys. Proximity effects with a molecular thin film influence these scattering mechanisms, which can be quantified through the known theory of magnetoconductance for bilayer graphene. Here, we present weak localization measurements in a copper-phthalocyanine / bilayer graphene / h-BN heterostructure that suggest an important suppression of trigonal warping effects in bilayer graphene (BLG), restoring the manifestation of the chirality of the charge carriers in the localization properties of BLG. Additionally, we observe a charge transfer of 3.6$\times$10$^{12}$cm$^{-2}$ from the BLG to the molecules, as well as a very small degradation of the mobility of the BLG/h-BN heterostructure upon the deposition of copper phthalocyanine (CuPc). The molecular arrangement of the CuPc thin film is characterized in a control sample through transmission electron microscopy, that we relate to the electronic transport results.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Hermitian topology from non-Hermitian knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermiticity of the system gives rise to a distinct knot topology in the complex eigenvalue spectrum, which has no counterpart in Hermitian systems. In contrast, the singular values of a non-Hermitian (NH) Hamiltonian are always real by definition, meaning they can also be interpreted as the eigenvalues of some underlying Hermitian Hamiltonian. In this work, we demonstrate that if the singular values of a NH Hamiltonian are treated as eigenvalues of prototype translational-invariant Hermitian models that undergo a topological phase transition between two distinct phases, the complex eigenvalues of the NH Hamiltonian will also undergo a transition between different knot structures. We emphasize that the choice of a NH Hamiltonian whose singular values match the eigenvalues of a Hermitian model is not unique. However, our study suggests that this connection between the NH and Hermitian models remains robust as long as the periodicity in lattice momentum is same for both. Furthermore, we provide an example showing that a change in the topology of the Hermitian model implies a transition in the underlying NH knot topology, but a change in knot topology does not necessarily signal a topological transition in the Hermitian system.</description>

      <title>Initialization of Neutral and Charged Exciton Spin States in a Telecom-Emitting Quantum Dot</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photonic cluster states are highly entangled states that allow for photonic quantum computing and memory-less quantum repeaters. Their generation has been recently demonstrated using semiconductor quantum dots emitting at the 900 nm wavelength range. However, a similar demonstration at the communication-optimal telecom range has remained elusive. A key ingredient that is still missing is an appropriate optical excitation method. A central requirement of such a method is to allow an arbitrary spin initialization of quantum dot excitonic complexes. In this work, we report on developing such a method based on a quasi-resonant p-shell excitation for a telecom-C-band-emitting quantum dot. We show qubit writing of a neutral exciton and spin-preserving excitation of a negative trion. Using the Larmor precession of the negative trion under an externally applied magnetic field, we determine the in-plane g-factors of both the electron and the hole in the investigated quantum dot. In addition, we measure a lower bound on the hole coherence time, $T_{2}^{*}&gt;6.4$ ns, boosting its candidacy as a sound photon entangler for more advanced quantum photonic schemes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exploration of the superconductivity in two-dimensional materials has garnered significant attention due to their promising low-power applications and fundamental scientific interest. Here, we report some novel stable non-van der Waals Nb$_x$N$_{x+1}$ ($x$ = 1-4) monolayers derived from the NbN bulk exfoliated along the (001) plane, as identified through first-principles calculations. Among these monolayers, Nb$_2$N$_3$, which crystallizes in the $P \overline{6} m2$ symmetry, stands out with an exceptional superconducting transition temperature of 77.8 K, setting a new high-$T_c$ benchmark for two-dimensional transition metal nitrides and binary compounds. Our detailed analysis reveals that the strong superconductivity in Nb$_2$N$_3$ is driven by phonon modes dominated by N vibrations, with significant electron-phonon coupling contributions from N-$p$ and Nb-$d$ electronic states. Using the anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg framework, we further determine the two-gap nature of the superconductivity in the Nb$_2$N$_3$ monolayer, characterized by pronounced electron-phonon coupling and anisotropic energy gaps. These results advance our understanding of superconductivity in 2D transition metal nitride and highlight their potential for nanoscale superconducting applications.</description>

      <title>A Quieter State of Charge -- Ultra-Low-Noise Collective Current in Charge-Density-Wave Nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) charge-density-wave (CDW) systems, electric current comprises normal electrons and a collective, electron-lattice condensate current associated with CDW sliding. While achieving the dissipation-less Frohlich current of the sliding condensate is impossible in real materials, one can imagine an important related target, namely reaching the electron transport regime where electronic noise is inhibited due to the collective, strongly-correlated nature of the electron-lattice condensate current. Here we report that in nanowires of the fully-gapped CDW material (TaSe4)2I, low-frequency electronic noise is suppressed below the limit of thermalized charge carriers in passive resistors. When the current is dominated by the sliding Frohlich condensate, the normalized noise spectral density decreases linearly with current -- a striking departure from the constant value observed in conventional conductors. This discovery signals intrinsically lower current fluctuations within a correlated transport regime. The dominant noise source due to fluctuations in the CDW depinning threshold is extrinsic and caused by lattice imperfections that locally pin the condensate. Once the bias voltage is well past threshold and the sliding mode is established, the normalized noise drops below the noise of normal electrons. No residual minimum noise level is observed for the current of the condensate. Since flicker noise limits phase stability in communication systems, reduces the sensitivity and selectivity of sensors, and degrades coherence in quantum devices, our discovery introduces a fundamentally new strategy for achieving ultra-low-noise performance in nanoscale and quantum electronics using strongly correlated materials.</description>

      <title>Protocols to measure the non-Abelian Berry phase by pumping a spin qubit through a quantum-dot loop</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05455v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A quantum system constrained to a degenerate energy eigenspace can undergo a nontrival time evolution upon adiabatic driving, described by a non-Abelian Berry phase. This type of dynamics may provide logical gates in quantum computing that are robust against timing errors. A strong candidate to realize such holonomic quantum gates is an electron or hole spin qubit trapped in a spin-orbit-coupled semiconductor, whose twofold Kramers degeneracy is protected by time-reversal symmetry. Here, we propose and quantitatively analyze protocols to measure the non-Abelian Berry phase by pumping a spin qubit through a loop of quantum dots. One of these protocols allows to characterize the local internal Zeeman field directions in the dots of the loop. We expect a near-term realisation of these protocols, as all key elements have been already demonstrated in spin-qubit experiments. These experiments would be important to assess the potential of holonomic quantum gates for spin-based quantum information processing.</description>

Abstract: The statistics of electron transport in a quantum conductor is affected by fluctuations of its voltage bias. Here we show experimentally how a third order correlation in the electromagnetic field arises from the noise of a tunnel junction in the microwave domain being modulated by the vacuum fluctuations generated by a resistor at ultralow temperature. This provides a way to measure the vacuum fluctuations experienced by the junction, not offset by the unavoidable noise added by the detection setup.</description>

Abstract: We predict the existence of anisotropic spin-transfer torque effect in textured altermagnets. To this end, we generalize the Zhang-Li torque to incorporate the symmetry associated with prototypical $d$-wave altermagnets and identify the spin-splitter adiabatic and nonadiabatic torques. Applying our results to domain wall dynamics induced by spin-transfer torque, we find that, in certain regimes, the spin-splitter adiabatic torque can induce domain wall precession, significantly slowing down domain wall motion. The response of the domain wall also becomes anisotropic, reflecting the $d$-wave symmetry of the altermagnet. Furthermore, we observe that the spin-splitter adiabatic torque modifies skyrmion dynamics, inducing anisotropic skyrmion Hall effect. The above phenomena can serve as a hallmark of altermagnetism in textured magnets, distinguishing it from the behavior of ordinary antiferromagnets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14593v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-reciprocal hopping induces a synthetic magnetic flux which leads to the non-Hermitian Aharonov-Bohm effect. Since non-Hermitian Hamiltonians possess both real and imaginary eigenvalues, this effect allows the observation of real and imaginary persistent currents in a ring threaded by the synthetic flux. Motivated by this, we investigate the behavior of persistent currents in a disordered Hatano-Nelson ring with anti-Hermitian intradimer hopping. The disorder is diagonal and we explore three distinct models, namely the Aubry-Andr\'{e}-Harper model, the Fibonacci model, both representing correlated disorder, and an uncorrelated (random) model. We conduct a detailed analysis of the energy spectrum and examine the real and imaginary parts of the persistent current under various conditions such as different ring sizes and filling factors. Interestingly, we find that real and imaginary persistent currents exhibit amplification in the presence of correlated disorder. This amplification is also observed in certain individual random configurations but vanishes after configuration averaging. Additionally, we observe both diamagnetic and paramagnetic responses in the current behavior and investigate aspects of persistent currents in the absence of disorder that have not been previously explored. Interestingly, we find that the intradimer bonds host only imaginary currents, while the interdimer bonds carry only real currents. The bulk-boundary correspondence is investigated by analyzing the existence of localized edge states under the open boundary condition.</description>

      <title>Effect of disorder and strain on the operation of planar Ge hole spin qubits</title>

Abstract: Germanium quantum dots in strained $\text{Ge}/\text{Si}_{1-x}\text{Ge}_{x}$ heterostructures exhibit fast and coherent hole qubit control in experiments. In this work, we theoretically and numerically address the effects of random alloy disorder and gate-induced strain on the operation of planar Ge hole spin qubits. Electrical operation of hole quantum dot spin qubits is enabled by the strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) originating from the intrinsic SOC in the Ge valence band as well as from the structural inversion asymmetry inherent in the underlying 2D hole gas. We use the atomistic valence force field (VFF) method to compute the strain due to random alloy disorder, and thermal expansion models in COMSOL Multiphysics to obtain the strain from a realistic gate-stack of planar hole quantum dot confinement. Recently, spin-orbit coupling terms $\propto k$ have been shown to be induced by strain inhomogeneity. Our hybrid approach to realistic device modeling suggests that strain inhomogeneity due to both random alloy disorder and gate-induced strain make a strong contribution to the linear-$k$ Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling, which eventually dominates hole spin EDSR; and there exist specific in-plane orientations of the global magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$ and the microwave drive $\mathbf{\tilde{E}}_{\text{ac}}$ for maximum EDSR Rabi frequency of the hole spin qubit. The current model including strain inhomogeneity accurately predicts the EDSR Rabi frequency to be $\!\sim\!100$ MHz for typical electric and magnetic fields in experiments, which represents at least an order of magnitude improvement in accuracy over phenomenological models assuming uniform uniaxial strain. State-of-the-art atomistic tight binding calculations via nano-electronic modeling (NEMO3D) are in agreement with the $\mathbf{k}{\cdot}\mathbf{p}$ description.</description>

      <title>When Adiabaticity Is Not Enough to Study Topological Phases in Solid-State Physics: Comparing the Berry and Aharonov-Anandan Phases in 2D Materials</title>

Abstract: Topological phases emerge as the parameters of a quantum system vary with time. Under the adiabatic approximation, the time dependence can be eliminated, allowing the Berry topological phase to be obtained from a closed trajectory in parameter space. In solid-state physics, this approach is commonly applied by taking a reciprocal space wavevector as the parameter, which is assumed to be varied by electromagnetic fields.The Berry curvature is then obtained by computing the derivatives of Bloch wavefunctions in reciprocal space. However, in many systems-especially gapless ones-the adiabatic approximation is never satisfied. This is particularly true in Dirac and Weyl materials, where the Berry curvature is often calculated without considering the breakdown of the adiabatic condition. In this work, we demonstrate how other time-dependent topological quantities, specifically the Aharonov-Anandan phase, can be used to extract information not only about topology but also about band transitions in 2D materials. In particular, a relationship between the current and the Aharonov-Anandan phase is proved, showing that photon-induced transitions produce current vortices. To illustrate this, we analyze graphene under electromagnetic radiation from a time-driven perspective, showing how the Aharonov-Anandan and Berry phases provide complementary insights into topology, interband transitions, and currents. This is achieved by using the Dirac-Bloch formalism and by solving the time-dependent equations within Floquet theory.</description>

      <title>Anomalous current-electric field characteristics in transport through a nanoelectromechanical systems</title>

Abstract: A deep understanding of the correlation between electronic and mechanical degrees of freedom is crucial to the development of quantum devices in a nanoelectromechanical system (NEMS). In this work, we first establish a fully quantum mechanical approach for transport through a NEMS device, which is valid for arbitrary bias voltages, temperatures, and electro-mechanical couplings. We find an anomalous current-electric field characteristics at a low bias, where the current decreases with a rising electric field, associated with the backward tunneling of electrons for a weak mechanical damping. We reveal that this intriguing behavior arises from a combined effect of mechanical motion and Coulomb blockade, where the rapid increase of backward tunneling events at a large oscillation amplitude suppresses the forward current due to prohibition of double occupation. In the opposite limit of strong damping, the oscillator dissipates its energy to the environment and relaxes to the ground state rapidly. Electrons then transport via the lowest vibrational state such that the net current and its corresponding noise have a vanishing dependence on the electric field.</description>

      <title>Enhancing nanoscale charged colloid crystallization near a metastable liquid binodal</title>

Abstract: Bottom-up assembly of nanocrystals (NCs) into ordered arrays, or superlattices (SLs), is a promising route to design materials with new functionalities, but the degree of control over assembly into functional structures remains challenging. Using electrostatics, rather than density, to tune the interactions between semiconductor NCs, we watch self-assembly proceeding through a metastable liquid phase. We systematically investigate the phase behavior as a function of quench conditions in situ and in real time using small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). Through quantitative fitting to colloid, liquid, and SL models, we extract the time evolution of each phase and the system phase diagram, which we find to be consistent with short-range attractive interactions. Using the phase diagram's predictive power, we establish control of the self-assembly rate over three orders of magnitude, and identify one- and two-step self-assembly regimes, with only the latter implicating the metastable liquid as an intermediate. Importantly, the presence of the metastable liquid increases SL formation rates relative to the equivalent one-step pathway, and SL order counterintuitively increases with the rate, revealing a highly desirable and generalizable kinetic strategy to promote and enhance ordered assembly.</description>

      <title>Local vs non-local dynamics in cavity-coupled Rydberg atom arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04634v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Locality is a transversal principle that governs quantum dynamics of many-body systems. However, for cavity embedded systems, such fundamental notion is hindered by the presence of non-local cavity modes, leaving space for new possible dynamical behaviors. Here, we investigate the real-time dynamics of low-energy excitations in one dimensional Rydberg atom arrays coupled to a global cavity mode. We derive an effective description in terms of a Tavis-Cummings-Ising model, whose phase diagram features ordered and disordered phases. The non-local nature of the cavity mode drastically affects the emergent meson and string dynamics. Mesons hybridize coherently with the cavity photons, leading to composite meson-polaritons excitations. Strings, differently from local interacting theories, acquire a finite kinetic energy thanks to non-local cavity-mediated interactions between the underlying domain-walls. We then conclude by presenting a new concrete experimental blueprint for a cavity QED Rydberg atom array simulator where the physics outlined in this work can be realized.</description>

      <title>Topological phases of coupled Su-Schrieffer-Heeger wires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18228v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The phase diagrams of arbitrary number $N_{\text{w}}$ of diagonally and perpendicularly coupled Su-Schrieffer-Heeger wires have been identified. The diagonally coupled wires have rich topological phase diagrams exhibiting insulating phases with winding numbers $0\leq w \leq N_{\text{w}}$ and topological critical lines restricted by the reflection mirror symmetry. Even number of perpendicularly coupled wires exhibit either gapless or trivial topological phases. Odd number of perpendicularly coupled wires additionally exhibit nontrivial topological phases with winding number $w=1$. Due to the mirror reflection symmetry, their gapless regions can be topologically nontrivial. Odd number of perpendicularly coupled wires reveal coherent confined correlations in the odd indexed wires with strong wire-wire coupling away from the gapless regions.</description>
