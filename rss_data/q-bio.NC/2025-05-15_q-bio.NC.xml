      <title>Neurophysiologically Realistic Environment for Comparing Adaptive Deep Brain Stimulation Algorithms in Parkinson Disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adaptive deep brain stimulation (aDBS) has emerged as a promising treatment for Parkinson disease (PD). In aDBS, a surgically placed electrode sends dynamically altered stimuli to the brain based on neurophysiological feedback: an invasive gadget that limits the amount of data one could collect for optimizing the control offline. As a consequence, a plethora of synthetic models of PD and those of the control algorithms have been proposed. Herein, we introduce the first neurophysiologically realistic benchmark for comparing said models. Specifically, our methodology covers not only conventional basal ganglia circuit dynamics and pathological oscillations, but also captures 15 previously dismissed physiological attributes, such as signal instabilities and noise, neural drift, electrode conductance changes and individual variability - all modeled as spatially distributed and temporally registered features via beta-band activity in the brain and a feedback. Furthermore, we purposely built our framework as a structured environment for training and evaluating deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, opening new possibilities for optimizing aDBS control strategies and inviting the machine learning community to contribute to the emerging field of intelligent neurostimulation interfaces.</description>

      <title>A Computational Approach to Epilepsy Treatment: An AI-optimized Global Natural Product Prescription System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Epilepsy is a prevalent neurological disease with millions of patients worldwide. Many patients have turned to alternative medicine due to the limited efficacy and side effects of conventional antiepileptic drugs. In this study, we developed a computational approach to optimize herbal epilepsy treatment through AI-driven analysis of global natural products and statistically validated randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Our intelligent prescription system combines machine learning (ML) algorithms for herb-efficacy characterization, Bayesian optimization for personalized dosing, and meta-analysis of RCTs for evidence-based recommendations. The system analyzed 1,872 natural compounds from traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), Ayurveda, and ethnopharmacological databases, integrating their bioactive properties with clinical outcomes from 48 RCTs covering 48 epilepsy conditions (n=5,216). Using LASSO regression and SHAP value analysis, we identified 17 high-efficacy herbs (e.g., Gastrodia elata [using \'e for accented characters], Withania somnifera), showing significant seizure reduction (p$&lt;$0.01, Cohen's d=0.89) with statistical significance confirmed by multiple testing (p$&lt;$0.001). A randomized double-blind validation trial (n=120) demonstrated 28.5\% greater seizure frequency reduction with AI-optimized herbal prescriptions compared to conventional protocols (95\% CI: 18.7-37.3\%, p=0.003).</description>

      <title>Temporal Interception and Present Reconstruction: A Cognitive-Signal Model for Human and AI Decision Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel theoretical model to explain how the human mind and artificial intelligence can approach real-time awareness by reducing perceptual delays. By investigating cosmic signal delay, neurological reaction times, and the ancient cognitive state of stillness, we explore how one may shift from reactive perception to a conscious interface with the near future. This paper introduces both a physical and cognitive model for perceiving the present not as a linear timestamp, but as an interference zone where early-arriving cosmic signals and reactive human delays intersect. We propose experimental approaches to test these ideas using human neural observation and neuro-receptive extensions. Finally, we propose a mathematical framework to guide the evolution of AI systems toward temporally efficient, ethically sound, and internally conscious decision-making processes</description>

      <title>Slow Transition to Low-Dimensional Chaos in Heavy-Tailed Recurrent Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Growing evidence suggests that synaptic weights in the brain follow heavy-tailed distributions, yet most theoretical analyses of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) assume Gaussian connectivity. We systematically study the activity of RNNs with random weights drawn from biologically plausible L\'evy alpha-stable distributions. While mean-field theory for the infinite system predicts that the quiescent state is always unstable -- implying ubiquitous chaos -- our finite-size analysis reveals a sharp transition between quiescent and chaotic dynamics. We theoretically predict the gain at which the system transitions from quiescent to chaotic dynamics, and validate it through simulations. Compared to Gaussian networks, heavy-tailed RNNs exhibit a broader parameter regime near the edge of chaos, namely a slow transition to chaos. However, this robustness comes with a tradeoff: heavier tails reduce the Lyapunov dimension of the attractor, indicating lower effective dimensionality. Our results reveal a biologically aligned tradeoff between the robustness of dynamics near the edge of chaos and the richness of high-dimensional neural activity. By analytically characterizing the transition point in finite-size networks -- where mean-field theory breaks down -- we provide a tractable framework for understanding dynamics in realistically sized, heavy-tailed neural circuits.</description>

      <title>Real-World fNIRS-Based Brain-Computer Interfaces: Benchmarking Deep Learning and Classical Models in Interactive Gaming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain-Computer Interfaces enable direct communication between the brain and external systems, with functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy emerging as a portable and non-invasive method for capturing cerebral hemodynamics. This study investigates the classification of rest and task states during a realistic, interactive tennis simulation using fNIRS signals and a range of machine learning approaches. We benchmarked traditional classifiers based on engineered features, Long Short-Term Memory networks on raw time-series data, and Convolutional Neural Networks applied to Gramian Angular Field-transformed images. Ensemble models like Extra Trees and Gradient Boosting achieved accuracies above 97 percent, while the ResNet-based CNN reached 95.0 percent accuracy with a near-perfect AUC of 99.2 percent, outperforming both LSTM and EfficientNet architectures. A novel data augmentation strategy was employed to equalize trial durations while preserving physiological integrity. Feature importance analyses revealed that both oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin signals, particularly slope and RMS metrics, were key contributors to classification performance. These findings demonstrate the strong potential of fNIRS-based BCIs for deployment in dynamic, real-world environments and underscore the advantages of deep learning models in decoding complex neural signals.</description>

      <title>Inferring entropy production in many-body systems using nonequilibrium MaxEnt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a method for inferring entropy production (EP) in high-dimensional stochastic systems, including many-body systems and non-Markovian systems with long memory. Standard techniques for estimating EP become intractable in such systems due to computational and statistical limitations. We infer trajectory-level EP and lower bounds on average EP by exploiting a nonequilibrium analogue of the Maximum Entropy principle, along with convex duality. Our approach uses only samples of trajectory observables (such as spatiotemporal correlation functions). It does not require reconstruction of high-dimensional probability distributions or rate matrices, nor any special assumptions such as discrete states or multipartite dynamics. It may be used to compute a hierarchical decomposition of EP, reflecting contributions from different kinds of interactions, and it has an intuitive physical interpretation as a thermodynamic uncertainty relation. We demonstrate its numerical performance on a disordered nonequilibrium spin model with 1000 spins and a large neural spike-train dataset.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive and reliable protocol for manual segmentation of the human claustrum using high-resolution MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01761v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The claustrum is a thin gray matter structure in each brain hemisphere, characterized by exceptionally high connectivity with nearly all brain regions. Despite extensive animal studies on its anatomy and function and growing evidence of claustral deficits in neuropsychiatric disorders, its specific roles in normal and abnormal human brain function remain largely unknown. This is primarily due to its thin and complex morphology, which limits accurate anatomical delineation and neural activity isolation in conventional in vivo neuroimaging. To facilitate future neuroimaging studies, we developed a comprehensive and reliable manual segmentation protocol based on a cellular-resolution brain atlas and high-resolution (0.7^3 mm) MRI data. The protocols involve detailed guidelines to delineate the entire claustrum, including the inferior parts that have not been clearly described in earlier MRI studies. Additionally, we propose a geometric method to parcellate the claustrum into three subregions (the dorsal, ventral, and temporal claustrum) along the superior-to-inferior axis. The mean bilateral claustrum volume in 10 young adults was 3307.5 mm^3, approximately 0.21% of total intracranial volume. Our segmentation protocol demonstrated high inter- and intra-rater reliability (ICC &gt; 0.89, DSC &gt; 0.85), confirming its replicability. This comprehensive and reliable manual segmentation protocol offers a robust foundation for anatomically precise neuroimaging investigations of the human claustrum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel predictive coding framework for studying attachment theory. Building off an established model of attachment, the dynamic-maturational model (DMM), as well as the neuroanatomical Embodied Predictive Interoception Coding (EPIC) model of interoception and emotion, we not only elucidate how neural processes can shape attachment strategies, but also explore how early attachment experiences can shape those processes in the first place.</description>

      <title>Associations between iron and mean kurtosis in iron-rich grey matter nuclei in aging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04706v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mean kurtosis in iron-rich grey matter has values similar to that seen in white matter. We suspect these elevated values may be related to iron. Multi-shell diffusion and multi-echo gradient echo acquisitions were used to derive mean kurtosis and R2*, respectively. Mean kurtosis and R2* were measured in subcortical grey matter nuclei and white matter tracts in 93 older adults and 62 younger adults. Grey matter regions exhibited higher mean kurtosis and R2* in the older adult group whereas white matter regions had reduced mean kurtosis in the older adult group. Grey matter mean kurtosis was significantly correlated with R2* iron-rich grey matter nuclei in both groups. Our findings indicate that higher mean kurtosis in iron-rich grey matter structures may be due to either increased tissue complexity or to decreases in signal-to-noise ratios from iron deposition</description>
