      <title>Multiband Embeddings of Light Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel ensemble of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that considers the multiband and non-uniform cadence without having to compute complex features. Our proposed model consists of an ensemble of RNNs, which do not require the entire light curve to perform inference, making the inference process simpler. The ensemble is able to adapt to varying numbers of bands, tested on three real light curve datasets, namely Gaia, Pan-STARRS1, and ZTF, to demonstrate its potential for generalization. We also show the capabilities of deep learning to perform not only classification, but also regression of physical parameters such as effective temperature and radius. Our ensemble model demonstrates superior performance in scenarios with fewer observations, thus providing potential for early classification of sources from facilities such as Vera C. Rubin Observatory's LSST. The results underline the model's effectiveness and flexibility, making it a promising tool for future astronomical surveys. Our research has shown that a multitask learning approach can enrich the embeddings obtained by the models, making them instrumental to solve additional tasks, such as determining the orbital parameters of binary systems or estimating parameters for object types beyond periodic ones.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Fault Diagnosis in GWAC: A Monitoring System for Telescope Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Ground-based Wide-Angle Cameras array (GWAC) necessitates the integration of over 100 hardware devices, more than 100 servers, and upwards of 2500 software modules, all synchronized within a 3-second imaging cycle. However, the complexity of real-time and high concurrency processing of big data have historically resulted in a substantial failure rate, with estimated observation efficiency of less than 50% in 2023. To address these challenges, we developed a monitoring system aimed at enhancing fault diagnosis efficiency. This paper details the system's architecture, data collection methods, and the design philosophy of monitoring views. After a year of practical fault diagnostics, the system has demonstrated the ability to identify and localize faults within minutes, achieving fault localization speeds nearly ten times faster than traditional methods. Additionally, the system's design exhibits high generalizability, making them applicable to other telescope array systems.</description>

      <title>Electric field reconstruction with three polarizations for the radio detection of ultra-high energy particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The amplitude, polarization, frequency spectrum and energy fluence carried by the electric field at a given measurement position are the key parameters for retrieving information from radio signals generated by extensive air showers. Accurate reconstruction of the electric field from the signals recorded by the antennas is therefore essential for the radio detection technique. Conventional reconstruction methods primarily focus on electric field reconstruction for antennas with two horizontal polarizations. In this paper, we introduce an analytical least-squares ($\chi^2$) reconstruction method that operates with both two and three polarizations, providing the reconstructed electric field directly at each antenna. This solution has been verified for simple and realistic antenna responses, with a particular focus on inclined air showers. Our method achieves an accuracy better than 4\% in determining the Hilbert peak amplitude of an electric field and better than 6\% accuracy, with minimal bias, when estimating energy fluence. Additionally, this method is reliable for almost all arrival directions, and the direction dependence has been investigated. This work also demonstrates that incorporating vertically polarized antennas enhances the precision of reconstruction, leading to a more accurate and reliable electric field estimation for inclined air showers. Consequently, the method enhances our ability to extract information about cosmic rays from the detected signals in current and future experiments.</description>

      <title>A detailed study on spectroscopic performance of SOI pixel detector with a pinned depleted diode structure for X-ray astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have been developing silicon-on-insulator (SOI) pixel detectors with a pinned depleted diode (PDD) structure, named "XRPIX", for X-ray astronomy. In our previous study, we successfully optimized the design of the PDD structure, achieving both the suppression of large leakage current and satisfactory X-ray spectroscopic performance. Here, we report a detailed study on the X-ray spectroscopic performance of the XRPIX with the optimized PDD structure. The data were obtained at $-60^\circ\mathrm{C}$ with the "event-driven readout mode", in which only a triggering pixel and its surroundings are read out. The energy resolutions in full width at half maximum at 6.4 keV are $178\pm1$ eV and $291\pm1$ eV for single-pixel and all-pixel event spectra, respectively. The all-pixel events include charge-sharing pixel events as well as the single-pixel events. These values are the best achieved in the history of our development. We argue that the gain non-linearity in the low energy side due to excessive charge injection to the charge-sensitive amplifier is a major factor to limit the current spectroscopic performance. Optimization of the amount of the charge injection is expected to lead to further improvement in the spectroscopic performance of XRPIX, especially for the all-pixel event spectrum.</description>

      <title>SF2A Environmental Transition Commission: What kind of astrophysics research for a sustainable world?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During its annual conference in 2024, the French Society of Astronomy \&amp;amp; Astrophysics (SF2A) hosted, for the fourth time, a special session dedicated to discussing the environmental transition within the French astrophysics research community. This year had a special context: both the CNRS-INSU and the CNES were preparing their scientific perspectives for the period 2025-2030 in the field of Astronomy-Astrophysics (AA). In this proceeding, we first describe the main actions undertaken by the Commission Transition Environnementale. Then, we summarize the discussions held during the half-day workshop, which brought together about 100 participants, and point to forthcoming proceeding, reports and other related resources. A key message is that the French A\&amp;amp;A community is now fully aware that astronomical activities simply cannot thrive indefinitely in the current situation, and seems now eager to seize the opportunity of developing our profession towards a better social and environmental impact.</description>

      <title>The TES-based Cryogenic AntiCoincidence Detector of ATHENA X-IFU: Validation of the thermal end-to-end simulator towards the updated Demonstration Model (DM 1.1)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cryogenic AntiCoincidence Detector (CryoAC) is a key element of the X-ray Integral Field Unit (X-IFU) on board the future ATHENA X-ray observatory. It is a TES-based detector designed to reduce the particle background of the instrument, thereby increasing its sensitivity. The detector design is driven by an end-to-end simulator which includes the electro-thermal modelling of the detector and the dynamics of its readout chain. Here, we present the measurements carried out on the last CryoAC single pixel prototype, namely DM127, in order to evaluate the critical thermal parameters of the detector and consequently to tune and validate the CryoAC end-to-end simulator.</description>

      <title>ExoSim 2: the new Exoplanet Observation Simulator applied to the Ariel space mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ExoSim 2 is the next generation of the Exoplanet Observation Simulator (ExoSim) tailored for spectro-photometric observations of transiting exoplanets from space, ground, and sub-orbital platforms. This software is a complete rewrite implemented in Python 3, embracing object-oriented design principles, which allow users to replace each component with their functions when required. ExoSim 2 is publicly available on GitHub, serving as a valuable resource for the scientific community. ExoSim 2 employs a modular architecture using Task classes, encapsulating simulation algorithms and functions. This flexible design facilitates the extensibility and adaptability of ExoSim 2 to diverse instrument configurations to address the evolving needs of the scientific community. Data management within ExoSim 2 is handled by the Signal class, which represents a structured data cube incorporating time, space, and spectral dimensions. The code execution in ExoSim 2 follows a three-step workflow: the creation of focal planes, the production of Sub-Exposure blocks, and the generation of non-destructive reads (NDRs). Each step can be executed independently, optimizing time and computational resources. ExoSim 2 has been extensively validated against other tools like ArielRad and has demonstrated consistency in estimating photon conversion efficiency, saturation time, and signal generation. The simulator has also been validated independently for instantaneous read-out and jitter simulation, and for astronomical signal representation. In conclusion, ExoSim 2 offers a robust and flexible tool for exoplanet observation simulation, capable of adapting to diverse instrument configurations and evolving scientific needs. Its design principles and validation results underscore its potential as a valuable resource in the field of exoplanet research.</description>

      <title>BayesEoR: Bayesian 21-cm Power Spectrum Estimation from Interferometric Visibilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: BayesEoR is a GPU-accelerated, MPI-compatible Python package for estimating the power spectrum of redshifted 21-cm emission from interferometric observations of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). Utilizing a Bayesian framework, BayesEoR jointly fits for the 21-cm EoR power spectrum and a "foreground" model, referring to bright, contaminating emission between us and the cosmological signal, and forward models the instrument with which these signals are observed. To perform the sampling, we use MultiNest [arXiv:1402.0004], which calculates the Bayesian evidence as part of the analysis. Thus, BayesEoR can also be used as a tool for model selection [see e.g. arXiv:1701.03384].</description>

      <title>DASCH: Bringing 100+ Years of Photographic Data into the 21st Century and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Harvard College Observatory was the preeminent astronomical data center of the early 20th century: it gathered and archived an enormous collection of glass photographic plates that became, and remains, the largest in the world. For nearly twenty years DASCH (Digital Access to a Sky Century @ Harvard) actively digitized this library using a one-of-a kind plate scanner. In early 2024, after 470,000 scans, the DASCH project finished. Now, this unique analog dataset can be integrated into 21st-century, digital analyses. The key DASCH data products include ~200 TB of plate images, ~16 TB of calibrated light curves, and a variety of supporting metadata and calibration outputs. Virtually every part of the sky is covered by thousands of DASCH images with a time baseline spanning more than 100 years; most stars brighter than B ~ 15 have hundreds or thousands of detections. DASCH Data Release 7, issued in late 2024, represents the culmination of the DASCH scanning project.</description>

      <title>Characterization of a fiber laser hydrophone for acoustic neutrino detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the development and characterization of a fiber laser hydrophone designed for deep-sea applications, with a focus on detecting neutrino interactions via their acoustic signatures. The hydrophone design includes a static pressure compensation mechanism, ensuring reliable operation at depths exceeding 1 km. The performance of the hydrophone was evaluated through laboratory tests and experiments in an anechoic basin, where its transfer function was measured before and after a 140-bar pressure cycle. The results show that the hydrophone maintains its sensitivity, with resonance peaks identified in both low- and high-frequency ranges. The hydrophone's sensitivity to acoustic signals was also compared to ambient sea state noise levels, demonstrating compatibility with the lowest noise conditions.</description>

      <title>Innovative Web Tool for Remote Data Acquisition and Analysis: Customized for SKA Low frequency Beamforming Test Bed LPDA Array at Gauribidanur Radio Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the evolution of radio astronomy, related education and training, the demand for scalable, efficient, and remote systems in data acquisition, storage, and analysis has significantly increased. Addressing this need, we have developed a web interface for a log-periodic dipole antenna (LPDA) array integral to the SKA Test activities at the Gauribidanur Radio Observatory (77.428 E, 13.603 N). This interface, employing Python-based technologies such as Streamlit and PyVISA, along with SCPI commands, offers a seamless and user-friendly experience. Our solution introduces a unique data acquisition approach, employing SCPI through Python to communicate with the setup's Data Acquisition System (DAS). The web interface, accessible remotely via a secure WLAN network or VPN, facilitates user-initiated observations and comprehensive logging and offers advanced features like manual RFI masking, transit plotting, and fringe plot analysis. Additionally, it acts as a data hub, allowing for the remote downloading of observational data. These capabilities significantly enhance the user's ability to conduct detailed post-observation data analysis. The effectiveness of this interface is further demonstrated through a successful solar transit observation, validating its utility and accuracy in real-world astronomical applications. The applications of this web tool are expandable and can be tailored according to the Observatory's Goals and Instrumentation as well as for the growing radio astronomy instrumentation and observing facilities coming up at various educational institutions.</description>

      <title>Modelling the Sgr A$^*$ and M87$^*$ shadows by using the Kerr-Taub-NUT metrics in the presence of a scalar field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent unveiling of the images of Sgr A* and M87* has significantly advanced our understanding of gravitational physics. In this study, we derive a class of Kerr-Taub-NUT metrics in the presence of a scalar field (KTNS). Treating these metrics as models for supermassive objects, we constrain the parameters using shadow size estimates done by observations of M87* and Sgr A* from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). Comparing the obtained results with M87* data, we show an upper limit on the NUT charge $n$ such that the constraint on the shadow deviation from circularity ($ \Delta C $) will be fulfilled for $ n&lt;0.5 $, and this allowed range changes with a variation in other parameters. Additionally, our findings reveal that fast-rotating KTNS metrics are better candidates for supermassive M87* than slowly rotating ones. We continue our study by estimating parameters using Keck and VLTI observations of Sgr A* and find that the constraint on the fraction deviation $ \delta $ is maintained within a certain range of the NUT charge such that the Keck bound is satisfied for $ n&lt;0.41 $. In contrast, the VLTI bound can be fulfilled for $ n&gt;0.34 $. Finally, we investigate weak gravitational lensing using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem and illustrate that all model parameters increase the deflection angle, causing light rays to deviate more significantly near fast-rotating KTNS objects.</description>

      <title>Search Capability for Near-Earth Objects with the Wide Field Survey Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST), with a powerful sky survey capability in the northern hemisphere, will play an important role in asteroid searching and monitoring. However, WFST is not a telescope dedicated to near-Earth asteroids (NEOs) searching. In order to improve the efficiency of finding NEOs on the premise of meeting the needs of other scientific research, we ran mock observations for WFST to study its search capability for NEOs. The NEO population model, the WFST detection model and site conditions are taken into account in our simulations. Based on the original scheduling scheme, we present two new schemes. Compared to the original scheme, the optimized scheme can improve the search capability of known and unknown NEOs by 100% and 50%. We also emphasized the importance of trailing loss and proposed an improved effective field of view model. In addition, it is predicted that adopting the clear-day ratio of 0.7 and the optimized scheme, for NEOs with absolute magnitude from 17 to 25, WFST can provide tracklets for about 1800 NEOs if their orbits are known, and in the case of blind search, more than 600 NEOs can be found by WFST. The new schemes provide valuable reference and suggestions for the WFST's regular survey strategy.</description>

      <title>Detection of Unresolved Strongly Lensed Supernovae with 7-Dimensional Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitationally lensed supernovae (glSNe) are a powerful tool for exploring the realms of astronomy and cosmology. Time-delay measurements and lens modeling of glSNe can provide a robust and independent method for constraining the expansion rate of the universe. The study of unresolved glSNe light curves presents a unique opportunity for utilizing small telescopes to investigate these systems. In this work, we investigate diverse observational strategies for the initial detection of glSNe using the 7-Dimensional Telescope (7DT), a multi-telescope system composed of twenty 50-cm telescopes. We implement different observing strategies on a subset of 5807 strong lensing systems and candidates identified within the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS), as reported in various publications. Our simulations under ideal observing conditions indicate the maximum expected annual detection rates for various glSNe types (Type Ia and core-collapse (CC)) using the 7DT target observing mode in the $r$-band at a depth of 22.04 mag, as follows: 8.25 events for type Ia, 3.06 for type Ic, 1.04 for type IIb, 0.66 for type IIL, 0.89 for type IIn, 5.26 for type IIP, and 1.44 for type Ib. Furthermore, in the case of medium-band filter observations (m6000) at a depth of 20.61 in the Wide-Field Survey (WFS) program, the predicted detection rate for glSNe Ia is 3.30 $yr^{-1}$. Given targeted follow-up observations of these initially detected systems with more powerful telescopes, we can apply a model-independent approach to forecast the ability to measure $H_{0}$ using a Gaussian process from Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) data and time-delay distance information derived from glSNe systems, which include both Ia and CC types. We forecast that the expected detection rate of glSNe systems can achieve a $2.4\%$ precision in estimating the Hubble constant.</description>

      <title>Fast Bayesian spectral analysis using Convolutional Neural Networks: Applications over GONG H$\alpha$ solar data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Solar filament oscillations have been observed for many years, but recent advances in telescope capabilities now enable daily monitoring of these periodic motions, offering valuable insights into the structure of filaments. A systematic study of filament oscillations over the solar cycle can shed light on the evolution of the prominences. Until now, only manual techniques have been used to analyze these oscillations.
  Aims. This work serves as a proof of concept, aiming to demonstrate the effectiveness of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). These networks automatically detect filament oscillations by applying power-spectrum analysis to H$\alpha$ data from the GONG telescope network.
  Methods. The proposed technique studies periodic fluctuations of every pixel of the H$\alpha$ data cubes. Using the Lomb Scargle periodogram, we computed the power spectral density (PSD) of the dataset. The background noise is well fitted to a combination of red and white noise. Using Bayesian statistics and Markov chains -- Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms we can fit the spectra and determine the confidence threshold of a given percentage to search for real oscillations. We built two CNN models to obtain the same results as the MCMC approach.
  Results. We applied the CNN models to some observations reported in the literature, proving its reliability in detecting the same events as the classical methods. A day with events not previously reported has been studied to check for the model capabilities outside of a controlled dataset where we can check with previous reports.
  Conclusions. CNNs proved to be a useful tool to study solar filament oscillations, using spectral techniques. Computing times have been reduced significantly while getting results similar enough to the classical methods. This is a relevant step towards the automatic detection of filament oscillations.</description>

      <title>Large discrepancies in error estimates for reverberation times derived from light curves of active galactic nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light-travel-time delays provide one of the most powerful ways of learning about the structure and kinematics of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Estimating delays from observations of AGN variability presents statistical challenges because the time series are almost invariably irregularly sampled. Correct assessment of errors in lag estimates is important for evaluating results. The most widely used method of determining phase lags has been the interpolated cross-correlation function method introduced by Gaskell and Sparke (1986, GS). It is shown here that the widely used modified smooth bootstrap method of Peterson et al. (1998) significantly overestimates the error in lags derived using the GS, especially for poorly sampled light curves. The remarkably high accuracy claimed for lags obtained by the JAVELIN method of Zu et al. (2011) (more than an order of magnitude improvement for 25% of cases) is spurious and the accuracy no better than the GS method. A related method proposed by Li et al. (2013) suffers from similar but less serious problems. A slightly modified version of the analytic formula of Gaskell and Peterson (1987) gives an easy and accurate way of estimating lag errors for well-sampled, high-quality data. The width of the continuum autocorrelation function is shown to be proportional to the square root of the luminosity. This is useful in planning observing campaigns. The discrete correlation function method is less powerful than the GS method and for many typical situations gives errors in the lag twice as large as those of the GS method.</description>

      <title>FindPOTATOs: Minor Planet Observation Linking Software</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For minor planet observations to be archived and used by the scientific community, observations of individual objects must be linked together into groups called tracklets. This linking is nontrivial, as linking software must find real tracklets in noisy data within a reasonable amount of time. We describe FindPOTATOs, a linking software written in Python that can assemble minor planet tracklets. With the appropriate parameters, FindPOTATOs assembles tracklets for a variety of objects, including close-approaching near-Earth objects and trans-Neptunian objects. FindPOTATOs is ideal for processing data sets taken at small observatories, processing archival data, or finding tracklets of minor planets on unusual orbits. This paper describes the code structure, usage, and validation.</description>

      <title>The AGILE space mission: an Italian success story and its legacy for future space astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AGILE (Astrorivelatore Gamma ad Immagini LEggero) has been a unique and hugely successful mission of Italian Space Agency (ASI), built and operated with the programmatic and technical support of the National Institute for Astrophysics (INAF), the National Institute for Nuclear Physics (INFN), several universities and Italian industries. During almost 17 years of observations in orbit (from April 23, 2007, to January 18, 2024), AGILE contributed to high-energy astrophysics and terrestrial physics with many discoveries and detections. Two co-aligned X- and gamma-ray detectors, a silicon-strip-based tracker, a wide field of view gamma-ray imager and the fast-reaction ground segment were the AGILE innovative solutions with respect to the previous generation of gamma-ray satellites. With the AGILE's re-entry, the in-orbit operational phase ends, but a new phase of scientific work on the satellite legacy data archive opens: AGILE may still hold future surprises.</description>

      <title>Accounting for Noise and Singularities in Bayesian Calibration Methods for Global 21-cm Cosmology Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to the large dynamic ranges involved with separating the cosmological 21-cm signal from the Cosmic Dawn from galactic foregrounds, a well-calibrated instrument is essential to avoid biases from instrumental systematics. In this paper we present three methods for calibrating a global 21-cm cosmology experiment using the noise wave parameter formalisation to characterise a low noise amplifier including a careful consideration of how calibrator temperature noise and singularities will bias the result. The first method presented in this paper builds upon the existing conjugate priors method by weighting the calibrators by a physically motivated factor, thereby avoiding singularities and normalising the noise. The second method fits polynomials to the noise wave parameters by marginalising over the polynomial coefficients and sampling the polynomial orders as parameters. The third method introduces a physically motivated noise model to the marginalised polynomial method. Running these methods on a suite of simulated datasets based on the REACH receiver design and a lab dataset, we found that our methods produced a calibration solution which is equally as or more accurate than the existing conjugate priors method when compared with an analytic estimate of the calibrator's noise. We find in the case of the measured lab dataset the conjugate priors method is biased heavily by the large noise on the shorted load calibrator, resulting in incorrect noise wave parameter fits. This is mitigated by the methods introduced in this paper which calibrate the validation source spectra to within 5% of the noise floor.</description>

      <title>How complex are galaxies? A non-parametric estimation of the intrinsic dimensionality of wide-band photometric data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02962v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Galaxies are complex objects, yet the number of independent parameters to describe them remains unknown. We present here a non-parametric method to estimate the intrinsic dimensionality of large datasets. We apply it to wide-band photometric data drawn from the COSMOS2020 catalogue and a comparable mock catalogue from the Horizon-AGN simulation. Our galaxy catalogues are limited in signal-to-noise ratio in all optical and NIR bands. Our results reveal that most of the variance in the wide-band photometry of this galaxy sample can be described with at most $4.3\pm0.5$ independent parameters for star-forming galaxies and $2.9\pm0.2$ for passive ones, both in the observed and simulated catalogues. We identify one of these parameters to be noise-driven, and recover that stellar mass and redshift are two key independent parameters driving the magnitudes. Our findings support the idea that wide-band photometry does not provide more than one additional independent parameter for star-forming galaxies. Although our sample is not mass-limited and may miss some passive galaxies due to our cut in SNR, our work suggests that dimensionality reduction techniques may be effectively used to explore and analyse wide-band photometric data, provided the used latent space is at least four-dimensional.</description>

      <title>The Commensal Real-time ASKAP Fast Transient incoherent-sum survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With wide-field phased array feed technology,the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) is ideally suited to search for seemingly rare radio transient sources that are difficult to discover previous-generation narrow-field telescopes. The Commensal Real-time ASKAP Fast Transient (CRAFT) Survey Science Project has developed instrumentation to continuously search for fast radio transients (duration &lt; 1 second) with ASKAP, with a particular focus on finding and localising Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). Since 2018, the CRAFT survey has been searching for FRBs and other fast transients by incoherently adding the intensities received by individual ASKAP antennas, and then correcting for the impact of frequency dispersion on these short-duration signals in the resultant incoherent sum (ICS) in real-time. This low-latency detection enables the triggering of voltage buffers, which facilitates the localisation of the transient source and the study of spectro-polarimetric properties at high time resolution. Here we report the sample of 43 FRBs discovered in this CRAFT/ICS survey to date. This includes 22 FRBs that had not previously been reported: 16 FRBs localised by ASKAP to &lt; 1 arcsec and 6 FRBs localised to ~ 10 arcmin. Of the new arcsecond-localised FRBs, we have identified and characterised host galaxies (and measured redshifts) for 11. The median of all 30 measured host redshifts from the survey to date is z=0.23. We summarise results from the searches, in particular those contributing to our understanding of the burst progenitors and emission mechanisms, and on the use of bursts as probes of intervening media. We conclude by foreshadowing future FRB surveys with ASKAP using a coherent detection system that is currently being commissioned. This will increase the burst detection rate by a factor of approximately ten and also the distance to which ASKAP can localise FRBs.</description>

      <title>Next-generation global gravitational-wave detector network: Impact of detector orientation on compact binary coalescence and stochastic gravitational-wave background searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06032v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Next-generation gravitational-wave detectors like the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, currently in their preparatory phase, have the potential to significantly improve our understanding of astrophysics, cosmology and fundamental physics. We examine how the arm orientations of the proposed detectors influence the sensitivity of a combined Einstein Telescope - Cosmic Explorer network with respect to the sensitivity to the stochastic gravitational-wave background and compact binary coalescences, where measuring both gravitational-wave polarizations is favorable. We present a method to optimize the arm orientations in the network for these two targets, and also demonstrate how to achieve a balanced configuration for both stochastic background and compact binary coalescence searches. For five specific network configurations, we explicitly compare the sensitivity to the stochastic background and binary neutron star mergers. For the latter, we conduct Bayesian parameter estimation on the extrinsic parameters of a reference binary neutron star system to assess sky localization and distance estimation capabilities. These are illustrated through efficiency curves showing the fraction of events meeting sky localization and distance uncertainty criteria as a function of redshift. Our findings suggest that globally coordinating efforts towards the next-generation gravitational-wave detector network is advantageous.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Key Features of Repeating Fast Radio Bursts with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11173v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are enigmatic high-energy events with unknown origins, which are observationally divided into two categories, i.e., repeaters and non-repeaters. However, there are potentially a number of non-repeaters that may be misclassified, as repeating bursts are missed due to the limited sensitivity and observation periods, thus misleading the investigation of their physical properties. In this work, we propose a repeater identification method based on the t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) algorithm and apply the classification to the first Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment Fast Radio Burst (CHIME/FRB) catalog. We find that the spectral morphology parameters, specifically spectral running ($r$), represent the key features for identifying repeaters from the non-repeaters. Also, the results suggest that repeaters are more biased towards narrowband emission, whereas non-repeaters are inclined toward broadband emission. We provide a list of 163 repeater candidates, 5 of which are confirmed with an updated repeater catalog from CHIME/FRB. Our findings improve our understanding of the various properties underlying repeaters and non-repeaters, as well as guidelines for future FRB detection and categorization.</description>
