      <title>Order-one explicit approximations of random periodic solutions of semi-linear SDEs with multiplicative noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to order-one explicit approximations of random periodic solutions to multiplicative noise driven stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with non-globally Lipschitz coefficients. The existence of the random periodic solution is demonstrated as the limit of the pull-back of the discretized SDE. A novel approach is introduced to analyze mean-square error bounds of the proposed scheme that does not depend on a prior high-order moment bounds of the numerical approximations. Under mild assumptions, the proposed scheme is proved to achieve an expected order-one mean square convergence in the infinite time horizon. Numerical examples are finally provided to verify the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Delocalization of One-Dimensional Random Band Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider an $ N \times N$ Hermitian one-dimensional random band matrix with band width $W &gt; N^{1 / 2 + \varepsilon} $ for any $ \varepsilon &gt; 0$. In the bulk of the spectrum and in the large $ N $ limit, we obtain the following results: (i) The semicircle law holds up to the scale $ N^{-1 + \varepsilon} $ for any $ \varepsilon &gt; 0 $. (ii) All $ L^2 $- normalized eigenvectors are delocalized, meaning their $ L^\infty$ norms are simultaneously bounded by $ N^{-\frac{1}{2} + \varepsilon} $ with overwhelming probability, for any $ \varepsilon &gt; 0 $. (iii) Quantum unique ergodicity holds in the sense that the local $ L^2 $ mass of eigenvectors becomes equidistributed with high probability.</description>

      <title>Stochastic flows for H\"older drifts and transport/continuity equations with noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove existence of a stochastic flow of diffeomorphisms generated by SDEs with drift in $L^q_t C^{0, \alpha}_x$ for any $q \in [2, \infty)$ and $\alpha \in (0, 1)$. This result is achieved using a Zvonkin-type transformation for the SDE. As a key intermediate step, well-posedness and optimal regularity for a class of parabolic PDEs related to the transformation is established. Using the existence of a differentiable stochastic flow, we prove well-posedness of $BV_\text{loc}$-solutions of stochastic transport equations and weak solutions of stochastic continuity equations with so-called transport noise and velocity fields in $L^q_t C^{0, \alpha}_x$. For both equations, solutions may fail to be unique in the deterministic setting.</description>

      <title>Nesting of double-dimer loops: local fluctuations and convergence to the nesting field of CLE(4)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the double-dimer model in the upper-half plane discretized by the square lattice with mesh size $\delta$. For each point $x$ in the upper half-plane, we consider the random variable $N_\delta(x)$ given by the number of the double-dimer loops surrounding this point. We prove that the normalized fluctuations of $N_\delta(x)$ for a fixed $x$ are asymptotically Gaussian as $\delta\to 0+$. Further, we prove that the double-dimer nesting field $N_\delta(\cdot) - \mathbb{E}\, N_\delta(\cdot)$, viewed as a random distribution in the upper half-plane, converges as $\delta\to 0+$ to the nesting field of CLE(4) constructed by Miller, Watson and Wilson.</description>

      <title>Viscosity Solutions of Fully second-order HJB Equations in the Wasserstein Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that the value functions of mean field control problems with common noise are the unique viscosity solutions to fully second-order Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations, in a Crandall-Lions-like framework. We allow the second-order derivative in measure to be state-dependent and thus infinite-dimensional, rather than derived from a finite-dimensional operator, hence the term ''fully''. Our argument leverages the construction of smooth approximations from particle systems developed by Cosso, Gozzi, Kharroubi, Pham, and Rosestolato [Trans. Amer. Math. Soc., 2023], and the compactness argument via penalization of measure moments in Soner and Yan [Appl. Math. Optim., 2024]. Our work addresses unbounded dynamics and state-dependent common noise volatility, and to our knowledge, this is the first result of its kind in the literature.</description>

      <title>Continuity of asymptotic entropy on wreath products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the continuity of asymptotic entropy as a function of the step distribution for non-degenerate probability measures with finite entropy on wreath products $ A \wr B = \bigoplus_B A \rtimes B $, where $A$ is any countable group and $B$ is a countable hyper-FC-central group that contains a finitely generated subgroup of at least cubic growth. As one step in proving the above, we show that on any countable group $G$ the probability that the $\mu$-random walk on $G$ never returns to the identity is continuous in $\mu$, for measures $\mu$ such that the semigroup generated by the support of $\mu$ contains a finitely generated subgroup of at least cubic growth. Finally, we show that among random walks on a group $G$ that admit a separable completely metrizable space $X$ as a model for their Poisson boundary, the weak continuity of the associated harmonic measures on $X$ implies the continuity of the asymptotic entropy. This result recovers the continuity of asymptotic entropy on known cases, such as Gromov hyperbolic groups and acylindrically hyperbolic groups, and extends it to new classes of groups, including linear groups and groups acting on $\mathrm{CAT}(0)$ spaces.</description>

      <title>Beyond Non-Degeneracy: Revisiting Certainty Equivalent Heuristic for Online Linear Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Certainty Equivalent heuristic (CE) is a widely-used algorithm for various dynamic resource allocation problems in OR and OM. Despite its popularity, existing theoretical guarantees of CE are limited to settings satisfying restrictive fluid regularity conditions, particularly, the non-degeneracy conditions, under the widely held belief that the violation of such conditions leads to performance deterioration and necessitates algorithmic innovation beyond CE.
  In this work, we conduct a refined performance analysis of CE within the general framework of online linear programming. We show that CE achieves uniformly near-optimal regret (up to a polylogarithmic factor in $T$) under only mild assumptions on the underlying distribution, without relying on any fluid regularity conditions. Our result implies that, contrary to prior belief, CE effectively beats the curse of degeneracy for a wide range of problem instances with continuous conditional reward distributions, highlighting the distinction of the problem's structure between discrete and non-discrete settings. Our explicit regret bound interpolates between the mild $(\log T)^2$ regime and the worst-case $\sqrt{T}$ regime with a parameter $\beta$ quantifying the minimal rate of probability accumulation of the conditional reward distributions, generalizing prior findings in the multisecretary setting.
  To achieve these results, we develop novel algorithmic analytical techniques. Drawing tools from the empirical processes theory, we establish strong concentration analysis of the solutions to random linear programs, leading to improved regret analysis under significantly relaxed assumptions. These techniques may find potential applications in broader online decision-making contexts.</description>

      <title>Decomposition of discontinuous flows of diffeomorphisms: jumpings, geometrical and topological aspects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a compact manifold equipped with a pair of complementary foliations, say horizontal $\mathcal{H}$ and vertical $\mathcal{V}$. In Melo, Morgado and Ruffino (Disc Cont Dyn Syst B, 2016, 21(9)) it is proved that if a semimartingale $X_t$ has a finite number of jumps in compact intervals then, up to a stopping time $\tau$, a stochastic flow of local diffeomorphisms in $M$ driven by $X_t$ can be decomposed into a process in the Lie group of diffeomorphisms which fix the leaves of $\mathcal{H}$ composed with a process in the Lie group of diffeomorphisms which fix the leaves of $\mathcal{V}$. Dynamics at the discontinuities of $X_t$ here are interpreted in the Marcus sense as in Kurtz, Pardoux and Protter \cite{KPP}. Here we enlarge the scope of this geometric decomposition and consider flows driven by arbitrary semimartingales with jumps and show explicit equations for each component. Our technique is based in an extension of the It\^o-Ventzel-Kunita formula for stochastic flows with jumps. Geometrical and others topological obstructions for the decomposition are also considered: e.g. an index of attainability is introduced to measure the complexity of the dynamics with respect to the pair of foliations.</description>

      <title>Kinetic Model of the Emergence of Autocatalysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a formal model of the emergence of self-constructing objects (e.g. heteropolymers with autocatalytic capability) in an open system, which don't contain such objects initially. The objects are constructed from subunits (e.g. monomers). Each object is characterized by the difference of self-instructed reproduction and decomposition rate only. This difference, divided by a common dimensional constant, is called ``productivity''. Due to external influence the productivity of each object can randomly change. The system as a whole is subjected to external limitation: the total number of the objects is conserved (e.g., by the controlled influx of monomers). We consider such process as possibly simplest example of self-organization. We obtained exact solutions of our model for several presumed mechanisms of random change of the productivity. We have shown that the probability to find self-constructing objects in the system necessarily increases, even if initially it was equal to zero.</description>

Abstract: We study the infinite-dimensional log-Sobolev inequality for spin systems on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ with interactions of power higher than quadratic. We assume that the one site measure without a boundary $e^{-\phi(x)}dx/Z$ satisfies a log-Sobolev inequality and we determine conditions so that the infinite-dimensional Gibbs measure also satisfies the inequality. As a concrete application, we prove that a certain class of nontrivial Gibbs measures with non-quadratic interaction potentials on an infinite product of Heisenberg groups satisfy the log-Sobolev inequality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01600v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the simple random walk on Galton-Watson trees with supercritical offspring distribution, conditioned on non-extinction. In case the offspring distribution has finite support, we prove an upper bound for the annealed return probability to the root which decays subexponentially in time with exponent 1/3. This exponent is optimal. Our result improves the previously known subexponential upper bound with exponent 1/5 by Piau [Ann. Probab. 26, 1016-1040 (1998)]. For offspring distributions with unbounded support but sufficiently fast decay, our method also yields improved subexponential upper bounds.</description>

      <title>Decoupled Functional Central Limit Theorems for Two-Time-Scale Stochastic Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17070v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In two-time-scale stochastic approximation (SA), two iterates are updated at different rates, governed by distinct step sizes, with each update influencing the other. Previous studies have demonstrated that the convergence rates of the error terms for these updates depend solely on their respective step sizes, a property known as decoupled convergence. However, a functional version of this decoupled convergence has not been explored. Our work fills this gap by establishing decoupled functional central limit theorems for two-time-scale SA, offering a more precise characterization of its asymptotic behavior. To achieve these results, we leverage the martingale problem approach and establish tightness as a crucial intermediate step. Furthermore, to address the interdependence between different time scales, we introduce an innovative auxiliary sequence to eliminate the primary influence of the fast-time-scale update on the slow-time-scale update.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14434v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of sampling from a target probability density function in frameworks where parallel evaluations of the log-density gradient are feasible. Focusing on smooth and strongly log-concave densities, we revisit the parallelized randomized midpoint method and investigate its properties using recently developed techniques for analyzing its sequential version. Through these techniques, we derive upper bounds on the Wasserstein distance between sampling and target densities. These bounds quantify the substantial runtime improvements achieved through parallel processing.</description>

Abstract: A fair coin is flipped $n$ times, and two finite sequences of heads and tails (words) $A$ and $B$ of the same length are given. Each time the word $A$ appears in the sequence of coin flips, Alice gets a point, and each time the word $B$ appears, Bob gets a point. Who is more likely to win? This puzzle is a slight extension of Litt's game that recently set Twitter abuzz. We show that Litt's game is fair for any value of $n$ and any two words that have the same auto-correlation structure by building up a bijection that exchanges Bob and Alice scores; the fact that the inter-correlation does not come into play in this case may come up as a surprise.</description>

      <title>Multifold Convolutions, Generating Functions and 1d Random Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22486v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider multifold convolutions of a combinatorial sequence $(a_n)_{n=0}^{\infty}$: namely, for each $k \in \N$ the $k$-fold convolution is $\mathcal{M}^{(k)}_n(\boldsymbol{a}) = \sum_{j_1+\dots+j_k=n} a_{j_1} \cdots a_{j_k}$. Let $C_n$ be the Catalan numbers, and let $B_n$ be the central binomial coefficients. Then for random Dyck paths or simple random walk bridges, the multifold convolutions give moments of returns to the origin, using the stars-and-bars problem. There are well-known explicit formulas for the multifold convolutions of $C_n$ and $B_n$. But even for combinatorial sequences $B_n^2$ and $B_n^3$, one may determine asymptotics of multifold convolutions for large $n$. We also discuss large deviations: In a second part of the paper we consider an elementary version of the circle method for calculating asymptotics using complex analysis.</description>

      <title>Deciding Bank Interest Rates -- A Major-Minor Impulse Control Mean-Field Game Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14481v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deciding bank interest rates has been a long-standing challenge in finance. It is crucial to ensure that the selected rates balance market share and profitability. However, traditional approaches typically focus on the interest rate changes of individual banks, often neglecting the interactions with other banks in the market. This work proposes a novel framework that models the interest rate problem as a major-minor mean field game within the context of an interbank game. To incorporate the complex interactions between banks, we utilize mean-field theory and employ impulsive control to model the overhead in rate adjustments. Ultimately, we solve this optimal control problem using a new deep Q-network method, which iterates the parameterized action value functions for major and minor players and updates the networks in a Fictitious Play way. Our proposed algorithm converges, offering a solution that enables the analysis of strategies for major and minor players in the market under the Nash Equilibrium.</description>
