      <title>On generalized metric structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a smooth manifold, let $TM$ be its tangent bundle and $T^{*}M$ its cotangent bundle. This paper investigates integrability conditions for generalized metrics, generalized almost para-complex structures, and generalized Hermitian structures on the generalized tangent bundle of $M$, $E=TM \oplus T^{*}M$. In particular, two notions of integrability are considered: integrability with respect to the Courant bracket and integrability with respect to the bracket induced by an affine connection. We give sufficient criteria that guarantee the integrability for the aforementioned generalized structures, formulated in terms of properties of the associated $2$-form and connection. Extensions to the pseudo-Riemannian setting and consequences for generalized Hermitian and K\"ahler structures are also discussed. We also describe relationship between generalized metrics and weak metric structures.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical Limits of Strongly Parabolic Higgs Bundles and Hyperpolygon Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Hitchin hyperk\"ahler metric on the moduli space of strongly parabolic $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\C)$-Higgs bundles on the $n$-punctured Riemann sphere and its degeneration obtained by scaling the parabolic weights $t\alpha$ as $t\to0$. Using the parabolic Deligne--Hitchin moduli space, we show that twistor lines of hyperpolygon spaces arise as limiting initial data for twistor lines at small weights, and we construct the corresponding real-analytic families of $\lambda$-connections. On suitably shrinking regions of the moduli space, the rescaled Hitchin metric converges, in the semiclassical limit, to the hyperk\"ahler metric on the hyperpolygon space $\mathcal X_\alpha$, which thus serves as the natural finite-dimensional model for the degeneration of the infinite-dimensional hyperk\"ahler reduction. Moreover, higher-order corrections of the Hitchin metric in this semiclassical regime can be expressed explicitly in terms of iterated integrals of logarithmic differentials on the punctured sphere.</description>

      <title>1-Lefschetz contact solvmanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the contact Lefschetz condition on compact contact solvmanifolds, as introduced by B.\ Cappelletti-Montano, A.\ De Nicola and I.\ Yudin. We seek to fill the gap in the literature concerning Benson-Gordon type results, characterizing $1$-Lefschetz contact solvmanifolds. We prove that the $1$-Lefschetz condition on Lie algebras is preserved via $1$-dimensional central extensions by a symplectic cocycle, thereby establishing that a unimodular symplectic Lie algebra $(\mathfrak{h}, \omega)$ is $1$-Lefschetz if and only if its contactization $(\mathfrak{g}, \eta)$ is $1$-Lefschetz. We achieve this by showing an explicit relation for the relevant cohomology degrees of $\mathfrak{h}$ and $\mathfrak{g}$. Using this, we show how the commutators $[\mathfrak{h},\mathfrak{h}]$ and $[\mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{g}]$ are related, especially when the $1$-Lefschetz condition holds. By specializing to the nilpotent setting, we prove that $1$-Lefschetz contact nilmanifolds equipped with an invariant contact form are quotients of a Heisenberg group, and deduce that there are many examples of compact $K$-contact solvmanifolds not admitting compatible Sasakian structures. We also construct examples of completely solvable $1$-Lefschetz solvmanifolds, some having the $2$-Lefschetz property and some failing it.</description>

      <title>Classification of ancient cylindrical mean curvature flows and the Mean Convex Neighborhood Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We resolve the Mean Convex Neighborhood Conjecture for mean curvature flows in all dimensions and for all types of cylindrical singularities. Specifically, we show that if the tangent flow at a singular point is a multiplicity-one cylinder, then in a neighborhood of that point the flow is mean-convex, its time-slices arise as level sets of a continuous function, and all nearby tangent flows are cylindrical. Moreover, we establish a canonical neighborhood theorem near such points, which characterizes the flow via local models. We also obtain a more uniform version of the Mean Convex Neighborhood Conjecture, which only requires closeness to a cylinder at some initial time and yields a quantitative version of this structural description.
  Our proof relies on a complete classification of ancient, asymptotically cylindrical flows. We prove that any such flow is non-collapsed, convex, rotationally symmetric, and belongs to one of three canonical families: ancient ovals, the bowl soliton, or the flying wing translating solitons. Central to our method is a refined asymptotic analysis and a novel \emph{leading mode condition,} together with a new ``induction over thresholds'' argument. In addition, our approach provides a full parameterization of the space of asymptotically cylindrical flows and gives a new proof of the existence of flying wing solitons.
  Our method is independent of prior work and, together with our prequel paper, this work is largely self-contained.</description>

      <title>Geometric Quantization by Paths Part II: The General Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Part I, we established the construction of the Prequantum Groupoid for simply connected spaces. This second part extends the theory to arbitrary connected parasymplectic diffeological spaces $(\mathrm{X}, \omega)$. We identify the obstruction to the existence of the Prequantum Groupoid as the non-additivity of the integration of the prequantum form $\mathbf{K}\omega$ on the space of loops.
  By defining a Total Group of Periods $\mathrm{P}_\omega$ directly on the space of paths, which absorbs the periods arising from the algebraic relations of the fundamental group, we construct a Prequantum Groupoid $\mathbf{T}_\omega$ with connected isotropy isomorphic to the torus of periods $\mathrm{T}_\omega = \mathbf{R}/\mathrm{P}_\omega$.
  Furthermore, we propose that this groupoid $\mathbf{T}_\omega$ constitutes the Quantum System itself. The classical space $\mathrm{X}$ is embedded as the Skeleton of units, surrounded by a Quantum Fog of non-identity morphisms. We prove that the group of automorphisms of the Quantum System is isomorphic to the group of symmetries of the Dynamical System, $\mathrm{Diff}(\mathrm{X}, \omega)$.</description>

      <title>Isocapacitary constants for the $p$-Laplacian on compact manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Steklov and Neumann isocapacitary constants for the $p$-Laplacian on compact manifolds. These constants yield two-sided bounds for the $(p,\alpha)$-Sobolev constants, which degenerate to upper and lower bounds for the first nontrivial Steklov and Neumann eigenvalues of the $p$-Laplacian when $\alpha= 1$.</description>

      <title>Curvature of left-invariant complex Finsler metric on Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $ G $ be a connected Lie group with real Lie algebra $ \mathfrak{g}$. Suppose $G$ is also a complex manifold. We obtain explicit holomorphic sectional and bisectional curvature formulas of left-invariant strongly pseudoconvex complex Finsler metrics $F$ on $G$ in terms of the complex Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}^{1,0}$; we also obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for $F$ to be a K\"ahler-Finsler metric and a weakly K\"ahler-Finsler metric, respectively. As an application, we obtain the rigidity result: if $F$ is a left-invariant strongly pseudoconvex complex Finsler metric on a complex Lie group $G$, then $F$ must be a complex Berwald metric with vanishing holomorphic bisectional curvature; moreover, $F$ is a K\"ahler-Berwald metric iff $G$ is an Abelian complex Lie group.</description>

Abstract: This paper is the second in a two-part solution to Almgren's conjecture on the existence of area-minimizing submanifolds with fractal singular sets. In part one, we construct area-minimizing submanifolds with fractal singular sets on certain special manifolds. Here we continue our work and show that area-minimizing submanifolds with fractal singular sets exist on almost any smooth manifold.</description>

      <title>A Liouville-Weierstrass correspondence for Spacelike and Timelike Minimal Surfaces in $\mathbb{L}^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a correspondence between solutions $\lambda(x,y)$ of the Liouville equation \[ \Delta \lambda = -\varepsilon e^{-4\lambda}, \] and the Weierstrass representations of spacelike ($\varepsilon = 1$) and timelike ($\varepsilon = -1$) minimal surfaces with diagonalizable Weingarten map in the three-dimensional Lorentz--Minkowski space $\mathbb{L}^3$. Using complex and paracomplex analysis, we provide a unified treatment of both causal types. We study the action of pseudo-isometries of $\mathbb{L}^3$ on minimal surfaces via M\"obius-type transformations, establishing a correspondence between these transformations and rotations in the special orthochronous Lorentz group. Furthermore, we show how local solutions of the Liouville equation determine the Gauss map and the associated Weierstrass data. Finally, we present explicit examples of spacelike and timelike minimal surfaces in $\mathbb{L}^3$ arising from solutions of the Liouville equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Chern-Weil theory for the primitive cohomology of a symplectic manifold. First, given a symplectic manifold, we review the superbundle-valued forms on this manifold and prove a primitive version of the Bianchi identity. Second, as the main result, we prove a transgression formula associated with the boundary map of the primitive cohomology. Third, as an application of the main result, we introduce the concept of primitive characteristic classes and point out a further direction.</description>

      <title>On a new filtration of the variational bicomplex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define a filtration on the variational bicomplex according to jet order. The filtration is preserved by the interior Euler operator, which is not a module homomorphism with respect to the ring of smooth functions on the jet space. However, the induced maps on the graded components of this filtration are. Furthermore, the space of functional forms in the image of the interior Euler operator inherits a filtration. Though the filtered subspaces are not submodules either, the graded components are isomorphic to linear spaces which do have module structures. This works for any fixed degree of the functional forms. In this way, the condition that a functional form vanishes can be stated concisely with a module basis. We work out explicitly two examples: one for functional forms of degree two in relation to the Helmholtz conditions and the other of arbitrary degree but with jet order one.</description>

      <title>The PDE-ODI principle and cylindrical mean curvature flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.25050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new approach for analyzing ancient solutions and singularities of mean curvature flow that are locally modeled on a cylinder. Its key ingredient is a general mechanism, called the \emph{PDE--ODI principle}, which converts a broad class of parabolic differential equations into systems of ordinary differential inequalities. This principle bypasses many delicate analytic estimates used in previous work, and yields asymptotic expansions to arbitrarily high order.
  As an application, we establish the uniqueness of the bowl soliton times a Euclidean factor among ancient, cylindrical flows with dominant linear mode. This extends previous results on this problem to the most general setting and is made possible by the stronger asymptotic control provided by our analysis. In the other case, when the quadratic mode dominates, we obtain a complete asymptotic expansion to arbitrary polynomial order, which will form the basis for a subsequent paper. Our framework also recovers and unifies several classical results. In particular, we give new proofs of the uniqueness of tangent flows (due to Colding-Minicozzi) and the rigidity of cylinders among shrinkers (due to Colding-Ilmanen-Minicozzi) by reducing both problems to a single ordinary differential inequality, without using the {\L}ojasiewicz-Simon inequality.
  Our approach is independent of prior work and the paper is largely self-contained.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the moduli space of holomorphic $GL(1|1)$ Higgs bundles over a compact Riemann surface. The supergroup $GL(1|1)$, the simplest non-trivial example beyond abelian cases, provides an ideal setting for developing supergeometric analogues of classical results in Higgs bundle theory. We derive an explicit description of the moduli space and we study the analogue of the Narasimhan-Seshadri theorem as well as the nonabelian Hodge correspondence. Furthermore, we formulate and solve the corresponding Hitchin equations, demonstrating their compatibility with fermionic contributions. As a highlight, we discuss the related Hitchin system on $\mathbb{P}^1$ and its integrability.</description>

      <title>Instanton 2-torsion and fibered knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the unreduced singular instanton homology $I^\sharp(Y,K;\mathbb{Z})$ has $2$-torsion for any null-homologous fibered knot $K$ of genus $g&gt;0$ in a closed $3$-manifold $Y$ except for $\#^{2g}S^1\times S^2$. The main technical result is a formula of $I^\sharp(Y,K;\mathbb{C})$ via sutured instanton theory, by which we can compare the dimensions of $I^\sharp(Y,K;\mathbb{F}_2)$ and $I^\sharp(Y,K;\mathbb{C})$. As a byproduct, we show that $I^\sharp(S^3,K;\mathbb{C})$ for a knot $K\subset S^3$ admitting lens space surgeries is determined by the Alexander polynomial, while some special cases of torus knots have been previously studied by many people. Another byproduct is that the next-to-top Alexander grading summand of instanton knot homology $KHI(S^3,K,g(K)-1)$ is non-vanishing when $K$ has unknotting number one, which generalizes the Baldwin--Sivek's result in the fibered case. Finally, we discuss the relation to the Heegaard Floer theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a compact complex manifold of dimension $n$ and let $m$ be a positive integer with $m\leq n$. Assume that $X$ admits a K\"ahler metric $\omega$ and a weakly positive, $\partial\bar\partial$-closed, smooth $(n-m,\,n-m)$-form $\Omega$. We introduce the notions of $(\omega,\,\Omega)$-Hermite-Einstein holomorphic vector bundles and $(\omega,\,\Omega)$(-semi)-stable coherent sheaves on $X$ by generalising the classical definitions depending only on $\omega$. We then prove that the $(\omega,\,\Omega)$-Hermite-Einstein condition implies the $(\omega,\,\Omega)$-semi-stability of a holomorphic vector bundle and its splitting into $(\omega,\,\Omega)$-stable subbundles. This extends a classical result by Kobayashi and L\"ubke to our generalised setting.</description>

      <title>Manifold classification from the descriptive viewpoint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider classification problems for manifolds and discrete subgroups of Lie groups from a descriptive set-theoretic point of view. This work is largely foundational in conception and character, recording both a framework for general study and Borel complexity computations for some of the most fundamental classes of manifolds. We show, for example, that for all $n\geq 0$, the homeomorphism problem for compact topological $n$-manifolds is Borel equivalent to the relation $=_{\mathbb{N}}$ of equality on the natural numbers, while the homeomorphism problem for noncompact topological $2$-manifolds is of maximal complexity among equivalence relations classifiable by countable structures. A nontrivial step in the latter consists of proving Borel measurable formulations of the Jordan--Schoenflies and surface triangulation theorems. Turning our attention to groups and geometric structures, we show, strengthening results of Stuck--Zimmer and Andretta--Camerlo--Hjorth, that the conjugacy relation on discrete subgroups of any noncompact semisimple Lie group is essentially countable universal. So too, as a corollary, is the isometry relation for complete hyperbolic $n$-manifolds for any $n\geq 2$, generalizing a result of Hjorth--Kechris. We then show that the isometry relation for complete hyperbolic $n$-manifolds with finitely generated fundamental group is, in contrast, Borel equivalent to the equality relation $=_{\mathbb{R}}$ on the real numbers when $n=2$, but that it is not concretely classifiable when $n=3$; thus there exists no Borel assignment of numerical complete invariants to finitely generated Kleinian groups up to conjugacy. We close with a survey of the most immediate open questions.</description>

      <title>Real Riemann Surfaces: Smooth and Discrete</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.25022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a discrete theory of real Riemann surfaces based on quadrilateral cellular decompositions (quad-graphs) and a linear discretization of the Cauchy-Riemann equations. We construct a discrete analogue of an antiholomorphic involution and classify the topological types of discrete real Riemann surfaces, recovering the classical results on the number of real ovals and the separation of the surface.
  Central to our approach is the construction of a symplectic homology basis adapted to the discrete involution. Using this basis, we prove that the discrete period matrix admits the same canonical decomposition $\Pi = \frac{1}{2} H + i T$ as in the smooth setting, where $H$ encodes the topological type and $T$ is purely imaginary. This structural result bridges the gap between combinatorial models and the classical theory of real algebraic curves.</description>

      <title>Partition functions of determinantal point processes on polarized K\"ahler manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01524v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the full asymptotic expansion of the partition functions of determinantal point processes defined on a polarized K\"ahler manifold. We show that the coefficients of the expansion are given by geometric functionals on K\"ahler metrics satisfying the cocycle identity, whose first variations can be expressed through the TYZ expansion coefficients of the Bergman kernel. In particular, these functionals naturally generalize the Mabuchi functional in K\"ahler geometry and the Liouville functional on Riemann surfaces. We further show that Futaki-type holomorphic invariants obstruct the existence of critical points of these geometric functionals, extending Lu's formula. We also verify that certain formulas remain valid up to the third coefficient without assuming polarization. Finally, we discuss the relation of our results to the quantum Hall effect (QHE), where the determinantal point process provides a microscopic model. In particular, we recover the higher-dimensional effective Chern-Simons actions derived in the physics literature and confirm a conjecture of Klevtsov on the form of the partition function asymptotics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, inextensible flows of curves in four-dimensional pseudo-Galilean space are expressed, and the necessary and sufficient conditions of these curve flows are given as partial differential equations. Also, the directional derivatives are defined in accordance with the Serret-Frenet frame in G41, the extended Serret-Frenet relations are expressed by using Frenet formulas in G41. Furthermore, the bending elastic energy functions are expressed for the same particle according to curve a(s,t).</description>

      <title>Bochner's technique in Einstein's non-symmetric geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A. Einstein considered a manifold with a non-symmetric (0,2)-tensor $G=g+F$, where $g$ is a Riemannian metric and $F\ne0$, and a connection $\nabla$ with torsion $T$ such that $(\nabla_X G)(Y,Z)=-G(T(X,Y),Z)$. Guided by the almost Lie algebroid construction on a vector bundle, we define the basic concepts of Bochner's technique for Einstein's non-symmetric geometry, give a clear example of the Einstein's connection $\nabla$, prove Weitzenb\"{o}ck type decomposition formula and obtain vanishing results about the null space of the Bochner and Hodge type Laplacians.</description>

      <title>Contact triad connection of contact manifolds in almost contact moving frame</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The notion of \emph{contact triad connection} on contact triads $(Q,\lambda,J_\xi)$ was introduced by Wang and the present author in early 2010's from scratch as the contact analog to the canonical connection of an almost K\"ahler manifolds. The connection facilitates the study of analysis of the contact instanton equation which ranges from local elliptic priori estimates, for both the interior [OW2,OW3] and the boundary [OY], to the generic perturbation theory of the asymptotic operators [KO], which also encompasses the case of pseudoholomorphic curves on noncompact symplectic manifolds with cylindrical ends [OK]. The main purpose of the present paper is to give a simpler and more canonical construction of the contact triad connection by first giving its characterization in terms of the associated \emph{almost contact structure} and then providing its construction using the almost contact moving frame in the framework of contact geometry.</description>

Abstract: We prove vanishing results for Witten genera of string generalized complete intersections in homogeneous $\text{Spin}^c$-manifolds and in other $\text{Spin}^c$-manifolds with Lie group actions. By applying these results to Fano manifolds with second Betti number equal to one we get new evidence for a conjecture of Stolz.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $(M,g)$ be a closed Riemannian manifold of dimension at least $3$. Let $S$ be the union of the focal submanifolds of an isoparametric function on $(M,g)$. In this article we address the existence of solutions of the Hardy-Sobolev type equation $\Delta_g u+K(x)u=\frac{u^{q-1}}{\left(d_{S}(x)\right)^s}$, where $d_{S}(x)$ is the distance from $x$ to $S$ and $q&gt;2$. In particular, we will prove the existence of infinite sign-changing solutions to the equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13594v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider sets of fixed CP, multilinear, and TT rank tensors, and derive conditions for when (the smooth parts of) these sets are smooth homogeneous manifolds. For CP and TT ranks, the conditions are essentially that the rank is sufficiently low. These homogeneous structures are then used to derive Riemannian metrics whose geodesics are both complete and efficient to compute.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15464v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We solve the capillary $L_p$-Christoffel--Minkowski problem in the half-space for $1&lt;p&lt;k+1$ in the class of even hypersurfaces. A crucial ingredient is a non-collapsing estimate that yields lower bounds for both the height and the capillary support function. Our result extends the capillary Christoffel--Minkowski existence result of \cite{HIS25}.</description>
