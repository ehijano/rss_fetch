      <title>Evidence for SiO cloud nucleation in the rogue planet PSO J318</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicate clouds are known to significantly impact the spectra of late L-type brown dwarfs, with observable absorption features at ~ 10 micron. JWST has reopened our window to the mid-infrared with unprecedented sensitivity, bringing the characterization of silicates into focus again. Using JWST, we characterize the planetary-mass brown dwarf PSO J318.5338-22.8603, concentrating on any silicate cloud absorption the object may exhibit. PSO J318's spectrum is extremely red, and its flux is variable, both of which are likely hallmarks of cloud absorption. We present JWST NIRSpec PRISM, G395H, and MIRI MRS observations from 1-18 micron. We introduce a method based on PSO J318's brightness temperature to generate a list of cloud species that are likely present in its atmosphere. We then test for their presence with petitRADTRANS retrievals. Using retrievals and grids from various climate models, we derive bulk parameters from PSO J318's spectra, which are mutually compatible. Our retrieval results point to a solar to slightly super-solar atmospheric C/O, a slightly super-solar metallicity, and a 12C/13C below ISM values. The atmospheric gravity proves difficult to constrain for both retrievals and grid models. Retrievals describing the flux of PSO J318 by mixing two 1-D models (``two-column models'') appear favored over single-column models; this is consistent with PSO J318's variability. The JWST spectra also reveal a pronounced absorption feature at 10 micron. This absorption is best reproduced by introducing a high-altitude cloud layer of small (&lt;0.1 micron), amorphous SiO grains. The retrieved particle size and location of the cloud is consistent with SiO condensing as cloud seeding nuclei. High-altitude clouds comprised of small SiO particles have been suggested in previous studies, therefore the SiO nucleation we potentially observe in PSO J318 could be a more wide-spread phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Detection of CO$_2$, CO, and H$_2$O in the atmosphere of the warm sub-Saturn HAT-P-12b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chemical composition of warm gas giant exoplanet atmospheres (with Teq &lt; 1000 K) is not well known due to the lack of observational constraints. HAT-P-12 b is a warm, sub-Saturn-mass transiting exoplanet that is ideal for transmission spectroscopy. One transit of HAT-P-12 b was observed with JWST NIRSpec in the 2.87-5.10 $\mu$m range with a resolving power of $\sim$1000. The JWST data are combined with archival observations from HST WFC3 covering the 1.1-1.7 $\mu$m range. The data are analysed using two data reduction pipelines and two atmospheric retrieval tools. Atmospheric simulations using chemical forward models are performed. CO2, CO, and H2O are detected at 12.2, 4.1, and 6.0 $\sigma$ confidence, respectively. Their volume mixing ratios are consistent with an atmosphere of $\sim$10 times solar metallicity and production of CO2 by photochemistry. CH4 is not detected and seems to be lacking, which could be due to a high intrinsic temperature with strong vertical mixing or other phenomena. SO2 is also not detected and its production seems limited by low upper atmospheric temperatures ($\sim$500 K at $P&lt;10^{-3}$ bar inferred from 1D retrievals), insufficient to produce it in detectable quantities ($\gtrsim$ 800 K required according to photochemical models). Retrievals indicate the presence of clouds between $10^{-1}$ and $10^{-3}$ bar. This study points towards an atmosphere for HAT-P-12 b that could be enriched in carbon and oxygen with respect to its host star. When including the production of CO2 via photochemistry, an atmospheric metallicity that is close to Saturn's can explain the observations. Metallicities inferred for other gas giant exoplanets based on their CO2 mixing ratios may need to account for its photochemical production pathways. This may impact studies on mass-metallicity trends and links between exoplanet atmospheres, interiors, and formation history.</description>

      <title>Dynamical regimes of small bodies perturbed by an eccentric giant planet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of small bodies perturbed by an eccentric planet was done mostly under the assumption of well separated orbits using analytical approximations appropriate for the hierarchical case. In this work we study the dynamics of small bodies in a wide range of eccentricities and inclinations perturbed by a giant planet with e_p=0.4, in the non-hierarchical case. We consider small bodies both interior and exterior to the planet. We apply semi-analytical models for the study of resonances and the properties of the secular disturbing function. We perform a frequency analysis of numerical integration of the exact equations of motion to obtain the proper frequencies and corresponding dynamical secular paths. We study the dependence of proper frequencies with the initial mutual inclination and we find a critical inclination around 30 degrees for which the pericenter proper frequency vanishes giving rise to the increase of small bodies eccentricities followed by unstable dynamics. This happens for both interior and exterior small bodies and constitutes a stability barrier in the inclination. For greater inclinations the ZLK mechanism dominates both populations. By means of numerical integration of thousands of small bodies we reproduce the well known pericenter shepherding, but for the exterior populations we also find concentrations of the longitude of the ascending node in the direction of the planetary line of apsides.</description>

      <title>Silicate clouds and a circumplanetary disk in the YSES-1 exoplanet system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Young exoplanets provide a critical link between understanding planet formation and atmospheric evolution. Direct imaging spectroscopy allows us to infer the properties of young, wide orbit, giant planets with high signal-to-noise. This allows us to compare this young population to exoplanets characterized with transmission spectroscopy, which has indirectly revealed the presence of clouds, photochemistry, and a diversity of atmospheric compositions. Direct detections have also been made for brown dwarfs, but direct studies of young giant planets in the mid-infrared were not possible prior to JWST. With two exoplanets around a solar type star, the YSES-1 system is an ideal laboratory for studying this early phase of exoplanet evolution. We report the first direct observations of silicate clouds in the atmosphere of the exoplanet YSES-1 c through its 9-11 micron absorption feature, and the first circumplanetary disk silicate emission around its sibling planet, YSES-1 b. The clouds of YSES-1 c are composed of either amorphous iron-enriched pyroxene or a combination of amorphous MgSiO3 and Mg2SiO4, with particle sizes of less than or equal to 0.1 micron at 1 millibar of pressure. We attribute the emission from the disk around YSES-1 b to be from submicron olivine dust grains, which may have formed through collisions of planet-forming bodies in the disk.</description>

      <title>The GAPS Programme at TNG LXVIII. Characterization of the outer substellar companion around HD 72659 with a multi-technique approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Before discovering the first exoplanets, the Radial Velocity (RV) method had been used for decades to discover binary stars. Despite significant advancements in this technique, it is limited by the intrinsic mass-inclination degeneracy that can be broken when combining RVs with astrometry, which allows us to determine the orbital inclination, or direct imaging, from which we can estimate the true mass of the target. HD 72659 is a solar analog known to host a gas giant on a $\sim 10$-yr orbit and a massive outer companion. This work aims to confirm HD 72659 c, which was recently announced using data from HIRES and HARPS spectrographs in combination with Gaia's astrometric data. We monitored HD 72659 with HARPS-N in the framework of the GAPS project since 2012. We now combined our 91 spectra with literature data and Gaia DR3 high-precision astrometry to constrain the mass and the orbit of this object ($M_{\rm c} \sim 19$ $M_{\rm J}$, $a \sim 21$ au) that falls in the Brown Dwarf desert. Moreover, we analyzed our high-resolution imaging observation taken with SPHERE, but since the target was not detected, we could only derive upper limits on its mass. We characterize the orbital parameters of HD 72659 c, confirming the literature mass of this object but finding a period twice as high as previously reported, and we also refine the parameters of planet b with reduced uncertainties compared to previous works. Finally, we analyze and discuss the dynamic configuration of this system, finding that the Kozai-Lidov mechanism may be at work.</description>

      <title>Orbit dissimilarity criteria in meteor showers: a comparative review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In meteor science, the identification of meteor showers is a crucial and complex problem. The most common method is to perform a systematic search of a database of observed orbits using an orbit dissimilarity criterion (D-criterion) and an algorithm. D-criteria compare the result of an orbit dissimilarity function (D-function) and a threshold. These D-functions associate one value to two meteoroids orbits. If this value is lower than the threshold, the meteoroids' orbits are considered similar. Group of meteors are thus formed. However, not all D-criteria have been evaluated, and their high number makes it hard to know which should be prioritised. This paper presents a review of each D-function, the tests they passed, the threshold choice, and the algorithms they are used with. We show what methods are currently used in the search for meteor showers, presenting statistics based on papers justifying the existence of established meteor showers. We review D-functions from eight different papers. We describe how thresholds and clustering algorithms are usually chosen. We also analyse tests that were performed on D-criteria. We discover that most of those criteria were not properly tested, and that some have been criticised for their theoretical background. Thus, we recommend performing a post-search analysis of the groups found, both in a statistical sense (to make sure the groups formed could not have been formed randomly) and an orbital dynamics sense (to check whether the group could indeed come from a singular parent body), to present the findings as potential meteor showers.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Influence of Asymmetric Errors on Retrievals of Exoplanet Transmission Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In studies of exoplanet atmospheres using transmission spectroscopy, Bayesian retrievals are the most popular form of analysis. In these procedures it is common to adopt a Gaussian likelihood. However, this implicitly assumes that the upper and lower error bars on the spectral points are equal. With recent observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) offering higher quality of data, it is worth revisiting this assumption to understand the impact that an asymmetry between the error bars may have on retrieved parameters. In this study, we challenge the approximation by comparing retrievals using a symmetric, Gaussian likelihood, and an asymmetric, split normal likelihood. We find that the influence of this assumption is minimal at the scales of asymmetry observed in JWST observations of WASP-39 b (with a maximum asymmetry of 77%) but we show that it would become critical with greater levels of asymmetry (e.g. an average asymmetry of 80%). Furthermore, we stress the importance of the shape of the asymmetric distribution and the difficulty in fitting this distribution from three summary statistics (the median and an upper and lower bound on the transit depth). An asymmetric likelihood sampler will incorrectly predict parameters if the shape of the likelihood does not match that of the underlying noise distribution even when the levels of asymmetry are equal in both. Overall, we find that it is safe to use the Gaussian likelihood assumption for current datasets but it is worth considering the potential bias if greater asymmetries are observed.</description>

      <title>The GAPS Programme at TNG. LXIX.The Dayside of WASP-76b revealed by GIANO-B, HARPS-N and ESPRESSO: Evidence for Three-Dimensional Atmospheric Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of the atmosphere of ultra-hot Jupiters (UHJs) with equilibrium temperature $\geq$2000 K provides valuable insights into atmospheric physics under such extreme conditions. We aim to characterise the dayside thermal spectrum of the UHJ WASP-76b and investigate its properties. We analysed data gathered with three high-resolution spectrographs, specifically two nights with simultaneous observations of HARPS-N and GIANO-B, and four nights of publicly available ESPRESSO optical spectra. We observed the planet's dayside covering orbital phases between quadratures (0.25 &lt; $\phi$ &lt; 0.75). We performed a homogeneous analysis of the GIANO-B, HARPS-N and ESPRESSO data and co-added the signal of thousands of planetary lines through cross-correlation with simulated spectra of the planetary atmosphere. We report the detection of CO in the dayside atmosphere of WASP-76b with a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of 10.4 in the GIANO-B spectra. In addition, we detect Fe I in both the HARPS-N and ESPRESSO datasets, with S/N of 3.5 and 6.2, respectively. A signal from Fe I is also identified in one of the two GIANO-B observations, with a S/N of 4.0. Interestingly, a qualitatively similar pattern - with a weaker detection in one epoch compared to the other - is also observed in the two HARPS-N nights. The GIANO-B results are therefore consistent with those obtained with HARPS-N. Finally, we compared our strongest detections of CO (GIANO-B) and Fe I (ESPRESSO), with predictions from Global Circulation Models (GCMs). Both cross-correlation and likelihood analyses favour the GCM that includes atmospheric dynamics over a static (no-dynamics) model when applied to the ESPRESSO data. This study adds to the growing body of literature employing GCMs to interpret high-resolution spectroscopic measurements of exoplanet atmospheres.</description>

      <title>Potential series expansion method applied in Analytical Modeling of Gravitational field of Irregularly Shaped Celestial Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aims to establish an analytical model that reproduces the gravitational field around non-spherical bodies with constant density. Due to the non-spherical geometry of such bodies, their gravitational potential is disturbed relative to a central field. By considering the body as a polyhedron and decomposing it into tetrahedral elements, we use the Series Potential Expansion Method (PSEM) to approximate the total potential by summing the potentials of each tetrahedron. While this model does not offer higher accuracy than the classical polyhedral approach, it achieves relative errors below 0.1\% for points outside the body when developed to higher orders (e.g., orders 11 and 12), and significantly reduces execution time. To validate this approach, we apply our model to asteroids (87) Sylvia, (101955) Bennu, (99942) Apophis, and (25143) Itokawa. We determine equilibrium points, analyze stability, investigate zero-velocity planes, and calculate the relative errors between the gravitational field modeled by PSEM and the results obtained using both the classical polyhedral method by Tsoulis and Petrovic and the mass concentration method. Our results highlight the computational efficiency of PSEM in modeling the gravitational potential of irregularly shaped bodies. This efficiency stems from expressing the gravitational potential through a homogeneous analytical function that is easy to manipulate algebraically, enabling explicit determination of the acceleration vector. Our model provides a robust framework for more complex analyses, such as studying periodic orbits around non-spherical celestial bodies, assessing their stability, and planning the smooth landing trajectories of spacecraft.</description>

      <title>Experimental Validation for Serial Conjunction of Diffraction-limited Coronagraph and Fiber Nuller</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the experimental results of a serially conjoined nuller system, which combines a type of Lyot coronagraph with a fiber nuller. The utilized one-dimensional diffraction-limited coronagraph (1DDLC) has promising features (binary nuller, small inner working angles (IWAs)). Still, it has a performance that is highly sensitive to spectral bandwidth and tilt aberrations. Nevertheless, for the 1DDLC, wavelengths other than the design wavelength introduce leaks with a flat wavefront on the Lyot-stop plane, preserving the same complex amplitude profile as an on-axis point source. This property supports the concept of serially coupling additional nullers after the 1DDLC. The fiber-nulling unit employs a Lyot-plane mask, relay optics (1/100$\times$), and a single-mode fiber. The Lyot-plane mask splits the incoming beam -- comprising leakage from the 1DDLC and planetary light -- into four beams so that, in principle, the on-axis single-mode fiber does not couple with the on-axis leak from the 1DDLC. For the wavelength 6-\% less than the coronagraph's design-center wavelength, we confirmed the contrast mitigation ability of $3.5 \times 10^{-5}$, which is about 1/20 times the value of the case with only 1DDLC. The resultant value approximately reaches the 1DDLC's contrast mitigation ability at the design center wavelength demonstrated in the previous study, suggesting that the combined system works robustly against the broad spectral bandwidth. Future work needs to address the demonstration of the anticipated robustness for the contrast-mitigation level lower than about $10^{-5}$.</description>

      <title>NASA Exoplanet Exploration Program (ExEP) Science Gap List</title>

Abstract: The Exoplanet Exploration Program (ExEP) is chartered by the NASA Astrophysics Division to carry out science, research, and technology tasks that advance NASA's science goals for exoplanets. The ExEP Science Gap List is a compilation of "science gaps", defined as either: 1) The difference between knowledge needed to define requirements for specified future NASA exoplanet missions and the current state of the art, or 2) Knowledge which is needed to enhance the exoplanet science return of current and future NASA exoplanet missions.

      <title>ARVE: Analyzing Radial Velocity Elements. I. The Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. In order to overcome the radial velocity (RV) precision barrier imposed by stellar variability, there has been a surge of software aimed at simulating and modeling these activity patterns. Aims. We present Analyzing Radial Velocity Elements (ARVE), a Python-based software which enables RV extraction using various customizable techniques, and subsequent analysis of the stellar and planetary signals present in the RVs. One of ARVE's unique features is its library of pre-computed auxiliary data, which includes synthetic spectra and spectral line masks, allowing the code to efficiently perform certain routines with minimal input from the user. Methods. ARVE is a class-based and modular code in which its functionalities are divided between four subclasses: functions, which handles general functions utilized by the other subclasses; data, which reads the input data, loads the auxiliary data, and extracts RVs from input high-resolution spectra; star, which characterizes the stellar activity components present in the RV time series; and planets, which performs fits of Keplerian signals in the data and offers injection-recovery tests of fictitious planets to determine the detection limits. Results. Demonstrations of ARVE are performed on three years of HARPS-N solar data. We show the evolution of granulation and supergranulation characteristic timescales with activity level, and we investigate the differences in planetary period-mass detection limits when extracting RVs with different methods. Conclusions. As stellar activity mitigation techniques grow more diverse, we foresee that a tool like ARVE could greatly benefit the community by offering a user-friendly and multi-functional approach to extract and analyze RV time series. With its current code structure, expanded functionality and increased compatibility with more spectrographs should be easily addable to future versions of ARVE.</description>

      <title>Different Inhomogeneous Evolutionary Histories for Uranus and Neptune</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13857v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present updated non-adiabatic and inhomogeneous evolution models for Uranus and Neptune, employing an interior composition of methane, ammonia, water, and rocks. Following formation trends of the gas giants, Uranus and Neptune formation models are applied, where both planets begin with layers stable to convection. Both planets are subject to convective mixing throughout their evolution. Consistent with past work on this subject, the interior heat of Uranus evolution models is preserved by the stability of an outer composition gradient at lower initial entropy, where convective mixing is inhibited over evolutionary timescales. In contrast, if Neptune's initial entropy is enough to convectively mix its envelope, it undergoes homogenization and adiabatic cooling of the outer 40\% of its envelope. The subsequent release of internal energy during Neptune's evolution, driven by the convective instability of its primordial outer compositional gradient, accounts for its higher luminosity relative to Uranus. This work proposes that the observed luminosity differences between Uranus and Neptune could be explained by the convective stability of their outer envelopes. The extensive convective mixing in Neptune can lead to a higher metallicity in its outer region compared to Uranus, a feature seen in atmospheric measurements and shown in past interior models of Neptune. Due to Neptune's more pronounced cooling, our models predict favorable conditions for hydrogen-water immiscibility in its envelope.</description>

      <title>Assessing interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS with the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias and the Two-meter Twin Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12922v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. Theories of the formation and evolution of small bodies in planetary systems predict that they may escape into interstellar space at any time. After having characterized just two such interlopers -1I/2017 U1 (Oumuamua) and 2I/Borisov more questions were raised than answered. Assessing the recently discovered interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS will only broaden our understanding of this complex topic.
  Aims. Here, we investigate the spectral, cometary, and rotational properties of 3I/ATLAS as well as its dynamical context.
  Methods. We identified the spectral type of 3I/ATLAS from the visible reflectance spectrum and used photometric observations to derive its level of activity and rotational properties. Observational data were obtained with the OSIRIS camera spectrograph at the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias and the Two-meter Twin Telescope. We used N-body simulations and statistical analyses of Gaia DR3 data to investigate the origin of 3I/ATLAS and its Galactic background.
  Results. Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has a visible spectrum slightly redder than those of D-type asteroids, 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, with a spectral slope of 18.3%/1000 A in the 4000-9000 A range, which is similar to those of TNOs and Centaurs. It has a conspicuous coma and its rotation period is 16.79 h. The heliocentric components of its Galactic velocity were (U, V, W) = (-51.233, -19.456, 18.930) km/s with a radiant in Sagittarius. The analysis of a sample of kinematic analogs of 3I/ATLAS extracted from Gaia DR3 suggests that its parent system is part of the Galactic thin disk and includes a solar-like star with slightly sub-solar metallicity.</description>
