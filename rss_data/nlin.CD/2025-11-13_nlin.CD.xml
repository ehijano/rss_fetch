      <title>When is a System Discoverable from Data? Discovery Requires Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The deep learning revolution has spurred a rise in advances of using AI in sciences. Within physical sciences the main focus has been on discovery of dynamical systems from observational data. Yet the reliability of learned surrogates and symbolic models is often undermined by the fundamental problem of non-uniqueness. The resulting models may fit the available data perfectly, but lack genuine predictive power. This raises the question: under what conditions can the systems governing equations be uniquely identified from a finite set of observations? We show, counter-intuitively, that chaos, typically associated with unpredictability, is crucial for ensuring a system is discoverable in the space of continuous or analytic functions. The prevalence of chaotic systems in benchmark datasets may have inadvertently obscured this fundamental limitation.
  More concretely, we show that systems chaotic on their entire domain are discoverable from a single trajectory within the space of continuous functions, and systems chaotic on a strange attractor are analytically discoverable under a geometric condition on the attractor. As a consequence, we demonstrate for the first time that the classical Lorenz system is analytically discoverable. Moreover, we establish that analytic discoverability is impossible in the presence of first integrals, common in real-world systems. These findings help explain the success of data-driven methods in inherently chaotic domains like weather forecasting, while revealing a significant challenge for engineering applications like digital twins, where stable, predictable behavior is desired. For these non-chaotic systems, we find that while trajectory data alone is insufficient, certain prior physical knowledge can help ensure discoverability. These findings warrant a critical re-evaluation of the fundamental assumptions underpinning purely data-driven discovery.</description>

      <title>Mean-field theory of the DNLS equation at positive and negative absolute temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Discrete Non Linear Schr\"odinger (DNLS) model, due to the existence of two conserved quantities, displays an equilibrium transition between a homogeneous phase at positive absolute temperature and a localized phase at negative absolute temperature. Here, we provide a mean-field theory of DNLS and show that this approximation is semi-quantitatively correct in the whole phase diagram, becoming exact in proximity of the transition. Our mean-field theory shows that the passage from stable positive-temperature to metastable negative-temperature states is smooth.</description>

      <title>From chaotic itinerancy to intermittent synchronization in complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although synchronization has been extensively studied, important processes underlying its emergence have remained hidden by the use of global order parameters. Here, we uncover how the route unfolds through a sequential transition between two well-known but previously unconnected phenomena: chaotic itinerancy (CI) and intermittent synchronization (IS). Using a new symbolic dynamics, we show that CI emerges as a collective yet unsynchronized exploration of different domains of the high-dimensional attractor, whose dimension is reduced as the coupling increases, ultimately collapsing back into the reference chaotic attractor of an individual unit. At this stage, the IS can emerge as irregular alternations between synchronous and asynchronous phases. The two phenomena are therefore mutually exclusive, each dominating a distinct coupling interval and governed by different mechanisms. Network structural heterogeneity enhances itinerant behavior since access to different domains of the attractor depends on the nodes' topological roles. The CI--IS crossover occurs within a consistent coupling interval across models and topologies. Experiments on electronic oscillator networks confirm this two-step process, establishing a unified framework for the route to synchronization in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Fractal geometry predicts dynamic differences in structural and functional connectomes</title>

Abstract: Understanding the intricate architecture of brain networks and its connection to brain function is essential for deciphering the underlying principles of cognition and disease. While traditional graph-theoretical measures have been widely used to characterize these networks, they often fail to fully capture the emergent properties of large-scale neural dynamics. Here, we introduce an alternative approach to quantify brain networks that is rooted in complex dynamics, fractal geometry, and asymptotic analysis. We apply these concepts to brain connectomes and demonstrate how quadratic iterations and geometric properties of Mandelbrot-like sets can provide novel insights into structural and functional network dynamics. Our findings reveal fundamental distinctions between structural (positive) and functional (signed) connectomes, such as the shift of cusp orientation and the variability in equi-M set geometry. Notably, structural connectomes exhibit more robust, predictable features, while functional connectomes show increased variability for non-trivial tasks. We further demonstrate that traditional graph-theoretical measures, when applied separately to the positive and negative sub-networks of functional connectomes, fail to fully capture their dynamic complexity. Instead, size and shape-based invariants of the equi-M set effectively differentiate between rest and emotional task states, which highlights their potential as superior markers of emergent network dynamics. These results suggest that incorporating fractal-based methods into network neuroscience provides a powerful tool for understanding how information flows in natural systems beyond static connectivity measures, while maintaining their simplicity.</description>

      <title>Probing forced responses and causality in data-driven climate emulators: conceptual limitations and the role of reduced-order models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22552</link>

Abstract: A central challenge in climate science and applied mathematics is developing data-driven models of multiscale systems that capture both stationary statistics and responses to external perturbations. Current neural climate emulators aim to resolve the atmosphere-ocean system in all its complexity but often struggle to reproduce forced responses, limiting their use in causal studies such as Green's function experiments. To investigate the origin of these limitations, we first examine a simplified dynamical system that retains key features of climate variability. We interpret the results through linear response theory, providing a rigorous framework to evaluate neural models beyond stationary statistics and probe causal mechanisms. We argue that the ability of multiscale systems' emulators to reproduce perturbed statistics depends critically on (i) identifying an appropriate coarse-grained representation and (ii) careful parameterizations of unresolved processes. For low-frequency climate dynamics, these insights highlight reduced-order models, tailored to specific processes and scales, as valuable alternatives to general-purpose emulators. We next consider a real-world application, developing a neural model to investigate the joint variability of the surface temperature field and radiative fluxes. The model infers a multiplicative noise process directly from data, largely reproduces the system's probability distribution, and enables causal studies through forced responses. We discuss its limitations and outline directions for future work. These results expose key challenges in data-driven modeling of multiscale physical systems and underscore the value of coarse-grained, stochastic approaches, with response theory as a principled framework to guide model design.</description>

      <title>Superuniversal Statistics with Topological Origins for non-Hermitian Scattering Singularities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14373v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vortex singularities in speckle patterns formed from random superpositions of waves are an inevitable consequence of destructive interference and are consequently generic and ubiquitous. Singularities are topologically stable, meaning they persist under small perturbations and can only be removed via pairwise annihilation. They have applications including sensing, imaging and energy transfer in multiple fields such as optics, acoustics, and elastic or fluid waves. We generalize the concept of speckle patterns to arbitrary parameter spaces and any complex scalar function that describes wave phenomena involving complicated scattering. In scattering systems specifically, we are often concerned with singularities associated with complex zeros of various functions of the scattering matrix S, such as Coherent Perfect Absorption, Reflectionless Scattering Modes, Transmissionless Scattering Modes, and Exceptional Points. Experimentally, we find that all singularities share a universal statistical property: any quantity that diverges as a simple pole at a singularity has a probability distribution function with a -3 power law tail. The tail of the distribution provides an estimate for the likelihood of finding a given singularity in a generic system. We use these universal statistical results to determine that homogeneous system loss is the most important parameter determining singularity density in a given parameter space of an absorptive scattering system. Finally, we discuss events where distinct singularities coincide in parameter space, which result in higher order singularities that are not topologically protected, and we do not find universal statistical properties for them. We support our empirical results from microwave experiments with Random Matrix Theory simulations and conclude that the statistical results presented hold for all generic non-Hermitian scattering systems.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Aggregation of Phase Elements on the Unit Circle under Parametric External Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19053v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate nonlinear aggregation dynamics of phase elements distributed on the unit circle under parametrically modulated external fields. Our model, inspired by flaky particle rotation in fluids, employs the equation ${d\alpha/dt} = \lambda(t)\sin 2(\alpha - \phi(t))$ with $\lambda(t) = \cos(\omega_1 t)$ and $\phi(t) = \omega_2 t$, representing a switching rotating attractive device where the attractive strength oscillates while the attractive point rotates at independent frequencies. Through numerical simulations and analytical approaches, we discover Arnold tongue-like structures in parameter space $(\omega_1, \omega_2)$, where initially isotropic phase distributions aggregate into highly anisotropic states. Complete aggregation occurs within wedge-shaped stability regions radiating from bifurcation points, forming band structures with characteristic slope relationships. The dynamics exhibit rich nonlinear behavior including attractors, limit cycles, and quasi-periodic trajectories in reduced indicator space spanned by aggregation degree ($I$), field-alignment measure ($O$), and temporal variation ($P$). Our findings reveal fundamental principles governing collective phase dynamics under competing temporal modulations, with potential applications spanning from biological synchronization to socio-economic dynamics and controllable collective systems.</description>
