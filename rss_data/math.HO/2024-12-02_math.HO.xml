      <title>An Elementary Proof of a Remarkable Relation Between the Squircle and Lemniscate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that there is a somewhat mysterious relation between the area of the quartic Fermat curve $x^4+y^4=1$, aka squircle, and the arc length of the lemniscate $(x^2+y^2)^2=x^2-y^2$. The standardproof of this fact uses relations between elliptic integrals and the gamma function. In this article we generalize this result to relate areas of sectors of the squircle to arc lengths of segments of the lemniscate. We provide a geometric interpretation of this relation and an elementary proof of the relation, which only uses basic integral calculus.</description>

      <title>Buffon-Laplace Needle Problem as a geometric probabilistic approach to filtration process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06670v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Buffon-Laplace Needle Problem considers a needle of a length $l$ randomly dropped on a large plane distributed with vertically parallel lines with distances $a$ and $b$ ($a \geqslant b$), respectively. As a classical problem in stochastic probability, it serves as a mathematical basis of various physical literature, such as the efficiency of a filter and the emergence of clogging in filtration process. Yet its potential application is limited by previous focus on its original form of the `short' needle case of $l &lt; b$ and its analytical difficulty in a general sense. Here, rather than a `short' needle embedded in two-dimensional space, we analytically solve problem versions with needles and spherocylinders of arbitrary length and radius embedded in two- and three-dimensional spaces dropped on a grid with any rectangular shape. We further confirm our analytical theory with Monte Carlo simulation. Our framework here helps to provide a geometric analytical perspective to filtration process, and also extend the analytical power of the needle problem into unexplored parameter regions for physical problems involving stochastic processes.</description>

      <title>Pierre Cartier: A Visionary Mathematician</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article reflects on the life and mathematical contributions of Pierre Cartier, a distinguished figure in 20th- and 21st-century mathematics. As a key member of the Bourbaki collective, Cartier played a pivotal role in the formalization and modernization of mathematics. His work spanned fields such as algebraic geometry, representation theory, mathematical physics, and category theory, leaving an indelible mark on the discipline. Beyond his technical achievements, Cartier was celebrated for his intellectual generosity and humanistic approach to science, shaping not only mathematical thought but also the broader cultural understanding of the field.</description>
