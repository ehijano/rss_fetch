      <title>Introducing First-Principles Calculations: New Approach to Group Dynamics and Bridging Social Phenomena in TeNP-Chain Based Social Dynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This note considers an innovative interdisciplinary methodology that bridges the gap between the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics applied to the study of materials such as tellurium nanoparticles (TeNPs) and graphene and the complex dynamics of social systems. The basis for this approach lies in the metaphorical parallels drawn between the structural features of TeNPs and graphene and the behavioral patterns of social groups in the face of misinformation. TeNPs exhibit unique properties such as the strengthening of covalent bonds within telluric chains and the disruption of secondary structure leading to the separation of these chains. This is analogous to increased cohesion within social groups and disruption of information flow between different subgroups, respectively. . Similarly, the outstanding properties of graphene, such as high electrical conductivity, strength, and flexibility, provide additional aspects for understanding the resilience and adaptability of social structures in response to external stimuli such as fake news. This research note proposes a novel metaphorical framework for analyzing the spread of fake news within social groups, analogous to the structural features of telluric nanoparticles (TeNPs). We investigate how the strengthening of covalent bonds within TeNPs reflects the strengthening of social cohesion in groups that share common beliefs and values.</description>

      <title>Quantum in the media: A content analysis of frames in Dutch newspapers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum technology is expected to have an impact on society. Scientists warn against the use of certain frames because they may create barriers to effective science communication. We studied 385 Dutch newspaper articles for the use of these frames. Newspapers commonly explained quantum concepts when mentioning quantum technology. They also regularly framed quantum technology as beneficial and enigmatic, often in prominent positions of the articles. The economic development/competitiveness frame, the social progress frame and the risk frame were less common. Although these frames are only potential barriers, we encourage journalists to weigh them when communicating about quantum technology.</description>

      <title>Biophysics in Africa: challenges, priorities, and hopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This report is a serious call to scientists, innovators, investors, and policymakers to invest in the development of biophysics in Africa. The complex problems of our day demand multidisciplinary approaches, and biophysics offers training in much-needed multi- and cross-disciplinary thinking. Biophysics is a research field at the forefront of modern science because it provides a powerful scientific platform that addresses many of the critical challenges humanity faces today and in the future. It is a vital source of innovation for any country interested in developing a high-tech economy. However, there is woefully little biophysics educational and research activity in Africa, representing a critical gap that must be addressed with urgency. This report suggests key research areas that African biophysicists should focus on, identifies major challenges to growing biophysics in Africa, and underscores the high-priority needs that must be addressed.</description>
