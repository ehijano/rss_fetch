      <title>Emergence of condensation patterns in kinetic equations for opinion dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we define a class of models to understand the impact of population size on opinion formation dynamics, a phenomenon usually related to group conformity. To this end, we introduce a new kinetic model in which the interaction frequency is weighted by the kinetic density. In the quasi-invariant regime, this model reduces to a Kaniadakis-Quarati-type equation with nonlinear drift, originally introduced for the dynamics of bosons in a spatially homogeneous setting. From the obtained PDE for the evolution of the opinion density, we determine the regime of parameters for which a critical mass exists and triggers blow-up of the solution. Therefore, the model is capable of describing strong conformity phenomena in cases where the total density of individuals holding a given opinion exceeds a fixed critical size. In the final part, several numerical experiments demonstrate the features of the introduced class of models and the related consensus effects.</description>

      <title>Ambush strategy enhances organisms' performance in rock-paper-scissors games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a five-species cyclic system wherein individuals of one species strategically adapt their movements to enhance their performance in the spatial rock-paper-scissors game. Environmental cues enable the awareness of the presence of organisms targeted for elimination in the cyclic game. If the local density of target organisms is sufficiently high, individuals move towards concentrated areas for direct attack; otherwise, they employ an ambush tactic, maximising the chances of success by targeting regions likely to be dominated by opponents. Running stochastic simulations, we discover that the ambush strategy enhances the likelihood of individual success compared to direct attacks alone, leading to uneven spatial patterns characterised by spiral waves. We compute the autocorrelation function and measure how the ambush tactic unbalances the organisms' spatial organisation by calculating the characteristic length scale of typical spatial domains of each species. We demonstrate that the threshold for local species density influences the ambush strategy's effectiveness, while the neighbourhood perception range significantly impacts decision-making accuracy. The outcomes show that long-range perception improves performance by over 60\%, although there is potential interference in decision-making under high attack triggers. Understanding how organisms' adaptation to their environment enhances their performance may be helpful not only for ecologists but also for data scientists aiming to improve artificial intelligence systems.</description>

      <title>Simulation of Crowd Egress with Environmental Stressors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.01393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.01393v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article introduces a modeling framework to characterize evacuee response to environmental stimuli during emergency egress. The model is developed in consistency with stress theory, which explains how an organism reacts to environmental stressors. We integrate the theory into the well-known social-force model, and develop a framework to simulate crowd evacuation behavior in multi-compartment buildings. Our method serves as a theoretical basis to study crowd movement at bottlenecks, and simulate their herding and way-finding behavior in normal and hazardous conditions. The pre-movement behavior is also briefly investigated by using opinion dynamics with social group model. The algorithms have been partly tested in FDS+EVAC as well as our simulation platform crowdEgress.</description>
