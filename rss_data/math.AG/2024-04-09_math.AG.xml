      <title>Log Calabi-Yau pairs of birational complexity zero</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the geometry of log Calabi-Yau pairs $(X,B)$ of index one and birational complexity zero. Firstly, we propose a conjecture that characterizes such pairs $(X,B)$ in terms of their dual complex and the rationality of their log canonical places. Secondly, we show that for these pairs the open set $X\setminus B$ is divisorially covered by open affine subvarieties which are isomorphic to open subvarieties of algebraic tori. We introduce and study invariants that measure the geometry and the number of these open subvarieties of algebraic tori. Thirdly, we study boundedness properties of log Calabi-Yau pairs of index one and birational complexity zero. For instance, in dimension $2$ we prove that such pairs are affinely bounded.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian loci in moduli of abelian surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that any smooth surface germ in the moduli of abelian surfaces arises from a Lagrangian fibration of abelian surfaces. By Donagi-Markman's cubic condition, the key issue of the proof is to find a suitable affine structure with a compatible cubic form on the base space of the family. We achieve this by analyzing the properties of cubic forms in two variables and proving the existence of the solution of the resulting partial differential equations by Cauchy-Kowalewski Theorem. Modifying the argument, we show also that a smooth curve germ in the moduli of abelian surfaces arises from a Lagrangian fibration if and only if the curve is a null curve with respect to the natural holomorphic conformal structure on the moduli of abelian surfaces.</description>

      <title>Compact Subvarieties of the Moduli Space of Complex Abelian Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the maximal dimension of compact subvarieties of $\mathcal{A}_g$, the moduli space of complex principally polarized abelian varieties of dimension $g$, and the maximal dimension of a compact subvariety through a very general point of $\mathcal{A}_g$. This also allows us to draw some conclusions for compact subvarieties of the moduli space of complex curves of compact type.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we study Seshadri constants and Gromov widths of toric surfaces via lattice widths of their moment polygons. We give the sharp lower bound of the ratio between the Gromov width of a symplectic toric $4$-fold and the lattice width of the moment polygon, which answers to a question raised by Codenotti, Hall and Hofscheier.</description>

Abstract: Let $\mathbb K$ be a field of characteristic zero. We prove that its motivic cohomology in degree $m-1$ and weight $m$ is rationally isomorphic to the cohomology of the polylogarithmic complex. This gives a partial extension of A.

      <title>A tropical version of Hilbert function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a tropical prevariety $V\subset \RR^n$ (being a finite union of rational polyhedra) two tropical polynomials belong to the same congruence class iff they coincide on $V$. We define a tropical Hilbert function $TH_V(k)$ as the dimension of the family of congruence classes of tropical polynomials with tropical degree at most $k$. It is shown that $TH_V(k)$ coincides with a polynomial of degree $\dim V$ for sufficiently big $k$ when $V$ is a polyhedron. For an arbitrary tropical prevariety we formulate it as a conjecture. The conjecture is justified in case $\dim V =0$.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we geometrically study the partial Bernstein-Zelevinsky operator introduced in the author's thesis, which generalizes the original Bernstein-Zelevinsky operator. We relate the partial Bernstein-Zelevinsky operator to the geometric induction of Lusztig and then perform explicit computations in special cases.

      <title>A Calabi-Yau-to-Curve Correspondence for Feynman Integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has long been known that the maximal cut of the equal-mass four-loop banana integral is a period of a family of Calabi-Yau threefolds that depends on the kinematic variable $z=m^2/p^2$. We show that it can also be interpreted as a period of a family of genus-two curves. We do this by introducing a general Calabi-Yau-to-curve correspondence, which in this case locally relates the original period of the family of Calabi-Yau threefolds to a period of a family of genus-two curves that varies holomorphically with the kinematic variable $z$. In addition to working out the concrete details of this correspondence for the equal-mass four-loop banana integral, we outline when we expect a correspondence of this type to hold.</description>

      <title>Cohen-Macaulay representations of Artin-Schelter Gorenstein algebras of dimension one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The existence of a tilting or silting object is an important feature for an algebraic triangulated category since it gives an equivalence with the derived category of a ring. By applying tilting theory, we study Cohen-Macaulay representations of $\mathbb N$-graded Artin-Schelter Gorenstein algebras $A=\bigoplus_{i\in \mathbb N}A_i$, where do not assume that $A_0$ is a field. This is a large class of noncommutative Gorenstein rings containing Gorenstein orders. In this paper, we concentrate on the case where $A$ has dimension one. Under the assumptions that $A$ is ring-indecomposable and $A_0$ has finite global dimension, we show that the stable category $\operatorname{\underline{\mathsf{CM}}}_0^{\mathbb Z}A$ always admits an (explicitly constructed) silting object. We also show that $\operatorname{\underline{\mathsf{CM}}}_0^{\mathbb Z}A$ admits a tilting object if and only if either $A$ is Artin-Schelter regular or the average Gorenstein parameter $p^A_\mathrm{av} \in {\mathbb Q}$ of $A$ is non-positive. These results are far-reaching generalizations of the results of Buchweitz, Iyama, and Yamaura. We give two different proofs of the second result; one is based on Orlov-type semiorthogonal decompositions, and the other is based on a more direct calculation. We apply our results to a Gorenstein tiled order $A$ to prove that $\operatorname{\underline{\mathsf{CM}}}^{\mathbb Z}A$ is equivalent to the derived category of the incidence algebra of an (explicitly constructed) poset. We also apply our results and Koszul duality to prove that the derived category $\mathsf{D}^\mathrm{b}(\operatorname{\mathsf{qgr}} A)$ of a smooth noncommutative projective quadric hypersurface $\operatorname{\mathsf{qgr}} A$ admits an (explicitly constructed) tilting object, which contains the tilting object of $\operatorname{\underline{\mathsf{CM}}}^{\mathbb Z}A$ due to Smith and Van den Bergh as a direct summand.</description>

Abstract: We address two longstanding open problems, one originating in PL topology, another in birational geometry.
  First, we prove the weighted version of Oda's \emph{strong factorization conjecture} (1978), and prove that two toric varieties that are related by a common iterated blowup (at rationally smooth points).
  Second, we prove that every two PL homeomorphic polyhedra have a common stellar subdivisions, as conjectured by Alexander in 1930.</description>

      <title>Formal principle with convergence for rational curves of Goursat type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a conjecture that a general member of a bracket-generating family of rational curves in a complex manifold satisfies the formal principle with convergence, namely, any formal equivalence between such curves is convergent. If the normal bundles of the rational curves are positive, the conjecture follows from the results of Commichau-Grauert and Hirschowitz. We prove the conjecture for the opposite case when the normal bundles are furthest from positive vector bundles among bracket-generating families, namely, when the families of rational curves are of Goursat type. The proof uses natural ODEs associated to rational curves of Goursat type and corresponding Cartan connections constructed by Doubrov-Komrakov-Morimoto. As an example, we see that a general line on a smooth cubic fourfold satisfies the formal principle with convergence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize classical triangular Schubert puzzles to puzzles with convex polygonal boundary. We give these puzzles a geometric Schubert calculus interpretation and derive novel combinatorial commutativity statements, using purely geometric arguments, for puzzles with four, five, and six sides, having various types of symmetry in their boundary conditions. We also present formulas for the associated structure constants in terms of Littlewood-Richardson numbers, and we prove an analogue of commutativity for parallelogram-shaped equivariant puzzles.</description>

      <title>A universal sequence of tensors for the asymptotic rank conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exponent $\sigma(T)$ of a tensor $T\in\mathbb{F}^d\otimes\mathbb{F}^d\otimes\mathbb{F}^d$ over a field $\mathbb{F}$ captures the base of the exponential growth rate of the tensor rank of $T$ under Kronecker powers. Tensor exponents are fundamental from the standpoint of algorithms and computational complexity theory; for example, the exponent $\omega$ of matrix multiplication can be characterized as $\omega=2\sigma(\mathrm{MM}_2)$, where $\mathrm{MM}_2\in\mathbb{F}^4\otimes\mathbb{F}^4\otimes\mathbb{F}^4$ is the tensor that represents $2\times 2$ matrix multiplication.
  Our main result is an explicit construction of a sequence $\mathcal{U}_d$ of zero-one-valued tensors that is universal for the worst-case tensor exponent; more precisely, we show that $\sigma(\mathcal{U}_d)=\sigma(d)$ where $\sigma(d)=\sup_{T\in\mathbb{F}^d\otimes\mathbb{F}^d\otimes\mathbb{F}^d}\sigma(T)$. We also supply an explicit universal sequence $\mathcal{U}_\Delta$ localised to capture the worst-case exponent $\sigma(\Delta)$ of tensors with support contained in $\Delta\subseteq [d]\times[d]\times [d]$; by combining such sequences, we obtain a universal sequence $\mathcal{T}_d$ such that $\sigma(\mathcal{T}_d)=1$ holds if and only if Strassen's asymptotic rank conjecture [Progr. Math. 120 (1994)] holds for $d$. Finally, we show that the limit $\lim_{d\rightarrow\infty}\sigma(d)$ exists and can be captured as $\lim_{d\rightarrow\infty} \sigma(D_d)$ for an explicit sequence $(D_d)_{d=1}^\infty$ of tensors obtained by diagonalisation of the sequences $\mathcal{U}_d$. As our second result we relate the absence of polynomials of fixed degree vanishing on tensors of low rank, or more generally asymptotic rank, with upper bounds on the exponent $\sigma(d)$. Using this technique, one may bound asymptotic rank for all tensors of a given format, knowing enough specific tensors of low asymptotic rank.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2108.08620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a smooth projective variety whose anti-canonical bundle is nef, we prove confluence of the small $K$-theoretic $J$-function, i.e., after rescaling appropriately the Novikov variables, the small $K$-theoretic $J$-function has a limit when $q\to 1$, which coincides with the small cohomological $J$-function. Furthermore, in the case of a Fano toric manifold $X$ of Picard rank 2, we prove the $K$-theoretic version of an identity due to Iritani that compares the $I$-function of the toric manifold and the oscillatory integral of the toric mirror. In particular, our confluence result yields a new proof of Iritani's identity in the case of a toric manifold of Picard rank 2.</description>

      <title>Inversion of adjunction for quotient singularities II: Non-linear actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.09502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.09502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the precise inversion of adjunction formula for quotient singularities. As an application, we prove the semi-continuity of minimal log discrepancies for hyperquotient singularities. This paper is a continuation of arXiv:2011.07300, and we generalize the previous results to non-linear group actions.</description>

      <title>Hurwitz moduli varieties parameterizing Galois covers of an algebraic curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.06020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.06020v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a smooth, projective curve $Y$, a finite group $G$ and a positive integer $n$ we study smooth, proper families $X\to Y\times S\to S$ of Galois covers of $Y$ with Galois group isomorphic to $G$ branched in $n$ points, parameterized by algebraic varieties $S$. When $G$ is with trivial center we prove that the Hurwitz space $H^G_n(Y)$ is a fine moduli variety for this moduli problem and construct explicitly the universal family. For arbitrary $G$ we prove that $H^G_n(Y)$ is a coarse moduli variety. For families of pointed Galois covers of $(Y,y_0)$ we prove that the Hurwitz space $H^G_n(Y,y_0)$ is a fine moduli variety, and construct explicitly the universal family, for arbitrary group $G$. We use classical tools of algebraic topology and of complex algebraic geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.12205v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we establish the following results: Let $(X, B)$ be a dlt pair, where $X$ is a $\mathbb Q$-factorial K\"ahler $4$-fold -- (i) if $X$ is compact and $K_X+B\sim_{\mathbb Q} D\geq 0$ for some effective $\mathbb Q$-divisor, then $(X, B)$ has a log minimal model, (ii) if $(X/T, B)$ is a semi-stable klt pair, $W\subset T$ a compact subset and $K_X+B$ is effective over $W$ (resp. not effective over $W$), then we can run a $(K_X+B)$-MMP over $T$ (in a neighborhood of $W$) which ends with a minimal model over $T$ (resp. a Mori fiber space over $T$). We also give a proof of the existence of flips for analytic varieties in all dimensions and the relative MMP for projective morphisms between analytic varieties.</description>

      <title>Mirror P=W conjecture and extended Fano/Landau-Ginzburg correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.09217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.09217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mirror P=W conjecture, formulated by Harder-Katzarkov-Przyjalkowski, predicts a correspondence between weight and perverse filtrations in the context of mirror symmetry. In this paper, we revisit this conjecture through the lens of mirror symmetry for a Fano pair $(X,D)$, where $X$ is a smooth Fano variety and $D$ is a simple normal crossing divisor. We introduce its mirror object as a multi-potential analogue of a Landau-Ginzburg (LG) model, which we call the hybrid LG model. This model is expected to capture the mirrors of all irreducible components of $D$. We study the topological aspects, particularly the perverse filtration, and the Hodge theory of hybrid LG models, building upon the work of Katzarkov-Kontsevich-Pantev. As an application, we discover an interesting upper bound on the multiplicativity of the perverse filtration for a hybrid LG model. Additionally, we propose a relative version of the homological mirror symmetry conjecture and explain how the mirror P=W conjecture naturally emerges from it.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.14599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that if a $3$-dimensional quasi-projective variety $X$ over an algebraically closed field of characteristic $p&gt;3$ has only log canonical singularities, then so does a general hyperplane section $H$ of $X$. We also show that the same is true for klt singularities, which is a slight extension of \cite{ST20}. In the course of the proof, we provide a sufficient condition for log canonical (resp.~klt) surface singularities to be geometrically log canonical (resp.~geometrically klt) over a field.</description>

Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth complex projective curve and let $E$ be a vector bundle on $X$ which is not semistable. We consider a flag bundle $\pi: \text{Fl}(E) \to X$ parametrizing certain flags of fibers of $E$. The dimensions of the successive quotients of the flags are determined by the ranks of vector bundles appearing in the Harder-Narasimhan filtration of $E$. We compute the Seshadri constants of nef line bundles on $\text{Fl}(E)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We effectively bound T-singularities on non-rational projective surfaces with an arbitrary amount of T-singularities and ample canonical class. This fully generalizes the previous work for the case of one singularity, and illustrates the vast increase in combinatorial complexity as the number of singularities grows. We find that certain combinatorial configurations lead to relatively high bounds. We classify all such configurations, and show that their non-existence gives a strong and optimal bound. As an application, we work out in detail the case of two singularities.</description>

      <title>Philosophy of contraherent cosheaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14179v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Contraherent cosheaves are module objects over algebraic varieties defined by gluing using the colocalization functors. Contraherent cosheaves are designed to be used for globalizing contramodules and contraderived categories for the purposes of Koszul duality and semi-infinite algebraic geometry. One major technical problem associated with contraherent cosheaves is that the colocalization functors, unlike the localizations, are not exact. The reason is that, given a commutative ring homomorphism $R\rightarrow S$ arising in connection with a typical covering in algebraic geometry, the ring $S$ is usually a flat, but not a projective $R$-module. We argue that the relevant difference between projective and flat modules, from the standpoint of homological algebra, is not that big, as manifested by the flat/projective and cotorsion periodicity theorems. The difference becomes even smaller if one observes that the ring $S$ is often a very flat $R$-module.</description>

Abstract: We prove that if $X$ is a compact complex analytic variety, which has quotient singularities in codimension 2, then there is a projective bimeromorphic morphism $f\colon Y\to X$, such that $Y$ has quotient singularities, and that the indeterminacy locus of $f^{-1}$ has codimension at least 3 in $X$. As an application, we deduce the Bogomolov-Gieseker inequality on orbifold Chern classes for stable reflexive coherent sheaves on compact K\"ahler varieties which have quotient singularities in codimension 2.</description>

Abstract: Let $(X,B)$ be an $\epsilon$-lc pair of dimension $d$ with a closed point $x\in X$. Birkar conjectured that there is an effective Cartier divisor $H$ passing through $x$ such that $(X,B+tH)$ is lc near $x$, where $t$ is a positive real number depending only on $d,\epsilon$. We prove that Birkar's conjecture is equivalent to Shokurov's conjecture on boundedness of klt complements on Fano fibrations and we confirm Birkar's conjecture in dimension 2. As a corollary, we prove the boundedness of klt complements on Fano fibrations over surfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider slice filtrations in logarithmic motivic homotopy theory. Our main results establish conjectured compatibilities with the Beilinson, BMS, and HKR filtrations on (topological, log) Hochschild homology and related invariants. In the case of perfect fields admitting resolution of singularities, we show that the slice filtration realizes the BMS filtration on the $p$-completed topological cyclic homology. Furthermore, the motivic trace map is compatible with the slice and BMS filtrations, yielding a natural morphism from the motivic slice spectral sequence to the BMS spectral sequence. Finally, we consider the Kummer \'etale hypersheafification of logarithmic $K$-theory and show that its very effective slices compute Lichtenbaum \'etale motivic cohomology.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we present an algorithmic procedure that transforms, if possible, a given system of ordinary or partial differential equations with radical dependencies in the unknown function and its derivatives into a system with polynomial relations among them by means of a rational change of variables. The solutions of the given equation and its transformation correspond one-to-one. This work can be seen as a generalization of previous work on reparametrization of ODEs and PDEs with radical coefficients.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2202.03213v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dubrovin has shown that the spectrum of the quantization (with respect to the first Poisson structure) of the dispersionless Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) hierarchy is given by shifted symmetric functions; the latter are related by the Bloch-Okounkov Theorem to quasimodular forms on the full modular group. We extend the relation to quasimodular forms to the full quantum KdV hierarchy (and to the more general quantum Intermediate Long Wave hierarchy). These quantum integrable hierarchies have been defined by Buryak and Rossi in terms of the Double Ramification cycle in the moduli space of curves. The main tool and conceptual contribution of the paper is a general effective criterion for quasimodularity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01141v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the following version of the famous Bernstein's theorem: Let $X\subset \mathbb R^{n+k}$ be a closed and connected set with Hausdorff dimension $n$. Assume that $X$ satisfies the monotonicity formula at $p\in X$. Then, the following statements are equivalent:
  (1) $X$ is an affine linear subspace;
  (2) $X$ is a definable set that is Lipschitz regular at infinity and its geometric tangent cone at infinity, $C(X,\infty)$, is a linear subspace;
  (3) $X$ is a definable set, blow-spherical regular at infinity and $C(X,\infty)$ is a linear subspace;
  (4) $X$ is a definable set that is Lipschitz normally embedded at infinity and $C(X,\infty)$ is a linear subspace;
  (5) the density of $X$ at infinity is 1.
  Consequently, we prove the following generalization of Bernstein's theorem: Let $X\subset \mathbb R^{n+1}$ be a closed and connected set with Hausdorff dimension $n$. Assume that $X$ satisfies the monotonicity formula at $p\in X$ and there are compact sets $K\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ and $\tilde K\subset \mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ such that $X\setminus \tilde K$ is a minimal hypersurface that is the graph of a $C^2$-smooth function $u\colon \mathbb{R}^{n}\setminus K\to \mathbb{R}$. Assume that $u$ has bounded derivative whenever $n&gt;7$. Then $X$ is a hyperplane. Several other results are also presented. For example, we generalize the o-minimal Chow's theorem, we prove that any entire complex analytic set that is bi-Lipschitz homeomorphic to a definable set in an o-minimal structure must be an algebraic set. We also obtain that Yau's Bernstein Problem, which says that an oriented stable complete minimal hypersurface in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ with $n\leq 6$ must be a hyperplane, holds true whether the hypersurface is a definable set in an o-minimal structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06072v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Gauss and Jacobi sums from a viewpoint of motives. We exhibit isomorphisms between Chow motives arising from the Artin-Schreier curve and the Fermat varieties over a finite field, that can be regarded as (and yield a new proof of) classically known relations among Gauss and Jacobi sums such as Davenport-Hasse's multiplication formula. As a key step, we define motivic analogues of the Gauss and Jacobi sums as algebraic correspondences, and show that they represent the Frobenius endomorphisms of such motives. This generalizes Coleman's result for curves. These results are applied to investigate the group of invertible Chow motives with coefficients in a cyclotomic field.</description>

      <title>Representations of Kronecker quivers and Steiner bundles on Grassmannians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00079v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{k}$ be an algebraically closed field. Connections between representations of the generalized Kronecker quivers $K_r$ and vector bundles on $\mathbb{P}^{r-1}$ have been known for quite some time. This article is concerned with a particular aspect of this correspondence, involving more generally Steiner bundles on Grassmannians $\mathrm{Gr}_d(\mathbb{k}^r)$ and certain full subcategories $\mathrm{rep}_{\mathrm{proj}}(K_r,d)$ of relative projective $K_r$-representations. Building on a categorical equivalence first explicitly established by Jardim and Prata, we employ representation-theoretic techniques provided by Auslander-Reiten theory and reflection functors to organize indecomposable Steiner bundles in a manner that facilitates the study of bundles enjoying certain properties such as uniformity and homogeneity. Conversely, computational results on Steiner bundles motivate investigations in $\mathrm{rep}_{\mathrm{proj}}(K_r,d)$, which elicit the conceptual sources of some recent work on the subject.
  From a purely representation-theoretic vantage point, our paper initiates the investigation of certain full subcategories of the, for $r\!\ge\!3$, wild category of $K_r$-representations. These may be characterized as being right Hom-orthogonal to certain algebraic families of elementary test modules.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the set of (real Dolbeault classes of) balanced metrics $\Theta$ on a balanced manifold $X$ with respect to which a torsion-free coherent sheaf $\mathcal{E}$ on $X$ is slope stable. We prove that the set of all such $[\Theta] \in H^{n - 1,n - 1}(X,\mathbb{R})$ is a convex cone defined by a finite number of linear inequalities. For this, we prove that the set of all $c_1(\mathcal{S})$ for $\mathcal{S} \subset \mathcal{E}$ saturated and coherent is finite.
  When $\mathcal{E}$ is a Hermitian vector bundle, the Kobayashi--Hitchin correspondence provides associated Hermitian Yang--Mills connections, which we show depend continuously on the metric, even around classes with respect to which $\mathcal{E}$ is only semi-stable. In this case, the holomorphic structure induced by the connection is the holomorphic structure of the associated graded object. The method relies on semi-stable perturbation techniques for geometric PDEs with a moment map interpretation and is quite versatile, and we hope that it can be used in other similar problems.</description>

      <title>Modularity of higher theta series II: Chow group of the generic fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19711v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Higher theta series on moduli spaces of Hermitian shtukas were constructed by Feng--Yun--Zhang and conjectured to be modular, parallel to classical conjectures in the Kudla program. In this paper we prove the modularity of higher theta series after restriction to the generic locus. The proof is an upgrade, using motivic homotopy theory, of earlier work of Feng--Yun--Zhang which established generic modularity of $\ell$-adic realizations. In the process, we develop some general tools of broader utility. One such is the "motivic sheaf-cycle correspondence", a categorical trace formalism for extracting computations in the Chow group from computations in Voevodsky's derived category of motives. Another new tool is the "derived homogeneous Fourier transform", which we use to implement a form of Fourier analysis for motives.</description>

      <title>Boundary local integrability of rational functions in two variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by studying boundary singularities of rational functions in two variables that are analytic on a domain, we investigate local integrability on $\mathbb{R}^2$ near $(0,0)$ of rational functions with denominator non-vanishing in the bi-upper half-plane but with an isolated zero (with respect to $\mathbb{R}^2$) at the origin. Building on work of Bickel-Pascoe-Sola, we give a necessary and sufficient test for membership in a local $L^{p}(\mathbb{R}^2)$ space and we give a complete description of all numerators $Q$ such that $Q/P$ is locally in a given $L^{p}$ space. As applications, we prove that every bounded rational function on the bidisk has partial derivatives belonging to $L^1$ on the two-torus. In addition, we give a new proof of a conjecture, started in Bickel-Knese-Pascoe-Sola and completed by Koll\'ar, characterizing the ideal of $Q$ such that $Q/P$ is locally bounded. A larger takeaway from this work is that a local model for stable polynomials we employ is a flexible tool and may be of use for other local questions about stable polynomials.</description>
