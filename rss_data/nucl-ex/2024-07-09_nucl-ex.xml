      <title>Isomer production studied with simultaneous decay curve analysis for alpha-particle induced reactions on natural platinum up to 29 MeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The isomeric ratios of $^{198}$Au, $^{197}$Hg and $^{195}$Hg produced by $\alpha$-particle induced reactions on natural platinum were investigated experimentally up to 29 MeV by using the standard stacked foil activation technique and $\gamma$-ray spectrometry. The isomeric ratios of $^{197}$Hg and $^{195}$Hg determined by the conventional activation cross section formula showed strong cooling time dependence. The time dependence was resolved by adjusting the isomeric transition branching ratios for the two isotopes within a simultaneous decay curve analysis framework. Our analysis suggests 94.5$\pm$0.7% and 48.9$\pm$1.8% as the isomeric transition branching ratios of $^{197m}$Hg (24 h) and $^{195m}$Hg (42 h), respectively. The isomeric ratios and independent production cross sections of $^{198}$Au, $^{197}$Hg, $^{195}$Hg and some other Hg, Au and Pt isotopes were also measured down to 6 MeV with these corrected isomeric transition branching ratios, and compared with predictions of statistical and pre-equilibrium models by TALYS-2.0 to discuss spin cuto? parameter dependence. We found the measured isomeric ratios are better predicted if we reduce the spin cuto? parameter to half or less from that estimated with the rigid body moment of inertia.</description>

      <title>Search for nuclear modifications of B$^+$ meson production in pPb collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ = 8.16 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear medium effects on B$^+$ meson production are studied using the binary-collision scaled cross section ratio between events of different multiplicities from proton-lead collisions. Data, collected by the CMS experiment in 2016 at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ = 8.16 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 175 nb$^{-1}$, were used. The scaling factors in the ratio are determined using a novel approach based on the Z $\to$ $\mu^+\mu^-$ cross sections measured in the same events. The scaled ratio for B$^+$ is consistent with unity for all event multiplicities, putting stringent constraints on nuclear modification for heavy flavor.</description>

      <title>Improved limit on neutrinoless double beta decay of \mohundred~from AMoRE-I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AMoRE searches for the signature of neutrinoless double beta decay of $^{100}$Mo with a 100 kg sample of enriched $^{100}$Mo. Scintillating molybdate crystals coupled with a metallic magnetic calorimeter operate at milli-Kelvin temperatures to measure the energy of electrons emitted in the decay. As a demonstration of the full-scale AMoRE, we conducted AMoRE-I, a pre-experiment with 18 molybdate crystals, at the Yangyang Underground Laboratory for over two years. The exposure was 8.02 kg$\cdot$year (or 3.89 kg$_{\mathrm{^{100}Mo}}\cdot$year) and the total background rate near the Q-value was 0.025 $\pm$ 0.002 counts/keV/kg/year. We observed no indication of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay and report a new lower limit of the half-life of $^{100}$Mo $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay as $ T^{0\nu}_{1/2}&gt;3.0\times10^{24}~\mathrm{years}$ at 90\% confidence level. The effective Majorana mass limit range is $m_{\beta\beta}&lt;$(210--610) meV using nuclear matrix elements estimated in the framework of different models, including the recent shell model calculations.</description>

      <title>Isochronous mass spectrometry at the RIKEN Rare-RI Ring facility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A dedicated isochronous storage ring, named the Rare-RI Ring, was constructed at the RI Beam Factory of RIKEN, aiming at precision mass measurements of nuclei located in uncharted territories of the nuclear chart. The Rare-RI Ring employs the isochronous mass spectrometry technique with the goal to achieve a relative mass precision of $10^{-6}$ within a measurement time of less than 1 ms. The performance of the facility was demonstrated through mass measurements of neutron-rich nuclei with well-known masses. Velocity or magnetic rigidity is measured for every particle prior to its injection into the ring, wherein its revolution time is accurately determined. The latter quantity is used to determine the mass of the particle, while the former one is needed for non-isochronicity corrections. Mass precisions on the order of $10^{-5}$ were achieved in the first commissioning, which demonstrates that Rare-RI Ring is a powerful tool for mass spectrometry of short-lived nuclei.</description>

      <title>Effect of ground-state deformation on the Isoscalar Giant Monopole Resonance and the first observation of overtones of the Isoscalar Giant Quadrupole Resonance in rare-earth Nd isotopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The strength distributions of the Isoscalar Giant Monopole Resonance (ISGMR) and Isoscalar Giant Quadrupole Resonance (ISGQR) in 142,146-150Nd have been determined via inelastic alpha-particle scattering with the Grand Raiden (GR) Spectrometer at the Research Center for Nuclear Physics (RCNP), Japan. In the deformed nuclei 146-150Nd, the ISGMR strength distributions exhibit a splitting into two components, while the nearly spherical nucleus 142Nd displays a single peak in the ISGMR strength distribution. A noteworthy achievement in this study is the first-time detection of overtones in the Isoscalar Giant Quadrupole Resonance (ISGQR) strength distributions within Nd isotopes at an excitation energy around 25 MeV obtained through Multipole Decomposition Analysis (MDA).</description>

      <title>Single-Neutron Adding on $^{34}$S</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: Single-neutron adding data was collected in order to determine the distribution of the single-neutron strength of the $0f_{7/2}$, $1p_{3/2}$, $1p_{1/2}$ and $0f_{5/2}$ orbitals outside of $Z=16, N=18$, $^{34}$S.
  Methods: The $^{34}$S($d$,$p$)$^{35}$S reaction has been measured at 8 MeV/u to investigate cross sections to excited states in $^{35}$S. Outgoing proton yields and momenta were analyzed by the Super-Enge Split-Pole Spectrograph in conjunction with the CeBrA demonstrator located at the John D. Fox Laboratory at Florida State University. Angular distributions were compared with Distorted Wave Born Approximation calculations in order to extract single-neutron spectroscopic overlaps.
  Results: Spectroscopic overlaps and strengths were determined for states in $^{35}$S up through 6~MeV in excitation energy. Each orbital was observed to have fragmented strength where a single level carried the majority. The single-neutron centroids of the $0f_{7/2}$, $1p_{3/2}$, $1p_{1/2}$ and $0f_{5/2}$ orbitals were determined to be $2360^{+90}_{-40}$~keV, $3280^{+80}_{-50}$~keV, $4780^{+60}_{-40}$~keV, and $\gtrsim7500$~keV, respectively.
  Conclusion: A previous discrepancy in the literature with respect to distribution of the neutron $1p_{1/2}$ strength was resolved. The integration of the normalized spectroscopic strengths, up to 5.1~MeV in excitation energy, revealed fully-vacant occupancies for the $0f_{7/2}$, $1p_{3/2}$, and $1p_{1/2}$ orbitals, as expected. The spacing in the single-neutron energies highlighted a reduction in the traditional $N=28$ shell-gap, relative to both the $1p$ spin-orbit energy difference ($N=32$) and the lower limit on the $N=34$ shell spacing.</description>

      <title>QCD Masterclass Lectures on Jet Physics and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: These lectures were presented at the 2024 QCD Masterclass in Saint-Jacut-de-la-Mer, France. They introduce and review fundamental theorems and principles of machine learning within the context of collider particle physics, focused on application to jet identification and discrimination. Numerous examples of binary discrimination in jet physics are studied in detail, including $H\to b\bar b$ identification in fixed-order perturbation theory, generic one- versus two-prong discrimination with parametric power counting techniques, and up versus down quark jet classification by assuming the central limit theorem, isospin conservation, and a convergent moment expansion of the single particle energy distribution. Quark versus gluon jet discrimination is considered in multiple contexts, from using additive, infrared and collinear safe observables, to using hadronic multiplicity, and to including measurements of the jet charge. While many of the results presented here are well known, some novel results are presented, the most prominent being a parametrized expression for the likelihood ratio of quark versus gluon discrimination for jets on which hadronic multiplicity and jet charge are simultaneously measured. End-of-lecture exercises are also provided.</description>

      <title>Statistical Production of $B_c$ Mesons in Heavy-Ion Collisions at the LHC Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recombination production of $B_c$ mesons in heavy-ion collisions at the LHC energy is facilitated by the abundant and highly thermalized charm ($c$) quarks transported in the deconfined medium created. We study the production of $B_c$ mesons via $c$ and bottom ($b$) quark recombination in a statistical fashion by placing $B_c$ in the position of a member of the family of open $b$ hadrons, which allows us to make quantitative predictions for the modifications of the production fraction ($f_c$) of $B_c$ mesons and its relative production to $B$ mesons in $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=5.02$ TeV Pb-Pb collisions with respect to proton-proton ($pp$) collisions at the same energy. The statistical production yield of $B_c$ mesons is converted into the transverse momentum ($p_T$) distribution with the shape computed from resonance recombination using the $c$- and $b$-quark phase space distributions that have been simulated via Langevin diffusion and constrained by open $c$- and $b$-hadron observables. Supplemented with the component fragmented from $b$-quark spectrum that dominates at high $p_T$, the total $p_T$ spectrum of $B_c$ mesons is obtained and converted into the $p_T$ dependent nuclear modification factor ($R_{\rm AA}$). Both $f_c$ and the integrated $R_{\rm AA}$ exhibit a $\sim5$-fold enhancement in central Pb-Pb collisions relative to the $pp$ reference. Comparison with data measured by the CMS experiment shows decent agreement within theoretical and experimental uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Volume effect on the extraction of sound velocity in high-energy nucleus-nucleus collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The determination of the speed of sound in quark-gluon plasma is a crucial aspect of understanding the properties of strongly interacting matter created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. In this study, we investigate the impact of initial-state fluctuations on the extraction of the speed of sound in a quark-gluon plasma in the ultra-central collisions. By employing the TRENTo model for simulating initial conditions, we demonstrate that these fluctuations lead to sizable volume effect, which in turn corrects the measured values of the sound velocity. With respect to realistic conditions of high-energy heavy-ion experiments, we provide quantitative estimate of these corrections.</description>

      <title>Coupled-channel treatment of $^7\mathrm{Li}(n,\gamma)^8\mathrm{Li}$ in effective field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.09324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.09324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The E1 contribution to the capture reaction $^7\mathrm{Li}(n,\gamma)^8\mathrm{Li}$ is calculated at low energies. We employ a coupled-channel formalism to account for the $^7\mathrm{Li}^\star$ excited core contribution. We develop a halo effective field theory power counting where capture in the spin $S=2$ channel is enhanced over the $S=1$ channel. A next-to-leading order calculation is presented where the excited core contribution is shown to affect only the overall normalization of the cross section. The momentum dependence of the capture cross section, as a consequence, is the same in a theory with or without the excited $^7\mathrm{Li}^\star$ degree of freedom at this order of the calculation. The kinematical signature of the $^7\mathrm{Li}^\star$ core is negligible at momenta below 1 MeV and significant only beyond the $3^+$ resonance energy, though still compatible with a next-to-next-to-leading order correction. We compare our formalism with a previous halo effective field theory calculation [Zhang, Nollett, and Phillips, Phys. Rev. C 89, 024613 (2014)] that also treated the $^7\mathrm{Li}^\star$ core as an explicit degree of freedom. Our formal expressions and analysis disagree with this earlier work in several aspects.</description>

      <title>Coupled-channels treatment of $^7\mathrm{Be}(p,\gamma)^8\mathrm{B}$ in effective field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.13003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2010.13003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The E1 and M1 contributions to $^7\mathrm{Be}(p,\gamma)^8\mathrm{B}$ at low energies are calculated in halo effective field theory. The excited $^7\mathrm{Be}^\star$ core is included as an explicit degree of freedom in a coupled-channels calculation. The E1 transition is calculated up to next-to-next-to-leading order. The leading contribution from M1 transition that gives significant contribution in a narrow energy region around the $1^+$ resonance state of $^8$B is included. We compare our results with previous halo effective field theory calculations that also included the $^7\mathrm{Be}^\star$ as an explicit degree of freedom. We disagree with these previous calculations in both the formal expressions and also in the analysis. Bayesian inference of the data gives $S_{17}(0)=21.0(7)$ eV b when combined with the expected theory error.</description>

      <title>Bulk medium properties of heavy-ion collisions from the beam energy scan with a multistage hydrodynamic model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00596v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a method to reconstruct full rapidity distributions of charged particle multiplicity and net proton yields, crucial for constraining the longitudinal dynamics of nuclear matter created in the beam energy scan program. Employing rapidity distributions within a multistage hydrodynamic model calibrated for Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}=7.7-200\,$GeV, we estimate the total energy and baryon number deposited into the collision fireball, offering insights into initial dynamics and the identification of nuclear remnants. We explore the potential of rapidity-dependent measurements in probing equations of state at finite chemical potentials. Furthermore, we compare the freeze-out parameters derived from both hydrodynamics and thermal models, highlighting that the parameters extracted via thermal models represent averaged properties across rapidities.</description>

Abstract: Quantum fluctuations plays an essential role in forming the collective flow of hadrons observed in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Event-by-event fluctuations of the collective flow can arise from various sources, such as the fluctuations in the initial geometry, hydrodynamic expansion, hadronization, and hadronic evolution of the nuclear matter, while the exact contribution from each source is still an open question. Using a (3+1)-dimensional relativistic hydrodynamic model coupled to a Monte-Carlo Glauber initial condition, Cooper-Frye particlization and a hadronic transport model, we explore the system size and shape dependences of the collective flow fluctuations in Au+Au, Cu+Au, and O+O collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}=200$~GeV. The particle yields, mean transverse momenta, 2-particle and 4-particle cumulant elliptic flows ($v_2\{2\}$ and $v_2\{4\}$) from our calculation agree with the currently existing data from RHIC. Different centrality dependences of the flow fluctuations, quantified by the $v_2\{4\}/v_2\{2\}$ ratio, are found for different collision systems due to their different sizes and shapes. By comparing $v_2\{4\}/v_2\{2\}$ between different hadron species, and comparing $v_2\{4\}/v_2\{2\}$ to the initial state geometric fluctuations quantified by the cumulant eccentricity ratio $\varepsilon_2\{4\}/\varepsilon_2\{2\}$, we find that while the initial state fluctuations are the main source of the $v_2$ fluctuations in large collision systems, other sources like nonlinear hydrodynamic response, hadronization, and hadronic afterburner can significantly affect the $v_2$ fluctuations in small systems.</description>

      <title>BINGO innovative assembly for background reduction in bolometric $0\nu\beta\beta$ experiments</title>

Abstract: BINGO is a project aiming to set the grounds for large-scale bolometric neutrinoless double-beta-decay experiments capable of investigating the effective Majorana neutrino mass at a few meV level. It focuses on developing innovative technologies (a detector assembly, cryogenic photodetectors and active veto) to achieve a very low background index, of the order of $10^{-5}$ counts/(keV kg yr) in the region of interest. The BINGO demonstrator, called MINI-BINGO, is designed to investigate the promising double-beta-decay isotopes $^{100}$Mo and $^{130}$Te and it will be composed of Li$_2$MoO$_4$ and TeO$_2$ crystals coupled to bolometric light detectors and surrounded by a Bi$_4$Ge$_3$O$_{12}$-based veto. This will allow us to reject a significant background in bolometers caused by surface contamination from $\alpha$-active radionuclides by means of light yield selection and to mitigate other sources of background, such as surface contamination from $\beta$-active radionuclides, external $\gamma$ radioactivity, and pile-up due to random coincidence of background events. This paper describes an R\&amp;D program towards the BINGO goals, particularly focusing on the development of an innovative assembly designed to reduce the passive materials within the line of sight of the detectors, which is expected to be a dominant source of background in next-generation bolometric experiments. We present the performance of two prototype modules -- housing four cubic (4.5-cm side) Li$_2$MoO$_4$ crystals in total -- operated in the Canfranc underground laboratory in Spain within a facility developed for the CROSS double-beta-decay experiment.</description>

      <title>Translationally invariant shell model calculation of the quasielastic $(p,2p)$ process at intermediate relativistic energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02812v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relativistic beams of heavy ions interacting with various nuclear targets allow to study a broad range of problems starting from nuclear equation of state to the traditional nuclear structure. Some questions which were impossible to answer heretofore -- can be addressed nowadays by using inverse kinematics. These includes the structure of short-lived nuclei and the precision study of exclusive channels with production of residual nuclei in certain quantum states. Theoretical understanding such processes is so far based on factorization models which combine the single-step amplitude of the reaction on a bound nucleon or nuclear cluster with a certain wave function of its relative motion with respect to the residual nucleus. The nuclear structure information is encoded in the spectroscopic amplitude, calculable within nuclear many-body theories. In this work, we use for this purpose the translationally-invariant shell model with configuration mixing and demonstrate that it successfully reproduces the single-differential and integrated cross sections of the quasielastic proton knockout, $^{12}\mbox{C}(p,2p)^{11}\mbox{B}$, with outgoing $^{11}$B in the ground state and low-lying excited states measured at GSI at 400 MeV/nucleon.</description>

      <title>Parameter dependence of the $\beta$-decay properties of neutron-rich Zr isotopes within the interacting boson model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14624v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate parameter dependence of the calculated $\beta$-decay properties, as well as low-lying states for the neutron-rich Zr isotopes within the neutron-proton interacting boson model (IBM-2) and interacting boson-fermion-fermion model (IBFFM-2). It is shown that the calculated $\log_{10}ft$ values for the transitions of the $0^+_1$ ground states of the parent even-even nuclei $^{96-102}$Zr into the $1^+_1$ states of the daughter odd-odd nuclei $^{96-102}$Nb consistently exhibit a strong dependence on those parameters associated with the quadrupole-quadrupole boson interaction, and with the residual interaction between an unpaired neutron and an unpaired proton in the IBFFM-2 Hamiltonian for the odd-odd Nb nuclei. By the reduction in magnitude of the quadrupole-quadrupole interaction strength by approximately a factor of 2, the calculated $\log_{10}ft$ values for the Zr$(0^+_1)\to$Nb$(1^+_1)$ transitions increase and agree with the experimental values. This points to a significant improvement over the previous study performed in the same mass region, that consists of the mapping from a relativistic energy density functional calculation onto the IBM-2 Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>CP Violation Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19123v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The strong CP violation problem has a long history emanating from its discovery 60 years ago in the decay of neutral kaons and subsequent experimental and theoretical studies over several decades. We review herein experimental data that observe indirect CP violation of the order of $\sim10^{-3}$, as well as the discovery of direct CP violation of the order of $\sim10^{-6}$. Despite improved experimental methods over the past half a century, the original CP violation numbers have remained the same. Verification of the CP violation in the decay of charged kaons was also observed. Data reflecting CP violation in the decays of $B$ and $D$ mesons have become very important and are also discussed in this review. The question of CP violation only with the participation of $s\bar{s}$, $c\bar{c}$, and $b\bar{b}$ quarks in the framework of the Standard Model or beyond it and its small magnitude remains open.</description>
