      <title>Latency Reduction in CloudVR: Cloud Prediction, Edge Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current virtual reality (VR) headsets encounter a trade-off between high processing power and affordability. Consequently, offloading 3D rendering to remote servers helps reduce costs, battery usage, and headset weight. Maintaining network latency below 20ms is crucial to achieving this goal. Predicting future movement and prerendering are beneficial in meeting this tight latency bound. This paper proposes a method that utilizes the low-latency property of edge servers and the high resources available in cloud servers simultaneously to achieve cost-efficient, high-quality VR. In this method, head movement is predicted on the cloud server, and frames are rendered there and transmitted to the edge server. If the prediction error surpasses a threshold, the frame is re-rendered on the edge server. Results demonstrate that using this method, each edge server can efficiently serve up to 23 users concurrently, compared to a maximum of 5 users when rendering the frame entirely on the edge server. Furthermore, this paper shows that employing the Mean Absolute Error loss function and predicting acceleration rather than velocity significantly enhances prediction accuracy. Additionally, it is shown that normalizing individual data using its mean and standard deviation does not yield improvements in prediction accuracy. These findings provide insights into optimizing VR headset performance through cloud-edge collaboration.</description>

      <title>Aerial-based Crisis Management Center (ACMC)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crisis management (CM) for critical infrastructures, natural disasters such as wildfires and hurricanes, terrorist actions, or civil unrest requires high speed communications and connectivity, and access to high performance computational resources to deliver timely dynamic responses to the crisis being managed by different first responders. CM systems should detect, recognize, and disseminate huge amounts of heterogeneous dynamic events that operate at different speeds and formats. Furthermore, the processing of crisis events and the development of real-time responses are major research challenges when the communications and computational resources needed by CM stakeholders are not available or severely degraded by the crisis. The main goal of the research presented in this paper is to utilize Unmanned Autonomous Systems (UAS) to provide Aerial-based Crisis Management Center (ACMC) that will provide the required communications services and the computational resources that are critically needed by first responders. In our approach to develop an ACMC architecture, we utilize a set of flexible Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) that can be dynamically composed to meet the communications and computational requirements of CM tasks. The ACMC services will be modeled as a deep neural network (DNN) mass transport approach to cover a distributed target in a decentralized manner. This is indeed a new decentralized coverage approach with time-varying communication weights. Furthermore, our analysis proves the stability and convergence of the proposed DNN-based mass transport for a team of UAS (e.g., quadcopters), where each quadcopter uses a feedback nonlinear control to independently attain the intended coverage trajectory in a decentralized manner.</description>

      <title>A Preventive-Corrective Scheme for Ensuring Power System Security During Active Wildfire Risks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The focus of this paper is on operating the electric power grid in a secure manner when wildfire risks are high. This is a challenging problem because of the uncertain ways in which the fires can impact the operation of the power system. To address this challenge, we propose a novel preventive-corrective coordinated decision-making scheme that quickly mitigates both static and dynamic insecurities given the risk of active wildfires in a region. The scheme utilizes a comprehensive contingency analysis tool for multi-asset outages that leverages: (i) a Feasibility Test algorithm which exhaustively desaturates overloaded cut-sets to prevent cascading line outages, and (ii) a data-driven transient stability analyzer which alleviates dynamic instabilities. This tool is then used to operate a coordinated unit commitment/optimal power flow model that is designed to adapt to varying risk levels associated with wildfires. Depending on the allowed risk, the model balances economical operation and grid robustness. The results obtained using the IEEE 118-bus system indicate that the proposed approach alleviates system vulnerabilities to wildfires while also minimizing operational cost.</description>

      <title>An Analysis of Market-to-Market Coordination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing usage of renewable energy resources has introduced significant uncertainties in energy generation, enlarging challenges for Regional Transmission Operators (RTOs) in managing transmission congestion. To mitigate congestion that affects neighboring regions, RTOs employ a market-to-market (M2M) process through an iterative method, in which they exchange real-time security-constrained economic dispatch solutions and communicate requests for congestion relief. While this method provides economic benefits, it struggles with issues like power swings and time delays. To explore the full potential of M2M enhancements, in this paper, we first analyze the current M2M iterative method practice to better understand its efficacy and identify places for improvements. Then, we explore enhancements and develop an ADMM method for the M2M coordination that optimizes congestion management. Specifically, our ADMM method can achieve a minimal cost that is the same as the cost obtained through a centralized model that optimizes multiple markets altogether. Our final case studies, across a comprehensive set of multi-area benchmark instances, demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed ADMM algorithm for the M2M process. Meanwhile, we identify scenarios where the existing M2M process fails to provide solutions as a by-product. Finally, the algorithm is implemented in an open-source package UnitCommitment.jl for easy access by a broader audience.</description>

      <title>Safety Verification of Stochastic Systems: A Set-Erosion Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the safety verification problem for discrete-time stochastic systems. We propose an approach for safety verification termed set-erosion strategy that verifies the safety of a stochastic system on a safe set through the safety of its associated deterministic system on an eroded subset. The amount of erosion is captured by the probabilistic bound on the distance between stochastic trajectories and their associated deterministic counterpart. Building on our recent work [1], we establish a sharp probabilistic bound on this distance. Combining this bound with the set-erosion strategy, we establish a general framework for the safety verification of stochastic systems. Our method is flexible and can work effectively with any deterministic safety verification techniques. We exemplify our method by incorporating barrier functions designed for deterministic safety verification, obtaining barrier certificates much tighter than existing results. Numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the efficacy and superiority of our method.</description>

      <title>A Miniature Potentiostat for Impedance Spectroscopy and Cyclic Voltammetry in Wearable Sensor Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A potentiostat is an analytical device and a crucial component in electrochemical instruments used for studying chemical reaction mechanisms, with potential applications in early diagnosis of disease or critical health conditions. Conventional potentiostats are typically benchtop devices designed for laboratory use, whereas a wearable potentiostat can be interfaced with biochemical sensors for disease diagnostics at home. This work presents a low-power potentiostat designed to connect with a sensor array consisting of eight to ten working electrodes. The potentiostat is capable of running Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy and Cyclic Voltammetry. The system is powered by lithium-ion batteries and uses Bluetooth for data transmission to the user. A single ARM M4 microcontroller, integrated with a Bluetooth low-energy radio module, controls the entire system. The accuracy, reliability, and power efficiency of the potentiostat were evaluated and compared against existing commercial benchtop potentiostats. Additionally, we have outlined future steps to enhance circuit miniaturization and power efficiency, aiming to develop fully integrated wearable sensing devices comparable in size to a wristwatch.</description>

      <title>Guaranteed-Safe MPPI Through Composite Control Barrier Functions for Efficient Sampling in Multi-Constrained Robotic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new guaranteed-safe model predictive path integral (GS-MPPI) control algorithm that enhances sample efficiency in nonlinear systems with multiple safety constraints. The approach use a composite control barrier function (CBF) along with MPPI to ensure all sampled trajectories are provably safe. We first construct a single CBF constraint from multiple safety constraints with potentially differing relative degrees, using it to create a safe closed-form control law. This safe control is then integrated into the system dynamics, allowing MPPI to optimize over exclusively safe trajectories. The method not only improves computational efficiency but also addresses the myopic behavior often associated with CBFs by incorporating long-term performance considerations. We demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness through simulations of a nonholonomic ground robot subject to position and speed constraints, showcasing safety and performance.</description>

      <title>Physics-Constrained Taylor Neural Networks for Learning and Control of Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven approaches are increasingly popular for identifying dynamical systems due to improved accuracy and availability of sensor data. However, relying solely on data for identification does not guarantee that the identified systems will maintain their physical properties or that the predicted models will generalize well. In this paper, we propose a novel method for system identification by integrating a neural network as the first-order derivative of a Taylor series expansion instead of learning a dynamical function directly. This approach, called Monotonic Taylor Neural Networks (MTNN), aims to ensure monotonic properties of dynamical systems by constraining the conditions for the output of the neural networks model to be either always non-positive or non-negative. These conditions are constructed in two ways: by designing a new neural network architecture or by regularizing the loss function for training. The proposed method demonstrates better performance compared to methods without constraints on the monotonic properties of the systems when tested with experimental data from two real-world systems, including HVAC and TCLab. Furthermore, MTNN shows good performance in an actual control application when using a model predictive controller for a nonlinear MIMO system, illustrating the practical applications of this method.</description>

      <title>Equivalence between Geometric Frequency and Lagrange Derivative</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper shows the equivalence between the geometric frequency of an electric quantity, namely, voltage and current, and the Lagrange derivative of a stream-line of a fluid. The geometric frequency is a concept recently proposed by the author and is a generalization of the instantaneous frequency, a quantity that is particularly important for the analysis and the control of electric power systems. On the other hand, the Lagrange derivative is mostly utilized in fluid dynamics and helps decomposing the time derivative into various components. The paper shows how these components relate to the elements of the geometric frequency. The paper also shows, through a variety of numerical examples, how the decomposition of the Lagrange derivative helps identifying the distortion of the waveform of a measured electric quantity and how this information can be utilized to classify system operating conditions.</description>

      <title>Cross-Domain Comparative Analysis of Digital Twins and Universalised Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digitalisation is one of the main drivers of most economic sectors nowadays and the digital twin, as a reification of digitalisation for complex systems has attracted much attention from both academics and industry. There have been studies focusing on digital twins in a specific sector while there are few exercising insightful comparisons of digital twins from different domains. Considering the digital twinning is a cross-domain transformation, it is beneficial to establish the principles of universality and variation that can explain similarities and differences in any digital twins. This paper first delivers a comparative analysis of digital twins in five domains through a six-dimensional characterisation framework. Then, by departing from the correlations among the domain-specific DT development, a cross-domain Digital Twin Platform-as-a-Service (DT-PaaS) is proposed to universalise the common process, tools and applications, meanwhile being inclusive of variations of every digital twin instance. As a centralised data, modeling and service platform, it is expected to break the barriers between domains by enabling the cross-domain digital twin data sharing, interoperability and development synergy and tackle some complex global challenges such as climate challenge, net zero, pandemics, etc.</description>

      <title>Cellular Network Densification: a System-level Analysis with IAB, NCR and RIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the number of user equipments increases in fifth generation (5G) and beyond, it is desired to densify the cellular network with auxiliary nodes assisting the base stations. Examples of these nodes are integrated access and backhaul (IAB) nodes, network-controlled repeaters (NCRs) and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). In this context, this work presents a system level overview of these three nodes. Moreover, this work evaluates through simulations the impact of network planning aiming at enhancing the performance of a network used to cover an outdoor sport event. We show that, in the considered scenario, in general, IAB nodes provide an improved signal to interference-plus-noise ratio and throughput, compared to NCRs and RISs. However, there are situations where NCR outperforms IAB due to higher level of interference caused by the latter. Finally, we show that the deployment of these nodes in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) also achieves performance gains due to their aerial mobility. However, UAV constraints related to aerial deployment may prevent these nodes from reaching results as good as the ones achieved by their stationary deployment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The onset of old age brings physiological and mental changes, with anxiety and depression being common mental disorders that can trigger other health issues and reduce lifespan. However, due to a global shortage of mental health professionals, combined with a growing population and limited awareness, these disorders often go undiagnosed. Music therapy offers a reliable method to address psychological, emotional, and cognitive needs. This paper presents an approach that monitors anxiety and depression symptoms in real time using low-complexity body sensors, followed by automated personalised music therapy, reducing the dependence on therapists and improving mental health care accessibility.</description>

      <title>Toward Neuronal Implementations of Delayed Optimal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Animal sensorimotor behavior is frequently modeled using optimal controllers. However, it is unclear how the neuronal circuits within the animal's nervous system implement optimal controller-like behavior. In this work, we study the question of implementing a delayed linear quadratic regulator with linear dynamical "neurons" on a muscle model. We show that for any second-order controller, there are three minimal neural circuit configurations that implement the same controller. Furthermore, the firing rate characteristics of each circuit can vary drastically, even as the overall controller behavior is preserved. Along the way, we introduce concepts that bridge controller realizations to neural implementations that are compatible with known neuronal delay structures.</description>

      <title>Equality Constrained Diffusion for Direct Trajectory Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent success of diffusion-based generative models in image and natural language processing has ignited interest in diffusion-based trajectory optimization for nonlinear control systems. Existing methods cannot, however, handle the nonlinear equality constraints necessary for direct trajectory optimization. As a result, diffusion-based trajectory optimizers are currently limited to shooting methods, where the nonlinear dynamics are enforced by forward rollouts. This precludes many of the benefits enjoyed by direct methods, including flexible state constraints, reduced numerical sensitivity, and easy initial guess specification. In this paper, we present a method for diffusion-based optimization with equality constraints. This allows us to perform direct trajectory optimization, enforcing dynamic feasibility with constraints rather than rollouts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first diffusion-based optimization algorithm that supports the general nonlinear equality constraints required for direct trajectory optimization.</description>

Abstract: Attitude estimation is crucial in aerospace engineering, robotics, and virtual reality applications, but faces difficulties due to nonlinear system dynamics and sensor limitations. This paper addresses the challenge of attitude estimation using quaternion-based adaptive right invariant extended Kalman filtering (RI-EKF) that integrates data from inertial and magnetometer sensors. Our approach applies the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate noise covariance, exploiting RI-EKF symmetry properties. We analyze the adaptive RI-EKF's stability, convergence, and accuracy, validating its performance through simulations and comparison with the left invariant EKF. Monte Carlo simulations validate the effectiveness of our noise covariance estimation technique across various window lengths.</description>

      <title>Barycentric rational approximation for learning the index of a dynamical system from limited data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the task of data-driven identification of dynamical systems, specifically for systems whose behavior at large frequencies is non-standard, as encoded by a non-trivial relative degree of the transfer function or, alternatively, a non-trivial index of a corresponding realization as a descriptor system. We develop novel surrogate modeling strategies that allow state-of-the-art rational approximation algorithms (e.g., AAA and vector fitting) to better handle data coming from such systems with non-trivial relative degree. Our contribution is twofold. On one hand, we describe a strategy to build rational surrogate models with prescribed relative degree, with the objective of mirroring the high-frequency behavior of the high-fidelity problem, when known. The surrogate model's desired degree is achieved through constraints on its barycentric coefficients, rather than through ad-hoc modifications of the rational form. On the other hand, we present a degree-identification routine that allows one to estimate the unknown relative degree of a system from low-frequency data. By identifying the degree of the system that generated the data, we can build a surrogate model that, in addition to matching the data well (at low frequencies), has enhanced extrapolation capabilities (at high frequencies). We showcase the effectiveness and robustness of the newly proposed method through a suite of numerical tests.</description>

      <title>Safe Navigation in Unmapped Environments for Robotic Systems with Input Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an approach for navigation and control in unmapped environments under input and state constraints using a composite control barrier function (CBF). We consider the scenario where real-time perception feedback (e.g., LiDAR) is used online to construct a local CBF that models local state constraints (e.g., local safety constraints such as obstacles) in the a priori unmapped environment. The approach employs a soft-maximum function to synthesize a single time-varying CBF from the N most recently obtained local CBFs. Next, the input constraints are transformed into controller-state constraints through the use of control dynamics. Then, we use a soft-minimum function to compose the input constraints with the time-varying CBF that models the a priori unmapped environment. This composition yields a single relaxed CBF, which is used in a constrained optimization to obtain an optimal control that satisfies the state and input constraints. The approach is validated through simulations of a nonholonomic ground robot that is equipped with LiDAR and navigates an unmapped environment. The robot successfully navigates the environment while avoiding the a priori unmapped obstacles and satisfying both speed and input constraints.</description>

      <title>Lossy Cooperative UAV Relaying Networks: Outage Probability Analysis and Location Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, performance of a lossy cooperative unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) relay communication system is analyzed. In this system, the UAV relay adopts lossy forward (LF) strategy and the receiver has certain distortion requirements for the received information. For the system described above, we first derive the achievable rate distortion region of the system. Then, on the basis of the region analysis, the system outage probability when the channel suffers Nakagami-$m$ fading is analyzed. Finally, we design an optimal relay position identification algorithm based on the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm, which determines the optimal UAV position to minimize the outage probability. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can optimize the UAV position and reduce the system outage probability effectively.</description>

      <title>Resource Allocation Based on Optimal Transport Theory in ISAC-Enabled Multi-UAV Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the resource allocation optimization for cooperative communication with non-cooperative localization in integrated sensing and communications (ISAC)-enabled multi-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) cooperative networks. Our goal is to maximize the weighted sum of the system's average sum rate and the localization quality of service (QoS) by jointly optimizing cell association, communication power allocation, and sensing power allocation. Since the formulated problem is a mixed-integer nonconvex problem, we propose the alternating iteration algorithm based on optimal transport theory (AIBOT) to solve the optimization problem more effectively. Simulation results demonstrate that the AIBOT can improve the system sum rate by nearly 12% and reduce the localization Cr'amer-Rao bound (CRB) by almost 29% compared to benchmark algorithms.</description>

      <title>SEAL: SEmantic-Augmented Imitation Learning via Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hierarchical Imitation Learning (HIL) is a promising approach for tackling long-horizon decision-making tasks. While it is a challenging task due to the lack of detailed supervisory labels for sub-goal learning, and reliance on hundreds to thousands of expert demonstrations. In this work, we introduce SEAL, a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs)'s powerful semantic and world knowledge for both specifying sub-goal space and pre-labeling states to semantically meaningful sub-goal representations without prior knowledge of task hierarchies. SEAL employs a dual-encoder structure, combining supervised LLM-guided sub-goal learning with unsupervised Vector Quantization (VQ) for more robust sub-goal representations. Additionally, SEAL incorporates a transition-augmented low-level planner for improved adaptation to sub-goal transitions. Our experiments demonstrate that SEAL outperforms state-of-the-art HIL methods and LLM-based planning approaches, particularly in settings with small expert datasets and complex long-horizon tasks.</description>

      <title>C-MORL: Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning through Efficient Discovery of Pareto Front</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) excels at handling rapidly changing preferences in tasks that involve multiple criteria, even for unseen preferences. However, previous dominating MORL methods typically generate a fixed policy set or preference-conditioned policy through multiple training iterations exclusively for sampled preference vectors, and cannot ensure the efficient discovery of the Pareto front. Furthermore, integrating preferences into the input of policy or value functions presents scalability challenges, in particular as the dimension of the state and preference space grow, which can complicate the learning process and hinder the algorithm's performance on more complex tasks. To address these issues, we propose a two-stage Pareto front discovery algorithm called Constrained MORL (C-MORL), which serves as a seamless bridge between constrained policy optimization and MORL. Concretely, a set of policies is trained in parallel in the initialization stage, with each optimized towards its individual preference over the multiple objectives. Then, to fill the remaining vacancies in the Pareto front, the constrained optimization steps are employed to maximize one objective while constraining the other objectives to exceed a predefined threshold. Empirically, compared to recent advancements in MORL methods, our algorithm achieves more consistent and superior performances in terms of hypervolume, expected utility, and sparsity on both discrete and continuous control tasks, especially with numerous objectives (up to nine objectives in our experiments).</description>

      <title>Optimal $H_{\infty}$ control based on stable manifold of discounted Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The optimal \(H_{\infty}\) control problem over an infinite time horizon, which incorporates a performance function with a discount factor \(e^{-\alpha t}\) (\(\alpha &gt; 0\)), is important in various fields. Solving this optimal \(H_{\infty}\) control problem is equivalent to addressing a discounted Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) partial differential equation. In this paper, we first provide a precise estimate for the discount factor \(\alpha\) that ensures the existence of a nonnegative stabilizing solution to the HJI equation. This stabilizing solution corresponds to the stable manifold of the characteristic system of the HJI equation, which is a contact Hamiltonian system due to the presence of the discount factor. Secondly, we demonstrate that approximating the optimal controller in a natural manner results in a closed-loop system with a finite \(L_2\)-gain that is nearly less than the gain of the original system. Thirdly, based on the theoretical results obtained, we propose a deep learning algorithm to approximate the optimal controller using the stable manifold of the contact Hamiltonian system associated with the HJI equation. Finally, we apply our method to the \(H_{\infty}\) control of the Allen-Cahn equation to illustrate its effectiveness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This letter introduces a machine-learning approach to learning the semantic dynamics of correlated systems with different control rules and dynamics. By leveraging the Koopman operator in an autoencoder (AE) framework, the system's state evolution is linearized in the latent space using a dynamic semantic Koopman (DSK) model, capturing the baseline semantic dynamics. Signal temporal logic (STL) is incorporated through a logical semantic Koopman (LSK) model to encode system-specific control rules. These models form the proposed logical Koopman AE framework that reduces communication costs while improving state prediction accuracy and control performance, showing a 91.65% reduction in communication samples and significant performance gains in simulation.</description>

      <title>Load Balancing-based Topology Adaptation for Integrated Access and Backhaul Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrated access and backhaul (IAB) technology is a flexible solution for network densification. IAB nodes can also be deployed in moving nodes such as buses and trains, i.e., mobile IAB (mIAB). As mIAB nodes can move around the coverage area, the connection between mIAB nodes and their parent macro base stations (BSs), IAB donor, is sometimes required to change in order to keep an acceptable backhaul link, the so called topology adaptation (TA). The change from one IAB donor to another may strongly impact the system load distribution, possibly causing unsatisfactory backhaul service due to the lack of radio resources. Based on this, TA should consider both backhaul link quality and traffic load. In this work, we propose a load balancing algorithm based on TA for IAB networks, and compare it with an approach in which TA is triggered based on reference signal received power (RSRP) only. The results show that our proposed algorithm improves the passengers worst connections throughput in uplink (UL) and, more modestly, also in downlink (DL), without impairing the pedestrian quality of service (QoS) significantly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancements in autonomous vehicle software present both opportunities and challenges, especially in enhancing road safety. The primary objective of autonomous vehicles is to reduce accident rates through improved safety measures. However, the integration of new algorithms into the autonomous vehicle, such as Artificial Intelligence methods, raises concerns about the compliance with established safety regulations. This paper introduces a novel software architecture based on behavior trees, aligned with established standards and designed to supervise vehicle functional safety in real time. It specifically addresses the integration of algorithms into industrial road vehicles, adhering to the ISO 26262. The proposed supervision methodology involves the detection of hazards and compliance with functional and technical safety requirements when a hazard arises. This methodology, implemented in this study in a Renault M\'egane (currently at SAE level 3 of automation), not only guarantees compliance with safety standards, but also paves the way for safer and more reliable autonomous driving technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Swarm robotics, or very large-scale robotics (VLSR), has many meaningful applications for complicated tasks. However, the complexity of motion control and energy costs stack up quickly as the number of robots increases. In addressing this problem, our previous studies have formulated various methods employing macroscopic and microscopic approaches. These methods enable microscopic robots to adhere to a reference Gaussian mixture model (GMM) distribution observed at the macroscopic scale. As a result, optimizing the macroscopic level will result in an optimal overall result. However, all these methods require systematic and global generation of Gaussian components (GCs) within obstacle-free areas to construct the GMM trajectories. This work utilizes centroidal Voronoi tessellation to generate GCs methodically. Consequently, it demonstrates performance improvement while also ensuring consistency and reliability.</description>

      <title>IC3M: In-Car Multimodal Multi-object Monitoring for Abnormal Status of Both Driver and Passengers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, in-car monitoring has emerged as a promising technology for detecting early-stage abnormal status of the driver and providing timely alerts to prevent traffic accidents. Although training models with multimodal data enhances the reliability of abnormal status detection, the scarcity of labeled data and the imbalance of class distribution impede the extraction of critical abnormal state features, significantly deteriorating training performance. Furthermore, missing modalities due to environment and hardware limitations further exacerbate the challenge of abnormal status identification. More importantly, monitoring abnormal health conditions of passengers, particularly in elderly care, is of paramount importance but remains underexplored. To address these challenges, we introduce our IC3M, an efficient camera-rotation-based multimodal framework for monitoring both driver and passengers in a car. Our IC3M comprises two key modules: an adaptive threshold pseudo-labeling strategy and a missing modality reconstruction. The former customizes pseudo-labeling thresholds for different classes based on the class distribution, generating class-balanced pseudo labels to guide model training effectively, while the latter leverages crossmodality relationships learned from limited labels to accurately recover missing modalities by distribution transferring from available modalities. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that IC3M outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks in accuracy, precision, and recall while exhibiting superior robustness under limited labeled data and severe missing modality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time delays are ubiquitous in industry, and they must be accounted for when designing control strategies. However, numerical optimal control (NOC) of delay differential equations (DDEs) is challenging because it requires specialized discretization methods and the time delays may depend on the manipulated inputs or state variables. Therefore, in this work, we propose to linearize the delayed states around the current time. This results in a set of implicit differential equations, and we compare the steady states and the corresponding stability criteria of the DDEs and the approximate system. Furthermore, we propose a simultaneous approach for NOC of DDEs based on the linearization, and we discretize the approximate system using Euler's implicit method. Finally, we present a numerical example involving a molten salt nuclear fission reactor.</description>

      <title>Custom Non-Linear Model Predictive Control for Obstacle Avoidance in Indoor and Outdoor Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Navigating complex environments requires Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and autonomous systems to perform trajectory tracking and obstacle avoidance in real-time. While many control strategies have effectively utilized linear approximations, addressing the non-linear dynamics of UAV, especially in obstacle-dense environments, remains a key challenge that requires further research. This paper introduces a Non-linear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) framework for the DJI Matrice 100, addressing these challenges by using a dynamic model and B-spline interpolation for smooth reference trajectories, ensuring minimal deviation while respecting safety constraints. The framework supports various trajectory types and employs a penalty-based cost function for control accuracy in tight maneuvers. The framework utilizes CasADi for efficient real-time optimization, enabling the UAV to maintain robust operation even under tight computational constraints. Simulation and real-world indoor and outdoor experiments demonstrated the NMPC ability to adapt to disturbances, resulting in smooth, collision-free navigation.</description>

      <title>Feedback Linearizable Discretizations of Second Order Mechanical Systems using Retraction Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18422v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mechanical systems are most often described by a set of continuous-time, nonlinear, second-order differential equations (SODEs) of a particular structure governed by the covariant derivative. The digital implementation of controllers for such systems requires a discrete model of the system and hence requires numerical discretization schemes. Feedback linearizability of such sampled systems, however, depends on the discretization scheme employed. In this article, we utilize retraction maps and their lifts to construct feedback linearizable discretizations for SODEs which can be applied to many mechanical systems.</description>

      <title>Closed-Loop Sensitivity Identification for Cross-Directional Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At Diamond Light Source, the UK's national synchrotron facility, electron beam disturbances are attenuated by the fast orbit feedback (FOFB), which controls a cross-directional (CD) system with hundreds of inputs and outputs. Due to the inability to measure the disturbances in real-time, the closed-loop sensitivity of the FOFB can only be evaluated indirectly, making it difficult to compare FOFB algorithms and detect faults. Existing methods rely on comparing open-loop with closed-loop measurements, but they are prone to instabilities and actuator saturation because of the system's strong directionality. Here, we introduce a reference signal to estimate the complementary sensitivity in closed loop. By decoupling the system into sets of single-input, single-output (SISO) systems, the reference signal is designed mode-by-mode, accommodating the system's strong directionality. Additionally, a lower bound on the reference amplitude is derived to limit the estimation error in the presence of disturbances and measurement noise. This method enables the use of SISO system identification techniques, making it suitable for large-scale systems. It not only facilitates performance estimation of ill-conditioned CD systems in closed-loop but also provides a signal for fault detection. The potential applications of this approach extend to other CD systems, such as papermaking, steel rolling, or battery manufacturing processes.</description>

      <title>An Artificial Neural Network based approach for Harmonic Component Prediction in a Distribution Line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the increasing use of nonlinear devices in both generation and consumption of power, it is essential that we develop accurate and quick control for active filters to suppress harmonics. Time delays between input and output are catastrophic for such filters which rely on real-time operation. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are capable of modeling complex nonlinear systems through adjustments in their learned parameters. Once properly trained, they can produce highly accurate predictions at an instantaneous time frame. Leveraging these qualities, various complex control systems may be replaced or aided by neural networks to provide quick and precise responses. This paper proposes an ANN-based approach for the prediction of individual harmonic components using minimal inputs. By extracting and analyzing the nature of harmonic component magnitudes obtained from the survey of a particular area through real-time measurements, a sequential pattern in their occurrence is observed. Various neural network architectures are trained using the collected data and their performances are evaluated. The best-performing model, whose losses are minimal, is then used to observe the harmonic cancellation for multiple unseen cases through a simplified simulation in hardware-in-the-loop. These neural network structures, which produce instantaneous and accurate outputs, are effective in harmonic filtering.</description>

      <title>A Deep Generative Learning Approach for Two-stage Adaptive Robust Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-stage adaptive robust optimization (ARO) is a powerful approach for planning under uncertainty, balancing first-stage decisions with recourse decisions made after uncertainty is realized. To account for uncertainty, modelers typically define a simple uncertainty set over which potential outcomes are considered. However, classical methods for defining these sets unintentionally capture a wide range of unrealistic outcomes, resulting in overly-conservative and costly planning in anticipation of unlikely contingencies. In this work, we introduce AGRO, a solution algorithm that performs adversarial generation for two-stage adaptive robust optimization using a variational autoencoder. AGRO generates high-dimensional contingencies that are simultaneously adversarial and realistic, improving the robustness of first-stage decisions at a lower planning cost than standard methods. To ensure generated contingencies lie in high-density regions of the uncertainty distribution, AGRO defines a tight uncertainty set as the image of "latent" uncertainty sets under the VAE decoding transformation. Projected gradient ascent is then used to maximize recourse costs over the latent uncertainty sets by leveraging differentiable optimization methods. We demonstrate the cost-efficiency of AGRO by applying it to both a synthetic production-distribution problem and a real-world power system expansion setting. We show that AGRO outperforms the standard column-and-constraint algorithm by up to 1.8% in production-distribution planning and up to 11.6% in power system expansion.</description>

      <title>Identification For Control Based on Neural Networks: Approximately Linearizable Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15858v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents a control-oriented identification scheme for efficient control design and stability analysis of nonlinear systems. Neural networks are used to identify a discrete-time nonlinear state-space model to approximate time-domain input-output behavior of a nonlinear system. The network is constructed such that the identified model is approximately linearizable by feedback, ensuring that the control law trivially follows from the learning stage. After the identification and quasi-linearization procedures, linear control theory comes at hand to design robust controllers and study stability of the closed-loop system. The effectiveness and interest of the methodology are illustrated throughout the paper on popular benchmarks for system identification.</description>

      <title>Absolute centrality in a signed Friedkin-Johnsen based model: a graphical characterisation of influence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the evolution of opinions governed by a Friedkin Johnsen (FJ) based model in arbitrary network structures with signed interactions. The agents contributing to the opinion formation are characterised as being influential. Initially, the agents are classified as opinion leaders and followers based on network connectivity and the nature of interactions. However, the addition of stubbornness leads to interesting behaviours wherein a non influential agent can now become influential and vice versa. Thereafter, a signal flow graph (SFG) based method is proposed to quantify the influence of an influential agents' opinions. Additionally, it helps illustrate the role played by network topology in shaping the final opinions of the agents. Based on this analysis, the absolute centrality measure is proposed to determine the overall influence of all the agents in the network. Unlike most of the existing measures, it is applicable to any network structure and considers the effect of stubbornness and antagonism. Examples are presented throughout the paper to illustrate and validate these results.</description>

      <title>Solution of the Probabilistic Lambert Problem: Connections with Optimal Mass Transport, Schr\"odinger Bridge and Reaction-Diffusion PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07961v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lambert problem originated in orbital mechanics. It concerns with determining the initial velocity for a boundary value problem involving the dynamical constraint due to gravitational potential with additional time horizon and endpoint position constraints. Its solution has application in transferring a spacecraft from a given initial to a given terminal position within prescribed flight time via velocity control. We consider a probabilistic variant of the Lambert problem where the knowledge of the endpoint constraints in position vectors are replaced by the knowledge of their respective joint probability density functions. We show that the Lambert problem with endpoint joint probability density constraints is a generalized optimal mass transport (OMT) problem, thereby connecting this classical astrodynamics problem with a burgeoning area of research in modern stochastic control and stochastic machine learning. This newfound connection allows us to rigorously establish the existence and uniqueness of solution for the probabilistic Lambert problem. The same connection also helps to numerically solve the probabilistic Lambert problem via diffusion regularization, i.e., by leveraging further connection of the OMT with the Schr\"odinger bridge problem (SBP). This also shows that the probabilistic Lambert problem with additive dynamic process noise is a generalized SBP, and can be solved numerically using the so-called Schr\"odinger factors, as we do in this work. Our analysis leads to solving a system of reaction-diffusion PDEs where the gravitational potential appears as the reaction rate.</description>

      <title>Stable Reduced-Rank VAR Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00237v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The vector autoregression (VAR) has been widely used in system identification, econometrics, natural science, and many other areas. However, when the state dimension becomes large the parameter dimension explodes. So rank reduced modelling is attractive and is well developed. But a fundamental requirement in almost all applications is stability of the fitted model. And this has not been addressed in the rank reduced case. Here, we develop, for the first time, a closed-form formula for an estimator of a rank reduced transition matrix which is guaranteed to be stable. We show that our estimator is consistent and asymptotically statistically efficient and illustrate it in comparative simulations.</description>

      <title>Residual-based Attention Physics-informed Neural Networks for Spatio-Temporal Ageing Assessment of Transformers Operated in Renewable Power Plants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06443v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformers are crucial for reliable and efficient power system operations, particularly in supporting the integration of renewable energy. Effective monitoring of transformer health is critical to maintain grid stability and performance. Thermal insulation ageing is a key transformer failure mode, which is generally tracked by monitoring the hotspot temperature (HST). However, HST measurement is complex, costly, and often estimated from indirect measurements. Existing HST models focus on space-agnostic thermal models, providing worst-case HST estimates. This article introduces a spatio-temporal model for transformer winding temperature and ageing estimation, which leverages physics-based partial differential equations (PDEs) with data-driven Neural Networks (NN) in a Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) configuration to improve prediction accuracy and acquire spatio-temporal resolution. The computational accuracy of the PINN model is improved through the implementation of the Residual-Based Attention (PINN-RBA) scheme that accelerates the PINN model convergence. The PINN-RBA model is benchmarked against self-adaptive attention schemes and classical vanilla PINN configurations. For the first time, PINN based oil temperature predictions are used to estimate spatio-temporal transformer winding temperature values, validated through PDE numerical solution and fiber optic sensor measurements. Furthermore, the spatio-temporal transformer ageing model is inferred, which supports transformer health management decision-making. Results are validated with a distribution transformer operating on a floating photovoltaic power plant.</description>

      <title>Data-driven distributionally robust MPC for systems with multiplicative noise: A semi-infinite semi-definite programming approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15193v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article introduces a novel distributionally robust model predictive control (DRMPC) algorithm for a specific class of controlled dynamical systems where the disturbance multiplies the state and control variables. These classes of systems arise in mathematical finance, where the paradigm of distributionally robust optimization (DRO) fits perfectly, and this serves as the primary motivation for this work. We recast the optimal control problem (OCP) as a semi-definite program with an infinite number of constraints, making the ensuing optimization problem a \emph{semi-infinite semi-definite program} (SI-SDP). To numerically solve the SI-SDP, we advance an approach for solving convex semi-infinite programs (SIPs) to SI-SDPs and, subsequently, solve the DRMPC problem. A numerical example is provided to show the effectiveness of the algorithm.</description>
