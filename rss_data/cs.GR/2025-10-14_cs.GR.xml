      <title>CLoD-GS: Continuous Level-of-Detail via 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Level of Detail (LoD) is a fundamental technique in real-time computer graphics for managing the rendering costs of complex scenes while preserving visual fidelity. Traditionally, LoD is implemented using discrete levels (DLoD), where multiple, distinct versions of a model are swapped out at different distances. This long-standing paradigm, however, suffers from two major drawbacks: it requires significant storage for multiple model copies and causes jarring visual ``popping" artifacts during transitions, degrading the user experience. We argue that the explicit, primitive-based nature of the emerging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) technique enables a more ideal paradigm: Continuous LoD (CLoD). A CLoD approach facilitates smooth, seamless quality scaling within a single, unified model, thereby circumventing the core problems of DLOD. To this end, we introduce CLoD-GS, a framework that integrates a continuous LoD mechanism directly into a 3DGS representation. Our method introduces a learnable, distance-dependent decay parameter for each Gaussian primitive, which dynamically adjusts its opacity based on viewpoint proximity. This allows for the progressive and smooth filtering of less significant primitives, effectively creating a continuous spectrum of detail within one model. To train this model to be robust across all distances, we introduce a virtual distance scaling mechanism and a novel coarse-to-fine training strategy with rendered point count regularization. Our approach not only eliminates the storage overhead and visual artifacts of discrete methods but also reduces the primitive count and memory footprint of the final model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CLoD-GS achieves smooth, quality-scalable rendering from a single model, delivering high-fidelity results across a wide range of performance targets.</description>

      <title>Unlocking Thickness Modeling for Codimensional Contact Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we analyze and address a fundamental restriction that blocks the reliable application of codimensional yarn-level and shell models with thickness, to simulate real-world woven and knit fabrics. As discretizations refine toward practical and accurate physical modeling, such models can generate non-physical contact forces with stencil-neighboring elements in the simulation mesh, leading to severe locking artifacts. While not well-documented in the literature, this restriction has so far been addressed with two alternatives with undesirable tradeoffs. One option is to restrict the mesh to coarse resolutions, however, this eliminates the possibility of accurate (and consistent) resolution simulations across real-world material variations. A second alternative instead seeks to cull contact pairs that can create such locking forces in the first place. This relaxes resolution restrictions but compromise robustness. Culling can and will generate unacceptable and unpredictable geometric intersections and tunneling that destroys weaving and knitting structures and cause unrecoverable pull-throughs. We address these challenges to simulating real-world materials with a new and practical contact-processing model for thickened codimensional simulation, that removes resolution restrictions, while guaranteeing contact-locking-free, non-intersecting simulations. We demonstrate the application of our model across a wide range of previously unavailable simulation scenarios, with real-world material yarn and fabric parameters and patterns, challenging simulation conditions and mesh resolutions, and both rod and shell models, integrated with the IPC barrier.</description>

      <title>GraphTracer: Graph-Guided Failure Tracing in LLM Agents for Robust Multi-Turn Deep Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent systems powered by Large Language Models excel at complex tasks through coordinated collaboration, yet they face high failure rates in multi-turn deep search scenarios. Existing temporal attribution methods struggle to accurately diagnose root causes, particularly when errors propagate across multiple agents. Attempts to automate failure attribution by analyzing action sequences remain ineffective due to their inability to account for information dependencies that span agents. This paper identifies two core challenges: \textit{(i) distinguishing symptoms from root causes in multi-agent error propagation}, and \textit{(ii) tracing information dependencies beyond temporal order}. To address these issues, we introduce \textbf{GraphTracer}, a framework that redefines failure attribution through information flow analysis. GraphTracer constructs Information Dependency Graphs (IDGs) to explicitly capture how agents reference and build on prior outputs. It localizes root causes by tracing through these dependency structures instead of relying on temporal sequences. GraphTracer also uses graph-aware synthetic data generation to target critical nodes, creating realistic failure scenarios. Evaluations on the Who\&amp;When benchmark and integration into production systems demonstrate that GraphTracer-8B achieves up to 18.18\% higher attribution accuracy compared to state-of-the-art models and enables 4.8\% to 14.2\% performance improvements in deployed multi-agent frameworks, establishing a robust solution for multi-agent system debugging.</description>

      <title>D3MAS: Decompose, Deduce, and Distribute for Enhanced Knowledge Sharing in Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent systems powered by large language models exhibit strong capabilities in collaborative problem-solving. However, these systems suffer from substantial knowledge redundancy. Agents duplicate efforts in retrieval and reasoning processes. This inefficiency stems from a deeper issue: current architectures lack mechanisms to ensure agents share minimal sufficient information at each operational stage. Empirical analysis reveals an average knowledge duplication rate of 47.3\% across agent communications. We propose D3MAS (Decompose, Deduce, and Distribute), a hierarchical coordination framework addressing redundancy through structural design rather than explicit optimization. The framework organizes collaboration across three coordinated layers. Task decomposition filters irrelevant sub-problems early. Collaborative reasoning captures complementary inference paths across agents. Distributed memory provides access to non-redundant knowledge. These layers coordinate through structured message passing in a unified heterogeneous graph. This cross-layer alignment ensures information remains aligned with actual task needs. Experiments on four challenging datasets show that D3MAS consistently improves reasoning accuracy by 8.7\% to 15.6\% and reduces knowledge redundancy by 46\% on average.</description>

      <title>VLM-Guided Adaptive Negative Prompting for Creative Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Creative generation is the synthesis of new, surprising, and valuable samples that reflect user intent yet cannot be envisioned in advance. This task aims to extend human imagination, enabling the discovery of visual concepts that exist in the unexplored spaces between familiar domains. While text-to-image diffusion models excel at rendering photorealistic scenes that faithfully match user prompts, they still struggle to generate genuinely novel content. Existing approaches to enhance generative creativity either rely on interpolation of image features, which restricts exploration to predefined categories, or require time-intensive procedures such as embedding optimization or model fine-tuning. We propose VLM-Guided Adaptive Negative-Prompting, a training-free, inference-time method that promotes creative image generation while preserving the validity of the generated object. Our approach utilizes a vision-language model (VLM) that analyzes intermediate outputs of the generation process and adaptively steers it away from conventional visual concepts, encouraging the emergence of novel and surprising outputs. We evaluate creativity through both novelty and validity, using statistical metrics in the CLIP embedding space. Through extensive experiments, we show consistent gains in creative novelty with negligible computational overhead. Moreover, unlike existing methods that primarily generate single objects, our approach extends to complex scenarios, such as generating coherent sets of creative objects and preserving creativity within elaborate compositional prompts. Our method integrates seamlessly into existing diffusion pipelines, offering a practical route to producing creative outputs that venture beyond the constraints of textual descriptions.</description>

      <title>MATStruct: High-Quality Medial Mesh Computation via Structure-aware Variational Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel optimization framework for computing the medial axis transform that simultaneously preserves the medial structure and ensures high medial mesh quality. The medial structure, consisting of interconnected sheets, seams, and junctions, provides a natural volumetric decomposition of a 3D shape. Our method introduces a structure-aware, particle-based optimization pipeline guided by the restricted power diagram (RPD), which partitions the input volume into convex cells whose dual encodes the connectivity of the medial mesh. Structure-awareness is enforced through a spherical quadratic error metric (SQEM) projection that constrains the movement of medial spheres, while a Gaussian kernel energy encourages an even spatial distribution. Compared to feature-preserving methods such as MATFP and MATTopo, our approach produces cleaner and more accurate medial structures with significantly improved mesh quality. In contrast to voxel-based, point-cloud-based, and variational methods, our framework is the first to integrate structural awareness into the optimization process, yielding medial meshes with superior geometric fidelity, topological correctness, and explicit structural decomposition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fire We Share proposes a care-centered, consequence-aware visualization framework for engaging with wildfire data not as static metrics, but as living archives of ecological and social entanglement. By combining plants-inspired data forms, event-based mapping, and narrative layering, the project foregrounds fire as a shared temporal condition-one that cuts across natural cycles and human systems. Rather than simplifying wildfire data into digestible visuals, The Fire We Share reimagines it as a textured, wounded archive-embodied, relational, and radically ethical.</description>

      <title>HyperAgent: Leveraging Hypergraphs for Topology Optimization in Multi-Agent Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language model-powered multi-agent systems have demonstrated remarkable collective intelligence through effective communication. However, existing approaches face two primary challenges: (i) \textit{Ineffective group collaboration modeling}, as they rely on pairwise edge representations in graph structures, limiting their ability to capture relationships among multiple agents; and (ii) \textit{Limited task-adaptiveness in communication topology design}, leading to excessive communication cost for simple tasks and insufficient coordination for complex scenarios. These issues restrict the scalability and practical deployment of adaptive collaboration frameworks. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{HyperAgent}, a hypergraph-based framework that optimizes communication topologies and effectively captures group collaboration patterns using direct hyperedge representations. Unlike edge-based approaches, HyperAgent uses hyperedges to link multiple agents within the same subtask and employs hypergraph convolutional layers to achieve one-step information aggregation in collaboration groups. Additionally, it incorporates a variational autoencoder framework with sparsity regularization to dynamically adjust hypergraph topologies based on task complexity. Experiments highlight the superiority of HyperAgent in both performance and efficiency. For instance, on GSM8K, HyperAgent achieves 95.07\% accuracy while reducing token consumption by 25.33\%, demonstrating the potential of hypergraph-based optimization for multi-agent communication.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Low-Effort Training Data Generation for Urban Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synthetic datasets are widely used for training urban scene recognition models, but even highly realistic renderings show a noticeable gap to real imagery. This gap is particularly pronounced when adapting to a specific target domain, such as Cityscapes, where differences in architecture, vegetation, object appearance, and camera characteristics limit downstream performance. Closing this gap with more detailed 3D modelling would require expensive asset and scene design, defeating the purpose of low-cost labelled data. To address this, we present a new framework that adapts an off-the-shelf diffusion model to a target domain using only imperfect pseudo-labels. Once trained, it generates high-fidelity, target-aligned images from semantic maps of any synthetic dataset, including low-effort sources created in hours rather than months. The method filters suboptimal generations, rectifies image-label misalignments, and standardises semantics across datasets, transforming weak synthetic data into competitive real-domain training sets. Experiments on five synthetic datasets and two real target datasets show segmentation gains of up to +8.0%pt. mIoU over state-of-the-art translation methods, making rapidly constructed synthetic datasets as effective as high-effort, time-intensive synthetic datasets requiring extensive manual design. This work highlights a valuable collaborative paradigm where fast semantic prototyping, combined with generative models, enables scalable, high-quality training data creation for urban scene understanding.</description>

      <title>TC-GS: A Faster Gaussian Splatting Module Utilizing Tensor Cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24796v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) renders pixels by rasterizing Gaussian primitives, where conditional alpha-blending dominates the computational cost in the rendering pipeline. This paper proposes TC-GS, an algorithm-independent universal module that expands the applicability of Tensor Core (TCU) for 3DGS, leading to substantial speedups and seamless integration into existing 3DGS optimization frameworks. The key innovation lies in mapping alpha computation to matrix multiplication, fully utilizing otherwise idle TCUs in existing 3DGS implementations. TC-GS provides plug-and-play acceleration for existing top-tier acceleration algorithms and integrates seamlessly with rendering pipeline designs, such as Gaussian compression and redundancy elimination algorithms. Additionally, we introduce a global-to-local coordinate transformation to mitigate rounding errors from quadratic terms of pixel coordinates caused by Tensor Core half-precision computation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method maintains rendering quality while providing an additional 2.18x speedup over existing Gaussian acceleration algorithms, thereby achieving a total acceleration of up to 5.6x.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Study of Different Edit Distance-Based Methods for Feature Tracking using Merge Trees on Time-Varying Scalar Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Feature tracking in time-varying scalar fields is a fundamental task in scientific computing. Topological descriptors, which summarize important features of data, have proved to be viable tools to facilitate this task. The merge tree is a topological descriptor that captures the connectivity behaviors of the sub- or superlevel sets of a scalar field. Edit distances between merge trees play a vital role in effective temporal data tracking. Existing methods to compute them fall into two main classes, namely whether they are dependent or independent of the branch decomposition. These two classes represent the most prominent approaches for producing tracking results. In this paper, we compare four different merge tree edit distance-based methods for feature tracking. We demonstrate that these methods yield distinct results with both analytical and real-world data sets. Furthermore, we investigate how these results vary and identify the factors that influence them. Our experiments reveal significant differences in tracked features over time, even among those produced by techniques within the same category.</description>

      <title>Diverse Text-to-Image Generation via Contrastive Noise Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03813v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have demonstrated impressive performance in generating high-fidelity images, largely enabled by text-guided inference. However, this advantage often comes with a critical drawback: limited diversity, as outputs tend to collapse into similar modes under strong text guidance. Existing approaches typically optimize intermediate latents or text conditions during inference, but these methods deliver only modest gains or remain sensitive to hyperparameter tuning. In this work, we introduce Contrastive Noise Optimization, a simple yet effective method that addresses the diversity issue from a distinct perspective. Unlike prior techniques that adapt intermediate latents, our approach shapes the initial noise to promote diverse outputs. Specifically, we develop a contrastive loss defined in the Tweedie data space and optimize a batch of noise latents. Our contrastive optimization repels instances within the batch to maximize diversity while keeping them anchored to a reference sample to preserve fidelity. We further provide theoretical insights into the mechanism of this preprocessing to substantiate its effectiveness. Extensive experiments across multiple T2I backbones demonstrate that our approach achieves a superior quality-diversity Pareto frontier while remaining robust to hyperparameter choices.</description>

      <title>Local MAP Sampling for Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07343v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS) provides a principled Bayesian approach to inverse problems by sampling from $p(x_0 \mid y)$. However, in practice, the goal of inverse problem solving is not to cover the posterior but to recover the most accurate reconstruction, where optimization-based diffusion solvers often excel despite lacking a clear probabilistic foundation. We introduce Local MAP Sampling (LMAPS), a new inference framework that iteratively solving local MAP subproblems along the diffusion trajectory. This perspective clarifies their connection to global MAP estimation and DPS, offering a unified probabilistic interpretation for optimization-based methods. Building on this foundation, we develop practical algorithms with a probabilistically interpretable covariance approximation, a reformulated objective for stability and interpretability, and a gradient approximation for non-differentiable operators. Across a broad set of image restoration and scientific tasks, LMAPS achieves state-of-the-art performance, including $\geq 2$ dB gains on motion deblurring, JPEG restoration, and quantization, and $&gt;1.5$ dB improvements on inverse scattering benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Baking Gaussian Splatting into Diffusion Denoiser for Fast and Scalable Single-stage Image-to-3D Generation and Reconstruction</title>

Abstract: Existing feedforward image-to-3D methods mainly rely on 2D multi-view diffusion models that cannot guarantee 3D consistency. These methods easily collapse when changing the prompt view direction and mainly handle object-centric cases. In this paper, we propose a novel single-stage 3D diffusion model, DiffusionGS, for object generation and scene reconstruction from a single view. DiffusionGS directly outputs 3D Gaussian point clouds at each timestep to enforce view consistency and allow the model to generate robustly given prompt views of any directions, beyond object-centric inputs. Plus, to improve the capability and generality of DiffusionGS, we scale up 3D training data by developing a scene-object mixed training strategy. Experiments show that DiffusionGS yields improvements of 2.20 dB/23.25 and 1.34 dB/19.16 in PSNR/FID for objects and scenes than the state-of-the-art methods, without depth estimator. Plus, our method enjoys over 5$\times$ faster speed ($\sim$6s on an A100 GPU). Our Project page at https://caiyuanhao1998.github.io/project/DiffusionGS/ shows the video and interactive results. The code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/caiyuanhao1998/Open-DiffusionGS</description>

      <title>Real-Time Position-Aware View Synthesis from Single-View Input</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14005v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in view synthesis have significantly enhanced immersive experiences across various computer graphics and multimedia applications, including telepresence and entertainment. By enabling the generation of new perspectives from a single input view, view synthesis allows users to better perceive and interact with their environment. However, many state-of-the-art methods, while achieving high visual quality, face limitations in real-time performance, which makes them less suitable for live applications where low latency is critical. In this paper, we present a lightweight, position-aware network designed for real-time view synthesis from a single input image and a target camera pose. The proposed framework consists of a Position Aware Embedding, which efficiently maps positional information from the target pose to generate high dimensional feature maps. These feature maps, along with the input image, are fed into a Rendering Network that merges features from dual encoder branches to resolve both high and low level details, producing a realistic new view of the scene. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior efficiency and visual quality compared to existing approaches, particularly in handling complex translational movements without explicit geometric operations like warping. This work marks a step toward enabling real-time live and interactive telepresence applications.</description>

      <title>Generating Multi-Image Synthetic Data for Text-to-Image Customization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Customization of text-to-image models enables users to insert new concepts or objects and generate them in unseen settings. Existing methods either rely on comparatively expensive test-time optimization or train encoders on single-image datasets without multi-image supervision, which can limit image quality. We propose a simple approach to address these challenges. We first leverage existing text-to-image models and 3D datasets to create a high-quality Synthetic Customization Dataset (SynCD) consisting of multiple images of the same object in different lighting, backgrounds, and poses. Using this dataset, we train an encoder-based model that incorporates fine-grained visual details from reference images via a shared attention mechanism. Finally, we propose an inference technique that normalizes text and image guidance vectors to mitigate overexposure issues in sampled images. Through extensive experiments, we show that our encoder-based model, trained on SynCD, and with the proposed inference algorithm, improves upon existing encoder-based methods on standard customization benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Surface-Aware Distilled 3D Semantic Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18254v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many 3D tasks such as pose alignment, animation, motion transfer, and 3D reconstruction rely on establishing correspondences between 3D shapes. This challenge has recently been approached by pairwise matching of semantic features from pre-trained vision models. However, despite their power, these features struggle to differentiate instances of the same semantic class such as ``left hand'' versus ``right hand'' which leads to substantial mapping errors. To solve this, we learn a surface-aware embedding space that is robust to these ambiguities while facilitating shared mapping for an entire family of 3D shapes. Importantly, our approach is self-supervised and requires only a small number of unpaired training meshes to infer features for new possibly imperfect 3D shapes at test time. We achieve this by introducing a contrastive loss that preserves the semantic content of the features distilled from foundational models while disambiguating features located far apart on the shape's surface. We observe superior performance in correspondence matching benchmarks and enable downstream applications including 2D-to-3D and 3D-to-3D texture transfer, in-part segmentation, pose alignment, and motion transfer in low-data regimes. Unlike previous pairwise approaches, our solution constructs a joint embedding space, where both seen and unseen 3D shapes are implicitly aligned without further optimization. The code is available at https://graphics.tudelft.nl/SurfaceAware3DFeatures.</description>

      <title>Large-Area Fabrication-Aware Computational Diffractive Optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22313v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Differentiable optics, as an emerging paradigm that jointly optimizes optics and (optional) image processing algorithms, has made innovative optical designs possible across a broad range of applications. Many of these systems utilize diffractive optical components (DOEs) for holography, PSF engineering, or wavefront shaping. Existing approaches have, however, mostly remained limited to laboratory prototypes, owing to a large quality gap between simulation and manufactured devices. We aim at lifting the fundamental technical barriers to the practical use of learned diffractive optical systems. To this end, we propose a fabrication-aware design pipeline for diffractive optics fabricated by direct-write grayscale lithography followed by nano-imprinting replication, which is directly suited for inexpensive mass production of large area designs. We propose a super-resolved neural lithography model that can accurately predict the 3D geometry generated by the fabrication process. This model can be seamlessly integrated into existing differentiable optics frameworks, enabling fabrication-aware, end-to-end optimization of computational optical systems. To tackle the computational challenges, we also devise tensor-parallel compute framework centered on distributing large-scale FFT computation across many GPUs. As such, we demonstrate large scale diffractive optics designs up to 32.16 mm $\times$ 21.44 mm, simulated on grids of up to 128,640 by 85,760 feature points. We find adequate agreement between simulation and fabricated prototypes for applications such as holography and PSF engineering. We also achieve high image quality from an imaging system comprised only of a single DOE, with images processed only by a Wiener filter utilizing the simulation PSF. We believe our findings lift the fabrication limitations for real-world applications of diffractive optics and differentiable optical design.</description>

      <title>Capsule: Efficient Player Isolation for Datacenters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11483</link>

Abstract: Cloud gaming is increasingly popular. A challenge for cloud provider is to keep datacenter utilization high: a non-trivial task due to application variety. These applications come in different shapes and sizes. So do cloud datacenter resources, e.g., CPUs, GPUs, NPUs. Part of the challenge stems from game engines being predominantly designed to run only one player. For example, one player in a lightweight game might utilize only a fraction of the cloud server GPU. The remaining GPU capacity will be left underutilized, an undesired outcome for the cloud provider.
  We introduce Capsule, a mechanism to seamlessly share one GPU, and other cloud servers resources, across multiple players. Sharing makes the cost of multiple players sublinear. We implemented Capsule in O3DE, a popular open source game engine. Our evaluations show that Capsule increases datacenter resource utilization by accommodating up to 2.25x more players, without degrading player gaming experience. This is the product of Capsule using up to 1.43x less GPU, 3.11x less VRAM, 3.7x less CPU, and 3.87x less RAM compared to the baseline. Capsule is also application agnostic. We ran four applications on Capsule-based O3DE with no application changes. Our experiences with four applications, three servers with different hardware specifications, including the one with four GPUs, and multi-server cluster show that Capsule design can be adopted by other game engines to increase datacenter utilization across cloud providers.</description>

      <title>FSFSplatter: Build Surface and Novel Views with Sparse-Views within 2min</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02691v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gaussian Splatting has become a leading reconstruction technique, known for its high-quality novel view synthesis and detailed reconstruction. However, most existing methods require dense, calibrated views. Reconstructing from free sparse images often leads to poor surface due to limited overlap and overfitting. We introduce FSFSplatter, a new approach for fast surface reconstruction from free sparse images. Our method integrates end-to-end dense Gaussian initialization, camera parameter estimation, and geometry-enhanced scene optimization. Specifically, FSFSplatter employs a large Transformer to encode multi-view images and generates a dense and geometrically consistent Gaussian scene initialization via a self-splitting Gaussian head. It eliminates local floaters through contribution-based pruning and mitigates overfitting to limited views by leveraging depth and multi-view feature supervision with differentiable camera parameters during rapid optimization. FSFSplatter outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on widely used DTU, Replica, and BlendedMVS datasets.</description>
