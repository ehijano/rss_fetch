      <title>Extended Linearity in the High-Order Wavefront Sensor for the Roman Coronagraph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The Coronagraphic Instrument (CGI) on the Roman Space Telescope aims for unprecedented contrast for direct imaging of exoplanets, serving as a critical tech demo for future missions like the Habitable Worlds Observatory. This requires advanced wavefront sensing and control (WFS&amp;C), including pair-wise (PW) probing for electric field estimation in the focal plane. Optimizing PW probe designs is vital to enhance performance and reduce overheads.
  Aims. We investigate different probe designs for PW probing in the context of Roman CGI. We compare classic sinc-sinc-sine probes, previously introduced single-actuator probes, and newly proposed sharp sinc probes in terms of effectiveness in focal-plane modulation, resilience to non-linearities, and overall impact on convergence and contrast.
  Methods. We conducted experiments on the THD2 testbed, configured to emulate Roman CGI with a custom Hybrid Lyot Coronagraph. We evaluated the three probe designs through WFS&amp;C experiments using PW probing for estimation and electric field conjugation for wavefront correction. Simulations and hardware tests assessed contrast convergence and the impact of non-linear terms at varying probe amplitudes. We also explored low-flux scenarios to demonstrate the use of high-amplitude probes in reducing exposure times or closing the loop on faint targets.
  Results. Single-actuator probes emerged as the most effective, with faster convergence and reduced non-linear effects at high amplitudes. Sharp sinc probes performed moderately well but were less robust than single actuators. High-amplitude single-actuator probes showed advantages in dark-hole digging under low-flux, through faster iterations without significant degradation in contrast. The THD2 testbed, operating at contrasts analogous to Roman CGI, validated our results and underscored its role as a critical platform for advancing WFS&amp;C techniques.</description>

      <title>3D printing for teaching and exploration in astronomy for individuals with blindness/visual impairment: textured representations of imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astronomy, a captivating field that draws upon science, mathematics, and engineering, has traditionally relied on visual representations to convey the wonders of the cosmos. While this approach effectively engages the sighted population, the use of imagery can exclude individuals with blindness or visual impairment (B/VI). Astronomical research is incorporated into press releases, media, outreach efforts, and educational systems aimed at enhancing public interest and often skill in science, but visual materials can hamper a population with B/VI. This paper explores the potential of 3D printing as an assistive technology providing an alternative to imagery. We produced textured 3D prints of astronomical research data from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Useability assessment of materials is an important phase of production before integration into structured programs, and we used a multi-phased approach in our prior research to create and test appropriate textures for 3D astronomical prints. This paper describes the last step of reviewing our 3D prints through informal useability sessions with diverse individuals. The assessment indicated our 3D prints provide reliable, informative representations of astronomical data appropriate for public use especially for public information, outreach programs, and science education for individuals with BVI.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of Plate Analysis, an algorithm for precise relative astrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astrometry plays a crucial role in understanding the structure, dynamics, and evolution of celestial objects by providing precise measurements of their positions and motions. We propose a new approach to wide-field, relative astrometry, Plate Analysis. Plate Analysis is an innovative algorithm that estimates stellar coordinates and corrects geometric distortion based on precise reference sources, without relying on dedicated calibration fields. It is implemented as a probabilistic framework using Stochastic Variational Inference to efficiently optimize the numerous parameters involved in the model.
  The methodology was tested through a simplified simulation designed after the Galactic center survey of the JASMINE mission. This simulation, called the JASMINE mini-mock survey, covered three years of observation with 100 satellite orbits, providing a comprehensive dataset for evaluating the performance of Plate Analysis. Although the observation model incorporated more than 30,000 parameters, the parameters were efficiently optimized through Plate Analysis. The results showed that the estimated coordinates closely match the expected stellar motions, with an average positional error of about $70\,\mathrm{\mu as}$. These findings validate the potential of Plate Analysis for precise wide-field astrometric applications, offering significant insights into improving the accuracy of stellar dynamics measurements.</description>

      <title>The Mini-SiTian Array: real-bogus classification using deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Mini-SiTian (MST) project is a pathfinder for China's next-generation large-scale time-domain survey, SiTian, aimed at discovering variable stars, transients, and explosive events. MST generates hundreds of thousands of transient alerts every night, approximately 99\% of which are false alarms, posing a significant challenge to its scientific goals. To mitigate the impact of false positives, we propose a deep learning-based solution and systematically evaluate thirteen convolutional neural networks. The results show that ResNet achieves exceptional specificity (99.70\%),
  EfficientNet achieves the highest recall rate (98.68\%), and DenseNet provides balanced performance with a recall rate of 94.55\% and specificity of 98.66\%. Leveraging these complementary strengths, we developed a bagging-based ensemble classifier that integrates ResNet18, DenseNet121, and EfficientNet\_B0 using a soft voting strategy. This classifier achieved the best AUC value (0.9961) among all models, with a recall rate of 95.37\% and specificity of 99.25\%. It has now been successfully deployed in the MST real-time data processing pipeline. Validation using 5,000 practically processed samples with a classification threshold of 0.798 showed that the classifier achieved 88.31\% accuracy, 91.89\% recall rate, and 99.82\% specificity, confirming its effectiveness and robustness under real application conditions.</description>

      <title>The Mini-SiTian Array: the mini-SiTian Realtime Image Processing pipeline (STRIP)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides a comprehensive introduction to the Mini-SiTian Real-Time Image Processing pipeline (STRIP) and evaluates its operational performance. The STRIP pipeline is specifically designed for real-time alert triggering and light curve generation for transient sources. By applying the STRIP pipeline to both simulated and real observational data of the Mini-SiTian survey, it successfully identified various types of variable sources, including stellar flares, supernovae, variable stars, and asteroids, while meeting requirements of reduction speed within 5 minutes. For the real observational dataset, the pipeline detected 1 flare event, 127 variable stars, and 14 asteroids from three monitored sky regions. Additionally, two datasets were generated: one, a real-bogus training dataset comprising 218,818 training samples, and the other, a variable star light curve dataset with 421 instances. These datasets will be used to train machine learning algorithms, which are planned for future integration into STRIP.</description>

      <title>The Mini-SiTian Array: White Paper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper outlines the scientific goals and observational strategies of the Mini-SiTian array. Mounted at Xinglong Observatory, the Mini-SiTian array consists of three 30 cm telescopes and has been in operation since 2022. The large field of view, combined with the capability for multi-band photometric observations, enables the Mini-SiTian array to perform rapid follow-up observations to identify optical counterparts of gravitational waves, capture the early light curves of tidal disruption events and supernovae, and monitor stellar flares, Be star outbursts, and cataclysmic variable stars, although its limiting magnitude is not very deep. By collaborating with the Xinglong 2.16-m telescope and leveraging a real-time image processing pipeline, simultaneous photometric and spectroscopic observations could be performed to reveal their underlying physical mechanisms. The observational and research experience provide critical guidance for the implementation of the full-scale SiTian project in the future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The SiTian project, designed to utilize 60 telescopes distributed across multiple sites in China, is a next-generation time-domain survey initiative. As a pathfinder for the SiTian project, the Mini-SiTian (MST) has been proposed and implemented to test the SiTian's brain and data pipeline, and to evaluate the feasibility of its technology and science cases. Mounted at the Xinglong Observatory, the MST project comprises three 30 cm telescopes and has been operated since Nov. 2022. Each telescope of the MST possesses a large field of view, covering $2.29^{\circ}$ $\times$ $1.53^{\circ}$ FOV, and is equipped with $g'$, $r'$ and $i'$ filters, respectively. Acting as the pioneer of the forthcoming SiTian project, the MST is dedicated to the discovery of variable stars, transients, and outburst events, and has already obtained some interesting scientific results. In this paper, we will summarize the first-two-year operation of the MST project.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The SiTian Project represents a groundbreaking initiative in astronomy, aiming to deploy a global network of telescopes, each with a 1-meter aperture, for comprehensive time-domain sky surveys. The network's innovative architecture features multiple observational nodes, each comprising three strategically aligned telescopes equipped with filters. This design enables three-color (g, r, i) channel imaging within each node, facilitating precise and coordinated observations. As a pathfinder to the full-scale project, the Mini-SiTian Project serves as the scientific and technological validation platform, utilizing three 30-centimeter aperture telescopes to validate the methodologies and technologies planned for the broader SiTian network. This paper focuses on the development and implementation of the Master Control System (MCS),and the central command hub for the Mini-SiTian array. The MCS is designed to facilitate seamless communication with the SiTian Brain, the project's central processing and decision-making unit, while ensuring accurate task allocation, real-time status monitoring, and optimized observational workflows. The system adopts a robust architecture that separates front-end and back-end functionalities.A key innovation of the MCS is its ability to dynamically adjust observation plans in response to transient source alerts, enabling rapid and coordinated scans of target sky regions...(abridged)</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a pathfinder of the SiTian project, the Mini-SiTian (MST) array, employed three commercial CMOS cameras, represents a next-generation, cost-effective optical time-domain survey project. This paper focuses primarily on the precise data processing pipeline designed for wide-field, CMOS-based devices, including the removal of instrumental effects, astrometry, photometry, and flux calibration. When applying this pipeline to approximately 3000 observations taken in the Field 02 (f02) region by MST, the results demonstrate a remarkable astrometric precision of approximately 70--80\,mas (about 0.1\,pixel), an impressive calibration accuracy of approximately 1\,mmag in the MST zero points, and a photometric accuracy of about 4\,mmag for bright stars. Our studies demonstrate that MST CMOS can achieve photometric accuracy comparable to that of CCDs, highlighting the feasibility of large-scale CMOS-based optical time-domain surveys and their potential applications for cost optimization in future large-scale time-domain surveys, like the SiTian project.</description>

      <title>The Mini-SiTian Array: Evaluation Camera System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Mini-SiTian project, which is the pathfinder for the SiTian project, utilizes three 30 cm telescopes equipped with commercial CMOS cameras (ZWO ASI6200MM Pro) to simulate large-area time-domain survey. Due to the avoidance of the traditional mechanical shutter, the CMOS camera is favorable in time-domain survey projects. In the future, the SiTian telescope array will employ a two-by-two scientific-grade mosaic CMOS camera to survey a 10,000-degree square area every 30 minutes. Therefore, the performance of CMOS directly determines the detection capability of SiTian telescopes for transient sources, and a comprehensive understanding of the performance of CMOS cameras is crucial. In this research, laboratory testing was conducted to thoroughly evaluate three cameras by assessing several critical parameters, including bias stability, dark current, pixel anomalies, linearity, gain, and read noise. We find exceptional short-term bias stability with standard deviations below 0.02 ADU, negligible dark current of approximately 0.002 e$^{-}$ pixel$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$ at $0^\circ\text{C}$, and excellent linearity with nonlinearity consistently below $\pm$ 0.5\%, and a small proportion (0.06\% to 0.08\%) of pixels with anomalous responses. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates uniform gain values across all cameras, ranging from 0.252 to 0.255 e$^{-}$ ADU$^{-1}$, with low readout noise, measured to be below 1.6 e$^{-}$ using conventional methods. We also propose a novel method for pixel-level gain and read noise calculation for CMOS sensors, which revealed a narrow gain distribution and a low median read noise of 1.028 e$^-$ for one of the cameras. The laboratory testing of the ZWO ASI6200MM Pro cameras indicates their potential to meet the requirements of time-domain surveys for the Mini-SiTian project.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-domain astronomy is one of the most important areas. Large sky area, deep-field, and short timescale are the priority of time-domain observations. SiTian is an ambitious ground-based project processing all sky optical monitoring, aiming for sky-survey timescale of less than 1 day. It is developed by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, an integrated network of dozens of 1-m-class telescopes deployed worldwide. The Mini-SiTian Telescope Array is carried out for demonstrations on optical design, group scheduling, and software pipeline developments, to overcome the high technical and financial difficulties of SiTian project. One array contains three 300 mm F/3 telescope, with FOV of 5 degrees over 400-1000 nm wavelength range. The Mini-SiTian Telescope Array is now under commissioning in Xinglong Observatory, and a perfect platform for technical research and educational purposes.</description>

      <title>How to write competitive proposals and job applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Writing proposals and job applications is arguably one of the most important tasks in the career of a scientist. The proposed ideas must be scientifically compelling, but how a proposal is planned, written, and presented can make an enormous difference. This Perspective is the third in a series aimed at training the writing skills of professional astronomers. In the first two papers we concentrated on the writing of papers, here we concentrate on how proposals and job applications can be optimally written and presented. We discuss how to select where to propose or apply, how to optimise your writing, and add notes on the potential use of artificial intelligence tools. This guide is aimed primarily at more junior researchers, but we hope that our observations and suggestions may also be helpful for more experienced applicants, as well as for reviewers and funding agencies.</description>

      <title>STRAUSS: Sonification Tools &amp; Resources for Analysis Using Sound Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sonification, or conveying data using non-verbal audio, is a relatively niche but growing approach for presenting data across multiple specialist domains including astronomy, climate science, and beyond. The STRAUSS Python package aims to provide such a tool, which builds upon previous approaches to provide a powerful means to explore different ways of expressing data, with fine control over the output audio and its format. STRAUSS is a free, open source (FOSS) package, designed to allow flexible and effective sonification to be integrated into data workflows, in analogy to widely used visualisation packages. The remit of STRAUSS is broad; it is intended to be able to bridge between ad-hoc solutions for sonifying very particular datasets, and highly technical compositional and sound-design tools that are not optimised for sonification, or may have a steep learning curve. The code offers a range of approaches to sonification for a variety of contexts (e.g. science education, science communication, technical data analysis, etc). To this end, STRAUSS is packaged with a number of examples of different sonification approaches, and preset configurations to support "low-barrier, high-ceiling" approach. STRAUSS has been used to produce both educational resources and analysis tools.</description>

      <title>Autonomous optical navigation for DESTINY+: Enhancing misalignment robustness in flyby observations with a rotating telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DESTINY+ is an upcoming JAXA Epsilon medium-class mission to flyby multiple asteroids including Phaethon. As an asteroid flyby observation instrument, a telescope mechanically capable of single-axis rotation, named TCAP, is mounted on the spacecraft to track and observe the target asteroids during flyby. As in past flyby missions utilizing rotating telescopes, TCAP is also used as a navigation camera for autonomous optical navigation during the closest-approach phase. To mitigate the degradation of the navigation accuracy, past missions performed calibration of the navigation camera's alignment before starting optical navigation. However, such calibration requires significant operational time to complete and imposes constraints on the operation sequence. From the above background, the DESTINY+ team has studied the possibility of reducing operational costs by allowing TCAP alignment errors to remain. This paper describes an autonomous optical navigation algorithm robust to the misalignment of rotating telescopes, proposed in this context. In the proposed method, the misalignment of the telescope is estimated simultaneously with the spacecraft's orbit relative to the flyby target. To deal with the nonlinearity between the misalignment and the observation value, the proposed method utilizes the unscented Kalman filter, instead of the extended Kalman filter widely used in past studies. The proposed method was evaluated with numerical simulations on a PC and with hardware-in-the-loop simulation, taking the Phaethon flyby in the DESTINY+ mission as an example. The validation results suggest that the proposed method can mitigate the misalignment-induced degradation of the optical navigation accuracy with reasonable computational costs suited for onboard computers.</description>

      <title>Initial Conditions from Galaxies: Machine-Learning Subgrid Correction to Standard Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a hybrid method for reconstructing the primordial density from late-time halos and galaxies. Our approach involves two steps: (1) apply standard Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) reconstruction to recover the large-scale features in the primordial density field and (2) train a deep learning model to learn small-scale corrections on partitioned subgrids of the full volume. At inference, this correction is then convolved across the full survey volume, enabling scaling to large survey volumes. We train our method on both mock halo catalogs and mock galaxy catalogs in both configuration and redshift space from the Quijote $1(h^{-1}\,\mathrm{Gpc})^3$ simulation suite. When evaluated on held-out simulations, our combined approach significantly improves the reconstruction cross-correlation coefficient with the true initial density field and remains robust to moderate model misspecification. Additionally, we show that models trained on $1(h^{-1}\,\mathrm{Gpc})^3$ can be applied to larger boxes--e.g., $(3h^{-1}\,\mathrm{Gpc})^3$--without retraining. Finally, we perform a Fisher analysis on our method's recovery of the BAO peak, and find that it significantly improves the error on the acoustic scale relative to standard BAO reconstruction. Ultimately, this method robustly captures nonlinearities and bias without sacrificing large-scale accuracy, and its flexibility to handle arbitrarily large volumes without escalating computational requirements makes it especially promising for large-volume surveys like DESI.</description>

      <title>Thermal Desorption Kinetics, Binding Energies, and Entrapment of Methyl Mercaptan Ices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Organosulfur species are potential major carriers of sulfur in the interstellar medium, as well as interesting ingredients in prebiotic chemistry. The most fundamental question regarding these species is under which conditions they reside in the gas versus solid phase. Here, we characterize the thermal desorption kinetics, binding energies, and entrapment of the organosulfur methyl mercaptan (CH$_3$SH, or MeSH) in different ice environments, comparing them with those of methanol (CH$_3$OH, or MeOH) ices. The derived multi-layer (pure MeSH-MeSH) and sub-monolayer (layered MeSH-H$_2$O) binding energies are surprisingly similar, corresponding to snow line locations where the disk midplane temperature is ~105 K. In both H$_2$O-dominated and more realistic H$_2$O:CO$_2$-dominated ices, 100% of the MeSH is entrapped, almost exclusively desorbing at the molecular volcano desorption peak, indicating that MeSH is retained at the water snow line if initially mixed with water ice during formation. Additionally, the presence of MeSH in an ice mixture enhances the entrapment of CO$_2$ and MeOH (up to 100%) until the onset of volcano desorption; without MeSH, both desorb at their respective pure desorption temperatures and also co-desorb with water. Compared to MeOH, MeSH binds less well to water, explaining why MeSH escapes during water ice crystallization rather than co-desorbing with water. These results show the larger relative size of MeSH compared to MeOH significantly impacts its ability to bind to water and its entrapment efficiency. Therefore, molecular size plays an important role in the adsorption and retention of S-bearing organics and, in turn, other volatiles in ices.</description>

      <title>General Framework for Array Noise Analysis and Noise Performance of a Two-Element Interferometer With a Mutual-Coupling Canceler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article investigates the noise performance of a two-element phased array and interferometer containing a recently introduced self-interference canceler, which in the context of this work acts as a mutual-coupling canceler. To this end, a general framework is proposed to permit noise analysis of this network and a large variety of other networks. The framework-based numerical analysis for a two-element-phased array shows that the addition of the canceler significantly increases the beam-equivalent noise temperature. For a two-element interferometer used in cosmology, this increase in noise temperature is still acceptable as the sky noise temperature in the 20-to-200 MHz band is high. When used in an interferometer, the canceler provides the ability to null mutual coherence at the interferometer output. The ability to provide matching to reduce the sensitivity of the null in mutual coherence to the phase of the 90deg hybrids in the canceler is discussed.</description>

      <title>Optimization of singly-charged particles identification with the AMS02 RICH detector by a machine learning method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AMS-02 is a detector currently in operation onboard the International Space Station (ISS). One of the main scientific goals of the spectrometer is the measurement of charged particle fluxes. The detector design makes possible the identification of particles and antiparticles by precise measurement of particle momentum in the AMS-02 Silicon Tracker, and velocity in the Cherenkov (RICH) detector. The RICH is able to measure the isotopic composition of the light elements (up to charge Z=5) in the kinetic energy range from a few GeV/n to about 10 GeV/n. However, the velocity reconstruction for charge 1 particles is particularly challenging due to the low number of photons they produce in the RICH detector which can lead to wrong event reconstruction. In this paper, we show the high potential of the Multilayer Perceptron deep learning model (MLP-BFGS) for identification of signal and the background due to interactions inside the AMS-02 detector, and to significantly improve particle identification by its mass.</description>

      <title>The Mini-SiTian Array: Light Curves Analysis of Asteroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The SiTian project, with its vast field of view, will become an ideal platform for asteroid scientific research. In this study, we develop a pipeline to analyze the photometry of asteroids and derive their periods from the data collected by the SiTian pathfinder project Mini-SiTian (MST). The pipeline is applied to the MST f02 region, a MST test region with a sky area of $2.29^{\circ} \times 1.53^{\circ}$. Rotation periods of 22 asteroids are derived by the obtained light curves analysis. Among them, there are 8 asteroids available in the Asteroid Lightcurve Photometry Database (ALCDEF), and 6 of them with more photometric points ($&gt;$200) have similar period parameters as the ones in ALCDEF. Additionally, the periods for 14 of these asteroids are newly obtained and are not listed in ALCDEF. This study demonstrates the feasibility of asteroid photometric research by the SiTian project. It shows that future observations from the SiTian project will provide even more photometry of asteroids, significantly increasing the number of available light curves. The potential vast photometric data of asteroids will help us to further understand the physics of asteroids, their material composition, and the formation and evolution of the solar system.</description>

      <title>Studying stellar populations in Omega Centauri with phylogenetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nature and formation history of our Galaxy's largest and most enigmatic stellar cluster, known as Omega Centauri (ocen) remains debated. Here, we offer a novel approach to disentangling the complex stellar populations within ocen based on phylogenetics methodologies from evolutionary biology. These include the Gaussian Mixture Model and Neighbor-Joining clustering algorithms applied to a set of chemical abundances of ocen stellar members. Instead of using the classical approach in astronomy of grouping them into separate populations, we focused on how the stars are related to each other. In this way, we could identify stars that likely formed in globular clusters versus those originating from prolonged in-situ star formation and how these stars interconnect. Our analysis supports the hypothesis that ocen might be a nuclear star cluster of a galaxy accreted by the Milky Way with a mass of about 10^9M_sun. Furthermore, we revealed the existence of a previously unidentified in-situ stellar population with a distinct chemical pattern unlike any known population found in the Milky Way to date. Our analysis of ocen is an example of the success of cross-disciplinary research and shows the vast potential of applying evolutionary biology tools to astronomical datasets, opening new avenues for understanding the chemical evolution of complex stellar systems.</description>

      <title>The Atacama Cosmology Telescope: Quantifying Atmospheric Emission above Cerro Toco</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At frequencies below 1\,Hz, fluctuations in atmospheric emission in the Chajnantor region in northern Chile are the primary source of interference for bolometric millimeter-wave observations. This paper focuses on characterizing these fluctuations using measurements from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment (APEX) water vapor radiometer. We show that the total precipitable water vapor (PWV) is not in general an accurate estimator of the level of fluctuations in millimeter-wave atmospheric emission. We also show that the microwave frequency spectrum of atmospheric fluctuations is in good agreement with predictions by the \texttt{am} code for frequency bands above 90~GHz. We introduce a new method for separating atmospheric and systematic fluctuations, allowing us to fit a robust atmospheric flatfield, as well as to study in the atmosphere in greater detail than previous works. We present a direct measurement of the temporal outer scale of turbulence of $\tau_0\approx50$\,s corresponding to a spatial scale of $L_0\approx500$\,m. Lastly, we show the variance of fluctuations in ACT's mm-wave bands correlate with the variance of fluctuations in PWV measured by APEX, even though the observatories are 6\,km apart and observe different lines of sight.</description>

      <title>Generalized Steppingstone Sampling: Efficient marginal likelihood estimation in gravitational wave analysis of Pulsar Timing Array data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14736v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Globally, Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) experiments have revealed evidence supporting an existing gravitational wave background (GWB) signal in the PTA data set. Apart from acquiring more observations, the sensitivity of PTA experiments can be increased by improving the accuracy of the noise modeling. In PTA data analysis, noise modeling is conducted primarily using Bayesian statistics, relying on the marginal likelihood and the Bayes factor to assess the evidence. We introduce generalized steppingstone (GSS) as an efficient and accurate marginal likelihood estimation method for the PTA-Bayesian framework. This method enables low-cost estimates with high accuracy, especially when comparing expensive models such as the Hellings-Downs (HD) model or the overlap reduction function model (ORF). We demonstrate the efficiency and the accuracy of GSS for model selection and evidence calculation by reevaluating the evidence of previous analyses from the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) 15 yr data set and the European PTA (EPTA) second data release. We find similar evidence for the GWB compared to the one reported by the NANOGrav 15-year data set. Compared to the evidence reported for the EPTA second data release, we find a substantial increase in evidence supporting GWB across all data sets.</description>

Abstract: Karabo is a versatile Python-based software framework simplifying research with radio astronomy data. It bundles existing software packages into a coherent whole to improve the ease of use of its components. Karabo includes useful abstractions, like strategies to scale and parallelize typical workloads or science-specific Python modules. The framework includes functionality to access datasets and mock observations to study the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) instruments and their expected accuracy. SKA will address problems in a wide range of fields of astronomy. We demonstrate the application of Karabo to some of the SKA science cases from HI intensity mapping, mock radio surveys, radio source detection, the epoch of re-ionisation and heliophysics. We discuss the capabilities and challenges of simulating large radio datasets in the context of SKA.</description>

      <title>Machine-assisted classification of potential biosignatures in earth-like exoplanets using low signal-to-noise ratio transmission spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19167v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The search for atmospheric biosignatures in Earth-like exoplanets is one of the most pressing challenges in observational astrobiology. Detecting biogenic gases in terrestrial planets requires high-resolution observations and long integration times. In this work, we developed and tested a general machine-learning methodology designed to classify transmission spectra with low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) according to their potential to contain biosignatures or bioindicators. To achieve this, we trained a set of models capable of classifying noisy transmission spectra (including stellar contamination) as containing methane, ozone, and/or water (multilabel classification), or simply as being interesting for follow-up observations (binary classification). The models were trained using $\sim10^7$ synthetic spectra of planets similar to TRAPPIST-1 e, generated with the package MultiREx. The trained algorithms correctly classified most of the test planets with transmission spectra having an SNR as low as 4, containing methane and/or ozone at mixing ratios similar to those of modern and Proterozoic Earth. Tests on realistic synthetic spectra, based on the current Earth's atmosphere, indicate that some of our models would classify most inhabited terrestrial planets observed with JWST/NIRSpec PRISM around M-dwarfs at distances similar to or smaller than that of TRAPPIST-1 e as likely to contain bioindicators, using 4 to 10 transits. These results have significant implications for the design of observing programs and future campaigns. Machine-assisted strategies, such as the one presented here, could greatly optimize the use of JWST resources for biosignature and bioindicator searches, while maximizing the chances of a real discovery through dedicated follow-up observations of promising candidates.</description>

      <title>Stellar Parameters for over Fifty Million stars from SMSS DR4 and Gaia DR3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09305v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an updated catalog of stellar parameters, including effective temperature, luminosity classification, and metallicity, for over fifty million stars from the SkyMapper Southern Survey (SMSS) DR4 and Gaia DR3. The accuracy of the derived parameters remains consistent with those achieved with SMSS DR2 using the same methods. Thanks to the advancements in SMSS DR4, photometric-metallicity estimates are now available for an unprecedented number of metal-poor stars. The catalog includes over 13 million metal-poor (MP; [Fe/H] $\leq -1$) stars, nearly three million very metal-poor (VMP; [Fe/H] $\leq -2.0$) stars, and approximately 120,000 extremely metal-poor (EMP; [Fe/H] $\leq -3.0$) stars - representing an increase by a factor of 4-6 compared to SMSS DR2. This catalog, combined with other stellar parameters obtained through our efforts, will be made available at https://nadc.china-vo.org/data/sports/ and https://zenodo.org/records/15108911.</description>

Abstract: Comets and asteroids have long captured human curiosity, and until recently, all documented examples belonged to our Solar System. That changed with the discovery of the first known interstellar object, 1I/2017 U1 ('Oumuamua), in 2017. Two years later, Gennady Borisov discovered a second interstellar object: 2I/Borisov. From its initial images, the object's diffuse appearance hinted at its cometary nature. To better understand the photometric evolution of comet 2I as it traveled through the inner Solar System, we compiled observations using medium-sized telescopes. This data is crucial for gaining insights into its size and composition, as well as how such objects, after millions of years in interstellar space, behave when exposed to the Sun's radiation. Given that 2I is the first interstellar comet ever observed, constraining its behavior is of great scientific interest. In this paper, we present photometric data gathered from observatories in Crimea and Catalonia, highlighting the importance of systematic photometric studies of interstellar objects using meter-class telescopes. Our observations showed a steady increase in the comet's brightness as it approached perihelion, likely due to the slow sublimation of ices. Over the pre-perihelion observation period, we did not detect any significant changes in magnitude. The analysis of observations reveals a steady increase in comet brightness as it approached perihelion, likely due to the sublimation of ices, with no observable outbursts during the five-month pre-perihelion period. Additionally, we discuss the challenges in ground-based observation of comets posed by light pollution today, particularly in urban areas, where visual observations are severely limited. Using sample surface brightness measurements, we demonstrate the impact of light pollution and outline the importance of systematic photometric studies for interstellar objects.</description>
