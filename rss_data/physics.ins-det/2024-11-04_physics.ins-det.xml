      <title>Design and Implementation of a Compact Analog Constant Fraction Discriminator for High-Resolution Timing in Gamma-Ray Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a custom analog front-end card designed for the read-out of PMTs coupled to lanthanum bromide scintillators. It integrates 16 discrete analog constant fraction discriminators (CFDs) on a compact 12x10 cm board, providing precise timing information for nuclear lifetime measurements. The design emphasizes cost-effectiveness, utilizing off-the-shelf discrete components, as well as compactness, achieved by using miniature coaxial connectors and cables as delay elements. The focus of this paper lies on the unusual and extremely minimalist analog shaper/discriminator design which is devised without operational amplifiers, making use of only a handful of RF transistors and LVDS receivers in place of comparators.</description>

      <title>Recent results and upgrade of the ALICE muon spectrometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ALICE experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is a multi-purpose particle detector, mainly focused on the study of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) in heavy-ion collisions. In the forward rapidity region, 2.5 $&lt;$ y $&lt;$ 4, ALICE is equipped with a muon spectrometer (MS), which allows to study quarkonia and open heavy-flavor particles, both key probes to investigate QGP properties.
  Although in LHC Run 1 and 2 many important results were achieved, the front absorber of the MS represented a limit to the physics program, due to the multiple scattering and energy loss in the material. To assess this limitation, a new forward vertex tracker (Muon Forward Tracker, MFT) was installed between the inner tracking system (ITS) and the front absorber. This has enhanced the MS physics performance, enabling the separation of prompt/non-prompt charmonium production at forward rapidity. It will also allow one to reduce the combinatorial background from semi-leptonic decays of kaons and pions. Finally, it will greatly improve the invariant-mass resolution of the low-mass dimuon pairs.
  Moreover, during the ongoing LHC Run 3, the rate of Pb\textendash{}Pb collisions has been increased from 10~kHz (in Run 2) up to 50~kHz, allowing to collect a data sample about 5 times larger than the one recorded in Run 2.
  This contribution will provide a brief overview of the MS upgrades and it will focus on the expected physics performance during the LHC Run 3. Some of the preliminary results already obtained will also be shown.</description>

      <title>Compact optical waveform generator with digital feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key requirement for quantum technologies based on atoms, ions, and molecules, is the ability to realize precise phase- and amplitude-controlled quantum operations via coherent laser pulses. However, for generating pulses on the sub-microsecond timescale, the characteristics of the optical and electronic components can introduce unwanted distortions that have a detrimental effect on the fidelity of quantum operations. In this paper, we present a compact arbitrary waveform generator that integrates a double-pass acousto-optic modulator for user-specified laser amplitude and phase modulations. Additionally, the module integrates an optical heterodyne detector to extract the precise laser pulse shape in real-time. The measured pulse shape is then fed into a digital feedback loop used to estimate the complex-valued transfer function and pre-distorted input pulses. We demonstrate the performance by generating shaped laser pulses suitable for realizing quantum logic gates with durations down to 180\,ns, requiring only a small number of feedback iterations.</description>

      <title>The Faint Particle Trigger for the IceCube Neutrino Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Faint Particle Trigger (FPT) was developed for the IceCube Neutrino Observatory to enhance the detection efficiency for faint signatures, produced by free Fractionally Charged Particles (FCP) predicted in several Standard Model (SM) extensions. A previous IceCube analysis has shown a reduced trigger efficiency in detecting FCP with a charge of e/3 due to the $\text{z}^2$ dependence of photon production processes. The FPT addresses this shortcoming by incorporating a so far unused hit type, so called SLC hits in the trigger decision. These are single isolated hits that are not used for triggering high energy signatures in IceCube. The FPT employs a sliding time window to analyze hits, utilizing four cuts to remove noise and bright background contributions. The noise contribution is effectively decreased to a few Hz by velocity and directional consistency of hit pairs. Furthermore a part of the dominating atmospheric muon rate is reduced, by requiring a minimum fraction of SLC hits in the trigger window. The FPT significantly improves the trigger efficiency by a factor of 1.55, compared to standard triggers, while increasing the event rate in IceCube by a factor 1.004. The trigger algorithm was tested and successfully deployed at South Pole in November 2023.</description>

      <title>Characterization of more than three years of in-orbit radiation damage of SiPMs on GRBAlpha and VZLUSAT-2 CubeSats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) are prone to radiation damage. With the increasing popularity of SiPMs among new spaceborne missions, especially on CubeSats, it is of paramount importance to characterize their performance in space environment. In this work, we report the in-orbit ageing of SiPM arrays, so-called multi-pixel photon counters (MPPCs), using measurements acquired by the GRBAlpha and VZLUSAT-2 CubeSats at low Earth orbit (LEO) spanning over three years, which in duration is unique. GRBAlpha is a 1U CubeSat launched on March 22, 2021, to a 550 km altitude sun-synchronous polar orbit (SSO) carrying on board a gamma-ray detector based on CsI(Tl) scintillator readout by eight MPPCs and regularly detecting gamma-ray transients such as gamma-ray bursts and solar flares in the energy range of ~30-900 keV. VZLUSAT-2 is a 3U CubeSat launched on January 13, 2022 also to a 550 km altitude SSO carrying on board, among other payloads, two gamma-ray detectors similar to the one on GRBAlpha. We have flight-proven the Hamamatsu MPPCs S13360-3050 PE and demonstrated that MPPCs, shielded by 2.5 mm of PbSb alloy, can be used in an LEO environment on a scientific mission lasting beyond three years. This manifests the potential of MPPCs being employed in future satellites.</description>

      <title>An FPGA-based Data Aggregator for the New ATLAS ITK Pixel DCS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24057v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The upcoming ATLAS Phase II upgrade mandates replacing the tracking system with the all-silicon Inner Tracker (ITK), featuring a pixel detector as its core element. The monitoring data of the new system will be aggregated from an on-detector ASIC, Monitoring Of Pixel System (MOPS), and channeled to the Detector Control System (DCS) via a newly developed FPGA-based interface known as MOPS-Hub.
  The mitigation strategies for addressing potential Single-Event Upset (SEU) issues in the new system, along with the proton irradiation results, are presented.</description>
