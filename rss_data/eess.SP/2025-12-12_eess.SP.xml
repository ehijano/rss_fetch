      <title>Analysis and Compensation of Receiver IQ Imbalance and Residual CFO Error for AFDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) is a promising waveform for future wireless communication systems. In this paper, we analyze the impact of receiver in-phase and quadrature (IQ) imbalance and residual carrier frequency offset (CFO) error on AFDM signals. Our analysis shows that the receiver IQ imbalance may not preserve the sparsity of the AFDM effective channel matrix because of the complex-conjugate operator of the discrete affine Fourier transform (DAFT). Moreover, the residual CFO error causes energy leakage in the effective channel matrix in the affine domain. To mitigate these effects, we extend the linear minimum mean-square error (LMMSE) detector to handle the improper Gaussian noise arising from the receiver IQ imbalance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed LMMSE detector effectively compensates for the receiver hardware impairments.</description>

      <title>Cost and Complexity as Barriers to RTLS Adoption in SMEs: A Survey and Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time location systems (RTLSs) are central to Industry 4.0 and emerging Industry 5.0, providing the spatiotemporal data required for asset tracking, workflow optimization, safety, and integration with WMS, MES, and digital twins. While large enterprises increasingly deploy RTLSs, adoption among small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) remains limited. This paper examines whether cost and installation complexity are primary barriers to SME adoption. We position RTLSs within the broader Industry 4.0 and Logistics 4.0 landscape and summarize their operational value. We then synthesize evidence from the literature on technical, financial, and organizational constraints, with emphasis on infrastructure requirements, calibration effort, integration with legacy systems, and human factors. To complement this analysis, we report results from an online survey of sixteen manufacturing and technology professionals in Canada and the United States. Respondents report strong perceived value for real-time tracking but identify upfront cost, installation effort, integration difficulty, and reliance on multiple anchor nodes as dominant obstacles. Most indicate acceptable upfront investments below $10,000 and express a clear preference for low-infrastructure deployments with minimized anchor counts. Building on these findings, we outline design directions for SME-focused RTLSs, including wireless and modular architectures, cloud-managed and self-calibrating systems, standardized integration interfaces, and anchor-minimizing or anchor-free localization methods. Overall, the results show that limited SME adoption stems less from insufficient perceived value than from misalignment between current RTLS deployment models and SME resource constraints.</description>

      <title>Topology Identification and Inference over Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topology identification and inference of processes evolving over graphs arise in timely applications involving brain, transportation, financial, power, as well as social and information networks. This chapter provides an overview of graph topology identification and statistical inference methods for multidimensional relational data. Approaches for undirected links connecting graph nodes are outlined, going all the way from correlation metrics to covariance selection, and revealing ties with smooth signal priors. To account for directional (possibly causal) relations among nodal variables and address the limitations of linear time-invariant models in handling dynamic as well as nonlinear dependencies, a principled framework is surveyed to capture these complexities through judiciously selected kernels from a prescribed dictionary. Generalizations are also described via structural equations and vector autoregressions that can exploit attributes such as low rank, sparsity, acyclicity, and smoothness to model dynamic processes over possibly time-evolving topologies. It is argued that this approach supports both batch and online learning algorithms with convergence rate guarantees, is amenable to tensor (that is, multi-way array) formulations as well as decompositions that are well-suited for multidimensional network data, and can seamlessly leverage high-order statistical information.</description>

      <title>Antenna Coding Design for Multi-User Transmissions Using Pixel Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates exploiting the potential of pixel antennas, which are a reconfigurable antenna technology that can flexibly adjust the antenna characteristics through antenna coding, in multi-user transmissions. To that end, we propose a multi-user multi-input single-output (MISO) pixel antenna system, which deploys the pixel antenna at users, and develop the system model including pixel antenna with antenna coding and multi-user beamspace channels. Aiming at maximizing the sum rate performance, we first propose an algorithm to alternatively design the precoding at the transmitter and the antenna coding at users, which explores the performance boundary for the proposed multi-user MISO pixel antenna system. To reduce the computational complexity, we propose a codebook-based antenna coding design algorithm, where the antenna coder is online optimized from an offline codebook. To further enhance the computation efficiency, we propose a hierarchical codebook-based antenna coding design that uses a multi-layer hierarchical search to achieve a better performance-complexity trade-off. Simulation results show that, adopting the proposed algorithms, the multi-user MISO pixel antenna system can always outperform conventional multi-user MISO systems with fixed antennas. More importantly, results validate that the proposed (hierarchical) codebook-based algorithms can significantly reduce the computational complexity while maintaining a satisfactory sum rate performance.</description>

      <title>Outdoor Crowd Flow Estimation Using RSRP from Commercial LTE Base Station: A Field Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advent of the 6G era, Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) has attracted increasing attention. One representative of use cases is crowd flow estimation on outdoor streets. However, most existing studies have focused on indoor environments or vehicles, and demonstrations of outdoor crowd flow estimation using commercial LTE base station remain limited. This study addresses this use case and proposes an analysis of a crowd flow estimation method using Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) obtained from a commercial LTE base station. Specifically, pedestrian counts derived from a camera-based object recognition algorithm were associated with the variance of RSRP. The features obtained from the variance were quantitatively evaluated by combining a CatBoost regression model with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis. Through this investigation, we clarified that an optimal variance window size for RSRP is 0.1 to 0.2 seconds and that enlarging the counting area increased the features obtained from the variance of RSRP, for machine learning. Consequently, this study is the first to quantitatively demonstrate the effectiveness of outdoor crowd flow estimation using commercial LTE, while also revealing the characteristic behavior of variance window size and counting area size in feature design.</description>

      <title>A Novel Pilot Scheme for Uplink Channel Estimation for Sub-array Structured ELAA in XL-MIMO systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel pilot scheme for multi-user uplink channel estimation in extra-large-scale massive MIMO (XL-MIMO) systems with extremely large aperture arrays (ELAA). The large aperture of ELAA introduces spatial non-stationarity, where far-apart users have significantly distinct visibility at the antennas, thereby reducing inter-user interference. This insight motivates our novel pilot scheme to group users with distinct visibility regions to share the same frequency subcarriers for channel estimation, so that more users can be served with reduced pilot overhead. Specifically, the proposed pilot scheme employs frequency-division multiplexing for inter-group channel estimation, while intra-group users -- benefiting from strong spatial orthogonality -- are distinguished by shifted cyclic codes, similar to code-division multiplexing. Additionally, we introduce a sub-array structured ELAA, where each sub-array is a traditional MIMO array and treated as spatial stationary, while the distances between sub-arrays can be significantly larger to achieve an expanded aperture. The channel support for sub-arrays features clustered sparsity in the antenna-delay domain and is modeled by a 2-dimensional (2-D) Markov random field (MRF). Based on this, we propose a low-complexity channel estimation algorithm within a turbo Bayesian inference framework that incorporates the 2-D MRF prior model. Simulations show that the proposed scheme and algorithm allow the XL-MIMO system to support more users, and deliver superior channel estimation performance.</description>

      <title>T-ADD: Enhancing DOA Estimation Robustness Against Adversarial Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning has achieved remarkable success in direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation. However, recent studies have shown that adversarial perturbations can severely compromise the performance of such models. To address this vulnerability, we propose Transformer-based Adversarial Defense for DOA estimation (T-ADD), a transformer-based defense method designed to counter adversarial attacks. To achieve a balance between robustness and estimation accuracy, we formulate the adversarial defense as a joint reconstruction task and introduce a tailored joint loss function. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with three state-of-the-art adversarial defense methods, the proposed T-ADD significantly mitigates the adverse effects of widely used adversarial attacks, leading to notable improvements in the adversarial robustness of the DOA model.</description>

      <title>NN-Based Frequency Domain DPD for OFDM Massive MIMO Transmitters With Multiple States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frequency domain (FD)-digital predistortion (DPD) is a low-complexity DPD solution for massive multiple-inputmultiple-output (MIMO) transmitters (TXs). In this letter, we extend FD-DPD to scenarios with multiple signal states (e.g., bandwidths and power levels). First, we propose a new neural network (NN)-based FD-DPD model, whose main idea is to use a hypernetwork (HN) to generate parameters for the output layer of the main NN based on the signal states. Then, we introduce how to effectively train the model with the help of time-domain (TD)-DPD. Experimental results show that the proposed model can achieve excellent performance, without requiring additional online training when signal states change.</description>

      <title>Symbol-Level Precoding for Integrated Sensing and Covert Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems have emerged as a promising solution to improve spectrum efficiency and enable functional convergence. However, ensuring secure information transmission while maintaining high-quality sensing performance remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we investigate an integrated sensing and covert communication (ISCC) system, in which a base station (BS) simultaneously serves multiple downlink users and senses malicious targets that may act as both potential eavesdroppers (Eves) and wardens. We propose a novel symbol-level precoding (SLP)-based waveform design for ISCC that achieves covert communication intrinsically, without requiring additional transmission resources such as artificial noise. The proposed design integrates symbol shaping to enhance reliability for legitimate users and noise shaping to obscure transmission activities from the targets. For imperfect channel state information (CSI), the framework incorporates bounded uncertainty models for user channels and target angles, yielding a more robust design. The resulting ISCC waveform optimization problem is non-convex; to address this, we develop a low-complexity proximal distance algorithm (PDA) with closed-form updates under both PSK and QAM modulations. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior covertness and sensing-communication performance with negligible degradation compared to traditional beamforming and conventional SLP approaches without noise-shaping mechanisms.</description>

      <title>CSI-Based User Positioning, Channel Charting, and Device Classification with an NVIDIA 5G Testbed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Channel-state information (CSI)-based sensing will play a key role in future cellular systems. However, no CSI dataset has been published from a real-world 5G NR system that facilitates the development and validation of suitable sensing algorithms. To close this gap, we publish three real-world wideband multi-antenna multi-open RAN radio unit (O-RU) CSI datasets from the 5G NR uplink channel: an indoor lab/office room dataset, an outdoor campus courtyard dataset, and a device classification dataset with six commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) user equipments (UEs). These datasets have been recorded using a software-defined 5G NR testbed based on NVIDIA Aerial RAN CoLab Over-the-Air (ARC-OTA) with COTS hardware, which we have deployed at ETH Zurich. We demonstrate the utility of these datasets for three CSI-based sensing tasks: neural UE positioning, channel charting in real-world coordinates, and closed-set device classification. For all these tasks, our results show high accuracy: neural UE positioning achieves 0.6cm (indoor) and 5.7cm (outdoor) mean absolute error, channel charting in real-world coordinates achieves 73cm mean absolute error (outdoor), and device classification achieves 99% (same day) and 95% (next day) accuracy. The CSI datasets, ground-truth UE position labels, CSI features, and simulation code are publicly available at https://caez.ethz.ch</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work studies beamformers designed to achieve multiple characteristics simultaneously, specifically those compromising white-noise gain and directivity factor. We compare methods explicitly designed for these joint features against those obtained by combining specific single-task beamformers. Through simulations, we demonstrate that the robust superdirective and the tunable beamformers yield the best results among those studied. Notably, these two methods produced nearly identical outputs across all evaluated metrics. These two are also more practical, continuously compromising between the two objectives.</description>

      <title>A Variable Step Sizes Frequency Offsets-Compensated Least Mean Squares Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frequency offsets-compensated least mean squares (FO-LMS) algorithm is a generic method for estimating a wireless channel under carrier and sampling frequency offsets when the transmitted signal is beforehand known to the receiver. The algorithm iteratively and explicitly adjusts its estimates of the channel and frequency offsets using stochastic gradient descent-based rules and the step sizes of these rules determine the learning rate and stability of the algorithm. Within the stability conditions, the choice of step sizes reflects a trade-off between the algorithm's ability to react to changes in the channel and the ability to minimize misadjustments caused by noise. This paper provides theoretical expressions to predict and optimize the tracking and misadjusment errors of FO-LMS when estimating channels and frequency offsets with known time-varying characteristics. This work also proposes a method to adjust the FO-LMS's step sizes based on the algorithm's performance when the time-varying characteristics are not known, which is more often the case in practice. Accuracy of the expressions and performance of the proposed variable step sizes algorithm are studied through simulations.</description>

      <title>Decision Feedback-Aided Known-Interference Cancellation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Known-interference cancellation (KIC) in combination with cooperative jamming can be used to provide covertness and security to wireless communications at the physical layer. However, since the signal of interest (SI) of a wireless communication system acts as estimation noise, i.e., interference, to KIC, the SI limits the extent to which the known interference (KI) can be canceled and that in turn limits the throughput of the wireless communication system that is being hidden or secured. In this letter, we analyze a decision feedback-aided known-interference cancellation (DF-KIC) structure in which both the KI and SI are canceled iteratively and successively. Measurement results demonstrate that introducing decision feedback to KIC improves its KI cancellation capability and hence increases the wireless communication system's useful throughput, albeit at the expense of a higher computational load.</description>

      <title>POLO: Phase-Only Localization in Uplink Distributed MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a low-complexity localization framework for uplink distributed MIMO (D-MIMO) systems, targeting the challenge of minimizing the highly spiky maximum-likelihood (ML) cost function that arises in sparsely deployed phasecoherent access points (APs) with narrowband transmission. In such systems, ML-based localization typically relies on dense grid search, incurring prohibitive computational complexity. To address this, we introduce phase-only localization (POLO), an approach that leverages differential carrier-phase measurements from selected APs to generate a compact set of candidate user positions. The ML cost function is then evaluated only at these candidates, reducing complexity significantly. A key challenge is to devise an AP selection mechanism that reduces the number of candidate points while maintaining reliable coverage. We propose two variants: POLO-I, which selects three APs to provide closed-form candidate positions with low computational cost, and POLO-II, which selects four APs using an alternative strategy that enhances coverage at marginally higher runtime. Comprehensive analytical and simulation results show that POLO achieves a favorable coverage-complexity trade-off, reducing cost by orders of magnitude relative to exhaustive grid search with only marginal loss in coverage. By characterizing this tradeoff under diverse AP configurations, we also provide practical guidelines for selecting between POLO-I and POLO-II depending on latency and coverage requirements.</description>

      <title>DB2-TransF: All You Need Is Learnable Daubechies Wavelets for Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time series forecasting requires models that can efficiently capture complex temporal dependencies, especially in large-scale and high-dimensional settings. While Transformer-based architectures excel at modeling long-range dependencies, their quadratic computational complexity poses limitations on scalability and adaptability. To overcome these challenges, we introduce DB2-TransF, a novel Transformer-inspired architecture that replaces the self-attention mechanism with a learnable Daubechies wavelet coefficient layer. This wavelet-based module efficiently captures multi-scale local and global patterns and enhances the modeling of correlations across multiple time series for the time series forecasting task. Extensive experiments on 13 standard forecasting benchmarks demonstrate that DB2-TransF achieves comparable or superior predictive accuracy to conventional Transformers, while substantially reducing memory usage for the time series forecasting task. The obtained experimental results position DB2-TransF as a scalable and resource-efficient framework for advanced time series forecasting.

      <title>CHyLL: Learning Continuous Neural Representations of Hybrid Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning the flows of hybrid systems that have both continuous and discrete time dynamics is challenging. The existing method learns the dynamics in each discrete mode, which suffers from the combination of mode switching and discontinuities in the flows. In this work, we propose CHyLL (Continuous Hybrid System Learning in Latent Space), which learns a continuous neural representation of a hybrid system without trajectory segmentation, event functions, or mode switching. The key insight of CHyLL is that the reset map glues the state space at the guard surface, reformulating the state space as a piecewise smooth quotient manifold where the flow becomes spatially continuous. Building upon these insights and the embedding theorems grounded in differential topology, CHyLL concurrently learns a singularity-free neural embedding in a higher-dimensional space and the continuous flow in it. We showcase that CHyLL can accurately predict the flow of hybrid systems with superior accuracy and identify the topological invariants of the hybrid systems. Finally, we apply CHyLL to the stochastic optimal control problem.</description>

      <title>Inertial Magnetic SLAM Systems Using Low-Cost Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatially inhomogeneous magnetic fields offer a valuable, non-visual information source for positioning. Among systems leveraging this, magnetic field-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) systems are particularly attractive because they can provide positioning information and build a magnetic field map on the fly. Moreover, they have bounded error within mapped regions. However, state-of-the-art methods typically require low-drift odometry data provided by visual odometry or a wheel encoder, etc. This is because these systems need to minimize/reduce positioning errors while exploring, which happens when they are in unmapped regions. To address these limitations, this work proposes a loosely coupled and a tightly coupled inertial magnetic SLAM (IM-SLAM) system. The proposed systems use commonly available low-cost sensors: an inertial measurement unit (IMU), a magnetometer array, and a barometer. The use of non-visual data provides a significant advantage over visual-based systems, making it robust to low-visibility conditions. Both systems employ state-space representations, and magnetic field models on different scales. The difference lies in how they use a local and global magnetic field model. The loosely coupled system uses these models separately in two state-space models, while the tightly coupled system integrates them into one state-space model. Experiment results show that the tightly coupled IM-SLAM system achieves lower positioning errors than the loosely coupled system in most scenarios, with typical errors on the order of meters per 100 meters traveled. These results demonstrate the feasiblity of developing a full 3D IM-SLAM systems using low-cost sensors and the potential of applying these systems in emergency response scenarios such as mine/fire rescue.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Classical and Quantum Communications: Recent Progress and Three Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A critical aspect of next-generation wireless networks is the integration of quantum communications to guard against quantum computing threats to classical networks. Despite successful experimental demonstrations, integrating quantum communications into the classical infrastructure faces substantial challenges, including high costs, compatibility issues, and extra hardware deployment to accommodate both classical and quantum communication equipment. To mitigate these challenges, we explore novel protocols that enable simultaneous classical and quantum communications, relying on a single set of transceivers to jointly modulate and decode classical and quantum information onto the same signal. Additionally, we emphasize extending quantum communication capabilities beyond traditional optical bands into the terahertz, even possibly to millimeter-wave and microwave frequencies, thereby broadening the potential horizon of quantum-secure applications. Finally, we identify open problems that must be addressed to facilitate practical implementation.</description>

      <title>Assessing Neuromorphic Computing for Fingertip Force Decoding from Electromyography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-density surface electromyography (HD-sEMG) provides a noninvasive neural interface for assistive and rehabilitation control, but mapping neural activity to user motor intent remains challenging. We assess a spiking neural network (SNN) as a neuromorphic architecture against a temporal convolutional network (TCN) for decoding fingertip force from motor-unit (MU) firing derived from HD-sEMG. Data were collected from a single participant (10 trials) with two forearm electrode arrays; MU activity was obtained via FastICA-based decomposition, and models were trained on overlapping windows with end-to-end causal convolutions. On held-out trials, the TCN achieved 4.44% MVC RMSE (Pearson r = 0.974) while the SNN achieved 8.25% MVC (r = 0.922). While the TCN was more accurate, we view the SNN as a realistic neuromorphic baseline that could close much of this gap with modest architectural and hyperparameter refinements.</description>

Abstract: This article envisions the concept of a ``Quantum Internet in the Sky", aiming to establish ubiquitous quantum communication links among distant nodes via free-space optical channels. Our key focus is on deploying quantum communication terminals on non-terrestrial platforms, specifically unmanned aerial vehicles and satellites, at various altitudes. By highlighting the unique characteristics of these platforms compared to terrestrial counterparts, we address inherent challenges and discuss potential solutions through meticulous system designs and analyses of typical non-terrestrial quantum communication scenarios. Finally, we illuminate the path forward by proposing essential future directions that underscore the integration of high-dimensional multipartite quantum communications with sensing, computing, and intelligence for multiple users en route to realizing a fully operational Quantum Internet.</description>

      <title>Improving the decoding performance of CA-polar codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the use of modern code-agnostic decoders to convert CA-SCL from an incomplete decoder to a complete one. When CA-SCL fails to identify a codeword that passes the CRC check, we apply a code-agnostic decoder that identifies a codeword that satisfies the CRC. We establish that this approach gives gains of up to 0.2 dB in block error rate for CA-Polar codes from the 5G New Radio standard. If, instead, the message had been encoded in a systematic CA-polar code, the gain improves to 0.2 ~ 1dB. Leveraging recent developments in blockwise soft output, we additionally establish that it is possible to control the undetected error rate even when using the CRC for error correction.</description>

      <title>Hyperspectral Image Data Reduction for Endmember Extraction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Endmember extraction from hyperspectral images aims to identify the spectral signatures of materials present in a scene. Recent studies have shown that self-dictionary methods can achieve high extraction accuracy; however, their high computational cost limits their applicability to large-scale hyperspectral images. Although several approaches have been proposed to mitigate this issue, it remains a major challenge. Motivated by this situation, this paper pursues a data reduction approach. Assuming that the hyperspectral image follows the linear mixing model with the pure-pixel assumption, we develop a data reduction technique that removes pixels that do not contain endmembers. We analyze the theoretical properties of this reduction step and show that it preserves pixels that lie close to the endmembers. Building on this result, we propose a data-reduced self-dictionary method that integrates the data reduction with a self-dictionary method based on a linear programming formulation. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can substantially reduce the computational time of the original self-dictionary method without sacrificing endmember extraction accuracy.</description>

      <title>NWP-based Atmospheric Refractivity Modeling and Fast &amp; Stable Non-uniform Plane Wave Ray-Tracing Simulations for LEO Link Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing low-Earth-orbit (LEO) communication link analyses face two main challenges: (1) limited accuracy of 3D atmospheric refractivity reconstructed from sparsely sampled radiosonde data, and (2) numerical instability in previous non-uniform plane-wave ray-tracing algorithms (i.e., underflow under standard double precision), where non-uniform plane waves inevitably arise at complex-valued dielectric interfaces, is caused by extremely small atmospheric loss terms. To address these issues, we reconstruct a high-resolution 3D complex-valued refractivity model using numerical weather prediction data, and develop a fast and numerically stable non-uniform plane-wave ray tracer. The method remains stable in double precision and delivers a 24-fold speedup over high-precision benchmarks. Comparisons show that boresight-error deviations and path-loss differences between the rigorous method and the uniform-plane-wave approximation remain negligible, even under heavy precipitation. Although rays in a lossy atmosphere experience different phase- and attenuation-direction vectors-forming non-uniform plane waves-the resulting effective attenuation along the path is nearly identical to that predicted by the uniform-plane-wave model. These findings justify the continued use of uniform-plane-wave ray tracing in practical LEO link analyses.</description>

      <title>Fast and Robust LRSD-based SAR/ISAR Imaging and Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The earlier works in the context of low-rank-sparse-decomposition (LRSD)-driven stationary synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging have shown significant improvement in the reconstruction-decomposition process. Neither of the proposed frameworks, however, can achieve satisfactory performance when facing a platform residual phase error (PRPE) arising from the instability of airborne platforms. More importantly, in spite of the significance of real-time processing requirements in remote sensing applications, these prior works have only focused on enhancing the quality of the formed image, not reducing the computational burden. To address these two concerns, this article presents a fast and unified joint SAR imaging framework where the dominant sparse objects and low-rank features of the image background are decomposed and enhanced through a robust LRSD. In particular, our unified algorithm circumvents the tedious task of computing the inverse of large matrices for image formation and takes advantage of the recent advances in constrained quadratic programming to handle the unimodular constraint imposed due to the PRPE. Furthermore, we extend our approach to ISAR autofocusing and imaging. Specifically, due to the intrinsic sparsity of ISAR images, the LRSD framework is essentially tasked with the recovery of a sparse image. Several experiments based on synthetic and real data are presented to validate the superiority of the proposed method in terms of imaging quality and computational cost compared to the state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>A Differentiable Digital Twin of Distributed Link Scheduling for Contention-Aware Networking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many routing and flow optimization problems in wired networks can be solved efficiently using minimum cost flow formulations. However, this approach does not extend to wireless multi-hop networks, where the assumptions of fixed link capacity and linear cost structure collapse due to contention for shared spectrum resources. The key challenge is that the long-term capacity of a wireless link becomes a non-linear function of its network context, including network topology, link quality, and the traffic assigned to neighboring links. In this work, we pursue a new direction of modeling wireless network under randomized medium access control by developing an analytical network digital twin (NDT) that predicts link duty cycles from network context. We generalize randomized contention as finding a Maximal Independent Set (MIS) on the conflict graph using weighted Luby's algorithm, derive an analytical model of link duty cycles, and introduce an iterative procedure that resolves the circular dependency among duty cycle, link capacity, and contention probability. Our numerical experiments show that the proposed NDT accurately predicts link duty cycles and congestion patterns with up to a 5000x speedup over packet-level simulation, and enables us to optimize link scheduling using gradient descent for reduced congestion and radio footprint.</description>

      <title>Rate-Splitting Multiple Access for Integrated Sensing and Communications: A First Experimental Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12037v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A canonical use case of Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems involves a multi-antenna transmitter communicating with $K$ users and sensing targets in its vicinity. For this setup, precoder and multiple access designs are of utmost importance, as the limited transmit power budget must be efficiently directed towards the desired directions (users and targets) to maximize both communications and sensing performance. This problem has been widely investigated analytically under various design choices, in particular (a) whether or not a dedicated sensing signal is needed, and (b) for different MIMO multiple access techniques, such as Space Division Multiple Access (SDMA) and Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA). However, a conclusive answer on which design choice achieves the best ISAC performance, backed by experimental results, remains elusive. We address this vacuum by experimentally evaluating and comparing RSMA and SDMA for communicating with two users $(K = 2)$ and sensing (ranging) one target. Over three scenarios that are representative of \emph{vehicular} ISAC, covering different levels of inter-user interference and separation/integration between sensing and communications, we show that RSMA without a dedicated sensing signal achieves better ISAC performance -- i.e., higher sum throughput (up to $50\%$ peak throughput gain) for similar radar SNR (between $20$ to $24{\rm dB}$) -- than SDMA with a dedicated sensing signal. This first-ever experimental study of RSMA ISAC demonstrates the feasibility and the superiority of RSMA for future multi-functional wireless systems.</description>

      <title>Rydberg Atomic Quantum Receivers for Multi-Target DOA Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02820v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum sensing technologies have experienced rapid progresses since entering the `second quantum revolution'. Among various candidates, schemes relying on Rydberg atoms exhibit compelling advantages for detecting radio frequency signals. Based on this, Rydberg atomic quantum receivers (RAQRs) have emerged as a promising solution to classical wireless communication and sensing. To harness the advantages and exploit the potential of RAQRs in wireless sensing, we investigate the realization of the direction of arrival (DOA) estimation by RAQRs. Specifically, we first conceive a Rydberg atomic quantum uniform linear array (RAQ-ULA) aided wireless receiver for multi-target DOA detection and propose the corresponding signal model of this sensing system. Our model reveals that the presence of the radio-frequency local oscillator in the RAQ-ULA creates sensor gain mismatches, which degrade the DOA estimation significantly by employing the classical Estimation of Signal Parameters via Rotational Invariant Techniques (ESPRIT). To solve this sensor gain mismatch problem, we propose the Rydberg atomic quantum ESPRIT (RAQ-ESPRIT) relying on our model. Lastly, we characterize our scheme through numerical simulations, where the results exhibit that it is capable of reducing the estimation error of its classical counterpart on the order of $&gt; 400$-fold and $&gt; 9000$-fold in the PSL and SQL, respectively.</description>

      <title>FE-MCFormer: An interpretable fault diagnosis framework for rotating machinery under strong noise based on time-frequency fusion transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many fault diagnosis methods of rotating machines are based on discriminative features extracted from signals collected from the key components such as bearings. However, under complex operating conditions, periodic impulsive characteristics in the signal related to weak fault information are often obscured by noise interference. Consequently, existing approaches struggle to learn interpretable fault-related features in such scenarios. This paper proposes a novel transformer framework (FE-MCFormer) to extract interpretable time-frequency features, with the aim of improving the fault detection accuracy and intrepretability of rotating machines under strong noise. First, a Fourier adaptive reconstruction embedding layer is introduced as a global information encoder in the model. Subsequently, a time-frequency fusion module is designed, further improve the model robustness and interpretability. The effectiveness of FE-MCFormer in machine fault diagnosis is validated through three case studies.</description>
