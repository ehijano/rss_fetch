      <title>Generalised-Edged Quivers and Global Forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-simply laced quivers, despite the lack of complete Lagrangian descriptions, play an important role in characterising moduli spaces of supersymmetric field theories. Notably, the moduli space of instantons in non-simply laced gauge groups can be understood by means of such quivers. We generalise the notion of non-simply laced unitary quivers to those whose edges carry two labels $(p,q)$, dubbed $(p,q)$-edged quivers. The special case of $(p,1)$ corresponds to a conventional non-simply laced edge studied in the literature. In the case of unframed $(p,q)$-edged quivers, we show how to parametrise the lattice of magnetic fluxes upon ungauging the decoupled $\mathrm{U}(1)$, and how one can pick sublattices thereof corresponding to different global forms of the quiver related by discrete gauging. This form of discrete gauging can be applied to any unframed unitary quivers, not just ones with generalised edges. We utilise both the Hilbert series and the superconformal index to study moduli spaces and 't Hooft anomalies. In particular, we study mixed 't Hooft anomalies between a one-form symmetry and a zero-form continuous topological symmetry in various $(p,q)$-edged quivers. We also provide an alternative realisation of the moduli space of $\mathfrak{so}(2n+1)$ instantons via gauging discrete symmetries in supersymmetric QCD with a symplectic gauge group and a large number of flavours.</description>

      <title>Spinor Adjoints, Gauge Invariance and a new Road to Sterile Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze the possibilities of certain gauge transformations regarding some specific spinorial dual structures. To this end, we define a general structure, which can be expressed in terms of discrete symmetry operators associated with parity, charge conjugation, and time reversal. To this end, we consider the demand of tensor covariance of the spinor bilinears under space-time transformations and also deep algebraic considerations such as the invertibility of the dual structure which guarantee that the physical information remains unchanged (respecting the Fierz-Pauli-Kofink identities), and so on. Later, we examine the global gauge freedom implicated by each choice of dual and point out the physical implications. The final goal is achieved by establishing a well-defined coupling between the Elko and standard model neutrinos in a prelude for a new formulation of the hypothetical so-called sterile neutrino.</description>

      <title>$R^2$--Inflation Derived from 4d Strings, the Role of the Dilaton, and Turning the Swampland into a Mirage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on a previously derived superstring model possessing a cosmological sector that mimics Starobinsky inflation, we analyze several questions addressed in the recent literature: the generation of an effective $R^2$-term, the stability of the sgoldstino , the modular symmetry of the inflaton potential and the large distance swampland conjecture. We first show that the presence of the string dilaton stabilizes the sgoldstino direction in the supersymmetric case and no modification of the K\"ahler potential is needed. This is a generic property of a large class of Starobinsky type models within the framework of no-scale supergravity. We then present an explicit example of a string derived inflaton potential where the large values of the inflaton field during inflation imply a decompactification of two extra dimensions, while the scale of inflation is generated by higher order $\alpha'$-corrections via expectation values that cancel the D-term of an anomalous $U(1)$ symmetry and break the modular symmetry of the scalar potential. As a result, the scale of inflation is much lower than the compactification scale which at the end of inflation is fixed at the free-fermionic self-dual point at an (approximate) supersymmetric minimum.</description>

      <title>A Lindbladian for exact renormalization of density operators in QFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In arXiv:1609.03493, the authors extended the exact renormalization group (ERG) to arbitrary wave-functionals in quantum field theory (QFT). Applying this formalism, we show that the ERG flow of density matrices is given by a Lindblad master equation. The Lindbladian consists of a "Hamiltonian" term which is the sum of a scaling and a coarse-graining (disentangling) operator, and a dissipative term with absorption and emission rates for each momentum mode. We consider as examples the flow of Gaussian states and the perturbative ground state of $\lambda \phi^4$ theory, and highlight the role of the dissipative terms in generating the correct flow of couplings. Integrating the Lindblad master equation, we find that a finite ERG flow of density matrices is described by a quantum channel. It follows from the data processing inequality that any distinguishability measure of states is an ERG monotone.</description>

      <title>Universal flops of length 1 and 2 from D2-branes at surface singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study families of deformed ADE surfaces by probing them with a D2-brane in Type IIA string theory. The geometry of the total space $X$ of such a family can be encoded in a scalar field $\Phi$, which lives in the corresponding ADE algebra and depends on the deformation parameters. The superpotential of the probe three dimensional (3d) theory incorporates a term that depends on the field $\Phi$. By varying the parameters on which $\Phi$ depends, one generates a family of 3d theories whose moduli space always includes a geometric branch, isomorphic to the deformed surface. By fibering this geometric branch over the parameter space, the total space $X$ of the family of ADE surfaces is reconstructed. We explore various cases, including when $X$ is the universal flop of length $\ell=1,2$. The effective theory, obtained after the introduction of $\Phi$, provides valuable insights into the geometric features of $X$, such as the loci in parameter space where the fiber becomes singular and, more notably, the conditions under which this induces a singularity in the total space. By analyzing the monopole operators in the 3d theory, we determine the charges of certain M2-brane states arising in M-theory compactifications on $X$.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Catalysis for Heavy Quarks in Anisotropic Holographic Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a twice anisotropic five-dimensional holographic model supported by Einstein-dilaton-three-Maxwell action that was constructed in the paper [arXiv:2011.07023]. Although, that model reproduced some essential features of the ``heavy quarks'', but did not describe the magnetic catalysis (MC) phenomenon expected from lattice results for the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) with heavy quarks. We study MC phenomenon as well as typical properties of the heavy quarks phase diagram contains magnetic field as a new parameter by improving the holographic model, i.e. modifying the ``heavy quarks'' warp factor and the coupling function for the Maxwell field. Considering spatial anisotropy decreases the transition temperature for all values of the magnetic field for heavy quarks model.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes for charged Lifshitz black holes with scalar hair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on the generalized Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton (EMD) gravity, including a nonminimal coupling term between the Maxwell field and scalar field. We construct charged lifshitz black holes with scalar hair of EMD gravity in the presence of cosmological constant for various horizon topologies $(k = 0, \pm 1)$. Then, we consider the scalar perturbations of charged Lifshitz black hole solutions and explore quasinormal modes (QNMs) of these black holes. By using the improved asymptotic iteration method (AIM), we recover the effects of factors such as the curvature, mass, and critical dynamic exponent of black holes on the QNMs.</description>

      <title>Integrable formulation of the OPE coefficients in the UV limit of the sine-Gordon model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the repulsive regime of the sine-Gordon model, we work out a method, that enables one to formulate the UV limit of finite volume expectation values in terms of the integrable description of the UV limit of the corresponding spectral problem. Since these expectation values are related to 3-point couplings containing at least two identical operators, our computations provide with an integrable formulation to the 3-point couplings of the UV CFT. Our approach is based on the fermionic description of operators in the sine-Gordon theory, in which these expectation values are expressed in terms of a finite number of elements of an infinite matrix. Focusing on vacuum expectation values, in this paper, the first two nontrivial coefficients in the UV series representation of this matrix are expressed in terms of integrability data. This allows one to get an integrable description to some specific ratios of vacuum expectation values in the complex Liouville CFT.</description>

      <title>Deriving the long-string CFT in AdS$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the path integral formulation of bosonic string theory in locally-AdS$_3$ spacetimes. Through a careful analysis of the worldsheet sigma model, we write down an effective theory of long strings living near the boundary of AdS$_3$. By directly computing the partition function of the long-string sector, we find that the worldsheet path integral naturally organizes itself into the Coulomb-gas expansion of a 2D conformal field theory on the asymptotic boundary, with the number of coulomb integrals being dual to the dimension of the moduli space of worldsheet instantons in the bulk. As such, we provide a derivation of the CFT dual of long strings in AdS$_3$ for completely generic spacetime and worldsheet topologies.</description>

      <title>The Equivariant B model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce an equivariant deformation of the $B$ model on the sphere with a $U(1)$-action. We present the deformed supersymmetry transformations and corresponding Lagrangians and study observables in the supercharge cohomology. The inclusion of equivariance allows for the introduction of novel, position-dependent observables on the sphere, which have no counterparts in the conventional $B$ model. Two specific cases we explore in detail are position-dependent superpotentials and complex structure deformations. In both instances, the theory exhibits notable differences from the standard $B$ model, revealing intriguing new features.</description>

      <title>Applying Color-Kinematics Duality in Pure Yang-Mills at Three Loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first application of color-kinematics (CK) duality at the three-loop level in non-supersymmetric pure Yang-Mills (YM) theory. Building on the minimal deformation approach introduced in \cite{Li:2023akg}, we extend its use to the three-loop Sudakov form factor. Although three classes of unitarity cuts fail under the globally off-shell CK-dual ansatz, a compact and elegant solution is achieved by deforming a single master numerator. The final numerators exhibit Lorentz invariance in $d$ dimensions and take a local form. This method harnesses CK duality's full potential by enforcing a subset of off-shell dual Jacobi identities for the deformation, offering a promising path toward constructing three-loop amplitudes in non-supersymmetric YM theory and gravity through CK duality and double copy.</description>

      <title>$\beta$ symmetry of heterotic supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The low energy effective action describing the Kaluza-Klein reduction of string theory on a $d$-torus possesses a continuous O($d, d$) global symmetry. The non-geometric piece of this symmetry, parameterized by a bi-vector $\beta$, was recently shown to effectively act as a hidden symmetry on the massless RR and universal NSNS fields of the ten dimensional parent theory, fixing their couplings. Here we extend the analysis of this symmetry to the massless gauge and fermion fields of heterotic supergravity. While the interactions of the boson fields are univocally fixed by $\beta$ symmetry, we find four bilinear and two quartic $\beta$ invariant combinations of fermions whose relative coefficients in the action must be determined by supersymmetry. Although not fully fixed, bilinear and quartic fermion couplings are strongly restricted by $\beta$ symmetry at leading order in $\alpha'$.</description>

      <title>Reciprocal Non-Relativistic Decoupling Limits of String Theory and M-Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has recently been realised that there are supersymmetry-preserving non-relativistic decoupling limits associated with each half-BPS object in String Theory and M-Theory. We argue that, given a $p$-brane and a $q$-brane for which there is a quarter-BPS intersecting configuration, the $p$-brane decoupling limit of the $q$-brane's worldvolume QFT is necessarily equal to the reciprocal $q$-brane decoupling limit of the $p$-brane's worldvolume theory. This is explicitly shown for the cases of the D0-D4 and D1-D3 systems. As an application of this idea, we use the reciprocal pair of limits in the M2-M5 system to describe the dynamics of interacting self-dual strings in the six-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=(2,0)$ theory. We also discuss the limits of the dual gravitational theories and, using symmetries, argue that the duality is maintained by the limits.</description>

      <title>The Reggeon Vertex for DDF States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a compact expression for the generating function of correlators involving an arbitrary number of bosonic open string DDF states. The explicit correlators for $M$ DDF states can then be obtained by differentiating this generating function with respect to the DDF polarization tensors. The generating function depends on single and double complex integrals centred around the punctures corresponding to the insertion points of the DDF vertices on the real axis in the upper half-plane. We have explicitly evaluated these integrals for an arbitrary number of DDF states. To check our results, we computed some massive scalars and spin-2 amplitudes for $M=3$ and $M=4$, verifying that these amplitudes have the form expected from Lorentz invariance.
  Moreover, for the first excited levels, we also show that the DDF amplitudes with generic polarizations can be reassembled into Lorentz-covariant amplitudes, with emergent covariant polarizations that match the expressions obtained by comparing the string states in both the DDF and covariant formalisms.</description>

      <title>Quintessence: an analytical study, with theoretical and observational applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We focus on minimally coupled (multi)field quintessence models and their realistic solutions. In a model-independent manner, we describe analytically these cosmological solutions throughout the universe history. Starting with a kination - radiation domination phase, we obtain an upper bound on the scalar potential to guarantee an early kination: $V(\varphi) \ll e^{-\sqrt{6} \varphi}$. Turning to the radiation - matter phase, we obtain analytical expressions for the scale factor $a(t)$ (not $t(a)$) and the scalar fields $\varphi^i(t)$ (usually neglected). These allow us to evaluate analytically the freezing of scalar fields, typically $\Delta \varphi \lesssim 10^{-2}$, as well as the transition moment of the dark energy equation of state parameter $w_{\varphi}$ from $+1$ to $-1$, with excellent agreement to the numerics. We comment on this freezing in view of string theory model building, and of some cosmological events. Turning to the latest phase of matter - dark energy domination, we show that the (multi)field displacement is sub-Planckian: $\Delta \varphi \leq 1$. We also provide for that phase analytic expressions for $\int (w_{\varphi}+1)\, d N$; we relate those to observational targets that we propose. Turning to the CPL parametrisation, while discussing a phantom behaviour, we derive analytical bounds on $w_0$ and $w_a$.</description>

      <title>A Note on Kinematic Flow and Differential Equations for Two-Site One-Loop Graph in FRW Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the canonical differential equations governing the two-site one-loop wavefcuntion coefficient in conformally-coupled scalar theory within a general FRW cosmology. By utilizing relative twisted cohomology and integration by parts, we systematically derive these equations, providing a solid foundation for further analysis. Moreover, we extend the kinematic flow framework to the one-loop level, efficiently deriving the differential equations graphically through the family trees generated by tube graphs, which are associated with the singularities of the system. This approach provides valuable insights into the dynamical behavior of the differential system for the cosmological wavefunction coefficient at the loop level.</description>

      <title>WKB Methods for Finite Difference Schrodinger Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14628v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this thesis, we develop WKB techniques for the finite difference Schrodinger equation, following the construction of the WKB approach for the standard differential Schrodinger equation. In particular, we will develop an all-order WKB algorithm to get arbitrary hbar-corrections and construct a general quantum momentum, underlining the various properties of its coefficients and the quantities that will be used when constructing the quantization condition. In doing so, we discover the existence of additional periodic factors that need to be considered in order to obtain the most general solution to the problem at hand. We will then proceed to study the simplest non trivial example, the linear potential case and the Bessel functions, that provide a solution to the linear problem.
  After studying the resurgence properties of the Bessel functions from an analytical and numerical point of view, we will then proceed to use those results in order to build general connection formulae, allowing us to connect the local solutions defined on two sides of a turning point into a smooth solution on the whole real line. With those connection formulae, we will analyse a selection of problems, constructing the discrete spectrum of various finite difference Schrodinger problems and comparing our results with existing literature.</description>

      <title>Does the oscillatory behavior of the Momentum Spectrum depend on the basis in the Post-Transient Stage?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pair creation by a spatially homogeneous, time-dependent electric field is studied within the framework of scalar quantum electrodynamics. We employ the standard Bogoliubov transformation approach to compute the single-particle distribution function in an adiabatic basis. We analyzed the distribution function of created particles in two different adiabatic bases (related by a unitary transformation). A novel dynamical scaling is observed while analyzing the oscillatory momentum spectrum of the pairs created by the Sauter pulsed field at intermediate times, calculated using the two adiabatic bases. In these bases, the same oscillatory momentum spectra are observed but at different times. However, when we scale the time by the point marking the end of the transient stage of dynamical evolution for each case of central momentum, the respective momentum spectra overlap. Furthermore, we study the time evolution of the momentum spectrum in the multi-photon regime and find that the spectra show a multi-modal profile structure at finite times for both choices of basis.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics and thermal stability of BTZ-ModMax black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by a new interesting nonlinear electrodynamics (NLED) model which is known as Modification Maxwell (ModMax) theory, we obtain an exact analytic BTZ black hole solution in the presence of a new NLED model and the cosmological constant. Then, by considering the obtained solution, we obtain Hawking temperature, entropy, electric charge, mass, and electric potential. We extract the first law of thermodynamics for the BTZ-ModMax black hole. We study thermal stability by evaluating the heat capacity (local stability) and Helmholtz free energy (global stability). By comparing the local and global stabilities, we find the common areas that satisfy the local and global stabilities, simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Integrable and critical Haagerup spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct the first integrable models based on the Haagerup fusion category $H_3$. We introduce a Haagerup version of the anyonic spin chain and use the boost operator formalism to identify two integrable Hamiltonians of PXP type on this chain. The first of these is an analogue of the golden chain; it has a topological symmetry based on $H_3$ and satisfies the Temperley-Lieb algebra with parameter $\delta=(3+\sqrt{13})/2$. We prove its integrability using a Lax formalism, and construct the corresponding solution to the Yang--Baxter equation. We present numerical evidence that this model is gapless with a dynamical critical exponent $z\neq 1$. The second integrable model we find breaks the topological symmetry. We present numerical evidence that this model reduces to a CFT in the large volume limit with central charge $c\sim3/2$.</description>

Abstract: We consider Weyl-invariant quadratic Einstein-Cartan gravity coupled to a scalar field and study the inflationary behaviour of the coupled system of the scalar field and the pseudoscalar associated with the Holst invariant. We find that the model is characterized by effective single-field inflation occurring at small field values and analyze its predictions which are in comfortable agreement with existing observations for a range of parameter values.</description>

      <title>Universal time evolution of string order parameter in quantum critical systems with boundary invertible or non-invertible symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The global symmetry, either invertible or non-invertible, has been extensively studied in two dimensional conformal field theories in recent years. When the theory is defined on a manifold with open boundaries, however, many interesting conformal boundary conditions will fully or partially break such global symmetry. In this work, we study the effect of symmetry-breaking boundaries or interfaces when the system is out of equilibrium. We show that the boundary or interface symmetry-breaking can be detected by the time evolution of string order parameters, which are constructed from the symmetry operators that implement the symmetry transformations. While the string order parameters are independent of time if the symmetry is preserved over the whole system, they evolve in time in a universal way if the boundary or interface breaks the symmetry. More explicitly, in the presence of boundary or interface symmetry-breaking, the string order parameters decay exponentially in time after a global quantum quench, and decay as a power-law in time after a local quantum quench. We also generalize our study to the case when the string order parameters are defined in a subsystem, which are related to the full counting statistics. It is found there are also universal features in the time evolution of string order parameters in this case. We verify our field theory results by studying the time evolution of these two different types of string order parameters in lattice models.</description>

      <title>On the Bisognano-Wichmann entanglement Hamiltonian of nonrelativistic fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the ground-state entanglement Hamiltonian of free nonrelativistic fermions for semi-infinite domains in one dimension. This is encoded in the two-point correlations projected onto the subsystem, an operator that commutes with the linear deformation of the physical Hamiltonian. The corresponding eigenfunctions are shown to possess the exact same structure both in the continuum as well as on the lattice. Namely, they are superpositions of the occupied single-particle modes of the total Hamiltonian, weighted by the inverse of their energy as measured from the Fermi level, and multiplied by an extra phase proportional to the integrated weight. Using this ansatz, we prove that the Bisognano-Wichmann form of the entanglement Hamiltonian becomes exact, up to a nonuniversal prefactor that depends on the dispersion for gapped chains.</description>

      <title>Revisiting experimental mass limits on HECOs using Dyson-Schwinger resummation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-Electric-Charge compact Objects (HECOs) appear in several theoretical particle physics models beyond the Standard Model, and are actively searched for in current colliders, such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In such searches, mass bounds of these objects have been placed, using Drell-Yan and Photon-Fusion processes at tree level so far. However, such estimates are not reliable, given that, as a result of the large values of the electric charge of the HECO, perturbative QED calculations break down. We present a Dyson-Schwinger-like resummation scheme, which allows for a large gauge coupling and thus makes the computation of the pertinent HECO-production cross sections reliable, thus allowing us to extract improved mass bounds for such objects from ATLAS and MoEDAL searches.</description>

      <title>Information retrieval from Euclidean path integral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we review the information loss paradox in the spirit of the Euclidean path integral approach. First, we argue that there is a long debate about the information loss paradox, and the non-perturbative quantum gravitational wave function must include the clue to the paradox. The Euclidean path integral approach provides the best way to describe the wave function. From this wave function, we can notice that there are not only semi-classical but also non-perturbative contributions, which are highly suppressed but preserved information. Information retrieval will be sufficiently explained if such non-perturbative contributions must be dominated by the late time. We will show that there is sufficient evidence that this scenario can be realized in generic circumstances. Finally, we compare this scenario with alternative approaches. Also, we comment on some unresolved issues that need to be clarified.</description>

Abstract: We show that in the operational setting of a two-agent, local operations, classical communication (LOCC) protocol, Alice and Bob cannot operationally distinguish monogamous entanglement from a topological identification of points in their respective local spacetimes, i.e. that ER = EPR can be recovered as an operational theorem. Our construction immediately implies that in this operational setting, the local topology of spacetime is observer-relative. It also provides a simple demonstration of the non-traversability of ER bridges. As our construction does not depend on an embedding geometry, it generalizes previous geometric approaches to ER = EPR.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Under the premise that quantum gravity becomes non-negligible, higher-order corrections of non-commutative geometry dominate. In this paper, we studied the thermodynamics of high-order corrections for Schwarzschild-AdS black hole with Lorentz distribution in the framework of non-commutative geometry. Our results indicate that when high-order corrections dominate, the thermodynamic behavior of Schwarzschild-AdS black hole in non-commutative geometry will gradually approach that of ordinary Schwarzschild-AdS black hole. In addition, we also studied the Joule-Thomson effect of Schwarzschild-AdS black hole under high-order corrections.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A mechanism is found that explains how matter falling into the future event horizon of a black hole leaves information there, which it sends to the past event horizon, and there it determines how particles are emitted. This way information must be conserved. The mechanism is a calculable gravitational effect. We also show how it is avoided that the "hidden region" of the black hole gets involved, which has been standing out as a problem ever since Hawking found that particles must be emitted. The most striking consequence of our mechanism is that the radiation temperature is not what Hawking calculated, but twice that value. This is a direct consequence of the fact that the hidden region is not there.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study quantum entanglement and test violation of Bell-type inequality at the Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC), which is one of the most attractive future colliders. It's a promising particle collider designed to search new physics, make Standard Model (SM) precision measurements, and serving as a Higgs factory. Our study is based on a fast simulation of the $Z$ boson pair production from Higgs boson decay at $\sqrt{s} = 250$ GeV. The detector effects are also included in the simulation. The spin density matrix of the joint $ZZ$ system is parametrized using irreducible tensor operators and reconstructed from the spherical coordinates of the decay leptons. To test Bell inequalities, we construct observable quantities for the $H \to ZZ*$ process in CEPC by using the (Collins-Gisin-Linden-Massar-Popescu) CGLMP inequality, whose value is determined from the density matrix of the Z boson pairs. The sensitivity of the Bell inequality violation is observed with more than 1$\sigma$ and the presence of the quantum entanglement is probed with more than 2$\sigma$ confidence level.</description>

      <title>Dynamical interiors of Black-Bounce spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the Israel-Darmois junction conditions, we obtain a class of regular dynamical interiors to the recently proposed black-bounce spacetimes which regularises the Schwarzschild singularity by introducing a regularisation parameter. We show that a regularised Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker like interior geometry can not be matched smoothly with the exterior black-bounce spacetime through a timelike hypersurface, as there always exists a thin shell of non-zero energy-momentum tensor at the matching hypersurface. We obtain the expressions for the energy density and pressure of the thin shell energy-momentum tensor in terms of the regularisation parameter and derive an evolution equation for the scale factor of the interior geometry by imposing physical conditions on these components of the surface energy-momentum tensor. We also discuss the formation of the event horizon inside the interior in the case when the initial conditions are such that the situation describes a collapsing matter cloud. We elaborate upon the physical implications of these results.</description>

      <title>On the Holographic Dual of a Topological Symmetry Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09538v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the holographic dual of a topological symmetry operator in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence. Symmetry operators arise from topological field theories localized on a subspace of the boundary CFT spacetime. We use bottom up considerations to construct the topological sector associated with their bulk counterparts. In particular, by exploiting the structure of entanglement wedge reconstruction we argue that the bulk counterpart has a non-topological worldvolume action, i.e., it describes a dynamical object. As a consequence, we find that there are no global $p$-form symmetries for $p \geq 0$ in asymptotically AdS spacetimes, which includes the case of non-invertible symmetries. Provided one has a suitable notion of subregion-subregion duality, our argument for the absence of bulk global symmetries applies to more general spacetimes. These considerations also motivate us to consider for general QFTs (holographic or not) the notion of lower-form symmetries, namely, $(-m)$-form symmetries for $m \geq 2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19079v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We take a fresh look at the relation between generalised K\"ahler geometry and $N=(2,2)$ supersymmetric sigma models in two dimensions formulated in terms of $(2,2)$ superfields. Dual formulations in terms of different kinds of superfield are combined to give a formulation with a doubled target space and both the original superfield and the dual superfield. For K\"ahler geometry, we show that this doubled geometry is Donaldson's deformation of the holomorphic cotangent bundle of the original K\"ahler manifold. This doubled formulation gives an elegant geometric reformulation of the equations of motion. We interpret the equations of motion as the intersection of two Lagrangian submanifolds (or of a Lagrangian submanifold with an isotropic one) in the infinite dimensional symplectic supermanifold which is the analogue of phase space. We then consider further extensions of this formalism, including one in which the geometry is quadrupled, and discuss their geometry.</description>

      <title>Vacuum energy density for interacting real and complex scalar fields in a Lorentz symmetry violation scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14656v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper the vacuum energy density and generation of topological mass are investigated for a system of a real and complex scalar fields interacting with each other. In addition to that, it is also included the quartic self-interaction for each one of the fields. The condition imposed on the real field is the periodic condition, while the complex field obey a quasi-periodic condition. The system is placed in a scenario where the CPT-even aether-type Lorentz symmetry violation takes place. We allow that the Lorentz violation affects the fields with different intensities. The vacuum energy density, its loop correction, and the topological mass are evaluated analytically. It is also discussed the possibility of different vacuum states and their corresponding stability requirements, which depends on the conditions imposed on the fields, the interaction coupling constants and also the Lorentz violation parameters. The formalism used here to perform this investigation is the effective potential one, which is written as a loop expansion via path integral in quantum field theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15168v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By using the braneworld model, we investigate the time evolution of microscopic and macroscopic correlations in expanding universes. To describe the FLRW cosmologies in the holographic setup, we take into account a braneworld moving in the $p$-brane gas geometry, where the radial motion of the braneworld determines the cosmology in the braneworld. We show that the braneworld model reproduces the standard cosmology exactly. In this braneworld model, we investigate the time-dependent mutual information between two disjoint macroscopic subregions and the time-dependent two-point functions in the expanding universes. We find that the mutual information becomes zero when the distance between two subregions is slightly larger than the subsystem size. We also find that it decreases as time and the density of matter increase. On the other hand, the microscopic two-point function in the short-distance limit decreases by a power law, while it is exponentially suppressed in the long-distance limit due to the screening effect. In addition, we find that the two-point function is also suppressed by a power law with time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galilean and Carrollian algebras acting on two-dimensional Newton-Cartan and Carrollian manifolds are isomorphic. A consequence of this property is a duality correspondence between one-dimensional Galilean and Carrollian fluids. We describe the dynamics of these systems as they emerge from the relevant limits of Lorentzian hydrodynamics, and explore the advertised duality relationship. This interchanges longitudinal and transverse directions with respect to the flow velocity, and permutes equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium observables, unveiling specific features of Carrollian physics. We investigate the action of local hydrodynamic-frame transformations in the Galilean and Carrollian configurations, i.e. dual Galilean and Carrollian local boosts, and comment on their potential breaking. Emphasis is laid on the additional geometric elements that are necessary to attain complete systems of hydrodynamic equations in Newton-Cartan and Carroll spacetimes. Our analysis is conducted in general Cartan frames as well as in more explicit coordinates, specifically suited to Galilean or Carrollian use.</description>

      <title>Kaluza-Klein discreteness of the entropy: Symmetrical bath and CFT subsystem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13447v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the entanglement entropy of CFT systems in contact with large bath system, such that the complete system lives on the boundary of $AdS_{d+1}$ spacetime. We are interested in finding the HEE of a bath (system-B) in contact with a central subsystem-A. We assume that the net size of systems A and B together remains fixed while allowing variation in individual sizes. This assumption is simply guided by the conservation laws. It is found that for large bath size the island entropy term are important. However other subleading (icebergs) terms do also contribute to bath entropy. The contributions are generally not separable from each other and all such contributions add together to give rise a fixed quantity. Further when accounted properly all such contributions will form part of higher entropy branch for the bath. Nevertheless the HEE of bath system should be subjected to minimality principle. The quantum minimality principle $ S_{quantum}[B]=\{S[A], S_{total}+S[A]\}_{min}$, is local in nature and gives rise to the Page curve. It is shown that the changes in bath entropy do capture Kaluza-Klein discreteness. The minimality principle would be applicable in finite temperature systems as well.</description>

Abstract: We study non-SUSY CFTs that are marginal deformations of $ \mathcal{N}=2 $ SCFTs in 4d. We explore the fate of integrability and/or non-integrability in these CFTs using the techniques of factorisation of scattering amplitudes in 2d sigma models. We show possibilities for the factorisation of scattering amplitudes in the absence of flavour D6 branes which rules out non-integrability in the dual non-SUSY CFTs.</description>

Abstract: For any (possibly singular) hyperelliptic curve, we give the definition of a hyperelliptic refined spectral curve and the hyperelliptic refined topological recursion, generalising the formulation for a special class of genus-zero curves by Kidwai and the author, and also improving the proposal by Chekhov and Eynard. Along the way, we uncover a fundamental geometric structure underlying the hyperelliptic refined topological recursion and investigate its properties -- parts of which remain conjectural due to computational difficulties. Moreover, we establish a new recursion valid in the so-called Nekrasov-Shatashivili limit and prove existence of the corresponding quantum curve.</description>

      <title>Solving Superconducting Quantum Circuits in Dirac's Constraint Analysis Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.10611v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we exploit Dirac's Constraint Analysis (DCA) in Hamiltonian formalism to study different types of Superconducting Quantum Circuits (SQC) in a {\it{unified}} way. The Lagrangian of a SQC reveals the constraints, that are classified in a Hamiltonian framework, such that redundant variables can be removed to isolate the canonical degrees of freedom for subsequent quantization of the Dirac Brackets via a generalized Correspondence Principle. This purely algebraic approach makes the application of concepts such as graph theory, null vector, loop charge,\ etc that are in vogue, (each for a specific type of circuit), completely redundant. The universal validity of DCA scheme in SQC, proposed by us, is demonstrated by correctly re-deriving existing results for different SQCs, obtained previously exploiting different formalisms each applicable for a specific SQC. Furthermore, we have also analysed and predicted new results for a generic form of SQC - it will be interesting to see its validation in an explicit circuit implementation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the simplest, and currently favoured, theoretical realizations of cosmic inflation yield a sharp prediction for the running of the spectral index $\alpha_\mathrm{S}$. Using latest cosmological data, we compute its marginalized posterior probability distribution over the space of nearly 300 models of single-field slow-roll inflation. The most probable value is $\alpha_\mathrm{S}=-6.3 \times 10^{-4}$, lying within the $98\%$ credible interval $-1.8 \times 10^{-3}&lt; \alpha_\mathrm{S}&lt; -9.1 \times 10^{-5}$. Within the landscape of all the proposed slow-roll inflationary models, positive values for the running are therefore disfavoured at more than three-sigma.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11576v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the possibility of traversable wormhole formation in the dark matter halos in the context of $f(Q)$ gravity. We obtain the exact wormhole solutions with anisotropic matter source based on the Bose-Einstein condensate, Navarro-Frenk-White, and pseudo-isothermal matter density profiles. Notably, we present a novel wormhole solution supported by these dark matters using the expressions for the density profile and rotational velocity along with the modified field equations to calculate the redshift and shape functions of the wormholes. With a particular set of parameters, we demonstrate that our proposed wormhole solutions fulfill the flare-out condition against an asymptotic background. Additionally, we examine the energy conditions, focusing on the null energy conditions at the wormhole's throat, providing a graphical representation of the feasible and negative regions. Our study also examines the wormhole's shadow in the presence of various dark matter models, revealing that higher central densities result in a shadow closer to the throat, whereas lower values have the opposite effect. Moreover, we explore the deflection of light when it encounters these wormholes, particularly noting that light deflection approaches infinity at the throat, where the gravitational field is extremely strong.</description>

      <title>The hydrodynamics of inverse phase transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01596v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: First order phase transitions are violent phenomena that occur when the state of the universe evolves abruptly from one vacuum to another. A \emph{direct} phase transition connects a local vacuum to a deeper vacuum of the zero--temperature potential, and the energy difference between the two minima manifests itself in the acceleration of the bubble wall. In this sense, the transition is triggered by the release of vacuum energy. On the other hand, an \emph{inverse} phase transition connects a deeper minimum of the zero--temperature potential to a higher one, and the bubble actually expands against the vacuum energy. The transition is then triggered purely by thermal corrections. We study for the first time the hydrodynamics and the energy budget of inverse phase transitions. We find several modes of expansion for inverse bubbles, which are related to the known ones for direct transitions by a mirror symmetry. We finally investigate the friction exerted on the bubble wall and comment on the possibility of runaway walls in inverse phase transitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05100v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study finite temperature dynamical correlation functions of the magnetization operator in the one-dimensional Ising quantum field theory. Our approach is based on a finite temperature form factor series and on a Fredholm determinant representation of the correlators. While for space-like separations the Fredholm determinant can be efficiently evaluated numerically, for the time-like region it has convergence issues inherited from the form factor series. We develop a method to compute the correlation functions at time-like separations based on the analytic continuation of the space-time coordinates to complex values. Using this numerical technique, we explore all space-time and temperature regimes in both the ordered and disordered phases including short, large, and near-light-cone separations at low and high temperatures. We confirm the existing analytic predictions for the asymptotic behavior of the correlations except in the case of space-like correlations in the paramagnetic phase. For this case we derive a new closed form expression for the correlation length that has some unusual properties: it is a non-analytic function of both the space-time direction and the temperature, and its temperature dependence is non-monotonic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19713v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a refined version of the string-net model which assigns a different energy cost to each plaquette excitation. Using recent exact calculations of the energy-level degeneracies we compute the partition function of this model and investigate several thermodynamical quantities. In the thermodynamic limit, we show that the partition function is dominated by the contribution of special particles, dubbed pure fluxons, which trivially braid with all other (product of) fluxons. We also analyze the behavior of Wegner-Wilson loops associated to excitations and show that they obey an area law, indicating confinement, for any finite temperature except for pure fluxons that always remain deconfined. Finally, using a recently proposed conjecture, we compute the topological mutual information at finite temperature, which features a nontrivial scaling between system size and temperature, similar to the one-dimensional classical Ising model.</description>

      <title>Gauge invariant quantum backreaction in U(1) axion inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19960v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We evaluate the quantum backreaction due to a gauge field coupled to a pseudo-scalar field driving a slow-roll inflationary stage, the so-called axion inflation. The backreaction is evaluated for the first time using a gauge invariant approach, going to second order in perturbation theory, and taking into consideration inflaton fluctuations as well as scalar perturbations of the metric. Within our gauge-invariant, but observer-dependent approach, we naturally consider as physical observers the ones comoving with the inflaton field. Considering the effective expansion rate consequent to the gauge field's backreaction, we observe that the backreaction effect becomes significant quite rapidly, moving the system out of the perturbative regime and into what is often referred to as the strong backreaction regime. This behavior also applies to the parameter that dictates the production of the gauge fields. The space-time backreaction is mainly due to the helicity contribution within the region of validity of the perturbative regime. As a final result, we see that the evaluated backreaction goes in the direction of prolonging the inflationary period more compared to the scenarios previously studied.</description>

      <title>Thermal pion condensation: holography meets lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12641</link>

Abstract: The holographic Witten-Sakai-Sugimoto model is often employed to describe strongly-coupled baryonic and isospin-asymmetric matter, for example in the context of neutron stars. Here we consider the case of vanishing baryon chemical potential, where detailed comparisons to data from lattice QCD are possible. To this end, we extend previous works by including a realistic pion mass and pion condensation into the decompactified limit of the model and evaluate the system for arbitrary isospin chemical potentials and temperatures. After suitably fixing the 3 parameters of the model, we find that the overall phase structure is in excellent agreement with lattice results. This also holds for observables at low temperatures in the strongly coupled regime, while we discover and discuss some discrepancies at large temperatures. Our findings give reassurance for the validity of previous and future applications of this model and highlight the aspects where improvements are needed.</description>

      <title>Is Lattice Quantum Gravity Asymptotically Safe? Making contact between Causal Dynamical Triangulations and the Functional Renormalization Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07808v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compare the effective action of the scale factor obtained from lattice quantum gravity (in the form of Causal Dynamical Triangulations (CDT)) to the corresponding effective action obtained from the simplest Functional Renormalization Group (FRG) calculation. In this way, we can identify the generic infinite four-volume limit of the lattice theory in the so-called de Sitter phase with the Gaussian fixed-point limit or the IR fixed-point limit obtained by FRG. We also show how to identify a putative UV lattice gravity fixed point. Our Monte Carlo simulations of CDT allow for the existence of such a UV fixed point, although the data precision does not yet provide a proof of its existence. The concept of a correlation length relevant for the lattice gravity fixed points is argued to be different from the concept of correlation lengths encountered in field theories in a fixed spacetime background.</description>

      <title>Scant evidence for thawing quintessence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17318v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: New constraints on the expansion rate of the Universe seem to favor evolving dark energy in the form of thawing quintessence models, i.e., models for which a canonical, minimally coupled scalar field has, at late times, begun to evolve away from potential energy domination. We scrutinize the evidence for thawing quintessence by exploring what it predicts for the equation of state. We show that, in terms of the usual Chevalier-Polarski-Linder parameters, ($w_0$, $w_a$), thawing quintessence is, in fact, only marginally consistent with a compilation of the current data. Despite this, we embrace the possibility that thawing quintessence is dark energy and find constraints on the microphysics of this scenario. We do so in terms of the effective mass $m^2$ and energy scale $V_0$ of the scalar field potential. We are particularly careful to enforce un-informative, flat priors on these parameters so as to minimize their effect on the final posteriors. While the current data favors a large and negative value of $m^2$, when we compare these models to the standard $\Lambda$CDM model we find that there is scant evidence for thawing quintessence.</description>
