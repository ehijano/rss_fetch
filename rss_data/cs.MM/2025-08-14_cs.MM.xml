      <title>PETLP: A Privacy-by-Design Pipeline for Social Media Data in AI Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media data presents AI researchers with overlapping obligations under the GDPR, copyright law, and platform terms -- yet existing frameworks fail to integrate these regulatory domains, leaving researchers without unified guidance. We introduce PETLP (Privacy-by-design Extract, Transform, Load, and Present), a compliance framework that embeds legal safeguards directly into extended ETL pipelines. Central to PETLP is treating Data Protection Impact Assessments as living documents that evolve from pre-registration through dissemination. Through systematic Reddit analysis, we demonstrate how extraction rights fundamentally differ between qualifying research organisations (who can invoke DSM Article 3 to override platform restrictions) and commercial entities (bound by terms of service), whilst GDPR obligations apply universally. We reveal why true anonymisation remains unachievable for social media data and expose the legal gap between permitted dataset creation and uncertain model distribution. By structuring compliance decisions into practical workflows and simplifying institutional data management plans, PETLP enables researchers to navigate regulatory complexity with confidence, bridging the gap between legal requirements and research practice.</description>

      <title>AI Blob! LLM-Driven Recontextualization of Italian Television Archives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces AI Blob!, an experimental system designed to explore the potential of semantic cataloging and Large Language Models (LLMs) for the retrieval and recontextualization of archival television footage. Drawing methodological inspiration from Italian television programs such as Blob (RAI Tre, 1989-), AI Blob! integrates automatic speech recognition (ASR), semantic embeddings, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to organize and reinterpret archival content. The system processes a curated dataset of 1,547 Italian television videos by transcribing audio, segmenting it into sentence-level units, and embedding these segments into a vector database for semantic querying. Upon user input of a thematic prompt, the LLM generates a range of linguistically and conceptually related queries, guiding the retrieval and recombination of audiovisual fragments. These fragments are algorithmically selected and structured into narrative sequences producing montages that emulate editorial practices of ironic juxtaposition and thematic coherence. By foregrounding dynamic, content-aware retrieval over static metadata schemas, AI Blob! demonstrates how semantic technologies can facilitate new approaches to archival engagement, enabling novel forms of automated narrative construction and cultural analysis. The project contributes to ongoing debates in media historiography and AI-driven archival research, offering both a conceptual framework and a publicly available dataset to support further interdisciplinary experimentation.</description>

      <title>In-place Double Stimulus Methodology for Subjective Assessment of High Quality Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel double stimulus subjective assessment methodology for the evaluation of high quality images to address the limitations of existing protocols in detecting subtle perceptual differences. The In-place Double Stimulus Quality Scale (IDSQS) allows subjects to alternately view a reference and a distorted image at the same spatial location, facilitating a more intuitive detection of differences in quality, especially at high to visually lossless quality levels. A large-scale crowdsourcing study employing this methodology was conducted, generating a comprehensive public dataset to evaluate perceived image quality across several compression algorithms and distortion levels. An additional contribution is the modeling of quality scores using a Beta distribution, allowing for the assessment of variability and subject consistency. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of the IDSQS methodology in achieving high correlation with more precise subjective evaluation benchmarks. The dataset, subjective data, and graphical user interface developed for this study are publicly available at https://github.com/shimamohammadi/IDSQS</description>

      <title>Waymo-3DSkelMo: A Multi-Agent 3D Skeletal Motion Dataset for Pedestrian Interaction Modeling in Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale high-quality 3D motion datasets with multi-person interactions are crucial for data-driven models in autonomous driving to achieve fine-grained pedestrian interaction understanding in dynamic urban environments. However, existing datasets mostly rely on estimating 3D poses from monocular RGB video frames, which suffer from occlusion and lack of temporal continuity, thus resulting in unrealistic and low-quality human motion. In this paper, we introduce Waymo-3DSkelMo, the first large-scale dataset providing high-quality, temporally coherent 3D skeletal motions with explicit interaction semantics, derived from the Waymo Perception dataset. Our key insight is to utilize 3D human body shape and motion priors to enhance the quality of the 3D pose sequences extracted from the raw LiDRA point clouds. The dataset covers over 14,000 seconds across more than 800 real driving scenarios, including rich interactions among an average of 27 agents per scene (with up to 250 agents in the largest scene). Furthermore, we establish 3D pose forecasting benchmarks under varying pedestrian densities, and the results demonstrate its value as a foundational resource for future research on fine-grained human behavior understanding in complex urban environments. The dataset and code will be available at https://github.com/GuangxunZhu/Waymo-3DSkelMo</description>

      <title>Episodic Memory Representation for Long-form Video Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) excel at general video understanding but struggle with long-form videos due to context window limits. Consequently, recent approaches focus on keyframe retrieval, condensing lengthy videos into a small set of informative frames. Despite their practicality, these methods simplify the problem to static text image matching, overlooking spatio temporal relationships crucial for capturing scene transitions and contextual continuity, and may yield redundant keyframes with limited information, diluting salient cues essential for accurate video question answering. To address these limitations, we introduce Video-EM, a training free framework inspired by the principles of human episodic memory, designed to facilitate robust and contextually grounded reasoning. Rather than treating keyframes as isolated visual entities, Video-EM explicitly models them as temporally ordered episodic events, capturing both spatial relationships and temporal dynamics necessary for accurately reconstructing the underlying narrative. Furthermore, the framework leverages chain of thought (CoT) thinking with LLMs to iteratively identify a minimal yet highly informative subset of episodic memories, enabling efficient and accurate question answering by Video-LLMs. Extensive evaluations on the Video-MME, EgoSchema, HourVideo, and LVBench benchmarks confirm the superiority of Video-EM, which achieves highly competitive results with performance gains of 4-9 percent over respective baselines while utilizing fewer frames.</description>

      <title>Multimodal LLM-based Query Paraphrasing for Video Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Text-to-video retrieval answers user queries through searches based on concepts and embeddings. However, due to limitations in the size of the concept bank and the amount of training data, answering queries in the wild is not always effective because of the out-of-vocabulary problem. Furthermore, neither concept-based nor embedding-based search can perform reasoning to consolidate search results for complex queries that include logical and spatial constraints. To address these challenges, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to paraphrase queries using text-to-text (T2T), text-to-image (T2I), and image-to-text (I2T) transformations. These transformations rephrase abstract concepts into simpler terms to mitigate the out-of-vocabulary problem. Additionally, complex relationships within a query can be decomposed into simpler sub-queries, improving retrieval performance by effectively fusing the search results of these sub-queries. To mitigate the issue of LLM hallucination, this paper also proposes a novel consistency-based verification strategy to filter out factually incorrect paraphrased queries. Extensive experiments are conducted for ad-hoc video search and known-item search on the TRECVid datasets. We provide empirical insights into how traditionally difficult-to-answer queries can be effectively resolved through query paraphrasing.</description>

      <title>Emotion-Qwen: A Unified Framework for Emotion and Vision Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06685v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate emotion understanding in videos necessitates effectively recognizing and interpreting emotional states by integrating visual, textual, auditory, and contextual cues. Although recent Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have exhibited significant progress in general vision-language (VL) tasks, their performance often deteriorates in emotion-specific scenarios, exhibiting catastrophic forgetting when fine-tuned on emotion-centric tasks. To overcome these limitations, we propose Emotion-Qwen, a unified multimodal framework designed to simultaneously enable robust emotion understanding and preserve general VL reasoning capabilities. Emotion-Qwen introduces a novel Hybrid Compressor based on a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, dynamically routing inputs to optimally balance emotion-specific processing and general multimodal reasoning. We further propose a carefully structured three-stage pre-training pipeline, leveraging extensive general and emotion-focused datasets to strengthen multimodal representation robustness and model adaptability. Additionally, we develop the Video Emotion Reasoning (VER) dataset, a large-scale bilingual resource containing over 40K video clips annotated with detailed context-aware emotional descriptions, significantly facilitating research on fine-grained emotional reasoning. Extensive experiments confirm that Emotion-Qwen achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple emotion recognition and reasoning benchmarks, while maintaining highly competitive results in general VL tasks.</description>

      <title>VGGSounder: Audio-Visual Evaluations for Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08237v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emergence of audio-visual foundation models underscores the importance of reliably assessing their multi-modal understanding. The VGGSound dataset is commonly used as a benchmark for evaluation audio-visual classification. However, our analysis identifies several limitations of VGGSound, including incomplete labelling, partially overlapping classes, and misaligned modalities. These lead to distorted evaluations of auditory and visual capabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce VGGSounder, a comprehensively re-annotated, multi-label test set that extends VGGSound and is specifically designed to evaluate audio-visual foundation models. VGGSounder features detailed modality annotations, enabling precise analyses of modality-specific performance. Furthermore, we reveal model limitations by analysing performance degradation when adding another input modality with our new modality confusion metric.</description>

      <title>Fact-Checking at Scale: Multimodal AI for Authenticity and Context Verification in Online Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The proliferation of multimedia content on social media platforms has dramatically transformed how information is consumed and disseminated. While this shift enables real-time coverage of global events, it also facilitates the rapid spread of misinformation and disinformation, especially during crises such as wars, natural disasters, or elections. The rise of synthetic media and the reuse of authentic content in misleading contexts have intensified the need for robust multimedia verification tools. In this paper, we present a comprehensive system developed for the ACM Multimedia 2025 Grand Challenge on Multimedia Verification. Our system assesses the authenticity and contextual accuracy of multimedia content in multilingual settings and generates both expert-oriented verification reports and accessible summaries for the general public. We introduce a unified verification pipeline that integrates visual forensics, textual analysis, and multimodal reasoning, and propose a hybrid approach to detect out-of-context (OOC) media through semantic similarity, temporal alignment, and geolocation cues. Extensive evaluations on the Grand Challenge benchmark demonstrate the system's effectiveness across diverse real-world scenarios. Our contributions advance the state of the art in multimedia verification and offer practical tools for journalists, fact-checkers, and researchers confronting information integrity challenges in the digital age.</description>

      <title>STAC: Leveraging Spatio-Temporal Data Associations For Efficient Cross-Camera Streaming and Analytics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15288v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In IoT based distributed network of cameras, real-time multi-camera video analytics is challenged by high bandwidth demands and redundant visual data, creating a fundamental tension where reducing data saves network overhead but can degrade model performance, and vice versa. We present STAC, a cross-cameras surveillance system that leverages spatio-temporal associations for efficient object tracking under constrained network conditions. STAC integrates multi-resolution feature learning, ensuring robustness under variable networked system level optimizations such as frame filtering, FFmpeg-based compression, and Region-of-Interest (RoI) masking, to eliminate redundant content across distributed video streams while preserving downstream model accuracy for object identification and tracking. Evaluated on NVIDIA's AICity Challenge dataset, STAC achieves a 76\% improvement in tracking accuracy and an 8.6x reduction in inference latency over a standard multi-object multi-camera tracking baseline (using YOLOv4 and DeepSORT). Furthermore, 29\% of redundant frames are filtered, significantly reducing data volume without compromising inference quality.</description>

      <title>MapStory: Prototyping Editable Map Animations with LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21966v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce MapStory, an LLM-powered animation prototyping tool that generates editable map animation sequences directly from natural language text by leveraging a dual-agent LLM architecture. Given a user written script, MapStory automatically produces a scene breakdown, which decomposes the text into key map animation primitives such as camera movements, visual highlights, and animated elements. Our system includes a researcher agent that accurately queries geospatial information by leveraging an LLM with web search, enabling automatic extraction of relevant regions, paths, and coordinates while allowing users to edit and query for changes or additional information to refine the results. Additionally, users can fine-tune parameters of these primitive blocks through an interactive timeline editor. We detail the system's design and architecture, informed by formative interviews with professional animators and by an analysis of 200 existing map animation videos. Our evaluation, which includes expert interviews (N=5) and a usability study (N=12), demonstrates that MapStory enables users to create map animations with ease, facilitates faster iteration, encourages creative exploration, and lowers barriers to creating map-centric stories.</description>

      <title>MIND: A Noise-Adaptive Denoising Framework for Medical Images Integrating Multi-Scale Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07817v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The core role of medical images in disease diagnosis makes their quality directly affect the accuracy of clinical judgment. However, due to factors such as low-dose scanning, equipment limitations and imaging artifacts, medical images are often accompanied by non-uniform noise interference, which seriously affects structure recognition and lesion detection. This paper proposes a medical image adaptive denoising model (MI-ND) that integrates multi-scale convolutional and Transformer architecture, introduces a noise level estimator (NLE) and a noise adaptive attention module (NAAB), and realizes channel-spatial attention regulation and cross-modal feature fusion driven by noise perception. Systematic testing is carried out on multimodal public datasets. Experiments show that this method significantly outperforms the comparative methods in image quality indicators such as PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS, and improves the F1 score and ROC-AUC in downstream diagnostic tasks, showing strong prac-tical value and promotional potential. The model has outstanding benefits in structural recovery, diagnostic sensitivity, and cross-modal robustness, and provides an effective solution for medical image enhancement and AI-assisted diagnosis and treatment.</description>
