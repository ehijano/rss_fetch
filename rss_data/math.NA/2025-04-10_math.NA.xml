      <title>Efficient Simulation of Singularly Perturbed Systems Using a Stabilized Multirate Explicit Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Singularly perturbed systems (SPSs) are prevalent in engineering applications, where numerically solving their initial value problems (IVPs) is challenging due to stiffness arising from multiple time scales. Classical explicit methods require impractically small time steps for stability, while implicit methods developed for SPSs are computationally intensive and less efficient for strongly nonlinear systems. This paper introduces a Stabilized Multirate Explicit Scheme (SMES) that stabilizes classical explicit methods without the need for small time steps or implicit formulations. By employing a multirate approach with variable time steps, SMES allows the fast dynamics to rapidly converge to their equilibrium manifold while slow dynamics evolve with larger steps. Analysis shows that SMES achieves numerical stability with significantly reduced computational effort and controlled error. Its effectiveness is illustrated with a numerical example.</description>

      <title>On Mixed-Precision Iterative Methods and Analysis for Nearly Completely Decomposable Markov Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the problem of computing the stationary distribution of nearly completely decomposable Markov processes, a well-established area in the classical theory of Markov processes with broad applications in the design, modeling, analysis and optimization of computer systems. We design general classes of algorithmic solution approaches that exploit forms of mixed-precision computation to significantly reduce computation times and that exploit forms of iterative approximate methods to mitigate the impact of inaccurate computations, further reduce computation times, and ensure convergence. Then we derive a mathematical analysis of our general algorithmic approaches that establishes theoretical results on approximation errors, convergence behaviors, and other algorithmic properties. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our general algorithmic approaches provide significant improvements in computation times over the most efficient existing numerical methods.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Enhanced Polyconvexification of Isotropic Energy Densities in Computational Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a neural network approach for fast evaluation of parameter-dependent polyconvex envelopes, which are crucial in computational mechanics. Our method uses a neural network architecture that inherently encodes polyconvexity in the main variable by combining a feature extraction layer that computes the minors function on the signed singular value characterisation of isotropic energy densities with a partially input convex neural network (PICNN). Polyconvex underestimation is weakly enforced by penalisation during training, as are the symmetries of the function. As a guiding example, we focus on a well-known isotropic damage problem, reformulated in terms of signed singular values, and apply a splitting approach to reduce the dimensionality of the parameter space, thereby making training more tractable. Numerical experiments show that the networks achieve sufficient accuracy for engineering applications while providing high compression and significant speed-up over traditional polyconvexification schemes. Most importantly, the network adapts to varying physical or material parameters, enabling real-time polyconvexification in large-scale computational mechanics scenarios.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Variance in the Central Limit Theorem for Multilevel Markovian Stochastic Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we consider the finite-dimensional parameter estimation problem associated to inverse problems. In such scenarios, one seeks to maximize the marginal likelihood associated to a Bayesian model. This latter model is connected to the solution of partial or ordinary differential equation. As such, there are two primary difficulties in maximizing the marginal likelihood (i) that the solution of differential equation is not always analytically tractable and (ii) neither is the marginal likelihood. Typically (i) is dealt with using a numerical solution of the differential equation, leading to a numerical bias and (ii) has been well studied in the literature using, for instance, Markovian stochastic approximation. It is well-known that to reduce the computational effort to obtain the maximal value of the parameter, one can use a hierarchy of solutions of the differential equation and combine with stochastic gradient methods. Several approaches do exactly this. In this paper we consider the asymptotic variance in the central limit theorem, associated to known estimates and find bounds on the asymptotic variance in terms of the precision of the solution of the differential equation. The significance of these bounds are the that they provide missing theoretical guidelines on how to set simulation parameters; that is, these appear to be the first mathematical results which help to run the methods efficiently in practice.</description>

      <title>Computation of shape Taylor expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shape derivative is an important analytical tool for studying scattering problems involving perturbations in scatterers. Many applications, including inverse scattering, optimal design, and uncertainty quantification, are based on shape derivatives. However, computing high order shape derivatives is challenging due to the complexity of shape calculus. This work introduces a comprehensive method for computing shape Taylor expansions in two dimensions using recurrence formulas. The approach is developed under sound-soft, sound-hard, impedance, and transmission boundary conditions. Additionally, we apply the shape Taylor expansion to uncertainty quantification in wave scattering, enabling high order moment estimation for the scattered field under random boundary perturbations. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the shape Taylor expansion in achieving high order approximations.</description>

      <title>Convergence of a continuous Galerkin method for the Biot-Allard poroelasticity system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a space-time finite element method for a system of poromechanics with memory effects that are modeled by a convolution integral. In the literature, the system is referred to as the Biot-Allard model. We recast the model as a first-order system in time, where the memory effects are transformed into an auxiliary differential equation. This allows for a computationally efficient numerical scheme. The system is discretized by continuous Galerkin methods in time and equal-order finite element methods in space. An optimal order error estimate is proved for the norm of the first-order energy of the unknowns of the system. The estimate is confirmed by numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Mixed-Precision in High-Order Methods: the Impact of Floating-Point Precision on the ADER-DG Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a mixed-precision implementation of the high-order discontinuous Galerkin method with ADER time stepping (ADER-DG) for solving hyperbolic systems of partial differential equations (PDEs) in the hyperbolic PDE engine ExaHyPE. The implementation provides a simple API extension for specifying the numerical precision for individual kernels, and thus allows for testing the effect of low and mixed precision on the accuracy of the solution. To showcase this, we study the impact of precision on the overall convergence order and actual accuracy of the method as achieved for four common hyperbolic PDE systems and five relevant scenarios that feature an analytic solution. For all scenarios, we also assess how sensitive each kernel of the ADER-DG algorithm is to using double, single or even half precision. This addresses the question where thoughtful adoption of mixed precision can mitigate hurtful effects of low precision on the overall simulation.</description>

      <title>On the Compressibility of Integral Operators in Anisotropic Wavelet Coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present article is concerned with the s*-compressibility of classical boundary integral operators in anisotropic wavelet coordinates. Having the s*-compressibility at hand, one can design adaptive wavelet algorithms which are asymptotically optimal, meaning that any target accuracy can be achieved at a computational expense that stays proportional to the number of degrees of freedom (within the setting determined by an underlying wavelet basis) that would ideally be necessary for realising that target accuracy if full knowledge about the unknown solution were given. As we consider here anisotropic wavelet coordinates, we can achieve higher convergence rates compared to the standard, isotropic setting. Especially, edge singularities of anisotropic nature can be resolved.</description>

      <title>A Krylov projection algorithm for large symmetric matrices with dense spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the approximation of $B^T (A+sI)^{-1} B$ for large s.p.d. $A\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ with dense spectrum and $B\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times p}$, $p\ll n$. We target the computations of Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) transfer functions for large-scale discretizations of problems with continuous spectral measures, such as linear time-invariant (LTI) PDEs on unbounded domains. Traditional Krylov methods, such as the Lanczos or CG algorithm, are known to be optimal for the computation of $(A+sI)^{-1}B$ with real positive $s$, resulting in an adaptation to the distinctively discrete and nonuniform spectra. However, the adaptation is damped for matrices with dense spectra. It was demonstrated in [Zimmerling, Druskin, Simoncini, Journal of Scientific Computing 103(1), 5 (2025)] that averaging Gau{\ss} and Gau\ss -Radau quadratures computed using the block-Lanczos method significantly reduces approximation errors for such problems. Here, we introduce an adaptive Kre\u{i}n-Nudelman extension to the (block) Lanczos recursions, allowing further acceleration at negligible $o(n)$ cost. Similar to the Gau\ss -Radau quadrature, a low-rank modification is applied to the (block) Lanczos matrix. However, unlike the Gau\ss -Radau quadrature, this modification depends on $\sqrt{s}$ and can be considered in the framework of the Hermite-Pad\'e approximants, which are known to be efficient for problems with branch-cuts, that can be good approximations to dense spectral intervals. Numerical results for large-scale discretizations of heat-diffusion and quasi-magnetostatic Maxwell's operators in unbounded domains confirm the efficiency of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Physics informed neural network for forward and inverse modeling of low grade brain tumors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A low grade tumor is a slow growing tumor with a lower likelihood of spreading compared to high grade tumors. Mathematical modeling using partial differential equations (PDEs) plays a crucial role in describing tumor behavior, growth and progression. This study employs the Burgess and extended Fisher Kolmogorov equations to model low-grade brain tumors. We utilize Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) based algorithm to develop an automated numerical solver for these models and explore their application in solving forward and inverse problems in brain tumor modeling. The study aims to demonstrate that the PINN based algorithms serve as advanced methodologies for modeling brain tumor dynamics by integrating deep learning with physics-informed principles. Additionally, we establish generalized error bounds in terms of training and quadrature errors. The convergence and stability of the neural network are derived for both models. Numerical tests confirm the accuracy and efficiency of the algorithms in both linear and nonlinear cases. Additionally, a statistical analysis of the numerical results is presented.</description>

      <title>Solving Power System Problems using Adiabatic Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This letter proposes a novel combinatorial optimization framework that reformulates existing power system problems into a format executable on quantum annealers. The proposed framework accommodates both normal and complex numbers and enables efficient handling of large-scale problems, thus ensuring broad applicability across power system problems. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate its applicability in two classical problems: (i) power system parameter identification, where we estimate the admittance matrix given voltage and current measurements, and (ii) power flow analysis, where we reformulate the nonlinear equations governing active and reactive power balance. The results show that the proposed framework effectively and efficiently solves both linear and nonlinear power system problems, and thus offers significant advantages in scenarios where traditional solvers face challenges, such as ill-conditioned systems and fault conditions.</description>

      <title>Successive randomized compression: A randomized algorithm for the compressed MPO-MPS product</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tensor networks like matrix product states (MPSs) and matrix product operators (MPOs) are powerful tools for representing exponentially large states and operators, with applications in quantum many-body physics, machine learning, numerical analysis, and other areas. In these applications, computing a compressed representation of the MPO--MPS product is a fundamental computational primitive. For this operation, this paper introduces a new single-pass, randomized algorithm, called successive randomized compression (SRC), that improves on existing approaches in speed or in accuracy. The performance of the new algorithm is evaluated on synthetic problems and unitary time evolution problems for quantum spin systems.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Grading and Classification System for End-of-Life Building Components Toward Circular Economy Loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The longevity and viability of construction components in a circular economy demand a robust, data-informed framework for reuse decision-making. This paper introduces a multi-level grading and classification system that combines Bayesian probabilistic modeling with scenario-based performance thresholds to assess the reusability of end-of-life modular components. By grading components across a five-tier scale, the system supports strategic decisions for reuse, up-use, or down-use, ensuring alignment with engineering standards and sustainability objectives. The model's development is grounded in empirical data from precast concrete wall panels, and its explainability is enhanced through decision tree logic and Sankey visualizations that trace the influence of contextual scenarios on classification outcomes. MGCS addresses the environmental, economic, and operational challenges of EoL management--reducing material waste, optimizing value recovery, and improving workflow efficiency. Through dynamic feature weighting and transparent reasoning, the system offers a practical yet rigorous pathway to embed circular thinking into construction industry practices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the convergence of spatial discretizations for reaction-diffusion systems with mass-action law satisfying a detailed balance condition. Considering systems on the d-dimensional torus, we construct appropriate space-discrete processes and show convergence not only on the level of solutions, but also on the level of the gradient systems governing the evolutions. As an important step, we prove chain rule inequalities for the reaction-diffusion systems as well as their discretizations, featuring a non-convex dissipation functional. The convergence is then obtained with variational methods by building on the recently introduced notion of gradient systems in continuity equation format.</description>

      <title>GLT hidden structures in mean-field quantum spin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work explores structured matrix sequences arising in mean-field quantum spin systems. We express these sequences within the framework of generalized locally Toeplitz (GLT) $*$-algebras, leveraging the fact that each GLT matrix sequence has a unique GLT symbol. This symbol characterizes both the asymptotic singular value distribution and, for Hermitian or quasi-Hermitian sequences, the asymptotic spectral distribution. Specifically, we analyze two cases of real symmetric matrix sequences stemming from mean-field quantum spin systems and determine their associated distributions using GLT theory. Our study concludes with visualizations and numerical tests that validate the theoretical findings, followed by a discussion of open problems and future directions.</description>

      <title>Physical configurations of a cell doublet with line tension, a theoretical study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.03098v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a first approximation, early embryos may be modeled as foams whose shape depends on the surface tensions of each cell. However it has been remarked that exist line tensions at polarized exterior cellular interfaces (apical). In order to understand the changes it may imply on the usual foam model, a simple case study is considered: a double cell with line tension. Phase diagrams, bifurcations, possible new configurations are studied.</description>

      <title>Abstract Fractional Cauchy Problem: Existence of Propagators and Inhomogeneous Solution Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a Cauchy problem for the inhomogeneous differential equation given in terms of an unbounded linear operator $A$ and the Caputo fractional derivative of order $\alpha \in (0, 2)$ in time. The previously known representation of the mild solution to such a problem does not have a conventional variation-of-constants like form, with the propagator derived from the associated homogeneous problem. Instead, it relies on the existence of two propagators with different analytical properties. This fact limits theoretical and especially numerical applicability of the existing solution representation. Here, we propose an alternative representation of the mild solution to the given problem, that consolidates the solution formulas for sub-parabolic, parabolic and sub-hyperbolic equations with a positive sectorial operator $A$ and non-zero initial data. The new representation is solely based on the propagator of the homogeneous problem and, therefore, can be considered as a more natural fractional extension of the solution to the classical parabolic Cauchy problem. By exploiting a trade-off between the regularity assumptions on the initial data in terms of the fractional powers of $A$ and the regularity assumptions on the right-hand side in time, we show that the proposed solution formula is strongly convergent for $t \geq 0$ under considerably weaker assumptions compared to the standard results from the literature. Crucially, the achieved relaxation of space regularity assumptions ensures that the new solution representation is practically feasible for any $\alpha \in (0, 2)$ and is amenable to the numerical evaluation using uniformly accurate quadrature-based algorithms.</description>

      <title>On the Loewner framework, the Kolmogorov superposition theorem, and the curse of dimensionality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00495v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Loewner framework is an interpolatory approach for the approximation of linear and nonlinear systems. The purpose here is to extend this framework to linear parametric systems with an arbitrary number n of parameters. To achieve this, a new generalized multivariate rational function realization is proposed. Then, we introduce the n-dimensional multivariate Loewner matrices and show that they can be computed by solving a set of coupled Sylvester equations. The null space of these Loewner matrices allows the construction of the multivariate barycentric rational function. The principal result of this work is to show how the null space of the n-dimensional Loewner matrix can be computed using a sequence of 1-dimensional Loewner matrices, leading to a drastic reduction of the computational burden. Equally importantly, this burden is alleviated by avoiding the explicit construction of large-scale n-dimensional Loewner matrices of size $N \times N$. Instead, the proposed methodology achieves decoupling of variables, leading to (i) a complexity reduction from $O(N^3)$ to below $O(N^{1.5})$ when $n &gt; 5$ and (ii) to memory storage bounded by the largest variable dimension rather than their product, thus taming the curse of dimensionality and making the solution scalable to very large data sets. This decoupling of the variables leads to a result similar to the Kolmogorov superposition theorem for rational functions. Thus, making use of barycentric representations, every multivariate rational function can be computed using the composition and superposition of single-variable functions. Finally, we suggest two algorithms (one direct and one iterative) to construct, directly from data, multivariate (or parametric) realizations ensuring (approximate) interpolation. Numerical examples highlight the effectiveness and scalability of the method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13389v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is proposed to use stochastic differential equations with state-dependent switching rates (SDEwS) for sampling from finite mixture distributions. An Euler scheme with constant time step for SDEwS is considered. It is shown that the scheme converges with order one in weak sense and also in the ergodic limit. Numerical experiments illustrate the use of SDEwS for sampling from mixture distributions and confirm the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>A posteriori error estimates for Schr{\"o}dinger operators discretized with linear combinations of atomic orbitals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish guaranteed and practically computable a posteriori error bounds for source problems and eigenvalue problems involving linear Schr{\"o}dinger operators with atom-centered potentials discretized with linear combinations of atomic orbitals. We show that the energy norm of the discretization error can be estimated by the dual energy norm of the residual, that further decomposes into atomic contributions, characterizing the error localized on atoms. Moreover, we show that the practical computation of the dual norms of atomic residuals involves diagonalizing radial Schr{\"o}dinger operators which can easily be precomputed in practice. We provide numerical illustrations of the performance of such a posteriori analysis on several test cases, showing that the error bounds accurately estimate the error, and that the localized error components allow for optimized adaptive basis sets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05650v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study semi-discrete and fully discrete evolving surface finite element schemes for the Cahn-Hilliard equation with a logarithmic potential. Specifically we consider linear finite elements discretising space and backward Euler time discretisation. Our analysis relies on a specific geometric assumption on the evolution of the surface. Our main results are $L^2_{H^1}$ error bounds for both the semi-discrete and fully discrete schemes, and we provide some numerical results.</description>

      <title>A Novel Algorithm for Periodic Conformal Flattening of Genus-one and Multiply Connected Genus-zero Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19052v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel parameterization method for genus-one and multiply connected genus-zero surfaces, called periodic conformal flattening. The conformal energy minimization technique is utilized to compute the desired conformal map, which is characterised as an easily solvable quadratic functional minimization problem, yielding a sparse linear system. The advantages of the proposed algorithms DPCF and SPCF are a) independence from the cut path selection, which introduces no additional conformal distortion near the cut seams; b) bijectivity guaranteeing for intrinsic Delaunay triangulations. The numerical experiments illustrate that DPCF and SPCF express high accuracy and a 4-5 times improvement in terms of efficiency compared with state-of-the-art algorithms.Based on the theoretical proof of the bijectivity guaranteeing, a simple strategy is applied for to guarantee the bijectivity of the resulting maps for non-Delaunay triangulations. The application on texture mapping illustrates the practicality of our developed algorithms.</description>

      <title>Network inference via approximate Bayesian computation. Illustration on a stochastic multi-population neural mass model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.15787v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we propose an adapted sequential Monte Carlo approximate Bayesian computation (SMC-ABC) algorithm for network inference in coupled stochastic differential equations (SDEs) used for multivariate time series modeling. Our approach is motivated by neuroscience, specifically the challenge of estimating brain connectivity before and during epileptic seizures. To this end, we make four key contributions. First, we introduce a 6N-dimensional SDE to model the activity of N coupled neuronal populations, extending the (single-population) stochastic Jansen and Rit neural mass model used to describe human electroencephalography (EEG) rhythms, particularly epileptic activity. Second, we construct a reliable and efficient numerical splitting scheme for the model simulation. Third, we apply the proposed adapted SMC-ABC algorithm to the neural mass model and validate it on different types of simulated data. Compared to standard SMC-ABC, our approach significantly reduces computational cost by requiring fewer model simulations to reach the desired posterior region, thanks to the inclusion of binary parameters describing the presence or absence of coupling directions. Finally, we apply our method to real multi-channel EEG data, uncovering potential similarities in patients' brain activities across different epileptic seizures, as well as differences between pre-seizure and seizure periods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.11666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Regularization by the Shannon entropy enables us to efficiently and approximately solve optimal transport problems on a finite set. This paper is concerned with regularized optimal transport problems via Bregman divergence. We introduce the required properties for Bregman divergences, provide a non-asymptotic error estimate for the regularized problem, and show that the error estimate becomes faster than exponentially.</description>

      <title>Numerical Fuzz: A Type System for Rounding Error Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04612v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Algorithms operating on real numbers are implemented as floating-point computations in practice, but floating-point operations introduce roundoff errors that can degrade the accuracy of the result. We propose $\Lambda_{num}$, a functional programming language with a type system that can express quantitative bounds on roundoff error. Our type system combines a sensitivity analysis, enforced through a linear typing discipline, with a novel graded monad to track the accumulation of roundoff errors. We prove that our type system is sound by relating the denotational semantics of our language to the exact and floating-point operational semantics. To demonstrate our system, we instantiate $\Lambda_{num}$ with error metrics proposed in the numerical analysis literature and we show how to incorporate rounding operations that faithfully model aspects of the IEEE 754 floating-point standard. To show that $\Lambda_{num}$ can be a useful tool for automated error analysis, we develop a prototype implementation for $\Lambda_{num}$ that infers error bounds that are competitive with existing tools, while often running significantly faster. Finally, we consider semantic extensions of our graded monad to bound error under more complex rounding behaviors, such as non-deterministic and randomized rounding.</description>
