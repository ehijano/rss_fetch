      <title>A quantum picture of light-suppressed photosynthetic charge transfer: Photo-blockade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a dynamic mechanism for the reversible regulation of photochemistry in plants under varying light environments. We employ a three-level quantum model to take into account the correlations between charge donors and charge acceptors immediately before photoexcitation, and show that under steady and coherent driving of light, the efficiency of charge transfer is inversely proportional to the intensity of incident light, which can be suppressed so severely that it becomes a limiting factor on photosynthetic electron transport. These results are analyzed to gain insight in the light responses of photosynthetic parameters. We discuss the implications of thermal fluctuation in the light source used in photochemical experiments, and argue that in high light conditions, the quantum yields measured with an incandescent lamp may be higher than those measured with a laser, a manifestation of thermal fluctuation in lamp illumination. Our new picture renders a consistent interpretation of a wide range of experiments, including plastocyanin-dependent electron transport in photosystem I, biphasic redox kinetics of P700 and wavelength-dependent quantum yields, and provides a donor-side scheme for the onset of irreversible damage to photosystem II.</description>

      <title>Evidence of Chaotic Mixing in the Alveolar Region of the Lung</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report an experimental and numerical investigation to study the role of asymmetry in the expansion-contraction of the acinar wall on the particle transport in the acinus. We model the acinar flow feature using a T-section by appropriately matching the dimensionless numbers to that in the acinus of healthy human subjects. We show that asymmetry in the expansion-contraction process (quantified by $\phi$) is required for chaotic advection. We show the stretch and fold process leading to chaos for a range of $\phi$ and scaled oscillation frequency $Sr$. We show a regime map in this generalize $\phi$ and $Sr$ space and show that most mammalian lungs fall at the boundary of chaotic regime.</description>

      <title>A two-dimensional vertex model for curvy cell-cell interfaces at the subcellular scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-sections of cell shapes in a tissue monolayer typically resemble a tiling of convex polygons. Yet, examples exist where the polygons are not convex with curved cell-cell interfaces, as seen in the adaxial epidermis. To date, two-dimensional vertex models predicting the structure and mechanics of cell monolayers have been mostly limited to convex polygons. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a framework to study curvy cell-cell interfaces at the subcellular scale within vertex models by using a parameterized curve between vertices that is expanded in a Fourier series and whose coefficients represent additional degrees of freedom. This extension to non-convex polygons allows for cells with same shape index, or dimensionless perimeter, to be, for example, either elongated or globular with lobes. In the presence of applied, anisotropic stresses, we find that local, subcellular curvature, or buckling, can be energetically more favorable than larger scale deformations involving groups of cells. Inspired by recent experiments, we also find that local, subcellular curvature at cell-cell interfaces emerges in a group of cells in response to the swelling of additional cells surrounding the group. Our framework, therefore, can account for a wider array of multi-cellular responses to constraints in the tissue environment.</description>

      <title>Meta-plasticity and memory in multi-level recurrent feed-forward networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Network systems can exhibit memory effects in which the interactions between different pairs of nodes adapt in time, leading to the emergence of preferred connections, patterns, and sub-networks. To a first approximation, this memory can be modelled through a ``plastic'' Hebbian or homophily mechanism, in which edges get reinforced proportionally to the amount of information flowing through them. However, recent studies on glia-neuron networks have highlighted how memory can evolve due to more complex dynamics, including multi-level network structures and ``meta-plastic'' effects that modulate reinforcement. Inspired by those systems, here we develop a simple and general model for the dynamics of an adaptive network with an additional meta-plastic mechanism that varies the rate of Hebbian strengthening of its edge connections. Specifically, we consider a biased random walk on a cyclic feed-forward network. The random walk chooses its steps according to the weights of the network edges. The weights evolve through a Hebbian mechanism modulated by a meta-plastic reinforcement, biasing the walker to prefer edges that have been already explored. We study the dynamical emergence (memorization) of preferred paths and their retrieval and identify three regimes: one dominated by the Hebbian term, one in which the meta-reinforcement drives memory formation, and a balanced one. We show that, in the latter two regimes, meta-reinforcement allows for the retrieval of a previously stored path even after weights have been reset to zero to erase Hebbian memory.</description>

      <title>Timed material self-assembly controlled by circadian clock proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.00779v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active biological molecules present a powerful, yet largely untapped, opportunity to impart autonomous regulation to materials. Because these systems can function robustly to regulate when and where chemical reactions occur, they have the ability to bring complex, life-like behavior to synthetic materials. Here, we achieve this design feat by using functionalized circadian clock proteins, KaiB and KaiC, to engineer time-dependent crosslinking of colloids. The resulting material self-assembles with programmable kinetics, producing macroscopic changes in material properties, via molecular assembly of KaiB-KaiC complexes. We show that colloid crosslinking depends strictly on the phosphorylation state of KaiC, with kinetics that are synced with KaiB-KaiC complexing. Our microscopic image analyses and computational models indicate that the stability of colloidal super-structures depends sensitively on the number of Kai complexes per colloid connection. Consistent with our model predictions, a high concentration stabilizes the material against dissolution after a robust self-assembly phase, while a low concentration allows circadian oscillation of material structure. This work introduces the concept of harnessing biological timers to control synthetic materials; and, more generally, opens the door to using protein-based reaction networks to endow synthetic systems with life-like functional properties.</description>

      <title>On the Salient Limitations of `On the Salient Limitations of the Methods of Assembly Theory and their Classification of Molecular Biosignatures'</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12452v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Assembly Theory (AT) is a theory that explains how to determine if a complex object is the product of evolution. Here we explain why attempts to compare AT to compression algorithms, ref 1, does not help identify if the object is the product of selection or not. Specifically, we show why aims to perform benchmark comparisons of different compression schemes to compare the performance of Molecular Assembly Indices against standard compression schemes in determining living vs. non-living samples fails to classify the data correctly. In their approach, Uthamacumaran et al., ref 1, compress data from Marshall et al.2 describing the experimental basis for assembly theory and evaluate the difference in the resulting distributions of data. After several computational experiments Uthamacumaran et al., ref 1, conclude that other compression techniques obtain better results in the problem of detecting life and non-life that of assembly pathways. Here we explain why the approach presented by Uthamacumaran et al.1 appears to be lacking, and why it is not to reproduce their analysis with the information given.</description>
