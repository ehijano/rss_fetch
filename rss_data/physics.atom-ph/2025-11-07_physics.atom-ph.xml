      <title>Photoelectron combs in ionization: Influence of rescattering and nondipole effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ionization by a sequence of extreme ultraviolet pulses is investigated based on the rigorous numerical solution of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation, when the driving laser field is treated exactly. This goes beyond the typically used first-order nondipole approximation and reveals the effects of radiation pressure to its full extent. Specifically, we observe the comb structures in both the momentum and the energy distributions of photoelectrons. The comb peaks are shifted, however, depending on the emission angle of electrons. While similar effect is observed already in the first-order nondipole approximation, with increasing the laser field strength the discrepancy with our exact results becomes more pronounced. Also, we observe the additional substructure of the comb peaks arising in the angle-integrated energy distributions of photoelectrons. Finally, as our numerical calculations account for the atomic potential in the entire interaction region, we observe the loss of coherence of comb structures with increasing the number of laser pulses, that we attribute to rescattering.</description>

      <title>General properties of the RABBITT at parity mixing conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parity mixing in photoionization, i.e. when emitted electrons have different parities but the same energy, causes interference observable only in angle-resolved measurements. The interference typically manifests as a symmetry violation in the photoelectron angular distributions. The traditional, based on HHG, RABBITT scheme with high-order harmonics separated by twice the seed field energy, precludes parity mixing. On the contrary, a free-electron laser provides a possibility to generate even harmonics. Using triple the fundamental frequency as a seed, one obtains a comb of alternating even and odd harmonics, separated by three times the initial frequency [Nature 578, 386-391 (2020)] (2-SB RABBITT). In this setup, there are two sidebands between the main photoelectron lines, versus one in the traditional scheme. In the paper, we examine the general properties of a two-sideband scheme and analyze the symmetry breakdown of photoelectron angular distributions for various polarization geometries of the incident pulse. We found a crucial difference in symmetries between 2-SB RABBITT and other photoionization schemes with parity mixing. Illustrative calculations are carried out for neon with pulse parameters typical for modern facilities. The possibility to reconstruct the temporal profile of the pulse from the angle-resolved measurements is discussed.</description>

      <title>Fast Transport of Trapped Ultracold Atoms Using Shortcuts-to-Adiabaticity by Counterdiabatic Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically study the fast spatial transport of a trapped Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) using shortcuts-to-adiabaticity (STA) by counterdiabatic driving (CD). The trapping potential and the required auxiliary potential were simulated as painted potentials. We compared STA transport to transport that follows a constant-acceleration scheme (CA). Experimentally feasible values of trap depth and atom number were used in the 2D Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) simulations. Different transport times, trap depths, and trap lengths were investigated. In all simulations, there exists a minimum amount of time necessary for fast transport, which is consistent with previous results from quantum speed limit studies.</description>

      <title>Quantum doubles in symmetric blockade structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exactly solvable models of topologically ordered phases with non-abelian anyons typically require complicated many-body interactions which do not naturally appear in nature. This motivates the "inverse problem" of quantum many-body physics: given microscopic systems with experimentally realistic two-body interactions, how to design a Hamiltonian that realizes a desired topological phase? Here we solve this problem on a platform motivated by Rydberg atoms, where elementary two-level systems couple via simple blockade interactions. Within this framework, we construct Hamiltonians that realize topological orders described by non-abelian quantum double models. We analytically prove the existence of topological order in the ground state, and present efficient schemes to prepare these states. We also introduce protocols for the controlled adiabatic braiding of anyonic excitations to probe their non-abelian statistics. Our construction is generic and applies to quantum doubles $\mathcal{D}(G)$ for arbitrary finite groups $G$. We illustrate braiding for the simplest non-abelian quantum double $\mathcal{D}(S_3)$.</description>

      <title>Superfluid Fraction of a 2D Bose-Einstein Condensate in a Triangular Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We experimentally investigate the superfluid properties of a two-dimensional, weakly interacting Bose-Einstein condensate in the zero-temperature regime, when it is subjected to a triangular optical lattice potential. We implement an original method, which involves solving the hydrodynamic continuity equation to extract the superfluid fraction tensor from the measured in situ density distribution of the fluid at rest. In parallel, we apply an independent dynamical approach that combines compressibility and sound velocity measurements to determine the superfluid fraction. Both methods yield consistent results in good agreement with simulations of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation as well as with the Leggett bounds determined from the measured density profiles.</description>

      <title>Silicon nitride based integrated photonic circuit to control a cold-atom source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03279v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have developed a silicon nitride based photonic integrated circuit (PIC) that is responsible for the cooling, pumping and imaging of cold rubidium 87 atoms. The photonic integrated circuit consists of two chips placed next to each other and has a total area of 2x2~cm$^2$. This greatly minimizes the area needed while still having all the optical control functions to create, control and measure a magneto-optical trap (MOT). The piezo electric material Lead Zirconate Titanate (PZT) on the PIC is employed for phase shifting a Mach-Zehnder type configuration where extinction ratios up to 50 dB and switching speeds of 1 MHz are achieved. For the first time a two and three dimensional rubidium 87 MOT is realized using an active PIC. For the three-dimensional MOT, we measure $7\cdot 10^7$ atoms with a temperature of 270~$\mu$K.</description>

      <title>Universality in Ionic Three-body Systems Near an Ion-atom Feshbach Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate bound and scattering properties of a system of two neutral atoms and an ion near an atom-ion Feshbach resonance. Our results indicate that long-range atom-ion interactions lead to significant deviations from universal behavior derived from contact or van der Waals potentials. We find that ionic systems display an overall suppression of inelastic transitions leading to recombination rates and lifetimes of Efimov state orders of magnitude smaller with respect to those for neutral atoms. We further characterize the dense spectra of triatomic molecular ions with extended lifetimes. Our results provide a deeper insight on the universality and structure of three-body ionic systems and establishing them as a promising platform for exploring novel few- and many-body phenomena with long-range interactions.</description>

      <title>Two-photon interference between mutually-detuned resonance fluorescence signals scattered off a semiconductor quantum dot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16939v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The radiative linewidth of a two-level emitter (TLE) fundamentally limits the bandwidth available for quantum information processing. Despite its importance, no prior experiment has systematically examined how driving detuning affects the indistinguishability of photons scattered from a TLE - a parameter critical for photonic quantum computing. Here, we perform post-selective two-photon interference measurements between mutually detuned resonance fluorescence signals from an InAs quantum dot embedded in a micropillar cavity. At small mutual laser detunings (&lt;=0.5GHz), the results are accurately described by the pure-state model [Nat. Commun. 16, 6453 (2025)], which treats all resonance-fluorescence photons as spontaneous emission. At larger detunings, we uncover an anomalous feature in the two-photon interference, where the normalised second-order correlation function under orthogonal polarisations yields g2_vert(0) &lt; 0.5.</description>

      <title>Proposal for realizing Heisenberg-type quantum-spin models in Rydberg-atom quantum simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22461v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the magnetic-field dependence of the interaction between two Rydberg atoms, $|nS_{1/2}, m_J\rangle$ and $|(n+1)S_{1/2}, m_J\rangle$. In this setting, the effective spin-1/2 Hamiltonian takes the form of an {\it XXZ} model. We show that the anisotropy parameter of the {\it XXZ} model can be tuned by applying a magnetic field and, in particular, that it changes drastically near the F\"orster resonance points. Based on this result, we propose experimental realizations of spin-1/2 and spin-1 Heisenberg-type quantum spin models in Rydberg atom quantum simulators, without relying on Floquet engineering. Our results provide guidance for future experiments of Rydberg atom quantum simulators and offer insight into quantum many-body phenomena emerging in the Heisenberg model.</description>
