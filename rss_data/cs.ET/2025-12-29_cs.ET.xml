      <title>Verifiable Passkey: The Decentralized Authentication Standard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Passwordless authentication has revolutionized the way we authenticate across various websites and services. FIDO2 Passkeys, is one of the most-widely adopted standards of passwordless authentication that promises phishing-resistance. However, like any other authentication system, passkeys require the user details to be saved on a centralized server, also known as Relying Party (RP) Server. This has led users to create a new passkey for every new online account. While this just works for a limited number of online accounts, the limited storage space of secure storage modules like TPM or a physical security key limits the number of passkeys a user can have. For example, Yubico Yubikey 5 (firmware 5.0 - 5.6) offers to store only 25 passkeys, while firmware 5.7+ allows to store upto 100 [1]. To overcome this problem, one of the widely adopted approaches is to use Federated Authentication with Single Sign On (SSO). This allows the user to create a passkey for the Identity Provider (IdP) and use the IdP to authenticate to all service providers. This proves to be a significant privacy risk since the IdP can potentially track users across different services. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a novel standard 'Verifiable Passkey' that allows the user to use Passkeys created for a Verifiable Credential issuer across any platform without risking privacy or user tracking.</description>

      <title>Fully analogue in-memory neural computing via quantum tunneling effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fully analogue neural computation requires hardware that can implement both linear and nonlinear transformations without digital assistance. While analogue in-memory computing efficiently realizes matrix-vector multiplication, the absence of learnable analogue nonlinearities remains a central bottleneck. Here we introduce KANalogue, a fully analogue realization of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) that instantiates univariate basis functions directly using negative-differential-resistance (NDR) devices. By mapping the intrinsic current-voltage characteristics of NDR devices to learnable coordinate-wise nonlinear functions, KANalogue embeds function approximation into device physics while preserving a fully analogue signal path. Using cold-metal tunnel diodes as a representative platform, we construct diverse nonlinear bases and combine them through crossbar-based analogue summation. Experiments on MNIST, FashionMNIST, and CIFAR-10 demonstrate that KANalogue achieves competitive accuracy with substantially fewer parameters and higher crossbar node efficiency than analogue MLPs, while approaching the performance of digital KANs under strict hardware constraints. The framework is not limited to a specific device technology and naturally generalizes to a broad class of NDR devices. These results establish a device-grounded route toward scalable, energy-efficient, fully analogue neural networks.</description>

      <title>M2RU: Memristive Minion Recurrent Unit for On-Chip Continual Learning at the Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17299v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continual learning on edge platforms remains challenging because recurrent networks depend on energy-intensive training procedures and frequent data movement that are impractical for embedded deployments. This work introduces M2RU, a mixed-signal architecture that implements the minion recurrent unit for efficient temporal processing with on-chip continual learning. The architecture integrates weighted-bit streaming, which enables multi-bit digital inputs to be processed in crossbars without high-resolution conversion, and an experience replay mechanism that stabilizes learning under domain shifts. M2RU achieves 15 GOPS at 48.62 mW, corresponding to 312 GOPS per watt, and maintains accuracy within 5 percent of software baselines on sequential MNIST and CIFAR-10 tasks. Compared with a CMOS digital design, the accelerator provides 29X improvement in energy efficiency. Device-aware analysis shows an expected operational lifetime of 12.2 years under continual learning workloads. These results establish M2RU as a scalable and energy-efficient platform for real-time adaptation in edge-level temporal intelligence.</description>

      <title>Validation of Quantum Computing for Transition Metal Oxide-based Automotive Catalysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19778v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing presents a promising alternative to classical computational methods for modeling strongly correlated materials with partially filled d orbitals. In this study, we perform a comprehensive quantum resource estimation using quantum phase estimation (QPE) and qubitization techniques for transition metal oxide molecules and a Pd zeolite catalyst fragment. Using the binary oxide molecules TiO, MnO, and FeO, we validate our active space selection and benchmarking methodology, employing classical multireference methods such as complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) and N-electron valence state perturbation theory (NEVPT2). We then apply these methods to estimate the quantum resources required for a full-scale quantum simulation of a $Z_2Pd$ ($Z=Al_2Si_{22}O_{48}$) fragment taken from the $Pd/2(Al_xSi_{(1-x)})$ catalyst family where x=Si/Al. Our analysis demonstrates that for large Pd zeolite systems, simulations achieving chemical accuracy would require ~$10^6-10^7$ physical qubits, and range that is consistent with the projected capabilities of future fault-tolerant quantum devices. We further explore the impact of active space size, basis set quality, and phase estimation error on the required qubit and gate counts. These findings provide a roadmap for near-term and future quantum simulations of industrially relevant catalytic materials, offering insights into the feasibility and scaling of quantum chemistry applications in materials science.</description>
