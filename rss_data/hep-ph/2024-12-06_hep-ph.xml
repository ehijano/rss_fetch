      <title>Jet EEC aWAKEning: hydrodynamic response on the celestial sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observation of the medium response generated by the propagation of high energy partons in the quark gluon plasma produced in heavy-ion collisions would provide a clear and unmistakable evidence for the hydrodynamic behavior of the bulk. Recently, it has been argued that the features of the medium's back-reaction to the jet could be cleanly imprinted in the correlations of asymptotic energy flows, in principle allowing to isolate this signal from other uncorrelated physical processes. Nonetheless, the current limited theoretical understanding of these jet observables in heavy-ion collisions constrains their applicability as probes of the medium (hydro)dynamics. In this work, we provide an analytic picture for the medium back-reaction's effect on the energy flux and two point energy correlator. We show that the medium response leads to the emergence of an universal classical scaling law, competing with the perturbative QCD contribution at large angles. Comparing the associated correlator to recent experimental measurements, we find that the observed large angle features can be qualitatively described by a purely hydrodynamically driven response and its interplay with the hard jet component.</description>

      <title>Direct Deflection of Millicharged Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Millicharged particles are generic in theories of dark sectors. A cosmic or local abundance of them may be produced by the early universe, stellar environments, or the decay or annihilation of dark matter/dark energy. Furthermore, if such particles are light, these production channels result in a background of millicharged radiation. We show that light-shining-through-wall experiments employing superconducting RF cavities can also be used as ``direct deflection" experiments to search for this relativistic background. The millicharged plasma is first subjected to an oscillating electromagnetic field of a driven cavity, which causes charge separation in the form of charge and current perturbations. In turn, these perturbations can propagate outwards and resonantly excite electromagnetic fields in a well-shielded cavity placed nearby, enabling detection. We estimate that future versions of the existing Dark SRF experiment can probe orders of magnitude of currently unexplored parameter space, including millicharges produced from the Sun, the cosmic neutrino background, or other mechanisms that generate a thermal abundance with energy density as small as $\sim 10^{-4}$ that of the cosmic microwave background.</description>

      <title>Blue Loops, Cepheids, and Forays into Axions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The blue loop stage of intermediate mass stars has been called a "magnifying glass", where even seemingly small effects in prior stages of evolution, as well as assumptions about stellar composition, rotation, and convection, produce discernible changes. As such, blue loops, and especially the existence and properties of Cepheids, can serve as a laboratory where feebly connected Beyond Standard Model particles such as axions can be gainfully studied. We undertake a careful study of the effects of these putative particles on the blue loop, paying close attention to the evolution of the core potential and the hydrogen profile. Our simulations, performed with MESA, place bounds on the axion-photon coupling using the galactic Cepheid S Mus, with dynamically-determined mass of $6 M_\odot$, as a benchmark. The effects of varying convective overshoot on the core potential and hydrogen profile, and the ensuing changes in the axion constraints, are carefully studied. Along the way, we explore the "mirror principle" induced by the hydrogen burning shell and contrast our results with those existing in the literature. Less conservative (but more stringent) bounds on the axion-photon coupling are given for a $9 M_\odot$ model, which is the heaviest that can be simulated if overshoot is incorporated, and tentative projections are given for a $12 M_\odot$ model, which is approximately the heaviest tail of the mass distribution of galactic Cepheids determined by pulsation models using Gaia DR2. Our main message is that the reliable simulation and observation (ideally, through dynamical mass determination) of massive Cepheids constitutes an important frontier in axion searches, challenges in modeling uncertainties in the microphysics of the blue loop stage notwithstanding.</description>

      <title>Stepping Up Superradiance Constraints on Axions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light feebly-coupled bosonic particles can efficiently extract the rotational energy of rapidly spinning black holes on sub-astrophysical timescales via a phenomenon known as black hole superradiance. In the case of light axions, the feeble self-interactions of these particles can lead to a non-linear coupled evolution of many superradiant quasi-bound states, dramatically altering the rate at which the black hole is spun down. In this work, we extend the study of axion superradiance to higher order states, solving for the first time the coupled evolution of all states with $n \leq 5$ in the fully relativistic limit (with $n$ being the principle quantum number). Using a Bayesian framework, we re-derive constraints on axions using the inferred spins of solar mass black holes, demonstrating that previously adopted limit-setting procedures have underestimated current sensitivity to the axion decay constant $f_a$ by around one order of magnitude, and that the inclusion to higher order states allows one to reasonably capture the evolution of typical high-spin black holes across a much wider range of parameter space, thereby allowing constraints to be extended to more massive axions. We conclude with an extensive discussion on the systematics associated with spin inference from x-ray observations.</description>

      <title>NuSTAR bounds on radiatively decaying particles from M82</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axions and other putative feebly interacting particles (FIPs) with a mass of tens to several hundreds of keVs can be produced in stellar cores with a Lorentz boost factor $E_a/m_a\lesssim 10$. Thus, starburst galaxies such as M82 are efficient factories of slow axions. Their decay $a\rightarrow\gamma\gamma$ would produce a large flux of X-ray photons, peaking around $100$ keV and spread around the galaxy by an angle that can be relatively large. We use observations of the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) mission to show that the absence of these features can constrain $30-500$ keV axion masses into uncharted regions for axion-photon coupling of $g_{a\gamma}\sim 10^{-10}-10^{-12}\,\rm GeV^{-1}$. Our argument can be applied to other heavy FIPs and astrophysical sources that are hot enough to produce them, yet cold enough to avoid large boost factors which slow down the decay.</description>

      <title>Tribute to Henry Primakoff:Tests of Chiral Perturbation Theory via Primakoff Reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Henry Primakoff founded a field of study based on the scattering of very high energy particles (pions, kaons, {\gamma} gamma-rays) from photon targets, {\gamma}* virtual photons in the Coulomb field of an atomic nucleus. Primakoff was the first to describe how to determine the {\pi}0 lifetime by measuring the {\gamma}{\gamma}* -&gt; {\pi}0 production cross section. For the case that a high energy (190 GeV/c) pion beam is used, Primakoff scattering, viewed in the rest frame of the pion, is effectively low-energy soft scattering of ~250 MeV gamma rays from a pion at rest. Together, low-energy soft scattering and high-energy hard scattering studies play crucial complementary roles in testing the Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) framework. A short description is presented of Primakoff's scientific career and personal life. Here, we focus on a review of Primakoff Scattering studies of pion polarizability and the {\gamma}-&gt;{\pi}{\pi}{\pi} chiral anomaly at CERN COMPASS, and of the {\pi}0 lifetime at Jefferson Laboratory (Jlab). Following a brief review of Chiral Perturbation Theory (ChPT), we discuss the good agreement of the results of these studies with 2-flavor (u,d) ChPT predictions. We discuss why Primakoff studies at CERN AMBER for kaon polarizability and {\gamma}-&gt;{\pi}{\pi}{\eta} and {\gamma}-&gt;KK{\pi} chiral anomalies, and at Jlab for the {\pi}0 and {\eta} lifetimes, are important for validating the theoretical framework of 3-flavor (u,d,s) ChPT. The transition from 2-flavor to 3-flavor ChPT incorporates the strange quark, which is crucial for understanding the full dynamics of the light mesons (pions, kaons, and etas). By comparing 3-flavor ChPT predictions with data for kaons, {\pi}0 and {\eta}, it will be possible to assess how well the model captures the interplay of the additional flavor and the effects of strange quarks.</description>

      <title>Interpreting Transformers for Jet Tagging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) algorithms, particularly attention-based transformer models, have become indispensable for analyzing the vast data generated by particle physics experiments like ATLAS and CMS at the CERN LHC. Particle Transformer (ParT), a state-of-the-art model, leverages particle-level attention to improve jet-tagging tasks, which are critical for identifying particles resulting from proton collisions. This study focuses on interpreting ParT by analyzing attention heat maps and particle-pair correlations on the $\eta$-$\phi$ plane, revealing a binary attention pattern where each particle attends to at most one other particle. At the same time, we observe that ParT shows varying focus on important particles and subjets depending on decay, indicating that the model learns traditional jet substructure observables. These insights enhance our understanding of the model's internal workings and learning process, offering potential avenues for improving the efficiency of transformer architectures in future high-energy physics applications.</description>

      <title>Darkonia at Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark matter may form bound states in a dark sector with an attractive force between two dark matter particles. Searches for dark matter at colliders can differ dramatically from routine searches if bound states, dubbed darkonia, are produced and decay into visible Standard-Model particles. In this work, we use three representative models with scalar, pseudo-scalar, and vector force carriers to map out the darkonium signatures at both high-energy and low-energy colliders. Some of the bound states can be stable due to generalized parity and charge-conjugation symmetries, while others decay into light dark-force carriers, which subsequently can decay at a displaced vertex. New signatures with a mix of missing energy and multiple di-lepton or di-jet vertices reconstructing intermediate darkonium resonances are within reach at the LHC and Belle II.</description>

      <title>Extended Poincare Symmetry Dictates Massive Scattering Amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify an extended Poincare symmetry $ISO(2) \times ISO(3,1)$ for on-shell massive scattering amplitudes, transforming under the $U(2)$ Little group symmetry. Thus the one-particle state involves in both spin and transversality $t$ (related to chirality), and the spin-spinors are extended to the spin-transverality spinors. The massive spin-$s$ spinors with different transversality can be related by the $SO(5,1)$ symmetry, although the $U(2)$ Little group breaks the symmetry explicitly. The three-point massive amplitudes can be fully determined from the $T^\pm$ and $m$ generators, diagrammatically denoted as the mass insertion and chirality flip, which provide correspondence between massless ultraviolet and massive chiral-eigenstate amplitudes. Thus the massless on-shell technique can be utilized to construct higher-point tree- and loop-level massive amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of boosted and resolved multi-Higgs-boson events with symmetry-preserving attention networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The production of multiple Higgs bosons at the CERN LHC provides a direct way to measure the trilinear and quartic Higgs self-interaction strengths as well as potential access to beyond the standard model effects that can enhance production at large transverse momentum $p_{\mathrm{T}}$. The largest event fraction arises from the fully hadronic final state in which every Higgs boson decays to a bottom quark-antiquark pair ($b\bar{b}$). This introduces a combinatorial challenge known as the \emph{jet assignment problem}: assigning jets to sets representing Higgs boson candidates. Symmetry-preserving attention networks (SPA-Nets) have been been developed to address this challenge. However, the complexity of jet assignment increases when simultaneously considering both $H\rightarrow b\bar{b}$ reconstruction possibilities, i.e., two "resolved" small-radius jets each containing a shower initiated by a $b$-quark or one "boosted" large-radius jet containing a merged shower initiated by a $b\bar{b}$ pair. The latter improves the reconstruction efficiency at high $p_{\mathrm{T}}$. In this work, we introduce a generalization to the SPA-Net approach to simultaneously consider both boosted and resolved reconstruction possibilities and unambiguously interpret an event as "fully resolved'', "fully boosted", or in between. We report the performance of baseline methods, the original SPA-Net approach, and our generalized version on nonresonant $HH$ and $HHH$ production at the LHC. Considering both boosted and resolved topologies, our SPA-Net approach increases the Higgs boson reconstruction purity by 57--62\% and the efficiency by 23--38\% compared to the baseline method depending on the final state.</description>

      <title>Eogenesis via the High-scale Electroweak Symmetry Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel electron-assisted Baryogenesis scenario that does not require explicit B-L violation, which is essential for the traditional Leptogenesis mechanism. This scenario is based on the assumption of high-scale electroweak symmetry restoration, which implies that the electron Yukawa interaction, crucial for the mechanism, does not reach thermal equilibrium before the electroweak sphaleron process is quenched in the early universe. Primordial charge asymmetries for chiral electrons, which can be generated through various mechanisms such as axion inflation, the evaporation of primordial black holes, or the CP-asymmetric decays of a heavy Higgs doublet, serve as the initial condition for the amplification of the baryon asymmetry through transport equations. Right-handed electron asymmetry is almost irrelevant to the baryon asymmetry due to high-scale electroweak symmetry restoration, leading to both a non-zero baryon asymmetry and the electron asymmetry. We dub this mechanism as the Eogenesis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interaction rates of neutrinos and antineutrinos within a QED plasma determine the dynamics of their decoupling in the early universe. We show how to define the relevant double-differential production, annihilation, and scattering rates at NLO. Integrating over these rates with specific weights, other quantities from the literature can be obtained, such as energy transfer rates, or a neutrino interaction rate. We show that NLO corrections to the energy transfer rates are as small as those that enter the previously determined neutrino interaction rate, and are therefore expected to have only a small influence on the neutrino decoupling parameter, $N_{\rm eff}\,$. We also provide a tabulation and fast interpolation routine for all double-differential rates, in order to allow for their use in non-approximate kinetic equations, which may further reduce the systematic uncertainties of the Standard Model prediction for $N_{\rm eff}\,$</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the results for the four-top quark production process at the LHC at NLO accuracy in perturbative QCD for the $3\ell$ decay channel. The QCD corrections are applied in both the production and the decay stages of the four top quarks by employing the narrow-width approximation. The spin correlations are therefore preserved at NLO accuracy in QCD without any approximation. We summarize the impact of higher-order QCD effects by highlighting the sensitivity of the results on the cut applied on the invariant mass of the two hardest light jets in the process.</description>

      <title>Renormalization of effective field theories via on-shell methods: the case of axion-like particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the renormalization group equations of axion-like particle effective field theories and determine the corresponding anomalous dimensions at one loop via on-shell and unitarity-based methods. The calculation of the phase-space cut-integrals is carried out using different integration methods, among which the double-cut integration via Stokes' theorem proves to be technically simpler. A close comparison between the standard Feynman diagrammatic approach and the unitarity-based method enables us to explicitly verify the reduction of complexity in the latter case, along with a more direct and elegant way to establish a connection among anomalous dimensions of operators that are dual under the CP symmetry.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave and dark matter from Axion-Higgs string</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axions have long been considered plausible candidates for dark matter. The axion dark matter emitted from cosmic strings after the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry breaking in the early Universe was extensively simulated. In this work, we study dark matter and gravitational waves through the lattice simulation of the Axion-Higgs string. We gave the dark matter overproduction and the Big Bang nucleosynthesis bounds on the axion decay constant $f_a$ and the axion mass $m_a$ for axion-like particles, and found that the predicted gravitational wave spectra cannot be probed by the dataset of the current pulsar timing array experiments.</description>

      <title>Peccei-Quinn charges in the 3-3-1 model with $U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Peccei-Quinn (PQ) mechanism is applied within the $\mathrm{SU(3)_c \otimes SU(3)_L \otimes U(1)_X}$ model with B-L symmetry. The structures in the PQ charges
  of all fermions and scalar fields in the model are investigated by applying the invariant condition under
  the symmetry group on all Yukawa interaction terms. All defined PQ charges just depend on PQ charge of the only complex singlet scalar in the model. The mixing and mass hierachy in the scalar sector of the model are studied in detail. As the result, the physical state of axion is a linear combination
  of all imaginary parts of scalar multiplets as general form. Explicit expressions for axion and light Standard Model like Higgs boson are shown. Mass of the axion and its coupling to photon are derived.</description>

      <title>High-energy cLFV at $\mu$TRISTAN: HNL extensions of the Standard Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the context of heavy neutral lepton (HNL) extensions of the Standard Model, we compute the cross-sections for $\mu^+ e^-\to \ell_\alpha^+\ell_\beta^-$ scattering, as well as several angular observables. In particular, we investigate the future sensitivity of a $\mu$TRISTAN collider in discovering such charged lepton flavour violating processes and the potential constraining power of these searches on the parameter space of HNL models. Our results show that while low-energy probes of $\mu-e$ flavour violation do offer the most promising potential, the prospects for $e\tau$ and $\mu\tau$ flavour violation searches at $\mu$TRISTAN can exceed those of related low-energy probes (as well as flavour violating $Z$-pole processes at FCC-ee) by several orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Unitarity bounds with subthreshold and anomalous cuts for $b$-hadron decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a generalisation of the Boyd-Grinstein-Lebed (BGL) parametrization. Most form factors (FFs) in $b$-hadron decays exhibit additional branch cuts -- namely subthreshold and anomalous branch cuts -- beyond the ``standard'' unitarity cut. These additional cuts cannot be adequately accounted for by the BGL parametrization. For instance, these cuts arise in the FFs for $B\to D^{(*)}$, $B\to K^{(*)}$, and $\Lambda_b\to \Lambda$ processes, which are particularly relevant from a phenomenological standpoint. We demonstrate how to parametrize such FFs and derive unitarity bounds in the presence of subthreshold and/or anomalous branch cuts. Our work paves the way for a wide range of new FF analyses based solely on first principles, thereby minimising systematic uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping the Chiral-Gravitational Anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze causality and unitarity constraints in graviton scattering amplitudes, aiming to establish new bounds on theories with $U(1)$-gravitational anomalies, such as axion models or strongly-coupled gauge theories. For this purpose, we show the necessity of coupling these theories to gravity. We obtain a universal scale $\Lambda_{\rm caus}$ at which states with $J\geq 4$ must appear in the theory. We show that this scale can lie below the quantum gravity scale. For axion models, we get $\Lambda_{\rm caus}\sim\sqrt{M_P f_a}$ where $f_a$ is the axion decay constant. In strongly-coupled gauge theories in the large-$N_c$ limit, the presence of glueballs allows to evade these bounds, provided the number of fermions $N_F\ll N_c$ and the 'tHooft coupling is not large. Nevertheless, for models that have a holographic 5D dual (large 'tHooft coupling), $\Lambda_{\rm caus}$ emerges as a new cutoff scale, unless certain conditions on the parameters of the 5D models are satisfied.</description>

      <title>Searches for exotic spin-dependent interactions with spin sensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerous theories have postulated the existence of exotic spin-dependent interactions beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. Spin-based quantum sensors, which utilize the quantum properties of spins to enhance measurement precision, emerge as powerful tools for probing these exotic interactions. These sensors encompass a wide range of technologies, such as optically pumped magnetometers, atomic comagnetometers, spin masers, nuclear magnetic resonance, spin amplifiers, and nitrogen-vacancy centers. These technologies stand out for their ultrahigh sensitivity, compact tabletop design, and cost-effectiveness, offering complementary approaches to the large-scale particle colliders and astrophysical observations. This article reviews the underlying physical principles of various spin sensors and highlights the recent theoretical and experimental progress in the searches for exotic spin-dependent interactions with these quantum sensors. Investigations covered include the exotic interactions of spins with ultralight dark matter, exotic spin-dependent forces, electric dipole moment, spin-gravity interactions, and among others. Ongoing and forthcoming experiments using advanced spin-based sensors to investigate exotic spin-dependent interactions are discussed.</description>

      <title>Quantum Rods and Clock in a Gravitational Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Local operators are the basic observables in quantum field theory which encode the physics observed by a local experimentalist. However, when gravity is dynamical, diffeomorphism symmetries are gauged which apparently obstructs a sensible definition of local operators, as different locations in spacetime are connected by these gauged symmetries. This consideration brings in the puzzle of reconciling our empirical world with quantum gravity. Intuitively, this puzzle can be avoided using relatively defined observables when there exists a natural reference system such as a distribution of galaxies in our universe. Nevertheless, this intuition is classical as the rods and clock defined in this way may also have quantum fluctuations so it is not a priori clear if it can be realized in the quantum regime. In this letter, we provide an affirmative answer to this question. Interestingly, we notice that the quantum fluctuations of the reference system are in fact essential for the realization of the above intuition in the quantum regime.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Anti-de Sitter Wormholes as seeds for Higgs Inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how certain types of magnetic asymptotically Anti-de Sitter Euclidean wormholes can catalyze the onset of inflation. These wormholes can be embedded as saddle point solutions of General Relativity coupled to the Standard Model, the inflaton being identified with the Higgs particle. Our scenario is based on the assumption that the quantum effective potential for the Higgs turns negative at a certain high energy window, in line with current measured values for the Higgs and Top quark masses. Within our proposal, we can estimate various parameters and physical quantities of interest, in consistency with current observational bounds.</description>

      <title>Evidence of a CP broken deconfined phase in 4D SU(2) Yang-Mills theory at $\theta =\pi$ from imaginary $\theta$ simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spontaneous breaking of CP symmetry in 4D SU($N$) pure Yang-Mills theory at $\theta=\pi$ has recently attracted much attention in the context of the higher-form symmetry and the 't Hooft anomaly matching condition. Here we use Monte Carlo simulations to study the $N=2$ case, which is interesting since it is the case opposite to the large-$N$ limit, where explicit calculations are available. In order to circumvent the severe sign problem due to the $\theta$ term for real $\theta$, we first obtain results at imaginary $\theta$, where the sign problem is absent, and make an analytic continuation to real $\theta$. We use the stout smearing in defining the $\theta$ term in the action to be used in our simulations. Thus we obtain the expectation value of the topological charge and the deconfining temperature at $\theta=\pi$, and provide an evidence that the CP symmetry, which is spontaneously broken at low temperature, gets restored \emph{strictly above} the deconfining temperature. This conclusion is consistent with the anomaly matching condition and yet differs from the prediction in the large-$N$ limit.</description>

      <title>A simple model to investigate jet quenching and correlated errors for centrality-dependent nuclear-modification factors in relativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply Bayesian techniques to compare a simple, empirical model for jet-quenching in heavy-ion collisions to centrality-dependent jet-$R_{AA}$ measured by ATLAS for Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.02$~TeV. We find that the $R_{AA}$ values for central collisions are adequately described with a model for the mean $p_T$-dependent jet energy-loss using only 2-parameters. This model is extended by incorporating 2D initial geometry information from TRENTO and compared to centrality-dependent $R_{AA}$ values. We find that the results are sensitive to value of the jet-quenching formation time, $\tau_f$, and that the optimal value of $\tau_f$ varies with the assumed path-length dependence of the energy-loss. We construct a covariance error matrix for the data from the $p_T$ dependent contributions to the ATLAS systematic errors and perform Bayesian calibrations for several different assumptions for the systematic error correlations. We show that most-probable functions and $\chi^2$ values are sensitive to assumptions made when fitting to correlated errors.</description>

Abstract: Quantum entanglement, a fundamental feature of quantum mechanics, has become a powerful tool impacting various areas of physics. In this proceeding, we investigate the presence of quantum entanglement within the Higgs to ZZ* (HZZ*) interaction at the ATLAS experiment. Utilizing quantum tomography techniques, we extract the complete spin density matrix characterizing the HZZ* interaction from ATLAS Standard Monte Carlo (MC) HZZ* 4l Run2 samples. We then evaluate the presence of quantum entanglement in the system using the derived spin density matrix. Our investigation sheds light on the entanglement properties within the HZZ* interaction, which offers valuable insights into its quantum characteristics.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Lagrangian Formulation for Quantum and Classical Gravity at High Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a systematic Lagrangian approach for quantum gravity in the super-Planckian limit where $s\gg M_{pl}^2\gg t$. The action can be used to calculate to arbitrary accuracy in the quantum and classical expansion parameters $\alpha_Q= \frac{t}{M_{pl}^2}$ and $\alpha_C= \frac{st}{M_{pl}^4}$, respectively, for the scattering of massless particles. The perturbative series contains powers of $\log(s/t)$ which can be resummed using a rapidity renormalization group equation (RRGE) that follows from a factorization theorem which allows us to write the amplitude as a convolution of a soft and collinear jet functions. We prove that the soft function is composed of an infinite tower of operators which do not mix under rapidity renormalization. The running of the leading order (in $G$) operator leads to the graviton Regge trajectory while the next to leading operator running corresponds to the gravitational BFKL equation. For the former, we find agreement with one of the two results previously presented in the literature, while for the ladder our result agrees (up to regulator dependent pieces) with those of Lipatov. We find that the convolutive piece of the gravitational BFKL kernel is the square of that of QCD. The power counting simplifies considerably in the classical limit where we can use our formalism to extract logs at any order in the PM expansion. The leading log at any order in the PM expansion can be calculated without going beyond one loop. The log at $(2N+1)$ order in the Post-Minkowskian expansion follows from calculating the one loop anomalous dimension for the $N+1$th order piece of the soft function and perturbatively solving the RRGE $N-1$ times. The factorization theorem implies that the classical logs which arise alternate between being real and imaginary in nature as $N$ increases.</description>

      <title>Block Lanczos for lattice QCD spectroscopy and matrix elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work introduced a new framework for analyzing correlation functions with improved convergence and signal-to-noise properties, as well as rigorous quantification of excited-state effects, based on the Lanczos algorithm and spurious eigenvalue filtering with the Cullum-Willoughby test. Here, we extend this framework to the analysis of correlation-function matrices built from multiple interpolating operators in lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) by constructing an oblique generalization of the block Lanczos algorithm, as well as a new physically motivated reformulation of the Cullum-Willoughby test that generalizes to block Lanczos straightforwardly. The resulting block Lanczos method directly extends generalized eigenvalue problem (GEVP) methods, which can be viewed as applying a single iteration of block Lanczos. Block Lanczos provides qualitative and quantitative advantages over GEVP methods analogous to the benefits of Lanczos over the standard effective mass, including faster convergence to ground- and excited-state energies, explicitly computable two-sided error bounds, straightforward extraction of matrix elements of external currents, and asymptotically constant signal-to-noise. No fits or statistical inference are required. Proof-of-principle calculations are performed for noiseless mock-data examples as well as two-by-two proton correlation-function matrices in lattice QCD.</description>

      <title>Toward discovering the excited $\Omega$ baryons through nonleptonic weak decays of $\Omega_c$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.04458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.04458v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nonleptonic weak decay processes $\Omega_c \to \Omega\pi^+/\Omega(1P)\pi^+/\Omega(1D)\pi^+/\Omega(2S)\pi^+$ are studied using the constituent quark model. The branching fraction of $\Omega_c \to \Omega\pi^+$ is predicted to be $1.0\%$. Considering the newly observed $\Omega(2012)$ resonance as a conventional $1P$-wave $\Omega$ excite state with spin-parity $J^P=3/2^-$, the newly measured ratio $\mathcal{B}[\Omega_c\to \Omega(2012)\pi^+ \to (\Xi\bar{K})^-\pi^+ ]/\mathcal{B}[\Omega_c\to \Omega \pi^+]$ at Belle can be well understood. Besides, the production rates for the missing $1P-$wave state $\Omega (1^2P_{1/2^-})$, two spin quartet $1D-$wave states $\Omega (1^4D_{1/2^+})$ and $\Omega (1^4D_{3/2^+})$, and two $2S$-wave states $\Omega(2^2S_{1/2^+})$ and $\Omega(2^4S_{3/2^+})$ are also investigated. It is expected that these missing excited $\Omega$ baryons should have large potentials to be discovered through the nonleptonic weak decays of $\Omega_c$ in forthcoming experiments by Belle II and/or LHCb.</description>

      <title>In-medium mass shift of two-flavored heavy mesons, $B_c$, $B^*_c$, $B_s$, $B^*_s$, $D_s$ and $D^*_s$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00250v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the first time, we estimate the in-medium mass shift of the two-flavored heavy mesons $B_c, B_c^*, B_s, B_s^*, D_s$ and $D_s^*$ in symmetric nuclear matter. The estimates are made by evaluating the lowest order one-loop self-energies. The enhanced excitations of intermediate state heavy-light mesons in symmetric nuclear matter are the origin of their negative mass shift. This negative mass shift may be regarded as a signature of partial restoration of chiral symmetry in an empirical sense because the origin of the negative mass shift in the study is not directly related to the chiral symmetry mechanism. Our results show that the magnitude of the mass shift for the $B_c$ meson ($\bar{b} c$ or $b \bar{c}$) is larger than those of the $\eta_c (\bar{c} c)$ and $\eta_b (\bar{b} b)$, different from a naive expectation that it would be in between them. While, that of the $B_c^*$ shows the in between of the $J/\psi$ and $\Upsilon$. We observe that the lighter vector meson excitation in each meson self-energy gives a dominant contribution for the corresponding meson mass shift, $B_c, B_s,$ and $D_s$.</description>

      <title>Linear response theory for light dark matter-electron scattering in materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06817v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We combine the non-relativistic effective theory of dark matter (DM) - electron interactions with linear response theory to obtain a formalism that fully accounts for screening and collective excitations in DM-induced electronic transition rate calculations for general DM-electron interactions. In the same way that the response of a dielectric material to an external electric field in electrodynamics is described by the dielectric function, so in our formalism the response of a detector material to a DM perturbation is described by a set of generalised susceptibilities which can be directly related to densities and currents arising from the non-relativistic expansion of the Dirac Hamiltonian. We apply our formalism to assess the sensitivity of non-spin-polarised detectors, and find that in-medium effects significantly affect the experimental sensitivity if DM couples to the detector's electron density, while being decoupled from other densities and currents. Our formalism can be straightforwardly extended to the case of spin-polarised materials.</description>

      <title>Collective excitations and low-energy ionization signatures of relativistic particles in silicon detectors</title>

Abstract: Solid-state detectors with a low energy threshold have several applications, including searches of non-relativistic halo dark-matter particles with sub-GeV masses. When searching for relativistic, beyond-the-Standard-Model particles with enhanced cross sections for small energy transfers, a small detector with a low energy threshold may have better sensitivity than a larger detector with a higher energy threshold. In this paper, we calculate the low-energy ionization spectrum from high-velocity particles scattering in a dielectric material. We consider the full material response including the excitation of bulk plasmons. We generalize the energy-loss function to relativistic kinematics, and benchmark existing tools used for halo dark-matter scattering against electron energy-loss spectroscopy data. Compared to calculations commonly used in the literature, such as the Photo-Absorption-Ionization model or the free-electron model, including collective effects shifts the recoil ionization spectrum towards higher energies, typically peaking around 4--6 electron-hole pairs. We apply our results to the three benchmark examples: millicharged particles produced in a beam, neutrinos with a magnetic dipole moment produced in a reactor, and upscattered dark-matter particles. Our results show that the proper inclusion of collective effects typically enhances a detector's sensitivity to these particles, since detector backgrounds, such as dark counts, peak at lower energies.</description>

      <title>Rewording Theoretical Predictions at Colliders with Vacuum Amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose multiloop vacuum amplitudes as the optimal building blocks for efficiently assembling theoretical predictions at high-energy colliders. This hypothesis is strongly supported by the manifestly causal properties of the loop-tree duality (LTD) representation of a vacuum amplitude. The vacuum amplitude, acting as a kernel, encodes all the final states contributing to a given scattering or decay process through residues in the on-shell energies of the internal propagators. It also naturally implements gauge invariance and the wave function renormalisation of the external legs. This methodological approach, dubbed LTD causal unitary, leads to a novel representation of differential cross sections and decay rates that is locally free of ultraviolet and infrared singularities at all orders in perturbation theory. Threshold singularities also match between different phase-space residues. Most notably, it allows us to conjecture for the first time the local functional form of initial-state collinear singularities. The fulfillment of all these properties provides a theoretical description of differential observables at colliders that is well defined in the four physical dimensions of the space-time.</description>

      <title>The $H\rightarrow Z\gamma$ decay and $CP$ violation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study examines the impact of $CP$-violation on the signal strength $\mu^{Z\gamma}$, which was reported as $2.2\pm 0.7$ by the LHC. We obtain constraints on the real and absorptive parts of the $CP$-violating form factor $h_3^{Z\gamma}$ and find that they are less than 1.15 GeV. Additionally, we revisit the leading order Standard Model contributions to the $H\rightarrow Z\gamma$ decay and calculate contributions to $h_3^{Z\gamma}$ from FCNC complex couplings mediated by the $Z$ and $H$ bosons. By using the current bounds on such couplings, we find that the FCNC contribution to $h_3^{Z\gamma}$ with top and charm quarks in the loop is of order $10^{-5}$ GeV. While in a model with new quarks that preserves the SM predictions on Higgs decays, the $CP$-violating form factor $h_3^{Z\gamma}$ can be of order $10^{-1}$ GeV and could explain the excess on the signal strength $\mu^{Z\gamma}$.</description>

      <title>Cutting the Scotogenic loop: Adding flavor to Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00188v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a framework for hybrid neutrino mass generation, wherein scotogenic dark sector particles, including dark matter, are charged non-trivially under the $A_4$ flavor symmetry. The spontaneous breaking of the $A_4$ group to residual $\mathcal{Z}_2$ subgroup results in the ``cutting" of the radiative loop. As a consequence the neutrinos acquire mass through the hybrid ``scoto-seesaw" mass mechanism, combining aspects of both the tree-level seesaw and one-loop scotogenic mechanisms, with the residual $\mathcal{Z}_2$ subgroup ensuring the stability of the dark matter. The flavor symmetry also leads to several predictions including the normal ordering of neutrino masses and ``generalized $\mu-\tau$ reflection symmetry" in leptonic mixing. Additionally, it gives testable predictions for neutrinoless double beta decay and a lower limit on the lightest neutrino mass. Finally, $A_4 \to \mathcal{Z}_2$ breaking also leaves its imprint on the dark sector and ties it with the neutrino masses and mixing. The model allows only scalar dark matter, whose mass has a theoretical upper limit of $\lesssim$ 600 GeV, with viable parameter space satisfying all dark matter constraints, available only up to about 80 GeV. Conversely, fermionic dark matter is excluded due to constraints from the neutrino sector. Various aspects of this highly predictive framework can be tested in both current and upcoming neutrino and dark matter experiments.</description>

      <title>Explaining the possible 95 GeV excesses in the B-L symmetric SSM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01926v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the excesses observed in the diphoton and $b\bar b$ data around $95\;{\rm GeV}$ within the framework of the $B-L$ supersymmetric model (B-LSSM). Comparing with the minimal supersymmetric standard model, the B-LSSM incorporates two singlet chiral Higgs bosons which mix with the SM-like Higgs boson due to the gauge kinetic mixing effect. The richer Higgs sector indicates that designating the B-LSSM specific CP-even Higgs state as the lightest Higgs boson has great potential to explain the excesses at around $95\;{\rm GeV}$. Considering the two-loop effective potential corrections to the squared Higgs mass matrix, it is found that the signal strengthes $\mu(h_{95})_{\gamma\gamma}$, $\mu(h_{95})_{b b}$ can be described simultaneously in the experimental $1\sigma$ interval. And the B-LSSM specific parameters $\tan\beta'$, $B_\eta$, $g_{YB}$, $M_{Z'}$ affect the theoretical predictions on the light Higgs boson masses and signal strengthes $\mu(h_{95})_{\gamma\gamma}$, $\mu(h_{95})_{bb}$ significantly.</description>

Abstract: We conduct an analysis of a $U(1)_{B-L}$ extended inert doublet model and obtained the parameter space allowing strong first order phase transitions. We show that a large part of the parameter space can cause double first-order phase transitions. Whereas both of these phase transitions can generate a detectable stochastic gravitational wave background, one of them can create primordial black holes with appreciable abundance. The primordial black holes generated at the high scale transition can account for the dark matter maintaining the correct relic abundance. We also show specific benchmark cases and their consequences from the aspect of primordial black holes and gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>The plan for a super $\eta$ factory at Huizhou accelerator complex</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As an approximate Goldstone boson with zero quantum number and zero standard model charge, the decay processes of long-lived $\eta$ meson offer a unique opportunity to explore new physics beyond the standard model and new sources of CP violation, as well as test the low-energy QCD theory and measure the fundamental parameters of light quarks. To pursue these goals in the physics frontiers, we propose a plan to construct a super $\eta$ factory at HIAF high-energy terminal or at CiADS after its energy upgrade. The high-intensity proton beam at HIAF enables the production of a vast number of $\eta$ samples, exceeding $10^{13}$ events per year in the first stage, utilizing multiple layers of thin targets made of light nucleus. This paper presents the physics goals, the first-version conceptual design of the spectrometer, and some preliminary simulation results.</description>

Abstract: The decay behavior of an exotic state can be used to probe its internal structure. We note that the hidden-charm pentaquark states, $P_{\psi}^{N}(4312)$, $P_{\psi}^{N}(4440)$, and $P_{\psi}^{N}(4457)$, have only been observed in the $J/\psi p$ channel. In this work, we employ the effective Lagrangian approach to systematically investigate the two-body and three-body decays of the heavy quark spin symmetry multiplet of hadronic molecules $\bar{D}^{(*)}\Sigma_c^{(*)}$. Our results show that the partial decay widths of the hidden-charm pentaquark molecules into $\bar{D}^{(*)}\Lambda_c \pi$ are sizable so that $\bar{D}^{(*)}\Lambda_c \pi$ are promising channels to search for them, which can help clarify their molecular nature.</description>

      <title>Twist corrections to exclusive vector meson production in a saturation framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a framework combining the higher-twist formalism of exclusive processes in the $s$ channel with the semi-classical effective description of small-$x$ physics in the $t$ channel. We apply it to transversely polarized light vector meson production, $\gamma^{*} p \rightarrow V (\rho, \varphi ,\omega) \; p$, which starts at the next-to-leading power and for which a purely collinear treatment leads to end-point singularities. The result is obtained in the most general kinematics, including both forward and non-forward cases by preserving the full impact parameter dependence in the non-perturbative correlators, in both momentum and coordinate space representations. A systematic expansion of the Wilson lines in terms of Reggeized gluon fields is performed in order to obtain the results in the weak-field BFKL approximation. These new results will allow for investigating the dilute-to-dense regime transition of QCD for a wide class of observables.</description>

Abstract: Exclusive diffractive meson production represents a golden channel for investigating gluonic saturation inside nucleons and nuclei. In this letter, we settle a systematic framework to deal with beyond leading power corrections at small-$x$, including the saturation regime, and obtain the $\gamma^{*} \rightarrow M (\rho, \phi, \omega)$ impact factor with both incoming photon and outgoing meson carrying arbitrary polarizations. This is of particular interest since the saturation scale at modern colliders, although entering a perturbative regime, is not large enough to prevents higher-twist effects to be sizable.</description>

Abstract: The BESIII observation of the $X(2600)$ suggests that one possible assignment for its spin-parity quantum numbers is $J^{PC}=2^{-+}$. This finding motivates us to systematically revisit isoscalar pseudotensor mesonic states through a comprehensive spectroscopic study. In this work, we employ a potential model to calculate the mass spectrum of isoscalar pseudotensor meson states with varying radial quantum numbers. Additionally, we analyze their strong decay behaviors, as allowed by the Okubo-Zweig-Iizuka (OZI) rule, using the quark pair creation model. Our findings yield valuable information about their resonant parameters and partial decay widths, which can aid in identifying the observed isoscalar pseudotensor states when combined with current experimental data. Importantly, we also predict several radial excitations of isoscalar pseudotensor mesons that remain unobserved experimentally. Furthermore, we exclude the $X(2600)$ from being classified as an isoscalar pseudotensor meson, which is critical for elucidating the properties of the $X(2600)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16281v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In view of the recent discovery of $T_{cc}$, which can be described as a $DD^*$ molecular state, we perform a study of the $KDD^*$ system, and its extension to studying $KD^*D^*$, where $D^*D^*$ is bound as a spin 1 $T_{cc}$-like state, to search for the possible existence of exotic mesons with the open flavors $ccs$ being part of their quark configuration. Considering the additional attractive interactions present in the $KD$ and $KD^*$ subsystems, where the states $D^*_{s0}(2317)$ and $D_{s1}(2460)$ are generated, we solve the Faddeev equations considering the fixed-center approximation for the mentioned three-body systems and find the existence of two doubly charmed $K^*$-like mesons, $K_{cc}^*(4309)$ and $K_{cc}^*(4449)$, with quantum numbers $I(J^P)=1/2\,(1^-)$. Considering the respective three-body thresholds of the two systems, both $K_{cc}$-states are bound by around $60$ MeV. An experimental confirmation will bring evidence for the existence of a degree of exoticity beyond charm +2.</description>

      <title>Almost general analysis of CKM and MNS matrices for hierarchical Yukawa structure and interpretation of Dirac CP phase probed by DUNE and T2HK</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08686v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this letter, we perform an almost general analysis of flavor-mixing matrices $V_{\rm CKM}$ and $U_{\rm MNS}$ to investigate the discriminative power of CP phases by next-generation neutrino oscillation experiments. As an approximation, we neglect the 1-3 mixing of diagonalization for more hierarchical fermions $u,e$. Thus there are two sources of CP violation in $V_{\rm CKM}$ and $U_{\rm MNS}$, the intrinsic CP phase $\delta_{d, \nu}$ in diagonalization of less hierarchical fermions $d, \nu$ and relative phases between two unitary matrices. By eliminating unphysical phases and imposing constraints of the three measured mixing angles, the flavor-mixing matrices are analytically displayed by two phases and the 1-2 mixing $s_{u, e}$ of more hierarchical fermions. For sufficiently small 1-2 mixing $s_{e}$ of charged leptons, the Dirac phase $\delta$ is mostly identical to the intrinsic phase of neutrinos $\delta_{\nu}$. Therefore, future detection of the Dirac phase indicates the observation of $\delta_{\nu}$. On the other hand, if such a CP violation is not observed, an upper limit is placed on a combination of $\delta_{\nu}$ and relative phases.</description>

      <title>Probing Type-I 2HDM light Higgs in the top-pair-associated diphoton channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the Type-I Two-Higgs-Doublet Model (2HDM-I) as a potential explanation for the 95 GeV diphoton excess reported at the LHC and evaluate the feasibility of discovering a 95 GeV Higgs boson at future hadron colliders. By analyzing the dependence of Higgs boson couplings and decay branching ratios on model parameters, we identify regions of parameter space that are consistent with current theoretical and experimental constraints. Our analysis indicates that direct Higgs search data place stringent constraints on the Higgs-mixing angle parameter $\alpha$, excluding samples within the range $-0.9 \lesssim \alpha \lesssim 1.3$. Subsequent collider simulations focus on the $pp \to t(\to W^+b)\bar{t}(\to W^-\bar{b})h(\to \gamma\gamma)$ process and its relevant backgrounds. These simulations reveal that at the 14 TeV High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC), statistical significances of $2\sigma$ and $5\sigma$ can be achieved at integrated luminosities of 137 fb$^{-1}$ and 859 fb$^{-1}$, respectively. Comparable statistical significance can be achieved more efficiently at the 27 TeV High-Energy LHC (HE-LHC) with integrated luminosities of $L=69 \text{fb}^{-1}$ and $L=430\ \text{fb}^{-1}$, and at the 100 TeV Future Circular Collider (FCC-hh) with $L=6.8\ \text{fb}^{-1}$ and $L=42\ \text{fb}^{-1}$. However, achieving comprehensive coverage of the parameters with $\alpha + \beta\approx 0$ at the $2\sigma$ level via the diphoton channel remains challenging, even with higher collision energies or increased integrated luminosities.</description>

      <title>Pi in the Sky: Neutron Stars with Exceptionally Light QCD Axions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of axion condensed neutron stars that arise in models of an exceptionally light axion that couples to quantum chromodynamics (QCD). These axions solve the strong-charge-parity (CP) problem, but have a mass-squared lighter than that due to QCD by a factor of $\varepsilon&lt;1$. Inside dense matter, the axion potential is altered, and much of the matter in neutron stars resides in the axion condensed phase where the strong-CP parameter $\theta =\pi$ and CP remains a good symmetry. In these regions, masses and interactions of nuclei are modified, in turn changing the equation of state (EOS), structure and phenomenology of the neutron stars. We take first steps toward the study of the EOS of neutron star matter at $\theta =\pi$ within chiral effective field theory and use relativistic mean field theory to deduce the resulting changes to nuclear matter and the neutron star low-density EOS. We derive constraints on the exceptionally light axion parameter space based on observations of the thermal relaxation of accreting neutron stars, isolated neutron star cooling, and pulsar glitches, excluding the region up to $5 \times 10^{-7} \lesssim \varepsilon \lesssim 0.2$ for $ m_a \gtrsim 2\times 10^{-9}\,{\rm eV} $. We comment on potential changes to the neutron star mass-radius relationship, and discuss the possibility of novel, nuclear-density compact objects with $\theta =\pi$ that are stabilized not by gravity but by the axion potential.</description>

      <title>AdamMCMC: Combining Metropolis Adjusted Langevin with Momentum-based Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14027v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Uncertainty estimation is a key issue when considering the application of deep neural network methods in science and engineering. In this work, we introduce a novel algorithm that quantifies epistemic uncertainty via Monte Carlo sampling from a tempered posterior distribution. It combines the well established Metropolis Adjusted Langevin Algorithm (MALA) with momentum-based optimization using Adam and leverages a prolate proposal distribution, to efficiently draw from the posterior. We prove that the constructed chain admits the Gibbs posterior as invariant distribution and approximates this posterior in total variation distance. Furthermore, we demonstrate the efficiency of the resulting algorithm and the merit of the proposed changes on a state-of-the-art classifier from high-energy particle physics.</description>

      <title>Reexamination of antinucleon-nucleon interactions in covariant chiral effective field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01292v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent progress in developing high-precision relativistic chiral nucleon-nucleon interactions, we study the antinucleon-nucleon interaction in a hybrid approach where the real part of the potential is constructed in the leading-order covariant chiral effective field theory, and the imaginary part is described following the procedure adopted in the heavy baryon chiral effective field theory. The phase shifts and inelasticities with $J\leq 1$ are obtained and compared to those calculated in the next-to-leading order heavy baryon chiral effective field theory. For most partial waves, the descriptions of phase shifts and inelasticities in the hybrid approach are comparable to those in the next-to-leading order heavy baryon chiral effective field theory, confirming the relatively faster convergence of the relativistic approach observed in the nucleon-nucleon sector. In addition, we search for bound states/resonances near the $\bar{N}N$ threshold and find several structures that can be associated with those states recently observed by the BESIII Collaboration.</description>

      <title>Unlocking Discovery Potential for Decaying Dark Matter and Faint X-ray Sources with XRISM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Astrophysical emission lines arising from particle decays can offer unique insights into the nature of dark matter (DM). Using dedicated simulations with background and foreground modeling, we comprehensively demonstrate that the recently launched XRISM space telescope with powerful X-ray spectroscopy capabilities is particularly well-suited to probe decaying DM, such as sterile neutrinos and axion-like particles, in the mass range of few to tens of keV. We analyze and map XRISM's DM discovery potential parameter space by considering Milky Way Galactic DM halo, including establishing an optimal line-of-sight search, as well as dwarf galaxies where we identify Segue 1 as a remarkably promising target. We demonstrate that with only 100 ks exposure XRISM/Resolve instrument is capable of probing the underexplored DM parameter window around few keV and testing DM couplings with sensitivity that exceeds by two orders existing Segue 1 limits. Further, we demonstrate that XRISM/Xtend instrument sensitivity enables discovery of the nature of faint astrophysical X-ray sources, especially in Segue 1, which could shed light on star-formation history. We discuss implications for decaying DM searches with improved detector energy resolution in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Extracting Signal Electron Trajectories in the COMET Phase-I Cylindrical Drift Chamber Using Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04795v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a pioneering approach to tracking analysis within the COMET Phase-I experiment, which aims to search for the charged lepton flavor violating $\mu\to e$ conversion process in a muonic atom, at J-PARC, Japan. This paper specifically introduces the extraction of signal electron trajectories in the COMET Phase-I cylindrical drift chamber (CDC) amidst a high background hit rate, with more than $40\,\%$ occupancy of the total CDC cells, utilizing deep learning techniques of semantic segmentation. Our model achieved remarkable results, with a purity rate of $98\,\%$ and a retention rate of $90\,\%$ for CDC cells with signal hits, surpassing the design-goal performance of $90\,\%$ for both metrics. This study marks the initial application of deep learning to COMET tracking, paving the way for more advanced techniques in future research.</description>

      <title>Electroweak Primordial Magnetic Blackhole: Cosmic Production and Physical Implication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05531v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The electroweak monopole, when coupled to gravity, turns to the Reissner-Nordstrom type primordial magnetic blackhole whose mass is bounded below, with the lower bound $M_P \sqrt \alpha$. This changes the overall picture of the monopole production mechanism in the early universe drastically and has deep implications in cosmolpgy. In particular, this enhances the possibility that the electroweak monopoles turned to the primordial magnetic blackholes could become the seed of stellar objects and galaxies, and account for the dark matter of the universe. Moreover, this tells that we have a new type of primordial blackhole different from the popular primordial blackhole in cosmology, the electroweak primordial magnetic blackhole based on a totally different production mechanism. We discuss the physical implications of the electroweak primordial magnetic blackhole.</description>

      <title>On-shell approach to scalar hair in spinning binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12909v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an on-shell description of spinning binary systems in gravitational theories where compact objects display scalar hair. The framework involves matter particles of arbitrary spin which, in addition to the minimal coupling to gravitons, are conformally coupled to a massless scalar mediating non-standard interactions. We use the unitary factorization techniques to derive the on-shell amplitudes relevant for emission of scalars and gravitons in matter scattering, paying attention to parametrize the freedom due to contact terms. Using the KMOC formalism, these amplitudes allow one to derive succinct expressions for the radiation waveforms at the leading post-Minkowskian order, together with the associated memory effects. Furthermore, we compute the power emitted via gravitational and scalar radiation in hyperbolic encounters of compact objects. After a continuation to bound orbits, these are compared with results obtained in specific scalar-tensor theories where black holes exhibit scalar hair, such as the scalar-Gauss-Bonnet or dynamical Chern-Simons theories. Finally, we identify possible deformations from the conformal coupling that can contribute to radiation observables at the same post-Newtonian order.</description>

      <title>Regulating chiral gauge theory at $\theta=0$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02024v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has recently been argued that a proposal to nonperturbatively regulate chiral gauge theories on the boundary of a five-dimensional lattice will fail due to the existence of exact $U(1)$ symmetries not present in the target theories. A related observation is that in the presence of gauge fields with nontrivial topology, fermion zeromodes will appear embedded in the extra dimension which do not decouple from the four-dimensional world. Here we show that these problems can be evaded by simulating the theory in the trivial topological sector of the boundary gauge fields. A regulated version of the Standard Model using this approach in the continuum and large volume limits is expected to appear as if it possessed a Peccei-Quinn mechanism for relaxing $\theta_\text{QCD}$ to zero, without there being an axion in the spectrum.</description>
