      <title>A Global Optimal Theory of Portfolio beyond R-$\sigma$ Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deviation of the efficient market hypothesis (EMH) for the practical economic system allows us gain the arbitrary or risk premium in finance markets. We propose the triplet $(R,H,\sigma)$ theory to give the local and global optimal portfolio, which eneralize from the $(R,\sigma)$ model. We present the formulation of the triplet $(R,H,\sigma)$ model and give the Pareto optimal solution as well as comparing it with the numerical investigations for the Chinese stock market. We define the local optimal weights of the triplet $(\mathbf{w}_{R},\mathbf{w}_{H},\mathbf{w}_{\sigma})$, which constructs the triangle of the quasi-optimal investing subspace such that we further define the centroid of the triangle or the incenter of the triangle as the optimal investing weights, which optimizes the mean return, the arbitrary or risk premium and the volatility risk. By investigating numerically the Chinese stock market as an example we demonstrate the validity of the formulation and obtain the global optimal strategy and quasi-optimal investing subspace. The theory provides an efficient way to design the portfolio for different style investors, conservative or aggressive investors, in finance market to maximize the mean return and arbitrary or risk premium with a small volatility risk.</description>

      <title>Capital allocation and tail central moments for the multivariate normal mean-variance mixture distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Capital allocation is a procedure used to assess the risk contributions of individual risk components to the total risk of a portfolio. While the conditional tail expectation (CTE)-based capital allocation is arguably the most popular capital allocation method, its inability to reflect important tail behaviour of losses necessitates a more accurate approach. In this paper, we introduce a new capital allocation method based on the tail central moments (TCM), generalising the tail covariance allocation informed by the tail variance. We develop analytical expressions of the TCM as well as the TCM-based capital allocation for the class of normal mean-variance mixture distributions, which is widely used to model asymmetric and heavy-tailed data in finance and insurance. As demonstrated by a numerical analysis, the TCM-based capital allocation captures several significant patterns in the tail region of equity losses that remain undetected by the CTE, enhancing the understanding of the tail risk contributions of risk components.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Adjusted Sorting for Asset Pricing with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning is central to empirical asset pricing, but portfolio construction still relies on point predictions and largely ignores asset-specific estimation uncertainty. We propose a simple change: sort assets using uncertainty-adjusted prediction bounds instead of point predictions alone. Across a broad set of ML models and a U.S. equity panel, this approach improves portfolio performance relative to point-prediction sorting. These gains persist even when bounds are built from partial or misspecified uncertainty information. They arise mainly from reduced volatility and are strongest for flexible machine learning models. Identification and robustness exercises show that these improvements are driven by asset-level rather than time or aggregate predictive uncertainty.</description>
