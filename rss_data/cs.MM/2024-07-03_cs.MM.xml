      <title>Volume Tracking Based Reference Mesh Extraction for Time-Varying Mesh Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-Varying meshes (TVMs), characterized by their varying connectivity and number of vertices, hold significant potential in immersive media and other various applications. However, their practical utilization is challenging due to their time-varying features and large file sizes. Creating a reference mesh that contains the most essential information is a promising approach to utilizing shared information within TVMs to reduce storage and transmission costs. We propose a novel method that employs volume tracking to extract reference meshes. First, we adopt as-rigid-as-possible (ARAP) volume tracking on TVMs to get the volume centers for each mesh. Then, we use multidimensional scaling (MDS) to get reference centers that ensure the reference mesh avoids self-contact regions. Finally, we map the vertices of the meshes to reference centers and extract the reference mesh. Our approach offers a feasible solution for extracting reference meshes that can serve multiple purposes such as establishing surface correspondence, deforming the reference mesh to different shapes for I-frame based mesh compression, or defining the global shape of the TVMs.</description>

      <title>To Forget or Not? Towards Practical Knowledge Unlearning for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on extensive corpora inevitably retain sensitive data, such as personal privacy information and copyrighted material. Recent advancements in knowledge unlearning involve updating LLM parameters to erase specific knowledge. However, current unlearning paradigms are mired in vague forgetting boundaries, often erasing knowledge indiscriminately. In this work, we introduce KnowUnDo, a benchmark containing copyrighted content and user privacy domains to evaluate if the unlearning process inadvertently erases essential knowledge. Our findings indicate that existing unlearning methods often suffer from excessive unlearning. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective method, MemFlex, which utilizes gradient information to precisely target and unlearn sensitive parameters. Experimental results show that MemFlex is superior to existing methods in both precise knowledge unlearning and general knowledge retaining of LLMs. Code and dataset will be released at https://github.com/zjunlp/KnowUnDo.</description>

      <title>A Bounding Box is Worth One Token: Interleaving Layout and Text in a Large Language Model for Document Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, many studies have demonstrated that exclusively incorporating OCR-derived text and spatial layouts with large language models (LLMs) can be highly effective for document understanding tasks. However, existing methods that integrate spatial layouts with text have limitations, such as producing overly long text sequences or failing to fully leverage the autoregressive traits of LLMs. In this work, we introduce Interleaving Layout and Text in a Large Language Model (LayTextLLM)} for document understanding. In particular, LayTextLLM projects each bounding box to a single embedding and interleaves it with text, efficiently avoiding long sequence issues while leveraging autoregressive traits of LLMs. LayTextLLM not only streamlines the interaction of layout and textual data but also shows enhanced performance in Key Information Extraction (KIE) and Visual Question Answering (VQA). Comprehensive benchmark evaluations reveal significant improvements, with a 27.0% increase on KIE tasks and 24.1% on VQA tasks compared to previous state-of-the-art document understanding MLLMs, as well as a 15.5% improvement over other SOTA OCR-based LLMs on KIE tasks.</description>

      <title>ScaleDreamer: Scalable Text-to-3D Synthesis with Asynchronous Score Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By leveraging the text-to-image diffusion priors, score distillation can synthesize 3D contents without paired text-3D training data. Instead of spending hours of online optimization per text prompt, recent studies have been focused on learning a text-to-3D generative network for amortizing multiple text-3D relations, which can synthesize 3D contents in seconds. However, existing score distillation methods are hard to scale up to a large amount of text prompts due to the difficulties in aligning pretrained diffusion prior with the distribution of rendered images from various text prompts. Current state-of-the-arts such as Variational Score Distillation finetune the pretrained diffusion model to minimize the noise prediction error so as to align the distributions, which are however unstable to train and will impair the model's comprehension capability to numerous text prompts. Based on the observation that the diffusion models tend to have lower noise prediction errors at earlier timesteps, we propose Asynchronous Score Distillation (ASD), which minimizes the noise prediction error by shifting the diffusion timestep to earlier ones. ASD is stable to train and can scale up to 100k prompts. It reduces the noise prediction error without changing the weights of pre-trained diffusion model, thus keeping its strong comprehension capability to prompts. We conduct extensive experiments across different 2D diffusion models, including Stable Diffusion and MVDream, and text-to-3D generators, including Hyper-iNGP, 3DConv-Net and Triplane-Transformer. The results demonstrate ASD's effectiveness in stable 3D generator training, high-quality 3D content synthesis, and its superior prompt-consistency, especially under large prompt corpus.</description>

      <title>Joint-Dataset Learning and Cross-Consistent Regularization for Text-to-Motion Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pose-estimation methods enable extracting human motion from common videos in the structured form of 3D skeleton sequences. Despite great application opportunities, effective content-based access to such spatio-temporal motion data is a challenging problem. In this paper, we focus on the recently introduced text-motion retrieval tasks, which aim to search for database motions that are the most relevant to a specified natural-language textual description (text-to-motion) and vice-versa (motion-to-text). Despite recent efforts to explore these promising avenues, a primary challenge remains the insufficient data available to train robust text-motion models effectively. To address this issue, we propose to investigate joint-dataset learning - where we train on multiple text-motion datasets simultaneously - together with the introduction of a Cross-Consistent Contrastive Loss function (CCCL), which regularizes the learned text-motion common space by imposing uni-modal constraints that augment the representation ability of the trained network. To learn a proper motion representation, we also introduce a transformer-based motion encoder, called MoT++, which employs spatio-temporal attention to process sequences of skeleton data. We demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approaches on the widely-used KIT Motion-Language and HumanML3D datasets. We perform detailed experimentation on joint-dataset learning and cross-dataset scenarios, showing the effectiveness of each introduced module in a carefully conducted ablation study and, in turn, pointing out the limitations of state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>SafaRi:Adaptive Sequence Transformer for Weakly Supervised Referring Expression Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Referring Expression Segmentation (RES) aims to provide a segmentation mask of the target object in an image referred to by the text (i.e., referring expression). Existing methods require large-scale mask annotations. Moreover, such approaches do not generalize well to unseen/zero-shot scenarios. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a weakly-supervised bootstrapping architecture for RES with several new algorithmic innovations. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first approach that considers only a fraction of both mask and box annotations (shown in Figure 1 and Table 1) for training. To enable principled training of models in such low-annotation settings, improve image-text region-level alignment, and further enhance spatial localization of the target object in the image, we propose Cross-modal Fusion with Attention Consistency module. For automatic pseudo-labeling of unlabeled samples, we introduce a novel Mask Validity Filtering routine based on a spatially aware zero-shot proposal scoring approach. Extensive experiments show that with just 30% annotations, our model SafaRi achieves 59.31 and 48.26 mIoUs as compared to 58.93 and 48.19 mIoUs obtained by the fully-supervised SOTA method SeqTR respectively on RefCOCO+@testA and RefCOCO+testB datasets. SafaRi also outperforms SeqTR by 11.7% (on RefCOCO+testA) and 19.6% (on RefCOCO+testB) in a fully-supervised setting and demonstrates strong generalization capabilities in unseen/zero-shot tasks.</description>

      <title>Video Watermarking: Safeguarding Your Video from (Unauthorized) Annotations by Video-based LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02411v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of video-based Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly enhanced video understanding. However, it has also raised some safety concerns regarding data protection, as videos can be more easily annotated, even without authorization. This paper introduces Video Watermarking, a novel technique to protect videos from unauthorized annotations by such video-based LLMs, especially concerning the video content and description, in response to specific queries. By imperceptibly embedding watermarks into key video frames with multi-modal flow-based losses, our method preserves the viewing experience while preventing misuse by video-based LLMs. Extensive experiments show that Video Watermarking significantly reduces the comprehensibility of videos with various video-based LLMs, demonstrating both stealth and robustness. In essence, our method provides a solution for securing video content, ensuring its integrity and confidentiality in the face of evolving video-based LLMs technologies.</description>

      <title>SlideAVSR: A Dataset of Paper Explanation Videos for Audio-Visual Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09759v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) is a multimodal extension of automatic speech recognition (ASR), using video as a complement to audio. In AVSR, considerable efforts have been directed at datasets for facial features such as lip-readings, while they often fall short in evaluating the image comprehension capabilities in broader contexts. In this paper, we construct SlideAVSR, an AVSR dataset using scientific paper explanation videos. SlideAVSR provides a new benchmark where models transcribe speech utterances with texts on the slides on the presentation recordings. As technical terminologies that are frequent in paper explanations are notoriously challenging to transcribe without reference texts, our SlideAVSR dataset spotlights a new aspect of AVSR problems. As a simple yet effective baseline, we propose DocWhisper, an AVSR model that can refer to textual information from slides, and confirm its effectiveness on SlideAVSR.</description>

      <title>Band-Attention Modulated RetNet for Face Forgery Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06022v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transformer networks are extensively utilized in face forgery detection due to their scalability across large datasets.Despite their success, transformers face challenges in balancing the capture of global context, which is crucial for unveiling forgery clues, with computational complexity.To mitigate this issue, we introduce Band-Attention modulated RetNet (BAR-Net), a lightweight network designed to efficiently process extensive visual contexts while avoiding catastrophic forgetting.Our approach empowers the target token to perceive global information by assigning differential attention levels to tokens at varying distances. We implement self-attention along both spatial axes, thereby maintaining spatial priors and easing the computational burden.Moreover, we present the adaptive frequency Band-Attention Modulation mechanism, which treats the entire Discrete Cosine Transform spectrogram as a series of frequency bands with learnable weights.Together, BAR-Net achieves favorable performance on several face forgery datasets, outperforming current state-of-the-art methods.</description>
