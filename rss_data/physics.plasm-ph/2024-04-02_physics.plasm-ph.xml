      <title>Attosecond gamma-ray flashes and electron-positron pairs in dyadic laser interaction with micro-wire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beams of photons and charged particles of high energy and high brightness find application across a range of disciplines in both fundamental and applied sciences. The interaction of an ultra-intense laser with matter has been shown to be an efficient source of high-energy particles, but typical schemes generate spatially broad distributions with high-divergence and low-brightness. In this paper we report on emission of highly collimated, ultrabright, attosecond $\gamma$-photons and generation of dense electron-positron pairs via a tunable particle generation scheme which utilises the interaction of two high-power lasers with metallic micro-wire target. Irradiating the target with a radially polarised laser pulse first produces a series of high charge, short duration, electron bunches with low transverse momentum. These electron bunches subsequently collide with a counter-propagating high intensity laser. Depending on the intensity of the counter-propagating laser, the scheme can be used to generate either highly collimated ultra-bright MeV-GeV $\gamma$-beams or electron-positron bunches with densities approaching the solid density level.</description>

      <title>Robustness of high-$\beta$ W7-X plasmas against ideal ballooning instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To examine the robustness of the designed 5% $\beta$-limit for high-performance operation in the W7-X stellarator, we undertake nonlinear magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of pressure-driven instabilities using the M3D-$C^1$ code. Consistent with linear analyses, ideal ballooning instabilities occur as $\beta$ exceeds 5% in the standard configuration. Nonetheless, the modes saturate nonlinearly at relatively low levels without triggering large-scale crashes, even though confinement degradation worsens as $\beta$ increases. In contrast, in an alternative configuration with nearly zero magnetic shear, ideal interchange modes induce a pressure crash at $\beta= 1\%$. These results suggest that the standard W7-X configuration might have a soft $\beta$-limit that is fairly immune to major MHD events, and that interchange instabilities tend to be more detrimental than ideal ballooning in stellarators.</description>

      <title>Covariant Guiding Center Equations for Charged Particle Motions in General Relativistic Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low density plasmas in curved spacetimes, such as those found in accretion flows around black holes, are challenging to model from first principles, owing to the large scale separation between the characteristic scales of the microscopic processes and large mean-free-paths comparable to the system sizes. Kinetic approaches become necessary to capture the relevant physics but lack the dynamic range to model the global characteristics of the systems. In this paper, we develop new covariant guiding center equations of motion for charges in general relativistic spacetimes that are computationally tractable. We decompose the particle motion into a fast gyration, which we integrate analytically and a slow drift of the guiding center, which can be solved numerically. We derive covariant conservation laws for the motions of the guiding centers and show, through a number of limiting cases, that the equations contain all known drift mechanisms. Finally, we present the general relativistic expressions for the various drift velocities in Schwarzschild spacetimes.</description>

      <title>General relativistic force-free electrodynamics with a discontinuous Galerkin-finite difference hybrid method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relativistic plasmas around compact objects can sometimes be approximated as being force-free. In this limit, the plasma inertia is negligible and the overall dynamics is governed by global electric currents. We present a novel numerical approach for simulating such force-free plasmas, which allows for high accuracy in smooth regions as well as capturing dissipation in current sheets. Using a high-order accurate discontinuous Galerkin method augmented with a conservative finite-difference method, we demonstrate efficient global simulations of black hole and neutron star magnetospheres. In addition to a series of challenging test problems, we show that our approach can-depending on the physical properties of the system and the numerical implementation-be up to 10x more efficient than conventional simulations, with a speedup of 2-3x for most problems we consider in practice.</description>

      <title>Fourier-Matsubara series expansion for imaginary-time correlation functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Fourier-Matsubara series expansion is derived for imaginary-time correlation functions that constitutes the imaginary-time generalization of the infinite Matsubara series for equal-time correlation functions. The expansion is consistent with all known exact properties of imaginary-time correlation functions and opens up new avenues for the utilization of quantum Monte Carlo simulation data. Moreover, the expansion drastically simplifies the computation of imaginary-time density-density correlation functions with the finite temperature version of the self-consistent dielectric formalism. Its existence underscores the utility of imaginary-time as a complementary domain for many-body physics.</description>

      <title>CME Deflection and East-West Asymmetry of ESP Intensity in Solar Cycles 23 and 24</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the East-West asymmetry in energetic storm particle (ESP) heavy ion intensities at interplanetary shocks driven by coronal mass ejections (CMEs) during solar cycles (SCs) 23 and 24. We use observations from NASA's ACE and STEREO missions of helium (He), oxygen (O), and iron (Fe) intensities from ~0.13 to 3 MeV/nucleon. We examine the longitudinal distribution of ESP intensities and the correlation of ESP intensities with the near-Sun CME speed and the average transit CME speed for eastern and western events. We observed an East-West asymmetry reversal of ESP heavy ion intensities from SC 23 to 24. We have determined that this change in asymmetry is caused by a shift in the heliolongitude distribution of the CME speed ratio (the ratio of CME near-Sun speed to CME average transit speed) from west to east.</description>

      <title>Extreme plasmons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanosciences largely rely on plasmons which are quasiparticles constituted by collective oscillations of quantum electron gas composed of conduction band electrons that occupy discrete quantum states. Our work has introduced non-perturbative plasmons with oscillation amplitudes that approach the extreme limit set by breakdown in characteristic coherence. In contrast, conventional plasmons are small-amplitude oscillations. Controlled excitation of extreme plasmons modeled in our work unleashes unprecedented Petavolts per meter fields. In this work, an analytical model of this new class of plasmons is developed based on quantum kinetic framework. A controllable extreme plasmon, the surface "crunch-in" plasmon, is modeled here using a modified independent electron approximation which takes into account the quantum oscillation frequency. Key characteristics of such realizable extreme plasmons that unlock unparalleled possibilities, are obtained.</description>

      <title>Investigations of atomic \&amp; molecular processes of NBI-heated discharges in the MAST Upgrade Super-X divertor with implications for reactors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08580v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This experimental study presents an in-depth investigation of the performance of the MAST-U Super-X divertor during NBI-heated operation (up to 2.5 MW) focussing on volumetric ion sources and sinks as well as power losses during detachment.
  The particle balance and power loss analysis revealed the crucial role of Molecular Activated Recombination and Dissociation (MAR and MAD) ion sinks in divertor particle and power balance, which remain pronounced in the change from ohmic to higher power (NBI heated) L-mode conditions. The importance of MAR and MAD remains with double the absorbed NBI heating. MAD results in significant power dissipation (up to $\sim 20 \%$ of $P_{SOL}$), mostly in the cold ($T_e &lt; 5$ eV) detached region. Theoretical and experimental evidence is found for the potential contribution of $D^-$ to MAR and MAD, which warrants further study.
  These results suggest that MAR and MAD can be relevant in higher power conditions than the ohmic conditions studied previously. Post-processing reactor-scale simulations shows that MAR and MAD can play a significant role in divertor physics and synthetic diagnostic signals of reactor-scale devices, which are currently underestimated in exhaust simulations. This raises implications for the accuracy of reactor-scale divertor simulations of particularly tightly baffled (alternative) divertor configurations.</description>

      <title>High-Precision Transition Energy Measurements of Neonlike Fe XVII Ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08395v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We improve by a factor of 4-20 the energy accuracy of the strongest soft X-ray transitions of Fe XVII ions by resonantly exciting them in an electron beam ion trap with a monochromatic beam at the P04 beamline of the PETRA III synchrotron facility. By simultaneously tracking instantaneous photon-energy fluctuations with a high-resolution photoelectron spectrometer, we minimize systematic uncertainties down to 10-15 meV, or velocity-equivalent +/- ~5 km/s in their rest energies, substantially improving our knowledge of this key astrophysical ion. Our large-scale configuration-interaction computations include more than four million relativistic configurations and agree with the experiment at a level without precedent for a ten-electron system. Thereby, theoretical uncertainties for interelectronic correlations become far smaller than those of quantum electrodynamics (QED) corrections. The present QED benchmark strengthens our trust in future calculations of many other complex atomic ions of interest to astrophysics, plasma physics, and for the development of optical clocks with highly charged ions.</description>

      <title>A New Mechanism For Generating Type-III Radiation From The Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05984v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Because the conventional method of creating type-III radiation by coalescence of counter-propagating Langmuir waves has not been verified with in-situ data, Parker Solar Probe data was examined in search of such in-situ evidence, which was not found. Instead, a new mechanism for creating type-III radiation has been found as a result of observing slow Langmuir waves (~2200 km/sec) with electric fields as large as 300 mV/m and associated density fluctuations during a developing type-III burst on March 21, 2023. Because of their slow phase velocities, these Langmuir waves had short wavelengths, several times the Debye length of 2.65 meters, and, as a result, k{\lambda}d~0.93. Such waves may be strongly damped to be replaced by new growing bursts of waves that create the characteristic Langmuir waveform that is composed of peaks and valleys of a few milliseconds duration. The average electron current associated with these Langmuir waves is estimated from the strahl as 8 microamps/m2. Peak currents were at least twice these averages. These Langmuir waves produced electrostatic harmonics having slow phase velocities (~2000 km/sec) at frequencies of n{\omega}p, where {\omega}p = 2pi*125 kHz is the Langmuir wave frequency and n = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. They also produced density fluctuations at the lowest harmonics. Such waves are not the type-III emission. As at least the first harmonic wave evolved through density irregularities, its wave number decreased and it became the electromagnetic wave that was the type-III radiation.</description>
