      <title>Screening articles by citation reputation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce reputable citations (RC), a method to screen and segment a collection of papers by decoupling popularity and influence. We demonstrate RC using recent works published in a large set of mathematics journals from Clarivate's Incites Essential Science Indicators, leveraging Clarivate's Web of Science for citation reports and assigning prestige values to institutions based on well-known international rankings. We compare researchers drawn from two samples: highly cited researchers (HC) and mathematicians whose influence is acknowledged by peers (Control). RC scores distinguish the influence of researchers beyond citations, revealing highly cited mathematical work of modest influence. The control group, comprising peer-acknowledged researchers, dominates the top tier of RC scores despite having fewer total citations than the HC group. Influence, as recognized by peers, does not always correlate with high citation counts, and RC scores offer a nuanced distinction between the two. With development, RC scores could automate screening of citations to identify exceptional and influential research, while addressing manipulative practices. The first application of RC reveals mathematics works that may be cited for reasons unrelated to genuine research advancements, suggesting a need for continued development of this method to mitigate such trends.</description>

      <title>Is Science Inevitable?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using large-scale citation data and a breakthrough metric, the study systematically evaluates the inevitability of scientific breakthroughs. We find that scientific breakthroughs emerge as multiple discoveries rather than singular events. Through analysis of over 40 million journal articles, we identify multiple discoveries as papers that independently displace the same reference using the Disruption Index (D-index), suggesting functional equivalence. Our findings support Merton's core argument that scientific discoveries arise from historical context rather than individual genius. The results reveal a long-tail distribution pattern of multiple discoveries across various datasets, challenging Merton's Poisson model while reinforcing the structural inevitability of scientific progress.</description>

      <title>KARMA: Leveraging Multi-Agent LLMs for Automated Knowledge Graph Enrichment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Maintaining comprehensive and up-to-date knowledge graphs (KGs) is critical for modern AI systems, but manual curation struggles to scale with the rapid growth of scientific literature. This paper presents KARMA, a novel framework employing multi-agent large language models (LLMs) to automate KG enrichment through structured analysis of unstructured text. Our approach employs nine collaborative agents, spanning entity discovery, relation extraction, schema alignment, and conflict resolution that iteratively parse documents, verify extracted knowledge, and integrate it into existing graph structures while adhering to domain-specific schema. Experiments on 1,200 PubMed articles from three different domains demonstrate the effectiveness of KARMA in knowledge graph enrichment, with the identification of up to 38,230 new entities while achieving 83.1\% LLM-verified correctness and reducing conflict edges by 18.6\% through multi-layer assessments.</description>

      <title>From Code to Canvas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The web-based dynamic geometry software CindyJS is a versatile tool to create interactive applications for mathematics and other topics. In this workshop, we will look at a code package that makes the creation of animations in CindyJS easier and more streamlined. Animations, which can then be embedded into presentations or be used in (lecture) videos. The focus lies on the creation of the animations themselves and some of the technical and artistic fundamentals to do so.</description>
