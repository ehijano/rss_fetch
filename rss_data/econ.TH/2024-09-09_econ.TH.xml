      <title>Uniform price auction with quantity constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the equilibria of uniform price auctions where bidders have flat demands up to their respective quantity constraints. We present an iterative procedure that systematically finds a Nash equilibrium outcome under semi-complete information as well as a novel ascending auction under incomplete information that has this outcome as a dominant strategy equilibrium. Demand reduction and low price equilibrium may occur since it is sometimes advantageous for a bidder to give up some of his/her demand and get the remaining demand at a low price rather than to get his/her entire demand at a higher price.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Collusion Without Threats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There has been substantial recent concern that pricing algorithms might learn to ``collude.'' Supra-competitive prices can emerge as a Nash equilibrium of repeated pricing games, in which sellers play strategies which threaten to punish their competitors who refuse to support high prices, and these strategies can be automatically learned. In fact, a standard economic intuition is that supra-competitive prices emerge from either the use of threats, or a failure of one party to optimize their payoff. Is this intuition correct? Would preventing threats in algorithmic decision-making prevent supra-competitive prices when sellers are optimizing for their own revenue? No. We show that supra-competitive prices can emerge even when both players are using algorithms which do not encode threats, and which optimize for their own revenue. We study sequential pricing games in which a first mover deploys an algorithm and then a second mover optimizes within the resulting environment. We show that if the first mover deploys any algorithm with a no-regret guarantee, and then the second mover even approximately optimizes within this now static environment, monopoly-like prices arise. The result holds for any no-regret learning algorithm deployed by the first mover and for any pricing policy of the second mover that obtains them profit at least as high as a random pricing would -- and hence the result applies even when the second mover is optimizing only within a space of non-responsive pricing distributions which are incapable of encoding threats. In fact, there exists a set of strategies, neither of which explicitly encode threats that form a Nash equilibrium of the simultaneous pricing game in algorithm space, and lead to near monopoly prices. This suggests that the definition of ``algorithmic collusion'' may need to be expanded, to include strategies without explicitly encoded threats.</description>

      <title>Optimal Auction Design with Contingent Payments and Costly Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19945v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the design of an auction for an income-generating asset such as an intellectual property license. Each bidder has a signal about his future income from acquiring the asset. After the asset is allocated, the winner's income is realized privately. The principal can audit the winner, at a cost, and then charge a payment contingent on the winner's realized income. We solve for a dynamic mechanism that maximizes revenue, net auditing costs. The winning bidder is charged linear royalties up to a cap. A higher bidder pays more in cash and faces a lower royalty cap.</description>

      <title>Random Attention and Unobserved Reference Alternatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01528v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper I develop and characterize a random attention model with unobserved reference alternatives. The decision maker pays attention to different subsets of the available set of alternatives randomly. The reference alternatives are exactly those alternatives that are always paid attention to, i.e. they are attention-privileged and these alternatives are supposed to be unknown to the outside observer. The characterization allows for a complete identification of the reference alternatives and a coarse identification of the underlying preferences. I then restrict the model by considering the independent random attention function and provide a complete identification of the underlying preferences as well.</description>
