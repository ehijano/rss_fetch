      <title>Rules, agents and order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex systems often exhibit highly structured network topologies that reflect functional constraints. In this work, we investigate how, under varying combinations of system-wide selection rules and special agents, different classes of random processes give rise to global order, with a focus restricted to finite-size networks. Using the large-$N$ Erdos-Renyi model as a null baseline, we contrast purely random link-adding processes with goal-directed dynamics, including variants of the chip-firing model and intracellular network growth, both driven by transport efficiency. Through simulations and structural probes such as $k$-core decomposition and $HITS$ centrality, we show that purely stochastic processes can spontaneously generate modest functional structures, but that significant departures from random behavior generically require two key conditions: critical topological complexity and dynamic alignment between topology and functionality. Our results suggest that the emergence of functional architectures depends not only on the presence of selection mechanisms or specialized roles, but also on the network's capacity to support differentiation and feedback. These findings provide insight into how topology-functionality relationships emerge in natural and artificial systems and offer a framework for using random graph baselines to diagnose the rise of global order in evolving finite-size networks.</description>

      <title>Cascades on Constrained Multiplex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a version of the Watts cascade model on directed multiplex configuration model networks, and present a detailed analysis of the cascade size, single-seed cascade probability and cascade condition. We then introduce a smaller class of network models that we call constrained multiplex networks, which allows us to induce patterns in the node activity, i.e. in the participation of nodes on different layers. We find that the choice of induced patterns affects the phase transitions of the cascade model in a variety of ways.</description>

      <title>Symmetry breaking in minimum dissipation networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Both natural and man-made supply networks exhibit universal structural patterns, such as the formation of loops. These patterns can be understood in terms of optimization models, assuming that biological networks evolved to optimal states and technical networks are designed to function optimally. In this article, we analyze networks that minimize dissipation under a research constraint. We demonstrate spontaneous symmetry breaking in optimal network structures as a function of resource scaling. We show that fluctuations intricately impact the structure and can lead to a reentrant transition from a symmetry-broken state to a symmetric state and back again.</description>

      <title>On the Parallels Between Evolutionary Theory and the State of AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article critically examines the foundational principles of contemporary AI methods, exploring the limitations that hinder its potential. We draw parallels between the modern AI landscape and the 20th-century Modern Synthesis in evolutionary biology, and highlight how advancements in evolutionary theory that augmented the Modern Synthesis, particularly those of Evolutionary Developmental Biology, offer insights that can inform a new design paradigm for AI. By synthesizing findings across AI and evolutionary theory, we propose a pathway to overcome existing limitations, enabling AI to achieve its aspirational goals.</description>

      <title>Finite-time scaling on low-dimensional map bifurcations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work has introduced the concept of finite-time scaling to characterize bifurcation diagrams at finite times in deterministic discrete dynamical systems, drawing an analogy with finite-size scaling used to study critical behavior in finite systems. In this work, we extend the finite-time scaling approach in several key directions. First, we present numerical results for 1D maps exhibiting period-doubling bifurcations and discontinuous transitions, analyzing selected paradigmatic examples. We then define two observables, the finite-time susceptibility and the finite-time Lyapunov exponent, that also display consistent scaling near bifurcation points. The method is further generalized to special cases of 2D maps including the 2D Chialvo map, capturing its bifurcation between a fixed point and a periodic orbit, while accounting for discontinuities and asymmetric periodic orbits. These results underscore fundamental connections between temporal and spatial observables in complex systems, suggesting new avenues for studying complex dynamical behavior.</description>

      <title>Synergistic motifs in linear Gaussian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Higher-order interdependencies are central features of complex systems, yet a mechanistic explanation for their emergence remains elusive. For linear Gaussian systems of arbitrary dimension, we derive an expression for synergy-dominance in terms of signed network motifs in the system's correlation matrix. We prove that antibalanced correlational structures ensure synergy-dominance and further show that antibalanced triads in the dyadic interaction matrix of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes are necessary for synergy-dominance. Our results demonstrate that pairwise interactions alone can give rise to synergistic information in the absence of explicit higher-order mechanisms, and highlight structural balance theory as an instrumental conceptual framework to study higher-order interdependencies.</description>

      <title>Antifragility and response to damage in the synchronization of oscillators on networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15148v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a mathematical framework to assess the impact of damage, defined as the reduction of weight in a specific link, on identical oscillator systems governed by the Kuramoto model and coupled through weighted networks. We analyze how weight modifications in a single link affect the system when its global function is to achieve the synchronization of coupled oscillators starting from random initial phases. We introduce different measures that allow the identification of cases where damage enhances synchronization (antifragile response), deteriorates it (fragile response), or has no significant impact. Using numerical solutions of the Kuramoto model, we investigate the effects of damage on network links where antifragility emerges. Our analysis includes lollipop graphs of varying sizes and a comprehensive evaluation and all the edges of 109 non-isomorphic graphs with six nodes. The approach is general and can be applied to study antifragility in other oscillator systems with different coupling mechanisms, offering a pathway for the quantitative exploration of antifragility in diverse complex systems.</description>
