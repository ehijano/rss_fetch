      <title>Undulatory swimming in suspensions and networks of flexible filaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many biological fluids are composed of suspended polymers immersed in a viscous fluid. A prime example is mucus, where the polymers are also known to form a network. While the presence of this microstructure is linked with an overall non-Newtonian response of the fluid, swimming cells and microorganisms similar in size to the network pores and polymer filaments instead experience the heterogeneous nature of the environment, interacting directly with the polymers as obstacles as they swim. To characterise and understand locomotion in these heterogeneous environments, we simulate the motion of an undulatory swimmer through suspensions and networks of elastic filaments, exploring the effects of filament and link compliance and filament concentration up to 20\% volume fraction. For compliant environments, the swimming speed increases with filament concentration to values about 10\% higher than in a viscous fluid. In stiffer environments, a non-monotonic dependence is observed, with an initial increase in speed to values 5\% greater than in a viscous fluid, followed by a dramatic reduction to speeds just a fraction of its value in a viscous fluid. Velocity fluctuations are also more pronounced in stiffer environments. We demonstrate that speed enhancements are linked to hydrodynamic interactions with the microstructure, while reductions are due to the filaments restricting the amplitude of the swimmer's propulsive wave. Unlike previous studies where interactions with obstacles allowed for significant enhancements in swimming speeds, the modest enhancements seen here are more comparable to those given by models where the environment is treated as a continuous viscoelastic fluid.</description>

      <title>Extended Spreading of Saline Droplets upon Impact on a Frosty Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the solidification dynamics of impacted water droplets is fundamental and crucial for applications, especially with the presence of frost and salt. Here, we experimentally investigate the spreading and freezing dynamics of saline droplets upon impact on a cold, frosty surface. Our findings demonstrate that the frost and salt can lead to an extended spreading of impacted droplets under specific conditions. In addition to the well-known 1/2 inertial spreading scaling law for droplets impact on a cold substrate, we observe a distinct transition to a 1/10 scaling law dominated by the capillary-viscous relation at low impacting velocities. We formulate the onset criterion for this extended spreading regime and derive a scaling dependence that captures the droplet's arrested diameter over various supercooling temperatures, by incorporating the effect of impact inertia, partial-wetting behavior and salinity. Based on the analysis, a unified model is proposed for predicting the droplet arrested diameter over a wide range of impact velocity and salinity.</description>

      <title>Tuning body shape and stiffness to mitigate water-entry forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-speed water entry of projectiles and diving systems induces high forces and jerk to the entering bodies due to the development of large hydrodynamic pressure. Previous research has shown separately that the peak forces can be reduced by improving the aerodynamic shape of the head (nose) or, recently, by introducing a spring element between the head and body. This study seeks to understand whether the aerodynamic shape or spring stiffness coupling is most important for force reduction by combining both in one study. The experiment combines the nose cone aerodynamics and spring stiffness with a rear body and examines the forces acting on the nose and body. Three parameters are varied: the nose angle, spring stiffness, and impact velocity. An unsteady semi-analytical formulation is developed to estimate the water entry forces and coupled body dynamics. We find that the peak force reduction due to the spring is highest when the slamming force is most significant, particularly at higher impact velocities and with blunter nose angles. The spring coupling enables periodic fluctuations between the kinetic and potential energy throughout the duration of impact, which can be tuned by varying the stiffness. These findings can allow engineers to control the dynamic response of water entry.</description>

      <title>Impact of Spanwise Rotation on Flow Separation and Recovery Behind a Bulge in Channel Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct numerical simulations of spanwise-rotating turbulent channel flow with a parabolic bump on the bottom wall are employed to investigate the effects of rotation on flow separation. Four rotation rates of $Ro_b := 2\Omega H/U_b = \pm 0.42, \; \pm 1.0$ are compared with the non-rotating scenario. The mild adverse pressure gradient induced by the lee side of the bump allows for a variable pressure-induced separation. The separation region is reduced (increased) when the bump is on the anti-cyclonic (cyclonic) side of the channel, compared with the non-rotating separation. The total drag is reduced in all rotating cases. Through several mechanisms, rotation alters the onset of separation, reattachment, and wake recovery. The mean momentum deficit is found to be the key. A physical interpretation of the ratio between the system rotation and mean shear vorticity, $S:=\Omega/\Omega_s$, provides the mechanisms regarding stability thresholds of $S=-0.5$ and $-1$. The rotation effects are explained accordingly with reference to the dynamics of several flow structures. For anti-cyclonic separation, particularly, the interaction between the Taylor-G\"ortler vortices and hairpin vortices of wall-bounded turbulence is proven to be responsible for the breakdown of the separating shear layer. A generalized argument is made regarding the essential role of near-wall deceleration and resultant ejection of enhanced hairpin vortices in destabilizing an anti-cyclonic flow. This mechanism is anticipated to have broad impacts on other applications in analogy to rotating shear flows, such as thermal convection and boundary layers over concave walls.</description>

      <title>Bridging scales in multiscale bubble growth dynamics with correlated fluctuations using neural operator learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intricate process of bubble growth dynamics involves a broad spectrum of physical phenomena from microscale mechanics of bubble formation to macroscale interplay between bubbles and surrounding thermo-hydrodynamics. Traditional bubble dynamics models including atomistic approaches and continuum-based methods segment the bubble dynamics into distinct scale-specific models. In order to bridge the gap between microscale stochastic fluid models and continuum-based fluid models for bubble dynamics, we develop a composite neural operator model to unify the analysis of nonlinear bubble dynamics across microscale and macroscale regimes by integrating a many-body dissipative particle dynamics (mDPD) model with a continuum-based Rayleigh-Plesset (RP) model through a novel neural network architecture, which consists of a deep operator network for learning the mean behavior of bubble growth subject to pressure variations and a long short-term memory network for learning the statistical features of correlated fluctuations in microscale bubble dynamics. Training and testing data are generated by conducting mDPD and RP simulations for nonlinear bubble dynamics with initial bubble radii ranging from 0.1 to 1.5 micrometers. Results show that the trained composite neural operator model can accurately predict bubble dynamics across scales, with a 99% accuracy for the time evaluation of the bubble radius under varying external pressure while containing correct size-dependent stochastic fluctuations in microscale bubble growth dynamics. The composite neural operator is the first deep learning surrogate for multiscale bubble growth dynamics that can capture correct stochastic fluctuations in microscopic fluid phenomena, which sets a new direction for future research in multiscale fluid dynamics modeling.</description>

      <title>A fast immersed boundary method for an extruded wall geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The computational cost of the boundary-condition-enforced immersed boundary method (IBM) increases in the order of $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ as the number of Lagrangian points, $N$, increases. This is due to the time-consuming calculation of the correction operator in the diffuse-interface IBM to enforce the no-slip boundary condition. In this study, a computationally efficient IBM algorithm for an extruded wall geometry is developed, and the correction operator calculation is significantly simplified while maintaining the accuracy of the solution. This method takes advantage of the geometrical symmetricity to apply several matrix simplifications, which result in a huge increase in the computational efficiency and an improved scalability of $\mathcal{O}(max(N, N^2/r^2))$ ($r$: the number of grid points towards the extruded direction). The boundary-condition-enforced IBM for an extruded wall geometry is applicable to the numerical simulations of the flow around a wall surface that satisfies both (a) an extruded wall geometry that retains the same cross-section geometry and (b) an Eulerian grid that is either uniform or whose stretch rate towards the extruded direction is constant. As this type of geometry is commonly studied to investigate the fundamental behavior of the fluid, the presented algorithm has wide applications. Several calculations are conducted to demonstrate the higher computational efficiency of the presented algorithm compared with that of the original algorithm. The results show improvements in computational efficiency of up to 2,800 times for the correction operator calculation and 160 times for the overall IBM calculations compared with the original algorithm while retaining the computational accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conceptualizing a porous media as a network of conductors sets a compromise between the oversimplifying conceptualization of the media as a bundle of capillary tubes and the computationally expensive and unobtainable detailed description of the media's geometry needed for direct numerical simulations. These models are abundantly being used to evaluate single and multiphase flow characteristics. The different flow characteristics are valuable in evaluating phenomena that may or may not be relevant for different applications. Here, we evaluate how different information about the pore space affects the ability of the network model to evaluate different flow characteristics.</description>

      <title>Neural Downscaling for Complex Systems: from Large-scale to Small-scale by Neural Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting and understanding the chaotic dynamics in complex systems is essential in various applications. However, conventional approaches, whether full-scale simulations or small-scale omissions, fail to offer a comprehensive solution. This instigates exploration into whether modeling or omitting small-scale dynamics could benefit from the well-captured large-scale dynamics. In this paper, we introduce a novel methodology called Neural Downscaling (ND), which integrates neural operator techniques with the principles of inertial manifold and nonlinear Galerkin theory. ND effectively infers small-scale dynamics within a complementary subspace from corresponding large-scale dynamics well-represented in a low-dimensional space. The effectiveness and generalization of the method are demonstrated on the complex systems governed by the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and Navier-Stokes equations. As the first comprehensive deterministic model targeting small-scale dynamics, ND sheds light on the intricate spatiotemporal nonlinear dynamics of complex systems, revealing how small-scale dynamics are intricately linked with and influenced by large-scale dynamics.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Optimized Approach for Parameter Selection in MESHFREE Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Meshfree simulation methods are emerging as compelling alternatives to conventional mesh-based approaches, particularly in the fields of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and continuum mechanics. In this publication, we provide a comprehensive overview of our research combining Machine Learning (ML) and Fraunhofer's MESHFREE software (www.meshfree.eu), a powerful tool utilizing a numerical point cloud in a Generalized Finite Difference Method (GFDM). This tool enables the effective handling of complex flow domains, moving geometries, and free surfaces, while allowing users to finely tune local refinement and quality parameters for an optimal balance between computation time and results accuracy. However, manually determining the optimal parameter combination poses challenges, especially for less experienced users. We introduce a novel ML-optimized approach, using active learning, regression trees, and visualization on MESHFREE simulation data, demonstrating the impact of input combinations on results quality and computation time. This research contributes valuable insights into parameter optimization in meshfree simulations, enhancing accessibility and usability for a broader user base in scientific and engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics of a disk in a thin film of weakly nematic fluid subject to linear friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To make progress towards the development of a theory on the motion of inclusions in thin structured films and membranes, we here consider as an initial step a circular disk in a two-dimensional, uniaxially anisotropic fluid layer. We assume overdamped dynamics, incompressibility of the fluid, and global alignment of the axis of anisotropy. Motion within this layer is affected by additional linear friction with the environment, for instance, a supporting substrate. We investigate the induced flows in the fluid when the disk is translated parallel or perpendicular to the direction of anisotropy. Moreover, expressions for corresponding mobilities and resistance coefficients of the disk are derived. Our results are obtained within the framework of a perturbative expansion in the parameters that quantify the anisotropy of the fluid. Good agreement is found for moderate anisotropy when compared to associated results from finite-element simulations. At pronounced anisotropy, the induced flow fields are still predicted qualitatively correctly by the perturbative theory, although quantitative deviations arise. We hope to stimulate with our investigations corresponding experimental analyses, for example, concerning fluid flows in anisotropic thin films on uniaxially rubbed supporting substrates.</description>

      <title>Intricacies of CO2-Basalt Interactions, Reactive Flow and Carbon Mineralization: Bridging Numerical Forecasts to Empirical Realities</title>

Abstract: Subsurface fluid flow and solute transport are pivotal in addressing pressing energy, environmental, and societal challenges, such as geological CO2 storage. Basaltic rocks have gained prominence as suitable geological substrates for injecting substantial CO2 volumes and carbon mineralization, driven by their widespread occurrence, high concentrations of cation-rich silicate minerals, reported fast mineralization rate, and favorable characteristics such as porosity, permeability, and injectivity. The mineralization process within basaltic rocks is intricately linked, involving the dissolution of silicate minerals and the subsequent precipitation of carbonate minerals. Columnar flow and batch surface growth experiments revealed the spontaneous formation of a limited number of large crystals at various locations, rationalized by the overarching influence of probabilistic mineral nucleation. Experiments with CO2-acidified brine versus freshwater prove to be more challenging regarding the sweet spots for heavy carbon mineralization due to clay formation on the surface, particularly smectites. Despite numerical predictions suggesting the formation of MgFeCa-carbonates in CO2-basalt interactions at higher temperatures, our laboratory findings primarily indicated the growth of calcium carbonates. The experimental and numerical outcomes highlight the necessity of a probabilistic approach for accurately modeling reaction kinetics, crystal growth distribution, and the dynamic interplay between reactive flow, geochemical reactions, mineral carbonation, and geometry alteration.</description>

      <title>Universal Murray's law for optimised fluid transport in synthetic structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16567v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Materials following Murray's law are of significant interest due to their unique porous structure and optimal mass transfer ability. However, it is challenging to construct such biomimetic hierarchical channels with perfectly cylindrical pores in synthetic systems following the existing theory. Achieving superior mass transport capacity revealed by Murray's law in nanostructured materials has thus far remained out of reach. We propose a Universal Murray's law applicable to a wide range of hierarchical structures, shapes and generalised transfer processes. We experimentally demonstrate optimal flow of various fluids in hierarchically planar and tubular graphene aerogel structures to validate the proposed law. By adjusting the macroscopic pores in such aerogel-based gas sensors, we also show a significantly improved sensor response dynamic. Our work provides a solid framework for designing synthetic Murray materials with arbitrarily shaped channels for superior mass transfer capabilities, with future implications in catalysis, sensing and energy applications.</description>

      <title>A new stabilized time-spectral finite element solver for fast simulation of blood flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09465v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing application of cardiorespiratory simulations for diagnosis and surgical planning necessitates the development of computational methods significantly faster than the current technology. To achieve this objective, we leverage the time-periodic nature of these flows by discretizing equations in the frequency domain instead of the time domain. This approach markedly reduces the size of the discrete problem and, consequently, the simulation cost. With this motivation, we introduce a finite element method for simulating time-periodic flows that are physically stable. The proposed time-spectral method is formulated by augmenting the baseline Galerkin's method with a least-squares penalty term that is weighed by a positive-definite stabilization matrix. An error estimate is established for the convective-diffusive system, showing that the proposed method emulates the behavior of existing standard time methods including optimal convergence rate in diffusive regimes and stability in strong convection. This method is tested on a patient-specific Fontan model at nominal Reynolds and Womersley numbers of 500 and 10, respectively, demonstrating its ability to replicate conventional time simulation results using as few as 7 modes at 11% of the computational cost. Owing to its higher local-to-processor computation density, the proposed method also exhibits improved parallel scalability for fast simulation of time-critical applications.</description>
