      <title>Dogs on forest trails; Understanding ecology of Striped Hyena and wild Canids in the presence of free-ranging dogs in Udanti-Sitanadi Tiger Reserve, Central India using Joint Distribution and Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study uses Joint Species Distribution Models (JSDMs) and Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to explore how wild carnivores and free-ranging dogs interact in the Udanti-Sitanadi Tiger Reserve (USTR) in Central India. The research focuses on key species like the Striped Hyena, Grey Wolf, Golden Jackal, and Indian Fox, revealing significant overlaps in habitat with free-ranging dogs, especially in densely populated areas like the Sitanadi region of the tiger reserve. These overlaps pose serious risks to wildlife through competition for resources, predation, and the spread of diseases. The study shows that the Striped Hyena prefers gentle slopes and forested areas, while the Grey Wolf tends to avoid cropland and thrives in regions with higher rainfall that supports a stable prey base. The Golden Jackal, more adaptable than the others, favors west-facing slopes and stable temperatures, whereas the Indian Fox is mainly found in the less disturbed, mountainous Kuladighat region. Additionally, the study highlights the potential impacts of climate change, predicting that the Grey Wolf could face habitat extinction under more severe scenarios. These findings underscore the urgent need for conservation strategies tailored to address both dog wild carnivore interactions and the growing challenges posed by climate change, focusing on protecting the critical habitats of vulnerable species like the Striped Hyena and Grey Wolf.</description>

      <title>Trophic Cascades and Habitat Suitability in Udanti Sitnadi Tiger Reserve: Impacts of Prey Depletion and Climate Change on Predator Prey Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the trophic cascades and habitat suitability in Udanti Sitnadi Tiger Reserve (USTR), highlighting the roles of apex predators, subordinate predators, and prey species in maintaining ecosystem balance. Using the Trophic Species Distribution Model (SDM), we explored prey-predator interactions and habitat suitability, revealing that tigers, due to prey depletion, increasingly rely on cattle, while leopards adapt by preying on smaller species. The study emphasizes the need for prey augmentation and habitat restoration to support apex predators. Additionally, climate change projections for 2021-2040 and 2081-2100 under CMIP6 scenarios SSP245 and SSP585 indicate significant regional habitat shifts, necessitating adaptive management strategies. Kuladighat is projected to face habitat contraction, while Sitanadi may experience habitat expansion. Effective conservation efforts such as habitat restoration, prey augmentation and predator recovery are the most important steps needed to maintain the purpose of a Tiger reserve and conservation potential of Udanti-Sonabeda Tiger Conservation Unit (TCU). To achieve these dynamics, focusing on community participation, anti-poaching measures, and scientific recommendations are the most crucial components to focus on. This comprehensive analysis underscores the critical role of targeted conservation activities in prey-depleted landscapes to ensure the long-term survival of tigers and the overall health of forest ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and mitigating human-wildlife conflicts in USTR.</description>

      <title>Analysis of a mathematical model for malaria using data-driven approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Malaria is one of the deadliest diseases in the world, every year millions of people become victims of this disease and many even lose their lives. Medical professionals and the government could take accurate measures to protect the people only when the disease dynamics are understood clearly. In this work, we propose a compartmental model to study the dynamics of malaria. We consider the transmission rate dependent on temperature and altitude. We performed the steady state analysis on the proposed model and checked the stability of the disease-free and endemic steady state. An artificial neural network (ANN) is applied to the formulated model to predict the trajectory of all five compartments following the mathematical analysis. Three different neural network architectures namely Artificial neural network (ANN), convolution neural network (CNN), and Recurrent neural network (RNN) are used to estimate these parameters from the trajectory of the data. To understand the severity of a disease, it is essential to calculate the risk associated with the disease. In this work, the risk is calculated using dynamic mode decomposition(DMD) from the trajectory of the infected people.</description>

      <title>Compartment model of strategy-dependent time delays in replicator dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world processes often exhibit temporal separation between actions and reactions - a characteristic frequently ignored in many modelling frameworks. Adding temporal aspects, like time delays, introduces a higher complexity of problems and leads to models that are challenging to analyse and computationally expensive to solve. In this work, we propose an intermediate solution to resolve the issue in the framework of evolutionary game theory. Our compartment-based model includes time delays while remaining relatively simple and straightforward to analyse. We show that this model yields qualitatively comparable results with models incorporating explicit delays. Particularly, we focus on the case of delays between parents' interaction and an offspring joining the population, with the magnitude of the delay depending on the parents' strategy. We analyse Stag-Hunt, Snowdrift, and the Prisoner's Dilemma game and show that strategy-dependent delays are detrimental to affected strategies. Additionally, we present how including delays may change the effective games played in the population, subsequently emphasising the importance of considering the studied systems' temporal aspects to model them accurately.</description>

      <title>Mathematical model of CAR-T-cell therapy for a B-cell Lymphoma lymph node</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CAR-T cell therapies have demonstrated significant success in treating B-cell leukemia in children and young adults. However, their effectiveness in treating B-cell lymphomas has been limited. Unlike leukemia, lymphoma often manifests as solid masses of cancer cells in lymph nodes, glands, or organs, making these tumors harder to access thus hindering treatment response. In this paper we present a mathematical model that elucidates the dynamics of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and CAR-T cells in a lymph node. The mathematical model aids in understanding the complex interplay between the cell populations involved and proposes ways to identify potential underlying dynamical causes of treatment failure. We also study the phenomenon of immunosuppression induced by tumor cells and theoretically demonstrate its impact on cell dynamics. Through the examination of various response scenarios, we underscore the significance of product characteristics in treatment outcomes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a numerical analysis of local community assembly through weak migration from a regional species pool. At equilibrium, the local community consists of a subset ("clique") of species from the regional community. Our analysis reveals that the interaction networks of these cliques exhibit nontrivial architectures. Specifically, we demonstrate the pronounced nested structure of the clique interaction matrix in the case of symmetric interactions and the hyperuniform structure seen in asymmetric communities.</description>

      <title>Modeling contagious disease spreading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An understanding of the disease spreading phenomenon based on a mathematical model is extremely needed for the implication of the correct policy measures to contain the disease propagation. Here, we report a new model namely the Ising-SIR model describing contagious disease spreading phenomena including both airborne and direct contact disease transformations. In the airborne case, a susceptible agent can catch the disease either from the environment or its infected neighbors whereas in the second case, the agent can be infected only through close contact with its infected neighbors. We have performed Monte Carlo simulations on a square lattice using periodic boundary conditions to investigate the dynamics of disease spread. The simulations demonstrate that the mechanism of disease spreading plays a significant role in the growth dynamics and leads to different growth exponent. In the direct contact disease spreading mechanism, the growth exponent is nearly equal to two for some model parameters which agrees with earlier empirical observations. In addition, the model predicts various types of spatiotemporal patterns that can be observed in nature.</description>

      <title>Forecasting infectious disease prevalence with associated uncertainty using neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Infectious diseases pose significant human and economic burdens. Accurately forecasting disease incidence can enable public health agencies to respond effectively to existing or emerging diseases. Despite progress in the field, developing accurate forecasting models remains a significant challenge. This thesis proposes two methodological frameworks using neural networks (NNs) with associated uncertainty estimates - a critical component limiting the application of NNs to epidemic forecasting thus far. We develop our frameworks by forecasting influenza-like illness (ILI) in the United States. Our first proposed method uses Web search activity data in conjunction with historical ILI rates as observations for training NN architectures. Our models incorporate Bayesian layers to produce uncertainty intervals, positioning themselves as legitimate alternatives to more conventional approaches. The best performing architecture: iterative recurrent neural network (IRNN), reduces mean absolute error by 10.3% and improves Skill by 17.1% on average in forecasting tasks across four flu seasons compared to the state-of-the-art. We build on this method by introducing IRNNs, an architecture which changes the sampling procedure in the IRNN to improve the uncertainty estimation. Our second framework uses neural ordinary differential equations to bridge the gap between mechanistic compartmental models and NNs; benefiting from the physical constraints that compartmental models provide. We evaluate eight neural ODE models utilising a mixture of ILI rates and Web search activity data to provide forecasts. These are compared with the IRNN and IRNN0 - the IRNN using only ILI rates. Models trained without Web search activity data outperform the IRNN0 by 16% in terms of Skill. Future work should focus on more effectively using neural ODEs with Web search data to compete with the best performing IRNN.</description>

      <title>Swarm Systems as a Platform for Open-Ended Evolutionary Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial swarm systems have been extensively studied and used in computer science, robotics, engineering and other technological fields, primarily as a platform for implementing robust distributed systems to achieve pre-defined objectives. However, such swarm systems, especially heterogeneous ones, can also be utilized as an ideal platform for creating *open-ended evolutionary dynamics* that do not converge toward pre-defined goals but keep exploring diverse possibilities and generating novel outputs indefinitely. In this article, we review Swarm Chemistry and its variants as concrete sample cases to illustrate beneficial characteristics of heterogeneous swarm systems, including the cardinality leap of design spaces, multiscale structures/behaviors and their diversity, and robust self-organization, self-repair and ecological interactions of emergent patterns, all of which serve as the driving forces for open-ended evolutionary processes. Applications to science, engineering, and art/entertainment as well as the directions of further research are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Taming Randomness in Agent-Based Models using Common Random Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random numbers are at the heart of every agent-based model (ABM) of health and disease. By representing each individual in a synthetic population, agent-based models enable detailed analysis of intervention impact and parameter sensitivity. Yet agent-based modeling has a fundamental signal-to-noise problem, in which small differences between simulations cannot be reliably differentiated from stochastic noise resulting from misaligned random number realizations. We introduce a novel methodology that eliminates noise due to misaligned random numbers, a first for agent-based modeling. Our approach enables meaningful individual-level analysis between ABM scenarios because all differences are driven by mechanistic effects rather than random number noise. A key result is that many fewer simulations are needed for some applications. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach on three disparate examples and discuss limitations.</description>

      <title>A model-based assessment of social isolation practices for COVID-19 outbreak response in residential care facilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01371v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Residential aged-care facilities (RACFs, also called long-term care facilities, aged care homes, or nursing homes) have elevated risks of respiratory infection outbreaks and associated disease burden. During the COVID-19 pandemic, social isolation policies were commonly used in these facilities to prevent and mitigate outbreaks. We refer specifically to general isolation policies that were intended to reduce contact between residents, without regard to confirmed infection status. Such policies are controversial because of their association with adverse mental and physical health indicators and there is a lack of modelling that assesses their effectiveness.
  We developed an agent-based model of COVID-19 transmission in a structured population, intended to represent the salient characteristics of a residential care environment. Using our model, we generated stochastic ensembles of simulated outbreaks and compared summary statistics of outbreaks simulated} under different mitigation conditions. Our study focuses on the marginal impact of general isolation (reducing social contact between residents), regardless of confirmed infection.
  In the absence of any asymptomatic screening, general isolation of residents to their rooms reduced median cumulative cases by approximately 27%. However, when conducted concurrently with asymptomatic screening and isolation of confirmed cases, general isolation reduced the median number of cumulative infections by only 12% in our simulations.
  Our simulations showed that general isolation of residents did not provide substantial benefits beyond those achieved through screening, isolation of confirmed cases, and deployment of PPE. Our conclusions are sensitive to assumptions about the proportion of total contacts in a facility accounted for by casual interactions between residents.</description>

      <title>Solving the prisoner's dilemma trap in Hamilton's model of temporarily formed random groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Explaining the evolution of cooperation in the strong altruism scenario, where a cooperator does not benefit from her contribution to the public goods, is a challenging problem that requires positive assortment among cooperators (i.e., cooperators must tend to associate with other cooperators) or punishment of defectors. The need for these drastic measures stems from the analysis of a group selection model of temporarily formed random groups introduced by Hamilton nearly fifty years ago to describe the fate of altruistic behavior in a population. Challenging conventional wisdom, we show analytically here that strong altruism evolves in Hamilton's original model in the case of biparental sexual reproduction. Moreover, when the cost of cooperation is small and the amplified contribution shared by group members is large, cooperation is the only stable strategy in equilibrium. Thus, our results provide a solution to the `problem of origination' of strong altruism, i.e. how cooperation can take off from an initial low frequency of cooperators. We discuss a possible reassessment of cooperation in cases of viral co-infection, as cooperation may even be favored in situations where the prisoner's dilemma applies.</description>
