      <title>Performance of the AstroPix Prototype Module for the Barrel Imaging Calorimeter at the ePIC Detector and in Space-Based Payloads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AstroPix is a high-voltage CMOS (HV-CMOS) monolithic active pixel sensor originally developed to enable precision gamma-ray imaging and spectroscopy in the medium-energy regime (approximately 100 keV-100 MeV) based on the groundwork laid by ATLASpix and MuPix. It features a 500 um pixel pitch, in-pixel amplification and digitization, and low power consumption (around 3-4 mW/cm^2), making it scalable for large-area, multilayer telescope detector planes. The detectors have a designed dynamic range of 25 keV to 700 keV.
  With these features, AstroPix meets the requirements of future space-based high-energy telescopes and the imaging layers of the Barrel Imaging Calorimeter (BIC) in the Electron-Proton/Ion Collider (ePIC) detector at the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). For the space-based payload, AstroPix is being integrated into sounding rocket and balloon payloads to demonstrate the technical readiness of the devices. For BIC, AstroPix-based imaging layers interleaved within the lead/scintillating-fiber (Pb/SciFi) sampling calorimeter provide granular shower imaging, enabling key performance features such as electron/pion or gamma/neutral-pion separation.
  As part of the ongoing detector R&amp;D efforts, we have been testing various AstroPix v3 configurations: the single chip, a quad-chip assembly, a three-layer stack of quad chips, and a nine-chip module that represents the smallest prototype unit of the BIC imaging layer. This presentation will highlight recent performance test results from these AstroPix detector configurations.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Limits to Phase and Amplitude Estimation in the High-Strehl Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: Ground-based telescopes are susceptible to seeing, an atmospheric phenomenon that reduces the resolving power of large observatories to that of a home telescope. Compensating these effects is therefore critical to realizing the potential of upcoming extremely large telescopes, a challenging task that requires precise wavefront control. Ultimately, this precision is limited by one's wavefront sensor (WFS) and its capacity to accurately encode phase and amplitude aberrations.
  Aims: Our attention is on photon noise-limited wavefront sensing in the high-Strehl regime. In particular, we seek fundamental limits to phase and amplitude estimation in addition to a WFS that saturate these bounds.
  Methods: Information theory is employed for deriving minimum-achievable residual errors, as stipulated by a metric called the Holevo Cramer-Rao bound. Holevo's bound is closely related to another metric called the quantum Cramer-Rao bound, which has already been applied to phase estimation on nearly-corrected wavefronts.
  Results: We present a WFS that can perfectly extract and phase shift a telescope's piston mode. We show how this phase can be used to tune the apparatus' sensitivity to phase and amplitude, and provide a closed-form expression for the optimal phase shift. For circular apertures, this implementation saturates the fundamental limits, but it can be easily modified to work with arbitrary pupils. Moreover, our proposal uses optics that are manufactureable today and is readily achromatized with geometric phase shifters.</description>

      <title>A Firefly-inspired Model for Deciphering the Alien</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (ETI) is, historically, a search for aliens like us, inspired by human centric ideas of intelligence and technology. However, humans are not the only instance of an intelligent, communicating species on Earth, and thus not guide to how we might think about ETI. Here, we explore the potential for the study of non-human species to inform new approaches in SETI research, using firefly communication patterns as an illustrative example. Fireflies communicate their presence through evolved flash patterns distinct from complex visual backgrounds. Extraterrestrial signals may also be identifiable not by their complexity or decodable content, but by the structural properties of the signal, as currently being explored in efforts to decode communication in non-human species across our biosphere. We present a firefly-inspired model for detecting potential technosignatures within environments dominated by ordered astronomical phenomena, such as pulsars. Using pulsar data from the Australia Telescope National Facility, we generate simulated signals that exhibit evolved dissimilarity from the surrounding pulsar population. This approach shifts focus from anthropocentric assumptions about intelligence toward recognizing communication through its fundamental structural properties, specifically, evolutionarily optimized contrast with natural backgrounds. Our model demonstrates that alien signals need not be inherently complicated nor need we decipher their meaning to identify them; rather, signals might be distinguishable as products of selection. We discuss implications for broadening SETI methodologies, leveraging the diverse forms of intelligence found on Earth.</description>

      <title>SVOM Follow-up Observation Coordinating Service</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sino-French SVOM (Space Variable Objects Monitor) mission is a space-based astronomy mission complemented with ground-based dedicated instrumentation. It aims to explore and study high-energy cosmic phenomena, such as gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). This unprecedented combination of space-based and ground-based instruments will provide leading multi-wavelength observational capabilities in gamma-rays, X-rays, optical, and near-infrared bands. The complete observation sequence of each GRB triggered by the SVOM mission consists of three stages, the GRB detections, followed by the on-board and grounded automatic follow-ups, and rapid deep multi-band photometry and spectroscopy re-visit observations. To efficiently organize all grounded instruments performing automatic follow-ups and re-visit observations, we develop a follow-up observation coordinating service (FOCS), which is capable of performing GRB trigger distributing, automatic observation scheduling and observation coordination supporting by providing a user support platform. The FOCS also facilitates the provision of observational planning for ground-based telescopes to conduct synchronized observations of identical celestial regions as SVOM. The FOCS is utilized for the SVOM-dedicated ground-based telescopes as well as for associated partner telescopes. Since the launch of SVOM in June 2024, as the FOCS system joining the operations of SVOM, multiple successful observations have been made for SVOM GRBs. In this paper, we present the goals of the FOCS system as well as the principle and workflow developed to achieve these goals. The structure, technical design, implementation, and performance of the FOCS system are also described in detail. We conclude with a summary of the current status of the FOCS system and our near-future development plan.</description>

      <title>Improving pulsar search efficiency in next-generation pulsar surveys with artificial intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsar searching with next-generation radio telescopes requires efficiently sifting through millions of candidates generated by search pipelines to identify the most promising ones. This challenge has motivated the utilization of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based tools. In this work, we explore an optimized pulsar search pipeline that utilizes deep learning to sift ``snapshot'' candidates generated by folding de-dispersed time series data. This approach significantly accelerates the search process by reducing the time spent on the folding step. We also developed a script to generate simulated pulsars for benchmarking and model fine-tuning. The benchmark analysis used the NGC 5904 globular cluster data and simulated pulsar data, showing that our pipeline reduces candidate folding time by a factor of $\sim$10 and achieves 100% recall by recovering all known detectable pulsars in the restricted parameter space. We also tested the speed-up using data of known pulsars from a single observation in the Southern-sky MWA Rapid Two-metre (SMART) survey, achieving a conservatively estimated speed-up factor of 60 in the folding step over a large parameter space. We tested the model's ability to classify pulsar candidates using real data collected from the FAST, GBT, MWA, Arecibo, and Parkes, demonstrating that our method can be generalized to different telescopes. The results show that the optimized pipeline identifies pulsars with an accuracy of 0.983 and a recall of 0.9844 on the real dataset. This approach can be used to improve the processing efficiency for the SMART and is also relevant for future SKA pulsar surveys.</description>

      <title>Mock Observations for the CSST Mission: Main Surveys-the Slitless Spectroscopy Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The China Space Station Telescope (CSST), slated to become China's largest space-based optical telescope in the coming decade, is designed to conduct wide-field sky surveys with high spatial resolution. Among its key observational modes, slitless spectral observation allows simultaneous imaging and spectral data acquisition over a wide field of view, offering significant advantages for astrophysical studies. Currently, the CSST is in the development phase and lacks real observational data. As a result, the development of its data processing pipeline and scientific pre-research must rely on the mock data generated through simulations. This work focuses on developing a simulation framework for the CSST slitless spectral imaging system, analyzing its spectral dispersing properties and structural design. Additionally, the detection performance of the slitless spectral system is assessed for various astrophysical targets. Simulation results demonstrate that nearly all 1st order spectra are accompanied by corresponding 0th order images, facilitating accurate source identification. Furthermore, the GI spectral band exhibits superior detection efficiency compared to the GV and GU bands, establishing it as the primary observational band for stellar and galactic studies. This work successfully develops a simulation framework for the CSST slitless spectroscopic equipment.</description>

      <title>Mock Observations for the CSST Mission: Integral Field Spectrograph--GEHONG: A Package for Generating Ideal Datacubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We developed a Python package GEHONG to mock the three-dimensional spectral data cube under the observation of an ideal telescope for the Integral Field Spectrograph of the Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST-IFS). This package can generate one-dimensional spectra corresponding to local physical properties at specific positions according to a series of two-dimensional distributions of physical parameters of target sources. In this way, it can produce a spatially resolved spectral cube of the target source. Two-dimensional distributions of physical parameters, including surface brightness, stellar population, and line-of-sight velocity, can be modeled using the parametric model or based on real observational data and numerical simulation data. For the generation of one-dimensional spectra, we have considered four types of spectra, including the stellar continuum spectra, ionized gas emission lines, AGN spectra, and stellar spectra. That makes GEHONG able to mock various types of targets, including galaxies, AGNs, star clusters, and HII regions.</description>

      <title>Mock Observations for the CSST Mission: Multi-Channel Imager--The Cluster Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Multi-Channel Imager (MCI), one of the instruments aboard the China Survey Space Telescope (CSST), is designed to simultaneously observe the sky in three filters, covering wavelengths from the near-ultraviolet (NUV) to the near-infrared (NIR). With its large field of view ($7.5^{\prime}\times7.5^{\prime}$), MCI is particularly well-suited for observing galaxy clusters, providing a powerful tool for investigating galaxy evolution, dark matter and dark energy through gravitational lensing. Here we present a comprehensive simulation framework of a strong lensing cluster as observed by MCI, aiming to fully exploit its capabilities in capturing lensing features. The framework simulates a strong lensing cluster from the CosmoDC2 catalog, calculating the gravitational potential and performing ray-tracing to derive the true positions, shapes and light distribution of galaxies within the cluster field. Additionally, the simulation incorporates intra-cluster light (ICL) and spectral energy distributions (SEDs), enabling further strong lensing analyses, such as ICL seperation from galaxy light and mass reconstruction combining strong and weak lensing measurements. This framework provides a critical benchmark for testing the MCI data pipeline and maximizing its potential in galaxy cluster research.</description>

      <title>Mock Observations for the CSST Mission: End-to-End Performance Modeling of Optical System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive end-to-end simulation analysis of the optical imaging performance of the China Survey Space Telescope (CSST) under in-orbit conditions. An integrated system model incorporating five static and two dynamic error sub-models was established. Wavefront errors were calculated for each sub-model and compared to the integrated system error to quantify the individual contributions to image degradation. At the detector level, wavefront error, point spread function (PSF), and ellipticity were evaluated across the full field of view (FOV). The average radius of 80\% encircled energy (REE80) of the PSF under full-error conditions was determined for 25 field points, yielding a value of 0.114 arcseconds. Furthermore, the calculations indicate a correlation between the wavefront distribution and the ellipticity distribution within the optical system. By optimizing the wavefront distribution, it is possible to adjust the ellipticity distribution of the PSF across the full FOV. The end-to-end simulation approach adopted in this paper provides a theoretical foundation for improving the image quality in large-aperture, off-axis space telescopes.</description>

      <title>Mock Observations for the CSST Mission: Main Surveys--the Stray Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stray light significantly influences the detection capabilities of astronomical telescopes. The actual stray-light level during observations depends not only on the telescope's inherent stray-light suppression capability but also on its operational orbit conditions. Accurate estimation of stray-light levels is crucial for assessing image quality and performing realistic scientific simulations. To rapidly estimate stray-light levels under realistic, complex operational conditions, we developed an analytical model tailored to the China Space Station Telescope (CSST). Our model simulates stray-light backgrounds generated by off-field sources such as moonlight, starlight, and earthshine, incorporating the effects of zodiacal light, as well as scattering and ghost images induced by bright in-field stars. The proposed method allows quick and accurate evaluation of stray-light conditions, facilitating both image simulation and observational scheduling.</description>

      <title>Mock Observations for the CSST Mission: Main Surveys--An Overview of Framework and Simulation Suite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST) is a flagship space-based observatory. Its main survey camera is designed to conduct high spatial resolution near-ultraviolet to near-infrared imaging and low-resolution spectroscopic surveys. To maximize the scientific output of CSST, we have developed a comprehensive, high-fidelity simulation pipeline for reproducing both imaging and spectroscopic observations. This paper presents an overview of the simulation framework, detailing its implementation and components. Built upon the GalSim package and incorporating the latest CSST instrumental specifications, our pipeline generates pixel-level mock observations that closely replicate the expected instrumental and observational conditions. The simulation suite integrates realistic astrophysical object catalogs, instrumental effects, point spread function (PSF) modeling, and observational noises to produce accurate synthetic data. We describe the key processing stages of the simulation, from constructing the input object catalogs to modeling the telescope optics and detector responses. Furthermore, we introduce the most recent release of simulated datasets, which provide a crucial testbed for data processing pipeline developments, calibration strategies, and scientific analyses, ensuring that CSST will meet its stringent requirements. Our pipeline serves as a vital tool for optimizing CSST main survey strategies and ensuring robust cosmological measurements.</description>

      <title>System Analysis for a high-precision high-accuracy Astrometric instrument for HWO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive system analysis for an instrument onboard the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), designed for high-precision, high-accuracy differential astrometry, with the primary scientific goal to determine the mass of Earth-like planets around the nearest Sun-like stars. The analysis integrates the definition of the mission profile, the instrumental concept architecture, and an error budget that breaks down the key contributors to the sub-micro arcses precision required for a single measurement. A portion of this budget addresses photo-center estimation for both the target and calibration stars used in differential astrometry. Other major contributors are related to instrumental control of systematics in the reconstruction of differential angle measurements from pixel data (focal plane calibration) to on sky line of sight (telescope distortion calibration). End-of-mission astrometry requires multiple observations (typically 100) of the same target distributed over the mission lifetime. We assess the mission profile to estimate the fraction of survey time required for astrometric survey to achieve the science objective. The proposed architecture of the instrument concept is derived from error budget and mission constraints based on a large visible detector array composed of an assembly of multiple CMOS sensor chips resulting in an overall gigapixel focal plane. We evaluate the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) and propose a way forward reaching TRL 5 level for key technologies by the Mission Consolidation Review in 2029.</description>

Abstract: Since the launch of JWST, observations of exoplanetary atmospheres have seen a revolution in data quality. Given that atmospheric parameter inferences depend heavily on the underlying data, a re-evaluation of current methodologies is warranted to assess the reliability of these results. We investigate the impact of variations in input spectra on atmospheric retrievals for the hot Jupiter WASP-39 b using JWST transit data. Specifically, we analyse the reliability of parameter estimations from random perturbations of the underlying spectrum and their sensitivity to three transmission spectra derived from the same observational data. Using the NIRSpec PRISM observation from a single transit of WASP-39 b, we perform retrievals with the TauREx framework. As a baseline, we use a spectrum derived with the Eureka! data reduction pipeline. To evaluate retrieval reliability, we analyse posterior distributions under deviations from this spectrum. We simulate random noise by performing retrievals on scattered instances of this spectrum and compare them with retrievals based on existing spectra reduced from the same raw observation. Our analysis identifies three types of posterior distributions: (1) Stable, Gaussian distributions for species constrained across the entire spectrum (e.g., H2O, CO2); (2) Uniform posteriors with upper bounds for weakly constrained species (e.g., CO, CH4); and (3) Unstable, heavy-tailed posteriors for species constrained by minor spectrum features (e.g., SO2, C2H2). We find that other parameters, such as the planetary radius and p-T profile, are stable under spectral perturbations. Posterior distributions differ for retrievals on independently reduced transmission spectra from the same raw data, complicating interpretation, particularly for skewed distributions. Based on this, we advocate for careful assessment and selection of credible interval sizes to reflect this.</description>

      <title>Are We There Yet? Challenges in Quantifying the Frequency of Earth Analogs in the Habitable Zone</title>

Abstract: Searching for life elsewhere in the universe is one of the most highly prioritized pursuits in astronomy today. However, the ability to observe evidence of Earth-like life through biosignatures is limited by the number of planets in the solar neighborhood with conditions similar to Earth. The occurrence rate of Earth-like planets in the habitable zones of Sun-like stars, $\eta_{\oplus}$, is therefore crucial for addressing the apparent lack of consensus on its value in the literature. Here we present a review of the current understanding of $\eta_{\oplus}$. We first provide definitions for parameters that contribute to $\eta_{\oplus}$. Then, we discuss the previous and current estimated parameter values and the context of the limitations on the analyses that produced these estimates. We compile an extensive list of the factors that go into any calculation of $\eta_{\oplus}$, and how detection techniques and surveys differ in their sensitivity and ability to accurately constrain $\eta_{\oplus}$. Understanding and refining the value of $\eta_{\oplus}$ is crucial for upcoming missions and telescopes, such as the planned Habitable Worlds Observatory and the Large Interferometer for Exoplanets, which aim to search for biosignatures on exoplanets in the solar neighborhood.</description>

      <title>NbodyCP:A direct N-body simulation code for composite stellar populations of single and binary star clusters</title>

Abstract: It is well-known that some star clusters contain composite stellar populations (CSPs), in which the metallicities or (and) ages of stars are different. The formation and evolution of such clusters and their stellar populations remain unclear. Both single and binary cluster channels may lead to such CSPs. In order to simulate the formation and evolution of such CSPs in star clusters, this work develops a code of direct N-body simulation of CSPs, NbodyCP. It is applied to different clusters, in particular, to binary clusters. It shows that CSPs and different kinds of cluster pairs can be formed via dynamical processes. This will help to partially explain the formation of CSPs and various clusters. Some special cluster structures, e.g., two cores or bar-like shape, are shown to be the results of evolution of some binary clusters. The simulation also shows that the separation between the members of a binary cluster affects the time of two member clusters to combine or move away significantly.</description>

      <title>Identification and characterization of distorted gravitational waves by lensing using deep learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) can be distorted by intervening mass distributions while propagating, leading to frequency-dependent modulations that imprint a distinct signature on the observed waveforms. Bayesian inference for GW lensing with conventional sampling methods is costly, and the problem is exacerbated by the rapidly growing GW catalog. Moreover, assessing the statistical significance of lensed candidates requires thousands, if not millions, of simulations to estimate the background from noise fluctuations and waveform systematics, which is infeasible with standard samplers. We present a novel method, \texttt{DINGO-lensing}, for performing inference on lensed GWs, extending the neural posterior estimation framework \texttt{DINGO}. By comparing our results with those using conventional samplers, we show that the compute time of parameter estimation of lensed GWs can be reduced from weeks to seconds, while preserving accuracy both in the posterior distributions and the evidence ratios. We train our neural networks with LIGO detector noise at design sensitivity and a lens model that accommodates two overlapping chirps with opposite parity. We show that the lensing parameters are recovered with millisecond precision for the time delays. We also demonstrate that our network can identify signals diffracted by point masses, highlighting its flexibility for searches. By simulating thousands of lensed and nonlensed events, we determine how the detectability changes with different source properties. \texttt{DINGO-lensing} provides a scalable and efficient avenue for identifying and characterizing gravitationally lensed GW events in the upcoming observing runs.</description>

      <title>samsara: A Continuous-Time Markov Chain Monte Carlo Sampler for Trans-Dimensional Bayesian Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian inference requires determining the posterior distribution, a task that becomes particularly challenging when the dimension of the parameter space is large and unknown. This limitation arises in many physics problems, such as Mixture Models (MM) with an unknown number of components or the inference of overlapping signals in noisy data, as in the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) Global Fit problem. Traditional approaches, such as product-space methods or Reversible-Jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC), often face efficiency and convergence limitations. This paper presents samsara, a Continuous-Time Markov Chain Monte Carlo (CTMCMC) framework that models parameter evolution through Poisson-driven birth, death, and mutation processes. samsara is designed to sample models of unknown dimensionality. By requiring detailed balance through adaptive rate definitions, CTMCMC achieves automatic acceptance of trans-dimensional moves and high sampling efficiency. The code features waiting time weighted estimators, optimized memory storage, and a modular design for easy customization. We validate samsara on three benchmark problems: an analytic trans-dimensional distribution, joint inference of sine waves and Lorentzians in time series, and a Gaussian MM with an unknown number of components. In all cases, the code shows excellent agreement with analytical and Nested Sampling results. All these features push samsara as a powerful alternative to RJMCMC for large- and variable-dimensional Bayesian inference problems.</description>

Abstract: The gravitational waves emitted by binary neutron star inspirals contain information on nuclear matter above saturation density. However, extracting this information and conducting parameter estimation remains a computationally challenging and expensive task. Wong et al. introduced Jim arXiv:2302.05333, a parameter estimation pipeline that combines relative binning and jax features such as hardware acceleration and automatic differentiation into a normalizing flow-enhanced sampler for gravitational waves from binary black hole (BBH) mergers. In this work, we extend the Jim framework to analyze gravitational wave signals from binary neutron stars (BNS) mergers with tidal effects included. We demonstrate that Jim can be used for full Bayesian parameter estimation of gravitational waves from BNS mergers within a few tens of minutes, which includes the training of the normalizing flow and computing the reference parameters for relative binning. For instance, Jim can analyze GW170817 in 26 minutes (33 minutes) of total wall time using the TaylorF2 (IMRPhenomD_NRTidalv2) waveform, and GW190425 in around 21 minutes for both waveforms. We highlight the importance of such an efficient parameter estimation pipeline for several science cases as well as its ecologically friendly implementation of gravitational wave parameter estimation.</description>

Abstract: Radio interferometers provide the means to perform the wide-field-of-view (FoV), high-sensitivity observations required for modern radio surveys. As computing power per cost has decreased, there has been a move towards larger arrays of smaller dishes, such as DSA-2000, the upcoming HIRAX, CHORD and SKA radio telescopes. Such arrays can have simpler receiver designs with room-temperature low-noise amplifiers and direct sampling to achieve, greatly reducing the cost per antenna. The ARGOS project is currently developing an array of five 6-meter antennas that will be used to demonstrate the technology required for a next generation "small-D, big-N" radio interferometer in Europe. In this work, our objective was to implement a first-stage digital signal processing system for the ARGOS demonstrator array, providing digitization, channelization, delay correction and frequency-dependent complex gain correction. The system is intended to produce delay and phase corrected dual-polarization channelized voltages in the frequency range 1-3 GHz with a nominal channel bandwidth of 1 MHz. We use an RFSoC 4x2 evaluation board with four analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) that can simultaneously sample two 1 GHz, dual-polarization bands. We use Xilinx Vitis HLS C++ to develop the required firmware as a set of customizable modules suitable for rapid prototyping. We performed hardware verification of the channel response of the critically sampled PFB and of the delay correction, showing both to be consistent with theoretical expectations. Furthermore, the board was installed at the Effelsberg 100-meter radio telescope where we performed commensal pulsar observations with the Effelsberg Direct Digitization backend, showing comparable performance. This work demonstrates the utility of high-level synthesis (HLS) languages in the development of high performance radio astronomy processing backends.</description>

      <title>Universal Spectral Tokenization via Self-Supervised Panchromatic Representation Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17959v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sequential scientific data span many resolutions and domains, and unifying them into a common representation is a key step toward developing foundation models for the sciences. Astronomical spectra exemplify this challenge: massive surveys have collected millions of spectra across a wide range of wavelengths and resolutions, yet analyses remain fragmented across spectral domains (e.g., optical vs. infrared) and object types (e.g., stars vs. galaxies), limiting the ability to pool information across datasets. We present a deep learning model that jointly learns from heterogeneous spectra in a self-supervised manner. Our universal spectral tokenizer processes spectra from a variety of object types and resolutions directly on their native wavelength grids, producing intrinsically aligned, homogeneous, and physically meaningful representations that can be efficiently adapted to achieve competitive performance across a range of downstream tasks. For the first time, we demonstrate that a single model can unify spectral data across resolutions and domains, suggesting that our model can serve as a powerful building block for foundation models in astronomy -- and potentially extend to other scientific domains with heterogeneous sequential data, such as climate and healthcare.</description>

      <title>Coherent Differential Imaging of high-contrast extended sources with VLT/SPHERE</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03518v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-contrast imaging relies on advanced coronagraphs and adaptive optics (AO) to attenuate the starlight. However, residual aberrations, especially non-common path aberrations between the AO channel and the coronagraph channel, limit the instrument performance. While post-processing techniques such as spectral or angular differential imaging (ADI) can partially address those issues, they suffer from self-subtraction and inefficiencies at small angular separations or when observations are conducted far from transit. We previously demonstrated the on-sky performance of coherent differential imaging (CDI), which offers a promising alternative. It allows for isolating coherent starlight residuals through speckle modulation, which can then be subtracted from the raw images during post-processing. This work aims to validate a CDI method on real science targets, demonstrating its effectiveness in imaging almost face-on circumstellar disks, which are typically challenging to retrieve with ADI. We temporally modulated the speckle field in VLT/SPHERE images, applying small phase offsets on the AO deformable mirror while observing stars surrounded by circumstellar material: HR 4796A, CPD-36 6759, HD 169142, and HD 163296. We hence separated the astrophysical scene from the stellar speckle field, whose lights are mutually incoherent. Combining a dozen of data frames and reference coronagraph point spread functions through a Karhunen-Lo\`eve image projection framework, we recover the circumstellar disks without the artifacts that are usually introduced by common post-processing algorithms (e.g., self-subtraction). The CDI method therefore represents a promising strategy for calibrating the effect of static and quasi-static aberrations in future direct imaging surveys. Indeed, it is efficient, does not require frequent telescope slewing, and does not introduce image artifacts to first order.</description>

      <title>Robustness of Neural Ratio and Posterior Estimators to Distributional Shifts for Population-Level Dark Matter Analysis in Strong Gravitational Lensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05905v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the robustness of Neural Ratio Estimators (NREs) and Neural Posterior Estimators (NPEs) to distributional shifts in the context of measuring the abundance of dark matter subhalos using strong gravitational lensing data. While these data-driven inference frameworks can be accurate on test data from the same distribution as the training sets, in real applications, it is expected that simulated training data and true observational data will differ in their distributions. We explore the behavior of a trained NRE and trained sequential NPEs to estimate the population-level parameters of dark matter subhalos from a large sample of images of strongly lensed galaxies with test data presenting distributional shifts within and beyond the bounds of the training distribution in the nuisance parameters (e.g., the background source morphology). While our results show that NREs and NPEs perform well when tested perfectly in distribution, they exhibit significant biases when confronted with slight deviations from the examples seen in the training distribution. This indicates the necessity for caution when applying NREs and NPEs to real astrophysical data, where high-dimensional underlying distributions are not perfectly known.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15893v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutron stars (NSs) probe the high-density regime of the nuclear equation of state (EOS). However, inferring the EOS from observations of NSs is a computationally challenging task. In this work, we efficiently solve this inverse problem by leveraging differential programming in two ways. First, we enable full Bayesian inference in under one hour of wall time on a GPU by using gradient-based samplers, without requiring pre-trained machine learning emulators. Moreover, we demonstrate efficient scaling to high-dimensional parameter spaces. Second, we introduce a novel gradient-based optimization scheme that recovers the EOS of a given NS mass-radius curve. We demonstrate how our framework can reveal consistencies or tensions between nuclear physics and astrophysics. First, we show how the breakdown density of a metamodel description of the EOS can be determined from NS observations. Second, we demonstrate how degeneracies in EOS modeling using nuclear empirical parameters can influence the inverse problem during gradient-based optimization. Looking ahead, our approach opens up new theoretical studies of the relation between NS properties and the EOS, while effectively tackling the data analysis challenges brought by future detectors.</description>

      <title>Enabling Early Transient Discovery in LSST via Difference Imaging with DECam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22156v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present SLIDE, a pipeline that enables transient discovery in data from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), using archival images from the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) as templates for difference imaging. We apply this pipeline to the recently released Data Preview 1 (DP1; the first public release of Rubin commissioning data) and search for transients in the resulting difference images. The image subtraction, photometry extraction, and transient detection are all performed on the Rubin Science Platform. We demonstrate that SLIDE effectively extracts clean photometry by circumventing poor or missing LSST templates. We identified 29 previously unreported transients, 12 of which would not have been detected based on the DP1 DiaObject catalog. SLIDE will be especially useful for transient analysis in the early years of LSST, when template coverage will be largely incomplete or when templates may be contaminated by transients present at the time of acquisition. We present multiband light curves for a sample of known transients, along with new transient candidates identified through our search. Finally, we discuss the prospects of applying this pipeline during the main LSST survey. Our pipeline is broadly applicable and will support studies of all transients with slowly evolving phases.</description>

Abstract: The Vera C. Rubin Observatory will soon survey the southern sky, delivering a depth and sky coverage that is unprecedented in time domain astronomy. As part of commissioning, Data Preview 1 (DP1) has been released. It comprises a LSSTComCam observing campaign between November and December 2024 with multi-band imaging of seven fields, covering roughly 0.4 square degrees each, providing a first glimpse into the data products that will become available once the Legacy Survey of Space and Time begins. In this work, we search three fields for extragalactic transients. We identify eight new likely supernovae, and three known ones from a sample of 369,644 difference image analysis objects. Photometric classification using Superphot+ assigns sub-classes with &gt;95% confidence to only one SN Ia and one SN II in this sample. Our findings are in agreement with supernova detection rate predictions of $15\pm4$ supernovae from simulations using simsurvey. The supernova detection rate in the data is possibly affected by the lack of suitable templates. Nevertheless, this work demonstrates the quality of the data products delivered in DP1 and indicates that the Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) is well placed to fulfill its discovery potential in time domain astronomy.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Early Universe with Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22018v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hydrogen is the most abundant element in our Universe. The first generation of stars and galaxies produced photons that ionized hydrogen gas, driving a cosmological event known as the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). The upcoming Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO) will map the distribution of neutral hydrogen during this era, aiding in the study of the properties of these first-generation objects. Extracting astrophysical information will be challenging, as SKAO will produce a tremendous amount of data where the hydrogen signal will be contaminated with undesired foreground contamination and instrumental systematics. To address this, we develop the latest deep learning techniques to extract information from the 2D power spectra of the hydrogen signal expected from SKAO. We apply a series of neural network models to these measurements and quantify their ability to predict the history of cosmic hydrogen reionization, which is connected to the increasing number and efficiency of early photon sources. We show that the study of the early Universe benefits from modern deep learning technology. In particular, we demonstrate that dedicated machine learning algorithms can achieve more than a $0.95$ $R^2$ score on average in recovering the reionization history. This enables accurate and precise cosmological and astrophysical inference of structure formation in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Giant Planet Evolution with MESA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23678v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The evolution of gaseous planets is a complex process influenced by various physical parameters and processes. In this study, we present critical modifications to the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) code to enhance its applicability to giant planet modelling. We introduce an equation of state specifically tailored for materials at planetary conditions. The equation of state considers the thermodynamic properties of hydrogen-helium mixtures and heavy elements, improving the accuracy of internal structure calculations. We also present modifications to the radiative opacity to allow the modelling of grains, clouds and opacity windows. Furthermore, we refine the treatment of convective mixing processes in MESA to better replicate convective mixing with the presence of composition gradients. Finally, we add a treatment for helium rain and settling. These modifications aim to enhance the predictive capabilities of MESA for giant planet evolution and are publicly available. We hope that these improvements will lead to a deeper understanding of giant planet evolution in the solar system and beyond.</description>
