      <title>Empirical Analysis of the Model-Free Valuation Approach: Hedging Gaps, Conservatism, and Trading Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the quality of model-free valuation approaches for financial derivatives by systematically evaluating the difference between model-free super-hedging strategies and the realized payoff of financial derivatives using historical option prices from several constituents of the S&amp;P 500 between 2018 and 2022.
  Our study allows in particular to describe the realized gap between payoff and model-free hedging strategy empirically so that we can quantify to which degree model-free approaches are overly conservative. Our results imply that the model-free hedging approach is only marginally more conservative than industry-standard models such as the Heston-model while being model-free at the same time.
  This finding, its statistical description and the model-independence of the hedging approach enable us to construct an explicit trading strategy which, as we demonstrate, can be profitably applied in financial markets, and additionally possesses the desirable feature with an explicit control of its downside risk due to its model-free construction preventing losses pathwise.</description>

      <title>Risk-Neutral Pricing of Random-Expiry Options Using Trinomial Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random-expiry options are nontraditional derivative contracts that may expire early based on a random event. We develop a methodology for pricing these options using a trinomial tree, where the middle path is interpreted as early expiry. We establish that this approach is free of arbitrage, derive its continuous-time limit, and show how it may be implemented numerically in an efficient manner.</description>

      <title>Sizing the Risk: Kelly, VIX, and Hybrid Approaches in Put-Writing on Index Options</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines systematic put-writing strategies applied to S&amp;P 500 Index options, with a focus on position sizing as a key determinant of long-term performance. Despite the well-documented volatility risk premium, where implied volatility exceeds realized volatility, the practical implementation of short-dated volatility-selling strategies remains underdeveloped in the literature. This study evaluates three position sizing approaches: the Kelly criterion, VIX-based volatility regime scaling, and a novel hybrid method combining both. Using SPXW options with expirations from 0 to 5 days, the analysis explores a broad design space, including moneyness levels, volatility estimators, and memory horizons. Results show that ultra-short-dated, far out-of-the-money options deliver superior risk-adjusted returns. The hybrid sizing method consistently balances return generation with robust drawdown control, particularly under low-volatility conditions such as those seen in 2024. The study offers new insights into volatility harvesting, introducing a dynamic sizing framework that adapts to shifting market regimes. It also contributes practical guidance for constructing short-dated option strategies that are robust across market environments. These findings have direct applications for institutional investors seeking to enhance portfolio efficiency through systematic exposure to volatility premia.</description>

      <title>Bimodal Dynamics of the Artificial Limit Order Book Stock Exchange with Autonomous Traders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the bifurcative dynamics of an artificial stock market exchange (ASME) with endogenous, myopic traders interacting through a limit order book (LOB). We showed that agent-based price dynamics possess intrinsic bistability, which is not a result of randomness but an emergent property of micro-level trading rules, where even identical initial conditions lead to qualitatively different long-run price equilibria: a deterministic zero-price state and a persistent positive-price equilibrium. The study also identifies a metastable region with elevated volatility between the basins of attraction and reveals distinct transient behaviors for trajectories converging to these equilibria. Furthermore, we observe that the system is neither entirely regular nor fully chaotic. By highlighting the emergence of divergent market outcomes from uniform beginnings, this work contributes a novel perspective on the inherent path dependence and complex dynamics of artificial stock markets.</description>

      <title>On Quantum Ambiguity and Potential Exponential Computational Speed-Ups to Solving Dynamic Asset Pricing Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01479v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate quantum computing solutions to a large class of dynamic nonlinear asset pricing models using algorithms, in theory exponentially more efficient than classical ones, which leverage the quantum properties of superposition and entanglement. The equilibrium asset pricing solution is a quantum state. We introduce quantum decision-theoretic foundations of ambiguity and model/parameter uncertainty to deal with model selection.</description>

      <title>Explicit local volatility formula for Cheyette-type interest rate models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23876v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the approximation of the local volatility function in the Cheyette interest rate model. Its main contribution is an explicit analytical formula for approximating local volatility, derived by extending the classical Dupire framework to interest rate models. In particular, an implicit Dupire-like expression for local volatility is first derived for options written on the short rate. This expression is then approximated using a combination of perturbation methods and probabilistic techniques, resulting in a formula expressed in terms of time and strike derivatives of the Bachelier implied variance. The final formula naturally extends to multi-factor Cheyette models and provides a practical tool for model calibration.</description>
