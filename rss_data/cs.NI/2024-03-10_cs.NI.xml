      <title>An End-to-End Pipeline Perspective on Video Streaming in Best-Effort Networks: A Survey and Tutorial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video streaming continues to captivate attention of users and service providers, dominate in Internet traffic, and form a vibrant research field. Taking a pragmatic approach to reviewing recent research in the field, this paper considers the most dominant streaming paradigm, the main aspects of which include transmission of two-dimensional videos over the best-effort Internet, support from content delivery networks, and client-side bitrate adaptation. To make the survey more accessible, we incorporate extensive tutorial materials. In contrast with the siloed approaches of existing surveys, our paper holistically covers the end-to-end streaming pipeline from video capture and upload for server processing to distribution for playback on diverse user devices. Reflecting the practical interests of respective stakeholders, our survey presents a novel perspective on end-to-end streaming and sheds light on the relationships and interactions between its ingestion, processing, and distribution stages. At each stage, we classify streaming designs in regard to their methodology depending on whether intuition, theory, or machine learning serves as a methodological basis for their core contribution. In addition to tasks confined to a single stage, the survey also examines transversal topics such as coding, super resolution, and quality of experience. After surveying more than 200 papers, we synthesize current trends and project future directions in video streaming research.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Road User Radio-Frequency Exposure Levels in an Urban Environment from Vehicular Antennas and the Infrastructure in ITS-G5 5.9 GHz Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aims to investigate the variability of exposure levels among road users generated in a realistic urban scenario by Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communication technologies operating at 5.9 GHz. The exposure levels were evaluated in terms of whole-body Specific Absorption Rate (wbSAR) [W/kg] in three different human models, ranging from children to adults. We calculated the electromagnetic field exposure level generated by V2V and V2I using raytracing and we assessed wbSAR resulting in urban exposure scenarios with an increasing number of transmitting antennas. Whole-body SAR was generally very low, on the order of 10^-4 W/kg. The maximum wbSAR, of 4.9x10^-4 W/kg, was obtained in the worst-case exposure condition comprising more than one transmitting vehicle and was found in the adult model for a distance within 10 m from the transmitting cars. We found that the height of the human model highly impacted the exposure level. Namely, the child (which is the shortest human model) was generally much less exposed than adults. All the wbSAR values found by varying the number of transmitting antennas, the distance of the road user from the antennas, and the type of human model (adult vs. child) were very well below the limits set by the ICNIRP and IEEE guidelines of 0.08 W/kg for human exposure in the 100 kHz - 300 GHz range.</description>

      <title>ADROIT6G DAI-driven Open and Programmable Architecture for 6G Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the upcoming 6G era, mobile networks must deal with more challenging applications (e.g., holographic telepresence and immersive communication) and meet far more stringent application requirements stemming along the edge-cloud continuum. These new applications will create an elevated level of expectations on performance, reliability, ubiquity, trustworthiness, security, openness, and sustainability, pushing the boundaries of innovation and driving transformational change across the architecture of future mobile networks. Towards this end, ADROIT6G proposes a set of disruptive innovations with a clear vision on setting a 6G network architecture that can be tailored to the requirements of innovative applications and match the ambitious KPIs set for 6G networks. More specifically, the key transformations that ADROIT6G considers essential to 6G network evolution are: i) AI/ML-powered optimisations across the network, exploring solutions in the "Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI)" domain for high performance and automation; ii) Transforming to fully cloud-native network software, which can be implemented across various edge-cloud platforms, with security built integrally into the network user plan; and iii) Software driven, zero-touch operations and ultimately automation of every aspect of the network and the services it delivers.</description>

      <title>RIS-aided multi-hop backhauling for 5G/6G UAV-assisted access points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drones are envisaged as an important part of the future 6G systems. With the possibility of their fast deployment they provide additional connectivity options in form of a hotspot. However, typically in such a use case they require provisioning of a wireless backhaul link to facilitate their proper operation, which might be a challenging task in urban environment. One of the possible ways to connect such nodes is to use the integrate access and backhaul (IAB) approach, where part of the spectrum dedicated for user access at the base station is used for wireless backhauling. Thus, in this work we consider the problem of establishing a multi-hop wireless backhaul link following the IAB concept, with the aid of drone relay stations (DRSs) and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). We formulate the problem of coverage improvement with fixed number of relays assuming certain throughput requirements on the backhaul. We show with simulations that the use of RISs allows for improvement of coverage in such a scenario or reduction in the number of involved nodes to provide the required backhaul.</description>

  Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, due to the possibility of their fast deployment, are considered an essential element of the future wireless 6G communication systems. However, an essential enabler for their use as access points is to provide a sufficient throughput wireless backhaul link. Thus, in this paper we consider the aspect of extension of network coverage with the use of drone-based relaying and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) for backhauling. Presented results of simulation experiments indicate that the use of RIS allows for significant improvement of network coverage without the need to use additional relays.</description>

      <title>User Connection and Resource Allocation Optimization in Blockchain Empowered Metaverse over 6G Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The convergence of blockchain, Metaverse, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) brings transformative digital opportunities alongside challenges like privacy and resource management. Addressing these, we focus on optimizing user connectivity and resource allocation in an NFT-centric and blockchain-enabled Metaverse in this paper. Through user work-offloading, we optimize data tasks, user connection parameters, and server computing frequency division. In the resource allocation phase, we optimize communication-computation resource distributions, including bandwidth, transmit power, and computing frequency. We introduce the trust-cost ratio (TCR), a pivotal measure combining trust scores from users' resources and server history with delay and energy costs. This balance ensures sustained user engagement and trust. The DASHF algorithm, central to our approach, encapsulates the Dinkelbach algorithm, alternating optimization, semidefinite relaxation (SDR), the Hungarian method, and a novel fractional programming technique from a recent IEEE JSAC paper [2]. The most challenging part of DASHF is to rewrite an optimization problem as Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Programming (QCQP) via carefully designed transformations, in order to be solved by SDR and the Hungarian algorithm. Extensive simulations validate the DASHF algorithm's efficacy, revealing critical insights for enhancing blockchain-Metaverse applications, especially with NFTs.</description>

      <title>RIS-empowered Topology Control for Distributed Learning in Urban Air Mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Urban Air Mobility (UAM) expands vehicles from the ground to the near-ground space, envisioned as a revolution for transportation systems. Comprehensive scene perception is the foundation for autonomous aerial driving. However, UAM encounters the intelligent perception challenge: high perception learning requirements conflict with the limited sensors and computing chips of flying cars. To overcome the challenge, federated learning (FL) and other collaborative learning have been proposed to enable resource-limited devices to conduct onboard deep learning (DL) collaboratively. But traditional collaborative learning like FL relies on a central integrator for DL model aggregation, which is difficult to deploy in dynamic environments. The fully decentralized learning schemes may be the intuitive solution while the convergence of distributed learning cannot be guaranteed. Accordingly, this paper explores reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) empowered distributed learning, taking account of topological attributes to facilitate the learning performance with convergence guarantee. We propose several FL topological criteria for optimizing the transmission delay and convergence rate by exploiting the Laplacian matrix eigenvalues of the communication network. Subsequently, we innovatively leverage the RIS link modification ability to remold the current network according to the proposed topological criteria. This paper rethinks the functions of RIS from the perspective of the network layer. Furthermore, a deep deterministic policy gradient-based RIS phase shift control algorithm is developed to construct or deconstruct the network links simultaneously to reshape the communication network. Simulation experiments are conducted over MobileNet-based multi-view learning to verify the efficiency of the distributed FL framework.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Split Learning over Energy-Constrained Wireless Edge Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Split learning (SL) is a promising approach for training artificial intelligence (AI) models, in which devices collaborate with a server to train an AI model in a distributed manner, based on a same fixed split point. However, due to the device heterogeneity and variation of channel conditions, this way is not optimal in training delay and energy consumption. In this paper, we design an adaptive split learning (ASL) scheme which can dynamically select split points for devices and allocate computing resource for the server in wireless edge networks. We formulate an optimization problem to minimize the average training latency subject to long-term energy consumption constraint. The difficulties in solving this problem are the lack of future information and mixed integer programming (MIP). To solve it, we propose an online algorithm leveraging the Lyapunov theory, named OPEN, which decomposes it into a new MIP problem only with the current information. Then, a two-layer optimization method is proposed to solve the MIP problem. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the ASL scheme can reduce the average training delay and energy consumption by 53.7% and 22.1%, respectively, as compared to the existing SL schemes.</description>

      <title>An Open, Programmable, Multi-vendor 5G O-RAN Testbed with NVIDIA ARC and OpenAirInterface</title>

Abstract: The transition of fifth generation (5G) cellular systems to softwarized, programmable, and intelligent networks depends on successfully enabling public and private 5G deployments that are (i) fully software-driven and (ii) with a performance at par with that of traditional monolithic systems. This requires hardware acceleration to scale the Physical (PHY) layer performance, end-to-end integration and testing, and careful planning of the Radio Frequency (RF) environment. In this paper, we describe how the X5G testbed at Northeastern University has addressed these challenges through the first 8-node network deployment of the NVIDIA Aerial RAN CoLab (ARC), with the Aerial Software Development Kit (SDK) for the PHY layer, accelerated on Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), and through its integration with higher layers from the OpenAirInterface (OAI) open-source project through the Small Cell Forum (SCF) Functional Application Platform Interface (FAPI). We discuss software integration, the network infrastructure, and a digital twin framework for RF planning. We then profile the performance with up to 4 Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) smartphones for each base station with iPerf and video streaming applications, measuring a cell rate higher than 500 Mbps in downlink and 45 Mbps in uplink.</description>
