      <title>On two systems of Burger's type arising in nonlinear wave interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we study the well-posedness of two systems of Burgers type arising in nonlinear wave interactions. The first model describes the interaction of a Burger's bore with the classical Korteweg-de Vries equation while the second exemplify the interaction of weak sound waves and entropy waves with small amplitudes. For the former, we show the local existence and uniqueness of solutions in Sobolev spaces and Wiener-type spaces. For the latter, we provide an elementary proof of finite time singularity.</description>

      <title>On a coupled-physics transmission eigenvalue problem and its spectral properties with applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a transmission eigenvalue problem that couples the principles of acoustics and elasticity. This problem naturally arises when studying fluid-solid interactions and constructing bubbly-elastic structures to create metamaterials. We uncover intriguing local geometric structures of the transmission eigenfunctions near the corners of the domains, under typical regularity conditions. As applications, we present novel unique identifiability and visibility results for an inverse problem associated with an acoustoelastic system, which hold practical significance.</description>

      <title>Removable singularity of (-1)-homogeneous solutions of stationary Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the removable singularity problem for $(-1)$-homogeneous solutions of the three-dimensional incompressible stationary Navier-Stokes equations with singular rays. We prove that any local $(-1)$-homogeneous solution $u$ near a potential singular ray from the origin, which passes through a point $P$ on the unit sphere $\mathbb{S}^2$, can be smoothly extended across $P$ on $\mathbb{S}^2$, provided that $u=o(\ln \text{dist} (x, P))$ on $\mathbb{S}^2$. The result is optimal in the sense that for any $\alpha&gt;0$, there exists a local $(-1)$-homogeneous solution near $P$ on $\mathbb{S}^2$, such that $\lim_{x\in \mathbb{S}^2, x\to P}|u(x)|/\ln |x'|=-\alpha$. Furthermore, we discuss the behavior of isolated singularities of $(-1)$-homogeneous solutions and provide examples from the literature that exhibit varying behaviors. We also present an existence result of solutions with any finite number of singular points located anywhere on $\mathbb{S}^2$.</description>

      <title>Hypercomplex Dynamics and Turbulent Flows in Sobolev and Besov Functional Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a rigorous study of advanced functional spaces, with a focus on Sobolev and Besov spaces, to investigate key aspects of fluid dynamics, including the regularity of solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations, hypercomplex bifurcations, and turbulence. We offer a comprehensive analysis of Sobolev embedding theorems in fractional spaces and apply bifurcation theory within quaternionic dynamical systems to better understand the complex behaviors in fluid systems. Additionally, the research delves into energy dissipation mechanisms in turbulent flows through the framework of Besov spaces. Key mathematical tools, such as interpolation theory, Littlewood-Paley decomposition, and energy cascade models, are integrated to develop a robust theoretical approach to these problems. By addressing challenges related to the existence and smoothness of solutions, this work contributes to the ongoing exploration of the open Navier-Stokes problem, providing new insights into the intricate relationship between fluid dynamics and functional spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the persistency of quasi-periodic solutions to multi-dimensional nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equations (NLS) involving Gevrey smooth nonlinearity with an arbitrary Gevrey index $\alpha&gt;1$.
  By applying the Craig-Wayne-Bourgain (CWB) method, we establish the existence of quasi-periodic solutions that are Gevrey smooth with the same Gevrey index as the nonlinearity.</description>

      <title>Complex-valued solutions of the mKdV equations in generalized Fourier-Lebesgue spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the \emph{complex-valued} solutions to the Cauchy problem of the modified Korteweg-de Vries equation on the real line. To study the low-regularity problems, we introduce a generalized Fourier-Lebesgue space $\widehat{M}^{s}_{r,q}(\mathbb{R})$ that unifies the modulation spaces and the Fourier-Lebesgue spaces. We then prove sharp local well-posedness results in this space by perturbation arguments using $X^{s,b}$-type spaces. Our results improve the previous one in \cite{GV}.</description>

      <title>Numerical computation of generalized Wasserstein distances with applications to traffic model analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalized Wasserstein distances allow to quantitatively compare two continuous or atomic mass distributions with equal or different total mass. In this paper, we propose four numerical methods for the approximation of three different generalized Wasserstein distances introduced in the last years, giving some insights about their physical meaning. After that, we explore their usage in the context of the sensitivity analysis of differential models for traffic flow. The quantification of models sensitivity is obtained by computing the generalized Wasserstein distances between two (numerical) solutions corresponding to different inputs, including different boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>On $L^\infty$ stability for wave propagation and for linear inverse problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stability is a key property of both forward models and inverse problems, and depends on the norms considered in the relevant function spaces. For instance, stability estimates for hyperbolic partial differential equations are often based on energy conservation principles, and are therefore expressed in terms of $L^2$ norms. The focus of this paper is on stability with respect to the $L^\infty$ norm, which is more relevant to detect localized phenomena. The linear wave equation is not stable in $L^\infty$, and we design an alternative solution method based on the regularization of Fourier multipliers, which is stable in $L^\infty$. Furthermore, we show how these ideas can be extended to inverse problems, and design a regularization method for the inversion of compact operators that is stable in $L^\infty$. We also discuss the connection with the stability of deep neural networks modeled by hyperbolic PDEs.</description>

      <title>Generalized energy conservation for linear wave equations with time-dependent propagation speed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a wave equation with a time-dependent propagation speed, whose potential oscillations are controlled through bounds on its first and second derivatives and by limiting the integral of the difference with a fixed constant. We investigate when the wave equation exhibits generalized energy conservation (GEC), meaning that the energy of all solutions remains bounded for all times by a multiple of the initial energy. When GEC is not satisfied, we provide upper bounds for the growth of the energy.
  These upper bounds are derived by analyzing the growth of the Fourier components of the solution. Depending on the frequency and the time interval, different energy inequalities are employed to fully exploit our assumptions on the propagation speed.
  Finally, we present counterexamples that demonstrate the optimality of our upper bound estimates.</description>

      <title>Long time existence for a class of weakly transverse Boussinesq systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the existence on long time scales of the solutions to the Cauchy problem for a version of weakly transverse Boussinesq systems arising in the modeling of surface water waves. This system is much more complicated than the isotropic Boussinesq systems because dispersion is only present in the x-direction, leading to anisotropic eigenvalues in the linearized system. This anisotropic character leads to loss of y-derivatives for the solutions. To overcome this main difficulty our strategy is to symmetrize the system by introducing suitable good unknowns in the sense of [3].</description>

      <title>On the solvability of parameter-dependent elliptic functional BVPs on annular-like domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the existence of nontrivial solutions of parameter-dependent elliptic equations with deviated argument in annular-like domains in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, with $n\geq 2$, subject to functional boundary conditions. In particular we consider a boundary value problem that may be used to model heat-flow problems. We obtain an existence result by means of topological methods; in particular, we make use of a recent variant in affine cones of the celebrated Birkhoff--Kellogg theorem. Using an ODE argument, we illustrate in an example the applicability of our theoretical result.</description>

      <title>A quasilinear elliptic equation with absorption term and Hardy potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we study the positive solutions of the equation \begin{equation*} -\Delta _{p}u+\mu \frac{u^{p-1}}{\left\vert x\right\vert ^{p}}+\left\vert x\right\vert ^{\theta }u^{q}=0,\qquad x\in \mathbb{R}^{N}\backslash \left\{ 0\right\} \end{equation*}% where $\Delta _{p}u={div}(\left\vert \nabla u\right\vert ^{p-2}\nabla u) $ and $1&lt;p&lt;N,q&gt;p-1,\mu ,\theta \in \mathbb{R}.$ We give a complete description of the existence and the asymptotic behaviour of the solutions near the singularity $0,$ or in an exterior domain. We show that the global solutions $\mathbb{R}^{N}\backslash \left\{ 0\right\} $ are radial and give their expression according to the position of the Hardy coefficient $\mu $ with respect to the critical exponent $\mu _{0}=-(\frac{N-p}{p})^{p}.$ Our method consists into proving that any nonradial solution can be compared to a radial one, then making exhaustive radial study by phase-plane techniques. Our results are optimal, extending the known results when $\mu =0$ or $p=2$, with new simpler proofs.They make in evidence interesting phenomena of nonuniqueness when $\theta +p=0$, and of existence of locally constant solutions when moreover $p&gt;2$ .</description>

      <title>Gaussian upper heat kernel bounds and Faber-Krahn inequalities on graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the equivalence of relative Faber-Krahn inequalities and the conjunction of Gaussian upper heat kernel bounds and volume doubling on large scales on graphs. For the normalizing measure, we obtain their equivalence up to constants by imposing comparability of small balls and the vertex degree at their centers. Removing this comparability assumption on the cost of a local regularity condition entering the equivalence and allowing for a variable dimension lead to a further generalization. The variable dimension converges to the doubling dimension for increasing ball radius. If the counting measure or arbitrary measures are considered, the local regularity condition contains the vertex degree. Furthermore, correction functions for the Gaussian, doubling, and Faber-Krahn dimension depending on the vertex degree are introduced. For the Gaussian and doubling, the variable correction functions always tend to one at infinity. Moreover, the variable Faber-Krahn dimension can be related to the doubling dimension and the vertex degree growth.</description>

Abstract: This article is devoted to the study of local well-posedness for deep water waves with constant vorticity in two space dimensions on the real line. The water waves can be paralinearized and written as a quasilinear dispersive system of equations. By using the energy estimate and the Strichartz estimate, we show that for $s&gt; \frac{5}{4}$, the gravity-capillary water wave system with constant vorticity is locally well-posed in $\mathcal{H}^{s}(\mathbb{R})$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the appearance of spatial asymptotic expansions of solutions of the Navier-Stokes equation on $\mathbb{R}^n$. In particular, we prove that the Navier-Stokes equation is locally well-posed in a class of weighted Sobolev and asymptotic spaces. The solutions depend analytically on the initial data and time and (generically) develop non-trivial asymptotic terms as $|x|\to\infty$. In addition, the solutions have a spatial smoothing property that depends on the order of the asymptotic expansion.</description>

      <title>Reversal in the Stationary Prandtl Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.02845v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of an open set of data which exhibits \textit{reversal} and \textit{recirculation} for the stationary Prandtl equations (data is taken in an appropriately defined product space due to the simultaneous forward and backward causality in the problem). Reversal describes the development of the solution beyond the Goldstein singularity, and is characterized by the presence of (spatio-temporal) regions in which $u &gt; 0$ and $u &lt; 0$. The classical point of view of regarding the system as an evolution in the tangential direction completely breaks down past the Goldstein singularity. Instead, to describe the development, we view the problem as a \textit{mixed-type, non-local, quasilinear, free-boundary} problem across the curve $\{ u = 0 \}$. In a well-chosen nonlinear and self-similar coordinate system, we extract a coupled system for the bulk solution and several modulation variables describing the free boundary. Our work combines and introduces techniques from mixed-type problems, free-boundary problems, modulation theory, harmonic analysis, and spectral theory. As a byproduct, we obtain several new cancellations in the Prandtl equations, and develop several new estimates tailored to singular integral operators with Airy type kernels.</description>

      <title>Strichartz estimates for the 2D and 3D massless Dirac-Coulomb equations and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.14904v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we continue the analysis of the dispersive properties of the 2D and 3D massless Dirac-Coulomb equations that has been started in arXiv:1503.00945 and arXiv:2101.07185. We prove a priori estimates of the solution of the mentioned systems, in particular Strichartz estimates with an additional angular regularity, exploiting the tools developed in the previous works. As an application, we show local well-posedness results for a Dirac-Coulomb equation perturbed with Hartree-type nonlinearities.</description>

      <title>Self-similar algebraic spiral solution of 2-D incompressible Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.05182v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the existence of self-similar algebraic spiral solutions for 2-D incompressible Euler equations for the initial vorticity of the form $|y|^{-\frac1\mu}\ \mathring{\omega}(\theta)$ with $\mu&gt;\frac12$ and $\mathring{\omega}\in L^1(\mathbb T)$ satisfying $m$-fold symmetry ($m\geq 2$) and a dominant condition. As an important application, we prove the existence of weak solution when $\mathring{\omega}$ is a Radon measure on $\mathbb T$ with $m$-fold symmetry, which is related to the vortex sheet solution.</description>

      <title>Comparison of viscosity solutions for a class of second order PDEs on the Wasserstein space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05040v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a comparison result for viscosity solutions of second order parabolic partial differential equations in the Wasserstein space. The comparison is valid for semisolutions that are Lipschitz continuous in the measure in a Fourier-Wasserstein metric and uniformly continuous in time. The class of equations we consider is motivated by Mckean-Vlasov control problems with common noise and filtering problems. The proof of comparison relies on a novel version of Ishii's lemma, which is tailor-made for the class of equations we consider.</description>

      <title>Stability of homogeneous equilibria of the Hartree-Fock equation, for its equivalent formulation for random fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Hartree-Fock equation admits homogeneous states that model infinitely many particles at equilibrium. We prove their asymptotic stability in large dimensions, under assumptions on the linearised operator. Perturbations are moreover showed to scatter to linear waves. We obtain this result for the equivalent formulation of the Hartree-Fock equation in the framework of random fields. The main novelty is to study the full Hartree-Fock equation, including for the first time the exchange term in the study of these stationary solutions.</description>

      <title>Malliavin Calculus for the stochastic heat equation and results on the density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the one-dimensional stochastic heat equation with nonlinear Lipschitz coefficients and Dirichlet boundary conditions. We apply Malliavin calculus to this equation; we show that the solution $u \in L_{1,2}$ and provide a different proof for the existence of a density for $u$ that relies on a localization argument. This type of localization has been used before for other SPDE. However, our proof for the existence of a density for the solution to the stochastic heat equation follows a different strategy and is more involved due to new difficulties arising with the heat kernel. We also prove the existence of a density for the supremum of $u$ and that it belongs in $D_{1,2}$.</description>

      <title>Instability of quadratic band degeneracies and the emergence of Dirac points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05886v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider the Schr\"{o}dinger operator $H = -\Delta + V$, where the potential $V$ is real, $\mathbb{Z}^2$-periodic, and additionally invariant under the symmetry group of the square. We show that, under typical small linear deformations of $V$, the quadratic band degeneracy points occurring over the high-symmetry quasimomentum $\boldsymbol{M}$ (see [27, 28]) each split into two separated degeneracies over perturbed quasimomenta $\boldsymbol{D}^+$ and $\boldsymbol{D}^-$, and that these degeneracies are Dirac points. The local character of the degenerate dispersion surfaces about the emergent Dirac points are tilted, elliptical cones. Correspondingly, the dynamics of wavepackets spectrally localized near either $\boldsymbol{D}^+$ or $\boldsymbol{D}^-$ are governed by a system of Dirac equations with an advection term. Symmetry-breaking perturbations and induced band topology are also discussed.</description>
