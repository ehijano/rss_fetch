      <title>On the existence of factors intersecting sets of cycles in regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recent result by Kardo\v{s}, M\'a\v{c}ajov\'a and Zerafa [J. Comb. Theory, Ser. B. 160 (2023) 1--14] related to the famous Berge-Fulkerson conjecture implies that given an arbitrary set of odd pairwise edge-disjoint cycles, say $\mathcal O$, in a bridgeless cubic graph, there exists a $1$-factor intersecting all cycles in $\mathcal O$ in at least one edge. This remarkable result opens up natural generalizations in the case of an $r$-regular graph $G$ and a $t$-factor $F$, with $r$ and $t$ being positive integers. In this paper, we start the study of this problem by proving necessary and sufficient conditions on $G$, $t$ and $r$ to assure the existence of a suitable $F$ for any possible choice of the set $\mathcal O$. First of all, we show that $G$ needs to be $2$-connected. Under this additional assumption, we highlight how the ratio $\frac{t}{r}$ seems to play a crucial role in assuring the existence of a $t$-factor $F$ with the required properties by proving that $\frac{t}{r} \geq \frac{1}{3}$ is a further necessary condition. We suspect that this condition is also sufficient, and we confirm it in the case $\frac{t}{r}=\frac{1}{3}$, generalizing the case $t=1$ and $r=3$ proved by Kardo\v{s}, M\'a\v{c}ajov\'a, Zerafa, and in the case $\frac{t}{r}=\frac{1}{2}$ with $t$ even. Finally, we provide further results in the case of cycles of arbitrary length.</description>

      <title>Bounded degree QBF and positional games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of SAT and its variants has provided numerous NP-complete problems, from which most NP-hardness results were derived. Due to the NP-hardness of SAT, adding constraints to either specify a more precise NP-complete problem or to obtain a tractable one helps better understand the complexity class of several problems. In 1984, Tovey proved that bounded-degree SAT is also NP-complete, thereby providing a tool for performing NP-hardness reductions even with bounded parameters, when the size of the reduction gadget is a function of the variable degree. In this work, we initiate a similar study for QBF, the quantified version of SAT. We prove that, like SAT, the truth value of a maximum degree two quantified formula is polynomial-time computable. However, surprisingly, while the truth value of a 3-regular 3-SAT formula can be decided in polynomial time, it is PSPACE-complete for a 3-regular QBF formula. A direct consequence of these results is that Avoider-Enforcer and Client-Waiter positional games are PSPACE-complete when restricted to bounded-degree hypergraphs. To complete the study, we also show that Maker-Breaker and Maker-Maker positional games are PSPACE-complete for bounded-degree hypergraphs.</description>

      <title>Insights from a workshop on gamification of research in mathematics and computer science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Can outreach inspire and lead to research and vice versa? In this work, we introduce our approach to the gamification of research in mathematics and computer science through three illustrative examples. We discuss our primary motivations and provide insights into what makes our proposed gamification effective for three research topics in discrete and computational geometry and topology: (1) DominatriX, an art gallery problem involving polyominoes with rooks and queens; (2) Cubical Sliding Puzzles, an exploration of the discrete configuration spaces of sliding puzzles on the $d$-cube with topological obstructions; and (3) The Fence Challenge, a participatory isoperimetric problem based on polyforms. Additionally, we report on the collaborative development of the game Le Carr\'e du Diable, inspired by The Fence Challenge and created during the workshop Let's talk about outreach!, held in October 2022 in Les Diablerets, Switzerland. All of our outreach encounters and creations are designed and curated with an inclusive culture and a strong commitment to welcoming the most diverse audience possible.</description>

      <title>Guaranteed Bounds on Posterior Distributions of Discrete Probabilistic Programs with Loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of bounding the posterior distribution of discrete probabilistic programs with unbounded support, loops, and conditioning. Loops pose the main difficulty in this setting: even if exact Bayesian inference is possible, the state of the art requires user-provided loop invariant templates. By contrast, we aim to find guaranteed bounds, which sandwich the true distribution. They are fully automated, applicable to more programs and provide more provable guarantees than approximate sampling-based inference. Since lower bounds can be obtained by unrolling loops, the main challenge is upper bounds, and we attack it in two ways. The first is called residual mass semantics, which is a flat bound based on the residual probability mass of a loop. The approach is simple, efficient, and has provable guarantees.
  The main novelty of our work is the second approach, called geometric bound semantics. It operates on a novel family of distributions, called eventually geometric distributions (EGDs), and can bound the distribution of loops with a new form of loop invariants called contraction invariants. The invariant synthesis problem reduces to a system of polynomial inequality constraints, which is a decidable problem with automated solvers. If a solution exists, it yields an exponentially decreasing bound on the whole distribution, and can therefore bound moments and tail asymptotics as well, not just probabilities as in the first approach.
  Both semantics enjoy desirable theoretical properties. In particular, we prove soundness and convergence, i.e. the bounds converge to the exact posterior as loops are unrolled further. On the practical side, we describe Diabolo, a fully-automated implementation of both semantics, and evaluate them on a variety of benchmarks from the literature, demonstrating their general applicability and the utility of the resulting bounds.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Genus Algorithm Based on Graph Rotations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of determining the minimal genus of a given finite connected graph. We present an algorithm which, for an arbitrary graph $G$ with $n$ vertices, determines the orientable genus of $G$ in $\mathcal{O}({2^{(n^2+3n)}}/{n^{(n+1)}})$ steps. This algorithm avoids the difficulties that many other genus algorithms have with handling bridge placements which is a well-known issue. The algorithm has a number of properties that make it useful for practical use: it is simple to implement, it outputs the faces of the optimal embedding, it outputs a proof certificate for verification and it can be used to obtain upper and lower bounds. We illustrate the algorithm by determining the genus of the $(3,12)$ cage (which is 17); other graphs are also considered.</description>

      <title>On complete classes of valuated matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.06961v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterize a rich class of valuated matroids, called R-minor valuated matroids that includes the indicator functions of matroids, and is closed under operations such as taking minors, duality, and induction by network. We exhibit a family of valuated matroids that are not R-minor based on sparse paving matroids. Valuated matroids are inherently related to gross substitute valuations in mathematical economics. By the same token we refute the Matroid Based Valuation Conjecture by Ostrovsky and Paes Leme (Theoretical Economics 2015) asserting that every gross substitute valuation arises from weighted matroid rank functions by repeated applications of merge and endowment operations. Our result also has implications in the context of Lorentzian polynomials: it reveals the limitations of known construction operations.</description>

      <title>Complexity of Maker-Breaker Games on Edge Sets of Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.10972v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the algorithmic complexity of Maker-Breaker games played on the edge sets of general graphs. We mainly consider the perfect matching game and the $H$-game. Maker wins if she claims the edges of a perfect matching in the first, and a copy of a fixed graph $H$ in the second. We prove that deciding who wins the perfect matching game and the $H$-game is PSPACE-complete, even for the latter in small-diameter graphs if $H$ is a tree. Toward finding the smallest graph $H$ for which the $H$-game is PSPACE-complete, we also prove that such an $H$ of order 51 and size 57 exists.
  We then give several positive results for the $H$-game. As the $H$-game is already PSPACE-complete when $H$ is a tree, we mainly consider the case where $H$ belongs to a subclass of trees. In particular, we design two linear-time algorithms, both based on structural characterizations, to decide the winners of the $P_4$-game in general graphs and the $K_{1,\ell}$-game in trees. Then, we prove that the $K_{1,\ell}$-game in any graph, and the $H$-game in trees are both FPT parameterized by the length of the game, notably adding to the short list of games with this property, which is of independent interest.
  Another natural direction to take is to consider the $H$-game when $H$ is a cycle. While we were unable to resolve this case, we prove that the related arboricity-$k$ game is polynomial-time solvable. In particular, when $k=2$, Maker wins this game if she claims the edges of any cycle.</description>

      <title>Computational complexity of the Weisfeiler-Leman dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Weisfeiler-Leman dimension of a graph $G$ is the least number $k$ such that the $k$-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm distinguishes $G$ from every other non-isomorphic graph. The dimension is a standard measure of the descriptive complexity of a graph and recently finds various applications in particular in the context of machine learning. In this paper, we study the computational complexity of computing the Weisfeiler-Leman dimension. We observe that in general the problem of deciding whether the Weisfeiler-Leman dimension of $G$ is at most $k$ is NP-hard. This is also true for the more restricted problem with graphs of color multiplicity at most 4. Therefore, we study parameterized versions of the problem. We give, for each fixed $k\geq 2$, a polynomial-time algorithm that decides whether the Weisfeiler-Leman dimension of a given graph of color multiplicity at most $5$ is at most $k$. Moreover, we show that for these color multiplicities this is optimal in the sense that this problem is P-hard under logspace-uniform $\text{AC}_0$-reductions. Furthermore, for each larger bound $c$ on the color classes and each fixed $k\geq 2$, we provide a polynomial-time decision algorithm for the abelian case, that is, for structures of which each color class has an abelian automorphism group.
  While the graph classes we consider may seem quite restrictive, graphs with $4$-bounded abelian colors include CFI-graphs and multipedes, which form the basis of almost all known hard instances and lower bounds related to the Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic aspects of semistability of quiver representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06493v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the semistability of quiver representations from an algorithmic perspective. We present efficient algorithms for several fundamental computational problems on the semistability of quiver representations: deciding the semistability and $\sigma$-semistability, finding the maximizers of King's criterion, and computing the Harder--Narasimhan filtration. We also investigate a class of polyhedral cones defined by the linear system in King's criterion, which we refer to as King cones. For rank-one representations, we demonstrate that these King cones can be encoded by submodular flow polytopes, enabling us to decide the $\sigma$-semistability in strongly polynomial time. Our approach employs submodularity in quiver representations, which may be of independent interest.</description>
