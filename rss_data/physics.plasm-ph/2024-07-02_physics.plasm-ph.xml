      <title>Understanding Large-Scale Plasma Simulation Challenges for Fusion Energy on Supercomputers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding plasma instabilities is essential for achieving sustainable fusion energy, with large-scale plasma simulations playing a crucial role in both the design and development of next-generation fusion energy devices and the modelling of industrial plasmas. To achieve sustainable fusion energy, it is essential to accurately model and predict plasma behavior under extreme conditions, requiring sophisticated simulation codes capable of capturing the complex interaction between plasma dynamics, magnetic fields, and material surfaces. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive HPC analysis of two prominent plasma simulation codes, BIT1 and JOREK, to advance understanding of plasma behavior in fusion energy applications. Our focus is on evaluating JOREK's computational efficiency and scalability for simulating non-linear MHD phenomena in tokamak fusion devices. The motivation behind this work stems from the urgent need to advance our understanding of plasma instabilities in magnetically confined fusion devices. Enhancing JOREK's performance on supercomputers improves fusion plasma code predictability, enabling more accurate modelling and faster optimization of fusion designs, thereby contributing to sustainable fusion energy. In prior studies, we analysed BIT1, a massively parallel Particle-in-Cell (PIC) code for studying plasma-material interactions in fusion devices. Our investigations into BIT1's computational requirements and scalability on advanced supercomputing architectures yielded valuable insights. Through detailed profiling and performance analysis, we have identified the primary bottlenecks and implemented optimization strategies, significantly enhancing parallel performance. This previous work serves as a foundation for our present endeavours.</description>

      <title>Integrated modeling of boron powder injection for real-time plasma-facing component conditioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An integrated modeling framework for investigating the application of solid boron powder injection for real-time surface conditioning of plasma-facing components in tokamak environments is presented. Utilizing the DIII-D impurity powder dropper setup, this study simulates B powder injection scenarios ranging from mg to tens of mg per second, corresponding to boron flux rates of $10^{20}-10^{21}$ B/s in standard L-mode conditions. The comprehensive modeling approach combines EMC3-EIRENE for simulating the plasma background and DIS for the ablation and transport of the boron powder particles. The results show substantial transport of B to the inboard lower divertor, predominantly influenced by the main ion plasma flow. The powder particle size (5-250 $\mu$m) was found to be insignificant for the scenario considered. The effects of erosion and redeposition were considered to reconcile the discrepancies with experimental observations, which saw substantial deposition on the outer PFCs. For this purpose, the WallDYN3D code was updated to include B sources within the plasma domain and integrated into the modeling framework. The mixed-material migration modeling shows evolving boron deposition patterns, suggesting the formation of mixed B-C layers or predominantly B coverage depending on the powder mass flow rate. While the modeling outcomes at lower B injection rates tend to align with experimental observations, the prediction of near-pure B layers at higher rates has yet to be experimentally verified in the carbon environment of the DIII-D tokamak. The extensive reach of B layers found in the modeling suggests the need for modeling that encompasses the entire wall geometry for more accurate experimental correlations. This integrated approach sets a precedent for analyzing and applying real-time in-situ boron coating techniques in advanced tokamak scenarios, potentially extendable to ITER.</description>

      <title>Off-site production of plasma-activated water for efficient sterilization: the crucial role of high-valence NOx and new chemical pathways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient sterilization of pathogens with cleaner methods is a critical concern for environmental disinfection and clinical anti-infective treatment. Plasma-activated water (PAW) is a promising alternative to chemical disinfectants and antibiotics for its strong sterilization ability and not inducing any acute toxicity, and only water and air are consumed during production. For more efficient water activation, plasma sources are commonly placed near or fully in contact with water as possible, but the risks of electrode corrosion and metal contamination of water threaten the safety and stability of PAW production. Herein, plasma-activated gas rich in high-valence NOx is generated by a hybrid plasma configuration and introduced into water for off-site PAW production. Plasma-generated O3 is found to dominate the gas-phase reactions for the formation of high-valence NOx. With the time-evolution of O3 concentration, gaseous NO3 radicals are produced behind N2O5 formation, but will be decomposed before N2O5 quenching. By decoupling the roles of gaseous NO3, N2O5, and O3 in the water activation, results show that short-lived aqueous species induced by gaseous NO3 radicals play the most crucial role in PAW sterilization, and the acidic environment induced by N2O5 is also essential. Moreover, SEM photographs and biomacromolecule leakage assays demonstrate that PAW disrupts the cell membranes of bacteria to achieve inactivation. In real-life applications, an integrated device for off-site PAW production with a yield of 2 L/h and a bactericidal efficiency of &gt;99.9% is developed. The PAW of 50mL produced in 3 minutes using this device is more effective in disinfection than 0.5% NaClO and 3% H2O2 with the same bacterial contact time. This work provides new avenues for efficient PAW production and deepens insights into the fundamental processes that govern the reactive chemistry in PAW sterilization.</description>

      <title>Symmetries of the Electromagnetic Turbulence in a Tokamak Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct the low-frequency formulation of the turbulence characterizing the plasma in a Tokamak edge. Under rather natural assumptions we demonstrate that, even in the presence of poloidal magnetic fluctuations, it is possible to deal with a reduced model for the turbulence dynamics. This model relies on a single equation for the electric potential, from which all the physical turbulent properties can be calculated. The main result of the present analysis concerns the existence of a specific Fourier branch for the dynamics which demonstrate the attractive character of the two-dimensional turbulence with respect to non-axisymmetric fluctuations. The peculiar nature of this instability, affecting the non-axially symmetric modes, is discussed in some detail, by recovering two different physical regimes.</description>

      <title>First Ion Temperature Measurements in the MAST-U Divertor via Retarding Field Energy Analyzer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents the first ion temperature (\(T_i\)) measurements from the MAST-U divertor using a Retarding Field Energy Analyzer (RFEA). Embedded within the flat tile of the closed divertor chamber, the RFEA captures \(T_i\) profiles across various plasma scenarios, including transitions to the Super-X configuration. Measurements were conducted under steady-state and transient plasma conditions characterized by a plasma current (\(I_p\)) of 750 kA, electron density (\(n_e\)) between \(2.2 \times 10^{19}\) and \(4.45 \times 10^{19}\,\text{m}^{-3}\), and Neutral Beam Injection (NBI) power ranging from 3.0 MW to 3.2 MW. The ion temperatures, peaking at approximately 20 eV in steady state, were compared with electron temperatures (\(T_e\)) obtained from Langmuir probes (LP) at identical radial positions. The study also examined ion saturation current density (\(J_{\text{sat}}\)) signals to using methodologies similar to previous MAST experiments. Preliminary findings reveal a \(T_i/T_e\) ratio ranging from 1 to 2.5. Additionally, high temporal resolution measurements (100 $\mu s$) captured the dynamics of Edge Localized Modes (ELMs), showing \(T_i\) peaks at 16.03 +- 1.84 eV during ELM events, nearly three times higher than inter-ELM temperatures.</description>

      <title>Measurement of zero-frequency fluctuations generated by coupling between Alfv\'en modes in the JET tokamak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first experimental detection of a zero-frequency fluctuation that is pumped by an Alfv\'en mode in a magnetically confined plasma. Core-localized bidirectional Alfv\'en modes of frequency inside the toroidicity-induced gap (and its harmonics) exhibit three-wave coupling interactions with a zero-frequency fluctuation. The observation of the zero-frequency fluctuation is consistent with theoretical and numerical predictions of zonal modes pumped by Alfv\'en modes, and is correlated with an increase in the deep core ion temperature, temperature gradient, and confinement factor $H_{89,P}$. Despite the energetic particle transport induced by the Alfv\'en eigenmodes, the generation of a zero-frequency fluctuation that can suppress the turbulence leads to an overall improvement of confinement.</description>

      <title>3D MHD modelling of plasmoid drift following massive material injection in a tokamak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanisms of plasmoid drift in the presence of massive material injection are studied via 3D non-linear MHD modelling with the JOREK code, using a transient neutral source deposited on the low field side midplane of a JET H-mode plasma to clarify basic processes and compare with existing theory. The simulations confirm the important role of the propagation of shear Alfv\'en waves (SAWs) from both ends of the plasmoid ("SAW braking") and the development of external resistive currents along magnetic field lines ("P\'egouri\'e braking") in limiting charge separation and thus the $\mathbf{E}\times \mathbf{B}$ plasmoid drift, where $\mathbf{E}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ are the electric and magnetic fields, respectively. The drift velocity is found to be limited by the SAW braking for cases with relatively small source amplitude while the P\'egouri\'e braking is shown to be stronger with larger toroidal extent of the source, both in good agreement with existing theory. The simulations also identity the key role of the size of the $\mathbf{E}\times \mathbf{B}$ flow region on plasmoid drift and show that the saturated velocity caused by dominant SAW braking agrees well with theory when considering an effective pressure within the $\mathbf{E}\times \mathbf{B}$ flow region. The existence of SAWs in the simulations is demonstrated and the 3D picture of plasmoid drift is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Medium-scale thermospheric gravity waves in the high-resolution Whole Atmosphere Model: Seasonal, local time, and longitudinal variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a study of the global medium-scale (scales&lt;620 km) gravity wave (GW) activity (in terms of zonal wind variance) and its seasonal, local time and longitudinal variations by employing the enhanced-resolution (~50 km) Whole Atmosphere Model (WAMT254) and space-based observations for geomagnetically quiet conditions. It is found that the GW hotspots produced by WAMT254 in the troposphere and stratosphere agree well with previously well-studied orographic and non-orographic sources. In the ionosphere-thermosphere (IT) region, GWs spread out forming latitudinal band-like hotspots. During solstices, a primary maximum in GW activity is observed in WAMT254 and GOCE over winter mid-high latitudes, likely associated with higher-order waves with primary sources in polar night jet, fronts and polar vortex. During all the seasons, the enhancement of GWs around the geomagnetic poles as observed by GOCE (at ~250 km) is well captured by simulations. WAMT254 GWs in the IT region also show dependence on local time due to their interaction with migrating tides leading to diurnal and semidiurnal variations. The GWs are more likely to propagate up from the MLT region during westward/weakly-eastward phase of thermospheric tides, signifying the dominance of eastward GW momentum flux in the MLT. Additionally, as a novel finding, a wavenumber-4 signature in GW activity is predicted by WAMT254 between 6-12 LT in the tropics at ~250 km, which propagates eastward with local time. This behavior is likely associated with the modulation of GWs by wave-4 signal of non-migrating tides in the lower thermospheric zonal winds.</description>

      <title>ParaPIF: A Parareal Approach for Parallel-in-Time Integration of Particle-in-Fourier schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose ParaPIF, a parareal based time parallelization scheme for the particle-in-Fourier (PIF) discretization of the Vlasov-Poisson system used in kinetic plasma simulations. Our coarse propagators are based on the coarsening of the numerical discretization scheme combined with, if possible, temporal coarsening rather than coarsening of particles and/or Fourier modes, which are not possible or effective for PIF schemes. Specifically, we use PIF with a coarse tolerance for nonuniform FFTs or even the standard particle-in-cell schemes as coarse propagators for the ParaPIF algorithm. We state and prove the convergence of the algorithm and verify the results numerically with Landau damping, two-stream instability, and Penning trap test cases in 3D-3V. We also implement the space-time parallelization of the PIF schemes in the open-source, performance-portable library IPPL and conduct scaling studies up to 1536 A100 GPUs on the JUWELS booster supercomputer. The space-time parallelization utilizing the ParaPIF algorithm for the time parallelization provides up to $4-6$ times speedup compared to spatial parallelization alone and achieves a push rate of around 1 billion particles per second for the benchmark plasma mini-apps considered.</description>

      <title>Extended X-ray absorption spectroscopy using an ultrashort pulse laboratory-scale laser-plasma accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.10123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Laser-driven compact particle accelerators can provide ultrashort pulses of broadband X-rays, well suited for undertaking X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements on a femtosecond timescale. Here the Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) features of the K-edge of a copper sample have been observed over a 250 eV window in a single shot using a laser wakefield accelerator, providing information on both the electronic and ionic structure simultaneously. This unique capability will allow the investigation of ultrafast processes, and in particular, probing high-energy-density matter and physics far-from-equilibrium where the sample refresh rate is slow and shot number is limited. For example, states that replicate the tremendous pressures and temperatures of planetary bodies or the conditions inside nuclear fusion reactions. Using high-power lasers to pump these samples also has the advantage of being inherently synchronised to the laser-driven X-ray probe. A perspective on the additional strengths of a laboratory-based ultrafast X-ray absorption source is presented.</description>

      <title>The coupling mechanism between crossed-beams energy transfer and stimulated Brillouin scattering in homogeneous plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10626v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The coupling mechanism between crossed beams energy transfer and stimulated Brillouin scattering in homogeneous plasmas are studied by theoretical analysis, fluid simulations and particle in cell(PIC) simulations. The numerical models of laser plasma instabilities are constructed by solving coupling equations with Schodinger equations form, and the fluid simulation results are confirmed by fluid theory and PIC simulations.In the parameter regime when the pump depletion does not occur in CBET and the reflectivity of SBS is lower than 1%, SBS will be affected by CBET, the CBET energy gain will still agree with theoretical predications. However, In the parameter regime when the pump depletion does occur in CBET and the reflectivity of SBS is higher than 1%, the CBET spatial gain will be reduced by the interaction of CBET and SBS, and the huge difference of SBS reflectivity for two crossed laser beams is observed.In the PIC simulations, we found that lower ZTe=Ti will significantly reduce the interaction between CBET and SBS (Z is the ion charge, Teis the electron temperature, Ti is the ion temperature).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wave-particle resonance, a ubiquitous process in the plasma universe, occurs when resonant particles observe a constant wave phase to enable sustained energy transfer. Here, we present spacecraft observations of simultaneous Landau and anomalous resonances between oblique whistler waves and the same group of protons, which are evidenced, respectively, by phase-space rings in parallel-velocity spectra and phase-bunched distributions in gyro-phase spectra. Our results indicate the coupling between Landau and anomalous resonances via the overlapping of the resonance islands.</description>

      <title>Potential Flow Formulation of Parker's Unsteady Solar Wind Model and Nonlinear Stability Aspects Near the Parker Sonic Critical Point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to present the first ever systematic theoretical formulation addressing the long-standing open issue of regularization of the singularity associated with the Parker sonic critical point in the linear perturbation problem for Parker's unsteady solar wind model. This is predicated on the necessity to go outside the framework of the linear perturbation problem and incorporate the dominant nonlinearities in this dynamical system. This is accomplished by constructing a whole new theoretical formulation of Parker's unsteady solar wind model based on the potential flow theory in ideal gas dynamics, which provides an appropriate optimal theoretical framework for this purpose. The stability of Parker's steady solar wind solution is shown to extend also to the neighborhood of the Parker sonic critical point by going to the concomitant nonlinear problem.</description>
