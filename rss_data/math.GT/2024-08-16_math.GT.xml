      <title>Birman-Hilden theory for 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a branched cover of manifolds, one can lift homeomorphisms along the cover to obtain a (virtual) homomorphism between mapping class groups. Following a question of Margalit-Winarski, we study the injectivity of this lifting map in the case of $3$-manifolds. We show that in contrast to the case of surfaces, the lifting map is generally not injective for most regular branched covers of $3$-manifolds. This includes the double cover of $S^3$ branched over the unlink, which generalizes the hyperelliptic branched cover of $S^2$. In this case, we find a finite normal generating set for the kernel of the lifting map.</description>

      <title>On geometric bases for {\it quantum} A-polynomials of knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A simple geometric way is suggested to derive the Ward identities in the Chern-Simons theory, also known as quantum $A$- and $C$-polynomials for knots. In quasi-classical limit it is closely related to the well publicized augmentation theory and contact geometry. Quantization allows to present it in much simpler terms, what could make these techniques available to a broader audience. To avoid overloading of the presentation, only the case of the colored Jones polynomial for the trefoil knot is considered, though various generalizations are straightforward. Restriction to solely Jones polynomials (rather than full HOMFLY-PT) is related to a serious simplification, provided by the use of Kauffman calculus. Going beyond looks realistic, however it remains a problem, both challenging and promising.</description>

      <title>Mean surfaces in Half-Pipe space and infinitesimal Teichm\"uller theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a correspondence between smooth spacelike surfaces in Half-Pipe space $\mathbb{HP}^3$ and divergence-free vector fields on the hyperbolic plane $\mathbb{H}^2$. We show that a particular case involves harmonic Lagrangian vector fields on $\mathbb{H}^2$, which are related to mean surfaces in $\mathbb{HP}^3$. Consequently, we prove that the infinitesimal Douady-Earle extension is a harmonic Lagrangian vector field that corresponds to a mean surface in $\mathbb{HP}^3$ with prescribed boundary data at infinity.
  We establish both existence and, under certain assumptions, uniqueness results for harmonic Lagrangian extension of a vector field on the circle. Finally, we characterize the Zygmund and little Zygmund conditions and provide quantitative bounds in terms of the Half-Pipe width.</description>

      <title>Diffeomorphisms of 4-manifolds with boundary and exotic embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.14878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.14878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define family versions of the invariant of 4-manifolds with contact boundary due to Kronheimer and Mrowka and use these to detect exotic diffeomorphisms of 4-manifolds with boundary. Further, we show the existence of the first example of exotic 3-spheres in a smooth closed 4-manifold with diffeomorphic complements.</description>

      <title>Mapping class groups of simply connected 4-manifolds with boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.05986v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the topological mapping class group of every compact, simply connected, topological 4-manifold. This was previously only known in the closed case. If the 4-manifold is smooth, we deduce an analogous description of the stable smooth mapping class group, extending work of Saeki.</description>

      <title>On localizing groups of exotic diffeomorphisms of 4-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11773v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ruberman in the 90's showed that the group of exotic diffeomorphisms of closed 4-manifolds can be infinitely generated. We provide various results on the question of when such infinite generation can localize to a smaller embedded submanifold of the original manifold. Our results include: (1) All known infinitely generated groups of exotic diffeomorphisms of 4-manifolds detected by families Seiberg-Witten theory do not localize to any topologically (locally-flatly) embedded rational homology balls in the ambient 4-manifold. (2) Many exotic diffeomorphisms cannot be obtained as Dehn twists along homology spheres (under mild assumptions). (3) There is no contractible 4-manifolds with Seifert fibered boundary that have a universal property for exotic diffeomorphisms analogous to a universal cork. In addition, there is no universal compact 4-manifold $W$ such that the set of exotic diffeomorphisms of a 4-manifold can localize to an embedding of $W$. (4) Certain infinite generations of exotic diffeomorphism groups do localize to a non-compact subset $V$ with a small Betti number, but not to any compact subset of $V$. (5) An analogous result holds for mapping class groups of 4-manifolds.</description>
