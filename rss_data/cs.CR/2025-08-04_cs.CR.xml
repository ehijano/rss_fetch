      <title>ranDecepter: Real-time Identification and Deterrence of Ransomware Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00293v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ransomware (RW) presents a significant and widespread threat in the digital landscape, necessitating effective countermeasures. Active cyber deception is a promising strategy to thwart RW and limiting its propagation by misleading it with false information and revealing its true behaviors. Furthermore, RW often acts as a communication conduit between attackers and defenders, allowing deception to return false data to attackers and deplete their resources. This paper introduces ranDecepter, a novel approach that combines active cyber deception with real-time analysis to enhance defenses against RW attacks. The ranDecepter identifies RW in real-time and isolates it within a deceptive environment, autonomously identifying critical elements in the RW code to create a loop mechanism. By repeatedly restarting the malware and transmitting counterfeit encryption information and secret keys to the attacker, it forces the attacker to store these fabricated details for each victim, thereby depleting their resources. Our comprehensive evaluation of ranDecepter, conducted using 1,134 real-world malware samples and twelve benign applications, demonstrates a remarkable 100% accuracy in RW identification, with no false positives and minimal impact on response times. Furthermore, within 24-hours, ranDecepter generates up to 9,223K entries in the attacker's database using 50 agents, showcasing its potential to undermine attacker resources.</description>

      <title>Cryptanalysis of Isogeny-Based Quantum Money with Rational Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum money is the cryptographic application of the quantum no-cloning theorem. It has recently been instantiated by Montgomery and Sharif (Asiacrypt '24) from class group actions on elliptic curves. In this work, we propose a concrete cryptanalysis by leveraging the efficiency of evaluating division polynomials with the coordinates of rational points, offering a speedup of O(log^4p) compared to the brute-force attack. Since our attack still requires exponential time, it remains impractical to forge a quantum banknote. Interestingly, due to the inherent properties of quantum money, our attack method also results in a more efficient verification procedure. Our algorithm leverages the properties of quadratic twists to utilize rational points in verifying the cardinality of the superposition of elliptic curves. We expect this approach to contribute to future research on elliptic-curve-based quantum cryptography.</description>

      <title>Preliminary Investigation into Uncertainty-Aware Attack Stage Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) represent a significant challenge in cybersecurity due to their prolonged, multi-stage nature and the sophistication of their operators. Traditional detection systems typically focus on identifying malicious activity in binary terms (benign or malicious) without accounting for the progression of an attack. However, effective response strategies depend on accurate inference of the attack's current stage, as countermeasures must be tailored to whether an adversary is in the early reconnaissance phase or actively conducting exploitation or exfiltration. This work addresses the problem of attack stage inference under uncertainty, with a focus on robustness to out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. We propose a classification approach based on Evidential Deep Learning (EDL), which models predictive uncertainty by outputting parameters of a Dirichlet distribution over possible stages. This allows the system not only to predict the most likely stage of an attack but also to indicate when it is uncertain or the input lies outside the training distribution. Preliminary experiments in a simulated environment demonstrate that the proposed model can accurately infer the stage of an attack with calibrated confidence while effectively detecting OOD inputs, which may indicate changes in the attackers' tactics. These results support the feasibility of deploying uncertainty-aware models for staged threat detection in dynamic and adversarial environments.</description>

      <title>Accurate Latent Inversion for Generative Image Steganography via Rectified Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Steganography based on diffusion models has attracted increasing attention due to its ability to generate high-quality images and exhibit strong robustness. In such approaches, the secret message is first embedded into the initial latent variable, and then the stego image is generated through the forward process. To extract the message, an inversion process is required to reconstruct the latent variables from the received image. However, inaccurate latent inversion leads to significant discrepancies between the reconstructed and original latent variables, rendering message extraction infeasible. To address this issue, we propose \textbf{RF-Stego}, a novel generative image steganography method that enables accurate latent inversion and significantly improves extraction accuracy. First, we develop the \textbf{P}ath \textbf{C}onsistency \textbf{L}inear \textbf{I}nversion (\textbf{PCLI}), which imposes formal constraints on the inversion process. By explicitly aligning it with the forward generation path and modeling both directions along a shared linear path, PCLI eliminates path mismatch and ensures path consistency throughout the steganographic process. Second, through rigorous theoretical proof, we demonstrate that \textbf{R}ectified \textbf{F}low \textbf{(RF)} offers both theoretical reversibility and numerical stability in the inversion process. Based on this, we replace traditional unstable samplers with RF sampler which effectively improves the numerical precision of the inversion process. Experimental results show RF-Stego outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of extraction accuracy, image quality, robustness, security and generation efficiency.</description>

      <title>CyGATE: Game-Theoretic Cyber Attack-Defense Engine for Patch Strategy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern cyber attacks unfold through multiple stages, requiring defenders to dynamically prioritize mitigations under uncertainty. While game-theoretic models capture attacker-defender interactions, existing approaches often rely on static assumptions and lack integration with real-time threat intelligence, limiting their adaptability. This paper presents CyGATE, a game-theoretic framework modeling attacker-defender interactions, using large language models (LLMs) with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to enhance tactic selection and patch prioritization. Applied to a two-agent scenario, CyGATE frames cyber conflicts as a partially observable stochastic game (POSG) across Cyber Kill Chain stages. Both agents use belief states to navigate uncertainty, with the attacker adapting tactics and the defender re-prioritizing patches based on evolving risks and observed adversary behavior. The framework's flexible architecture enables extension to multi-agent scenarios involving coordinated attackers, collaborative defenders, or complex enterprise environments with multiple stakeholders. Evaluated in a dynamic patch scheduling scenario, CyGATE effectively prioritizes high-risk vulnerabilities, enhancing adaptability through dynamic threat integration, strategic foresight by anticipating attacker moves under uncertainty, and efficiency by optimizing resource use.</description>

      <title>Activation-Guided Local Editing for Jailbreaking Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jailbreaking is an essential adversarial technique for red-teaming these models to uncover and patch security flaws. However, existing jailbreak methods face significant drawbacks. Token-level jailbreak attacks often produce incoherent or unreadable inputs and exhibit poor transferability, while prompt-level attacks lack scalability and rely heavily on manual effort and human ingenuity. We propose a concise and effective two-stage framework that combines the advantages of these approaches. The first stage performs a scenario-based generation of context and rephrases the original malicious query to obscure its harmful intent. The second stage then utilizes information from the model's hidden states to guide fine-grained edits, effectively steering the model's internal representation of the input from a malicious toward a benign one. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this method achieves state-of-the-art Attack Success Rate, with gains of up to 37.74% over the strongest baseline, and exhibits excellent transferability to black-box models. Our analysis further demonstrates that AGILE maintains substantial effectiveness against prominent defense mechanisms, highlighting the limitations of current safeguards and providing valuable insights for future defense development.

      <title>LeakSealer: A Semisupervised Defense for LLMs Against Prompt Injection and Leakage Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generalization capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to their widespread deployment across various applications. However, this increased adoption has introduced several security threats, notably in the forms of jailbreaking and data leakage attacks. Additionally, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), while enhancing context-awareness in LLM responses, has inadvertently introduced vulnerabilities that can result in the leakage of sensitive information. Our contributions are twofold. First, we introduce a methodology to analyze historical interaction data from an LLM system, enabling the generation of usage maps categorized by topics (including adversarial interactions). This approach further provides forensic insights for tracking the evolution of jailbreaking attack patterns. Second, we propose LeakSealer, a model-agnostic framework that combines static analysis for forensic insights with dynamic defenses in a Human-In-The-Loop (HITL) pipeline. This technique identifies topic groups and detects anomalous patterns, allowing for proactive defense mechanisms. We empirically evaluate LeakSealer under two scenarios: (1) jailbreak attempts, employing a public benchmark dataset, and (2) PII leakage, supported by a curated dataset of labeled LLM interactions. In the static setting, LeakSealer achieves the highest precision and recall on the ToxicChat dataset when identifying prompt injection. In the dynamic setting, PII leakage detection achieves an AUPRC of $0.97$, significantly outperforming baselines such as Llama Guard.</description>

      <title>FedGuard: A Diverse-Byzantine-Robust Mechanism for Federated Learning with Major Malicious Clients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning is a distributed training framework vulnerable to Byzantine attacks, particularly when over 50% of clients are malicious or when datasets are highly non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID). Additionally, most existing defense mechanisms are designed for specific attack types (e.g., gradient similarity-based schemes can only defend against outlier model poisoning), limiting their effectiveness. In response, we propose FedGuard, a novel federated learning mechanism. FedGuard cleverly addresses the aforementioned issues by leveraging the high sensitivity of membership inference to model bias. By requiring clients to include an additional mini-batch of server-specified data in their training, FedGuard can identify and exclude poisoned models, as their confidence in the mini-batch will drop significantly. Our comprehensive evaluation unequivocally shows that, under three highly non-IID datasets, with 90% of clients being Byzantine and seven different types of Byzantine attacks occurring in each round, FedGuard significantly outperforms existing robust federated learning schemes in mitigating various types of Byzantine attacks.</description>

      <title>Demo: TOSense -- What Did You Just Agree to?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online services often require users to agree to lengthy and obscure Terms of Service (ToS), leading to information asymmetry and legal risks. This paper proposes TOSense-a Chrome extension that allows users to ask questions about ToS in natural language and get concise answers in real time. The system combines (i) a crawler "tos-crawl" that automatically extracts ToS content, and (ii) a lightweight large language model pipeline: MiniLM for semantic retrieval and BART-encoder for answer relevance verification. To avoid expensive manual annotation, we present a novel Question Answering Evaluation Pipeline (QEP) that generates synthetic questions and verifies the correctness of answers using clustered topic matching. Experiments on five major platforms, Apple, Google, X (formerly Twitter), Microsoft, and Netflix, show the effectiveness of TOSense (with up to 44.5% accuracy) across varying number of topic clusters. During the demonstration, we will showcase TOSense in action. Attendees will be able to experience seamless extraction, interactive question answering, and instant indexing of new sites.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Dynamic Binary Instrumentation Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic Binary Instrumentation (DBI) is the set of techniques that enable instrumentation of programs at run-time, making it possible to monitor and modify the execution of compiled binaries or entire systems. DBI is used for countless security applications and analyses, and is extensively used across many fields in both industry and academia. Over the years, several DBI approaches have been proposed based on different technologies and implementing diverse techniques. Every solution tries to overcome certain limitations, but they sometimes bring other shortcomings. Some are specialized for one particular domain or task, while others have a wider scope.
  In this paper, we shed light into the labyrinth of DBI, bringing together process-level and whole-system approaches. We depict their building blocks and analyze the underlying instrumentation techniques, comparing their ability to instrument different primitives and run-time events. Then, we evaluate their performance when implementing each primitive, and highlight relevant observations. Our results show that no single technique is better than the rest in all circumstances.</description>

      <title>LeakyCLIP: Extracting Training Data from CLIP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the memorization and privacy leakage risks in Contrastive Language--Image Pretraining (CLIP) is critical for ensuring the security of multimodal models. Recent studies have demonstrated the feasibility of extracting sensitive training examples from diffusion models, with conditional diffusion models exhibiting a stronger tendency to memorize and leak information. In this work, we investigate data memorization and extraction risks in CLIP through the lens of CLIP inversion, a process that aims to reconstruct training images from text prompts. To this end, we introduce \textbf{LeakyCLIP}, a novel attack framework designed to achieve high-quality, semantically accurate image reconstruction from CLIP embeddings. We identify three key challenges in CLIP inversion: 1) non-robust features, 2) limited visual semantics in text embeddings, and 3) low reconstruction fidelity. To address these challenges, LeakyCLIP employs 1) adversarial fine-tuning to enhance optimization smoothness, 2) linear transformation-based embedding alignment, and 3) Stable Diffusion-based refinement to improve fidelity. Empirical results demonstrate the superiority of LeakyCLIP, achieving over 358% improvement in Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) for ViT-B-16 compared to baseline methods on LAION-2B subset. Furthermore, we uncover a pervasive leakage risk, showing that training data membership can even be successfully inferred from the metrics of low-fidelity reconstructions. Our work introduces a practical method for CLIP inversion while offering novel insights into the nature and scope of privacy risks in multimodal models.</description>

      <title>Wukong Framework for Not Safe For Work Detection in Text-to-Image systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) generation is a popular AI-generated content (AIGC) technology enabling diverse and creative image synthesis. However, some outputs may contain Not Safe For Work (NSFW) content (e.g., violence), violating community guidelines. Detecting NSFW content efficiently and accurately, known as external safeguarding, is essential. Existing external safeguards fall into two types: text filters, which analyze user prompts but overlook T2I model-specific variations and are prone to adversarial attacks; and image filters, which analyze final generated images but are computationally costly and introduce latency. Diffusion models, the foundation of modern T2I systems like Stable Diffusion, generate images through iterative denoising using a U-Net architecture with ResNet and Transformer blocks. We observe that: (1) early denoising steps define the semantic layout of the image, and (2) cross-attention layers in U-Net are crucial for aligning text and image regions. Based on these insights, we propose Wukong, a transformer-based NSFW detection framework that leverages intermediate outputs from early denoising steps and reuses U-Net's pre-trained cross-attention parameters. Wukong operates within the diffusion process, enabling early detection without waiting for full image generation. We also introduce a new dataset containing prompts, seeds, and image-specific NSFW labels, and evaluate Wukong on this and two public benchmarks. Results show that Wukong significantly outperforms text-based safeguards and achieves comparable accuracy of image filters, while offering much greater efficiency.</description>

      <title>Information-Theoretic Decentralized Secure Aggregation with Collusion Resilience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In decentralized federated learning (FL), multiple clients collaboratively learn a shared machine learning (ML) model by leveraging their privately held datasets distributed across the network, through interactive exchange of the intermediate model updates. To ensure data security, cryptographic techniques are commonly employed to protect model updates during aggregation. Despite growing interest in secure aggregation, existing works predominantly focus on protocol design and computational guarantees, with limited understanding of the fundamental information-theoretic limits of such systems. Moreover, optimal bounds on communication and key usage remain unknown in decentralized settings, where no central aggregator is available. Motivated by these gaps, we study the problem of decentralized secure aggregation (DSA) from an information-theoretic perspective. Specifically, we consider a network of $K$ fully-connected users, each holding a private input -- an abstraction of local training data -- who aim to securely compute the sum of all inputs. The security constraint requires that no user learns anything beyond the input sum, even when colluding with up to $T$ other users. We characterize the optimal rate region, which specifies the minimum achievable communication and secret key rates for DSA. In particular, we show that to securely compute one symbol of the desired input sum, each user must (i) transmit at least one symbol to others, (ii) hold at least one symbol of secret key, and (iii) all users must collectively hold no fewer than $K - 1$ independent key symbols. Our results establish the fundamental performance limits of DSA, providing insights for the design of provably secure and communication-efficient protocols in distributed learning systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Face Recognition Systems that operate in unconstrained environments capture images under varying conditions,such as inconsistent lighting, or diverse face poses. These challenges require including a Face Detection module that regresses bounding boxes and landmark coordinates for proper Face Alignment. This paper shows the effectiveness of Object Generation Attacks on Face Detection, dubbed Face Generation Attacks, and demonstrates for the first time a Landmark Shift Attack that backdoors the coordinate regression task performed by face detectors.

      <title>Cyber-Physical Co-Simulation of Load Frequency Control under Load-Altering Attacks</title>

Abstract: Integrating Information and Communications Technology (ICT) devices into the power grid brings many benefits. However, it also exposes the grid to new potential cyber threats. Many control and protection mechanisms, such as Load Frequency Control (LFC), responsible for maintaining nominal frequency during load fluctuations and Under Frequency Load Shedding (UFLS) disconnecting portion of the load during an emergency, are dependent on information exchange through the communication network. The recently emerging Load Altering Attacks (LAAs) utilize a botnet of high-wattage devices to introduce load fluctuation. In their dynamic form (DLAAs), they manipulate the load in response to live grid frequency measurements for increased efficiency, posing a notable threat to grid stability. Recognizing the importance of communication networks in power grid cyber security research, this paper presents an open-source co-simulation environment that models the power grid with the corresponding communication network, implementing grid protective mechanisms. This setup allows the comprehensive analysis of the attacks in concrete LFC and UFLS scenarios.</description>

      <title>Is It Really You? Exploring Biometric Verification Scenarios in Photorealistic Talking-Head Avatar Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00748v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photorealistic talking-head avatars are becoming increasingly common in virtual meetings, gaming, and social platforms. These avatars allow for more immersive communication, but they also introduce serious security risks. One emerging threat is impersonation: an attacker can steal a user's avatar, preserving his appearance and voice, making it nearly impossible to detect its fraudulent usage by sight or sound alone. In this paper, we explore the challenge of biometric verification in such avatar-mediated scenarios. Our main question is whether an individual's facial motion patterns can serve as reliable behavioral biometrics to verify their identity when the avatar's visual appearance is a facsimile of its owner. To answer this question, we introduce a new dataset of realistic avatar videos created using a state-of-the-art one-shot avatar generation model, GAGAvatar, with genuine and impostor avatar videos. We also propose a lightweight, explainable spatio-temporal Graph Convolutional Network architecture with temporal attention pooling, that uses only facial landmarks to model dynamic facial gestures. Experimental results demonstrate that facial motion cues enable meaningful identity verification with AUC values approaching 80%. The proposed benchmark and biometric system are available for the research community in order to bring attention to the urgent need for more advanced behavioral biometric defenses in avatar-based communication systems.</description>

      <title>Efficient and Universal Watermarking for LLM-Generated Code Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07518v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced the usability of AI-generated code, providing effective assistance to programmers. This advancement also raises ethical and legal concerns, such as academic dishonesty or the generation of malicious code. For accountability, it is imperative to detect whether a piece of code is AI-generated. Watermarking is broadly considered a promising solution and has been successfully applied to identify LLM-generated text. However, existing efforts on code are far from ideal, suffering from limited universality and excessive time and memory consumption. In this work, we propose a plug-and-play watermarking approach for AI-generated code detection, named ACW (AI Code Watermarking). ACW is training-free and works by selectively applying a set of carefully-designed, semantic-preserving and idempotent code transformations to LLM code outputs. The presence or absence of the transformations serves as implicit watermarks, enabling the detection of AI-generated code. Our experimental results show that ACW effectively detects AI-generated code, preserves code utility, and is resilient against code optimizations. Especially, ACW is efficient and is universal across different LLMs, addressing the limitations of existing approaches.</description>

      <title>UTrace: Poisoning Forensics for Private Collaborative Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15126v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML) enables multiple data owners to contribute their data privately to a set of servers that run a secure multi-party computation (MPC) protocol to train a joint ML model. In these protocols, the input data remains private throughout the training process, and only the resulting model is made available. While this approach benefits privacy, it also exacerbates the risks of data poisoning, where compromised data owners induce undesirable model behavior by contributing malicious datasets. Existing MPC mechanisms can mitigate certain poisoning attacks, but these measures are not exhaustive. To complement existing poisoning defenses, we introduce UTrace: a framework for User-level Traceback of poisoning attacks in PPML. Utrace computes user responsibility scores using gradient similarity metrics aggregated across the most relevant samples in an owner's dataset. UTrace is effective at low poisoning rates and is resilient to poisoning attacks distributed across multiple data owners, unlike existing unlearning-based methods. We introduce methods for checkpointing gradients with low storage overhead, enabling traceback in the absence of data owners at deployment time. We also design several optimizations that reduce traceback time and communication in MPC. We provide a comprehensive evaluation of UTrace across four datasets from three data modalities (vision, text, and malware) and show its effectiveness against 10 poisoning attacks.</description>

      <title>ExclaveFL: Providing Transparency to Federated Learning using Exclaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10537v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In federated learning (FL), data providers jointly train a model without disclosing their training data. Despite its inherent privacy benefits, a malicious data provider can simply deviate from the correct training protocol without being detected, potentially compromising the trained model. While current solutions have explored the use of trusted execution environments (TEEs) to combat such attacks, they usually assume side-channel attacks against the TEEs are out of scope. However, such side-channel attacks can undermine the security properties of TEE-based FL frameworks, not by extracting the FL data, but by leaking keys that allow the adversary to impersonate as the TEE whilst deviating arbitrarily from the correct training protocol.
  We describe ExclaveFL, an FL platform that provides end-to-end integrity and transparency, even in the presence of side-channel attacks on TEEs. We propose a new paradigm in which existing TEEs are used as exclaves -- integrity-protected execution environments that do not contain any secrets, making them immune to side-channel attacks. Whereas previous approaches attest the TEE itself and bind this attestation to a key held by the TEE, ExclaveFL attests individual data transformations at runtime. These runtime attestations form an attested dataflow graph, which can be checked to ensure the FL training job satisfies claims, such as deviations from the correct computation. We implement ExclaveFL by extending the popular NVFlare FL framework to use exclaves, and show experimentally that ExclaveFL introduces less than 10% overhead compared to the same FL framework without TEEs, whilst providing stronger security guarantees.</description>

      <title>From LLMs to MLLMs to Agents: A Survey of Emerging Paradigms in Jailbreak Attacks and Defenses within LLM Ecosystem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15170v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly evolving from single-modal systems to multimodal LLMs and intelligent agents, significantly expanding their capabilities while introducing increasingly severe security risks. This paper presents a systematic survey of the growing complexity of jailbreak attacks and corresponding defense mechanisms within the expanding LLM ecosystem. We first trace the developmental trajectory from LLMs to MLLMs and Agents, highlighting the core security challenges emerging at each stage. Next, we categorize mainstream jailbreak techniques from both the attack impact and visibility perspectives, and provide a comprehensive analysis of representative attack methods, related datasets, and evaluation metrics. On the defense side, we organize existing strategies based on response timing and technical approach, offering a structured understanding of their applicability and implementation. Furthermore, we identify key limitations in existing surveys, such as insufficient attention to agent-specific security issues, the absence of a clear taxonomy for hybrid jailbreak methods, a lack of detailed analysis of experimental setups, and outdated coverage of recent advancements. To address these limitations, we provide an updated synthesis of recent work and outline future research directions in areas such as dataset construction, evaluation framework optimization, and strategy generalization. Our study seeks to enhance the understanding of jailbreak mechanisms and facilitate the advancement of more resilient and adaptive defense strategies in the context of ever more capable LLMs.</description>

      <title>Theoretically Unmasking Inference Attacks Against LDP-Protected Clients in Federated Vision Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated Learning enables collaborative learning among clients via a coordinating server while avoiding direct data sharing, offering a perceived solution to preserve privacy. However, recent studies on Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) have challenged this notion, showing high success rates against unprotected training data. While local differential privacy (LDP) is widely regarded as a gold standard for privacy protection in data analysis, most studies on MIAs either neglect LDP or fail to provide theoretical guarantees for attack success rates against LDP-protected data. To address this gap, we derive theoretical lower bounds for the success rates of low-polynomial time MIAs that exploit vulnerabilities in fully connected or self-attention layers. We establish that even when data are protected by LDP, privacy risks persist, depending on the privacy budget. Practical evaluations on federated vision models confirm considerable privacy risks, revealing that the noise required to mitigate these attacks significantly degrades models' utility.</description>

      <title>A Practical and Secure Byzantine Robust Aggregator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23183v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In machine learning security, one is often faced with the problem of removing outliers from a given set of high-dimensional vectors when computing their average. For example, many variants of data poisoning attacks produce gradient vectors during training that are outliers in the distribution of clean gradients, which bias the computed average used to derive the ML model. Filtering them out before averaging serves as a generic defense strategy. Byzantine robust aggregation is an algorithmic primitive which computes a robust average of vectors, in the presence of an $\epsilon$ fraction of vectors which may have been arbitrarily and adaptively corrupted, such that the resulting bias in the final average is provably bounded.
  In this paper, we give the first robust aggregator that runs in quasi-linear time in the size of input vectors and provably has near-optimal bias bounds. Our algorithm also does not assume any knowledge of the distribution of clean vectors, nor does it require pre-computing any filtering thresholds from it. This makes it practical to use directly in standard neural network training procedures. We empirically confirm its expected runtime efficiency and its effectiveness in nullifying 10 different ML poisoning attacks.</description>

      <title>OneShield -- the Next Generation of LLM Guardrails</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models has created a general excitement about the great potential for a myriad of applications. While LLMs offer many possibilities, questions about safety, privacy, and ethics have emerged, and all the key actors are working to address these issues with protective measures for their own models and standalone solutions. The constantly evolving nature of LLMs makes it extremely challenging to universally shield users against their potential risks, and one-size-fits-all solutions are unfeasible. In this work, we propose OneShield, our stand-alone, model-agnostic and customizable solution to safeguard LLMs. OneShield aims to provide facilities for defining risk factors, expressing and declaring contextual safety and compliance policies, and mitigating LLM risks, with a focus on each specific customer. We describe the implementation of the framework, discuss scalability considerations, and provide usage statistics of OneShield since its initial deployment.</description>

      <title>Verification Cost Asymmetry in Cognitive Warfare: A Complexity-Theoretic Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21258v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Human verification under adversarial information flow operates as a cost-bounded decision procedure constrained by working memory limits and cognitive biases. We introduce the Verification Cost Asymmetry (VCA) coefficient, formalizing it as the ratio of expected verification work between populations under identical claim distributions. Drawing on probabilistically checkable proofs (PCP) and parameterized complexity theory, we construct dissemination protocols that reduce verification for trusted audiences to constant human effort while imposing superlinear costs on adversarial populations lacking cryptographic infrastructure. We prove theoretical guarantees for this asymmetry, validate the framework through controlled user studies measuring verification effort with and without spot-checkable provenance, and demonstrate practical encoding of real-world information campaigns. The results establish complexity-theoretic foundations for engineering democratic advantage in cognitive warfare, with immediate applications to content authentication, platform governance, and information operations doctrine.</description>

Abstract: We present SACRO-ML, an integrated suite of open source Python tools to facilitate the statistical disclosure control (SDC) of machine learning (ML) models trained on confidential data prior to public release. SACRO-ML combines (i) a SafeModel package that extends commonly used ML models to provide ante-hoc SDC by assessing the vulnerability of disclosure posed by the training regime; and (ii) an Attacks package that provides post-hoc SDC by rigorously assessing the empirical disclosure risk of a model through a variety of simulated attacks after training.

      <title>FakeIDet: Exploring Patches for Privacy-Preserving Fake ID Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07761v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Verifying the authenticity of identity documents (IDs) has become a critical challenge for real-life applications such as digital banking, crypto-exchanges, renting, etc. This study focuses on the topic of fake ID detection, covering several limitations in the field. In particular, there are no publicly available data from real IDs for proper research in this area, and most published studies rely on proprietary internal databases that are not available for privacy reasons. In order to advance this critical challenge of real data scarcity that makes it so difficult to advance the technology of machine learning-based fake ID detection, we introduce a new patch-based methodology that trades off privacy and performance, and propose a novel patch-wise approach for privacy-aware fake ID detection: FakeIDet. In our experiments, we explore: i) two levels of anonymization for an ID (i.e., fully- and pseudo-anonymized), and ii) different patch size configurations, varying the amount of sensitive data visible in the patch image. State-of-the-art methods, such as vision transformers and foundation models, are considered as backbones. Our results show that, on an unseen database (DLC-2021), our proposal for fake ID detection achieves 13.91% and 0% EERs at the patch and the whole ID level, showing a good generalization to other databases. In addition to the path-based methodology introduced and the new FakeIDet method based on it, another key contribution of our article is the release of the first publicly available database that contains 48,400 patches from real and fake IDs, called FakeIDet-db, together with the experimental framework.</description>

      <title>RecPS: Privacy Risk Scoring for Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18365v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recommender systems (RecSys) have become an essential component of many web applications. The core of the system is a recommendation model trained on highly sensitive user-item interaction data. While privacy-enhancing techniques are actively studied in the research community, the real-world model development still depends on minimal privacy protection, e.g., via controlled access. Users of such systems should have the right to choose \emph{not} to share highly sensitive interactions. However, there is no method allowing the user to know which interactions are more sensitive than others. Thus, quantifying the privacy risk of RecSys training data is a critical step to enabling privacy-aware RecSys model development and deployment. We propose a membership-inference attack (MIA)- based privacy scoring method, RecPS, to measure privacy risks at both the interaction and user levels. The RecPS interaction-level score definition is motivated and derived from differential privacy, which is then extended to the user-level scoring method. A critical component is the interaction-level MIA method RecLiRA, which gives high-quality membership estimation. We have conducted extensive experiments on well-known benchmark datasets and RecSys models to show the unique features and benefits of RecPS scoring in risk assessment and RecSys model unlearning.</description>
