      <title>Maximal Procurement under a Budget</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of a principal who wants to influence an agent's observable action, subject to an ex-post budget. The agent has a private type determining their cost function. This paper endogenizes the value of the resource driving incentives, which holds no inherent value but is restricted by finite availability. We characterize the optimal mechanism, showing the emergence of a pooling region where the budget constraint binds for low-cost types. We then introduce a linear value for the transferable resource; as the principal's value increases, the mechanism demands more from agents with binding budget constraint but less from others.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence for Multi-Unit Auction design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding bidding behavior in multi-unit auctions remains an ongoing challenge for researchers. Despite their widespread use, theoretical insights into the bidding behavior, revenue ranking, and efficiency of commonly used multi-unit auctions are limited. This paper utilizes artificial intelligence, specifically reinforcement learning, as a model free learning approach to simulate bidding in three prominent multi-unit auctions employed in practice. We introduce six algorithms that are suitable for learning and bidding in multi-unit auctions and compare them using an illustrative example. This paper underscores the significance of using artificial intelligence in auction design, particularly in enhancing the design of multi-unit auctions.</description>

      <title>How Do Digital Advertising Auctions Impact Product Prices?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.08432v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a model of digital advertising with three key features: (i) advertisers can reach consumers on and off a platform, (ii) additional data enhances the value of advertiser-consumer matches, and (iii) bidding follows auction-like mechanisms. We contrast data-augmented auctions, which leverage the platform's data advantage to improve match quality, and managed campaign mechanisms that automate match formation and price-setting. The platform-optimal mechanism is a managed campaign that conditions on-platform prices for sponsored products on the off-platform prices set by all advertisers. This mechanism yields the efficient on-platform allocation but inefficient off-platform allocations due to high product prices; it attains the vertical integration profit for the platform and advertisers; and it increases off-platform product prices and decreases consumer surplus, relative to data-augmented auctions.</description>

      <title>Bubble Necessity Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.08268v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Asset price bubbles are situations where asset prices exceed the fundamental values defined by the present value of dividends. This paper presents a conceptually new perspective: the necessity of bubbles. We establish the Bubble Necessity Theorem in a plausible general class of economic models: with faster long-run economic growth ($G$) than dividend growth ($G_d$) and counterfactual long-run autarky interest rate ($R$) below dividend growth, all equilibria are bubbly with non-negligible bubble sizes relative to the economy. This bubble necessity condition naturally arises in economies with sufficiently strong savings motives and multiple factors or sectors with uneven productivity growth.</description>

      <title>Sharing Credit for Joint Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12104v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How can one efficiently share payoffs with collaborators when participating in risky research? First, I show that efficiency can be achieved by allocating payoffs asymmetrically between the researcher who makes a breakthrough ("winner") and the others, even if agents cannot observe others' effort. When the winner's identity is non-contractible, allocating credit based on effort at time of breakthrough also suffices to achieve efficiency; so the terminal effort profile, rather than the full history of effort, is a sufficient statistic. These findings suggest that simple mechanisms using minimal information are robust and effective in addressing inefficiencies in strategic experimentation.</description>

      <title>Not obviously manipulable allotment rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the problem of allocating a single non-disposable commodity among agents whose preferences are single-peaked, we study a weakening of strategy-proofness called not obvious manipulability (NOM). If agents are cognitively limited, then NOM is sufficient to describe their strategic behavior. We characterize a large family of own-peak-only rules that satisfy efficiency, NOM, and a minimal fairness condition. We call these rules "simple". In economies with excess demand, simple rules fully satiate agents whose peak amount is less than or equal to equal division and assign, to each remaining agent, an amount between equal division and his peak. In economies with excess supply, simple rules are defined symmetrically. These rules can be thought of as a two-step procedure that involves solving a claims problem. We also show that the single-plateaued domain is maximal for the characterizing properties of simple rules. Therefore, even though replacing strategy-proofness with NOM greatly expands the family of admissible rules, the maximal domain of preferences involved remains basically unaltered.</description>
