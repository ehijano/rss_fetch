      <title>A predictive modular approach to constraint satisfaction under uncertainty - with application to glycosylation in continuous monoclonal antibody biosimilar production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper proposes a modular-based approach to constraint handling in process optimization and control. This is partly motivated by the recent interest in learning-based methods, e.g., within bioproduction, for which constraint handling under uncertainty is a challenge. The proposed constraint handler, called predictive filter, is combined with an adaptive constraint margin and a constraint violation cost monitor to minimize the cost of violating soft constraints due to model uncertainty and disturbances. The module can be combined with any controller and is based on minimally modifying the controller output, in a least squares sense, such that constraints are satisfied within the considered horizon. The proposed method is computationally efficient and suitable for real-time applications. The effectiveness of the method is illustrated through a realistic simulation case study of glycosylation constraint satisfaction in continuous monoclonal antibody biosimilar production using Chinese hamster ovary cells, for which the metabolic network model consists of 23 extracellular metabolites and 126 reactions.</description>

      <title>Optimal Coordination of Local Flexibility from Electric Vehicles with Social Impact Consideration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of renewable energy sources (RES) and the convergence of transport electrification, creates a significant challenge for distribution network management e.g. voltage and frequency violations, particularly in rural and remote areas. This paper investigates how smart charging of electric vehicles (EVs) can help reduce renewable energy curtailment and alleviate stress on local distribution networks. We implement a customised AC Optimal Power Flow (AC OPF) formulation which integrates into the optimisation an indicator reflecting the social impact of flexibility from EV users, based on the analysis of historical EV charging behaviours. The contribution of EV owners to reducing wind curtailment is optimised to enhance the acceptability of flexibility procurement, as the method targets EV users whose charging habits are most likely to align with flexibility requirements. Our method integrates social, technological, and economic perspectives with optimal flexibility coordination, and utilises clustering of EVs through a kmeans algorithm. To ensure scalability, we introduce a polar coordinate-based dimension reduction technique. The flexibility optimisation approach is demonstrated on the Orkney grid model, incorporating demand and wind farm generation data, as well as multi year charging data from 106 EVs. Results indicate that, by building upon the existing habits of EV users, curtailment can be reduced by 99.5% during a typical summer week the period when curtailment is most prevalent. This research demonstrates a foundational and transferable approach which is cognisant of socio techno economic factors towards accelerating decarbonisation and tackling the stochastic challenges of new demand and generation patterns on local distribution networks.</description>

      <title>Grid-Aware Flexibility Operation of Behind-the-Meter Assets: A review of Objectives and Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs) in low-voltage distribution networks (LVDNs) often leads to network instability and congestion. Discovering the flexibility potential of behind- the-meter (BTM) assets offers a promising solution to these challenges, providing benefits for both prosumers and grid operators. This review focuses on the objectives and constraints associated with the operation of BTM flexibility resources in LVDNs. We propose a new classification framework for network-aware flexibility modelling that incorporates prosumer objectives, flexibility sources, and both local and grid-level constraints. This review identifies research gaps in prosumer-centric grid considerations, control strategies, flexibility preferences, and scenarios in the use of BTM resources.</description>

      <title>Fairness for distribution network hosting capacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of distributed generation (DG) is essential to the energy transition but poses challenges for lowvoltage (LV) distribution networks (DNs) with limited hosting capacity (HC). This study incorporates multiple fairness criteria, utilitarian, egalitarian, bounded, and bargaining, into the HC optimisation framework to assess their impact. When applied to LV feeders of different sizes and topologies, the analysis shows that bargaining and upper-bounded fairness provide the best balance between efficiency and fairness. Efficiency refers to maximising the social welfare of the LV DNs, while fairness is proportional to the minimisation of disparity in opportunity for installing DG. Feeder topology significantly influences fairness outcomes, while feeder size affects total HC and the inherent fairness of feeders. These results emphasise the importance of regulatory incentives and network designs in order to facilitate fair and efficient DG integration.</description>

      <title>Chat-Driven Reconfiguration of Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional control personalization requires users to understand optimization parameters and provide repetitive numerical feedback, creating significant barriers for non-expert users. To deal with this issue, we propose ChatMPC, a model predictive control framework that enables users to personalize control systems and adapt to environmental changes through natural language interaction. The framework operates in two modes: personalization, where users iteratively adjust control behavior to their preferences, and co-development, where users provide real-time environmental information that complements sensor data. We establish convergence guarantees under different user behavior models, demonstrating exponential convergence for consistent feedback and finite-time convergence with logarithmic interaction complexity for tolerance-based users. We validate ChatMPC through experiments in robot navigation with personalized obstacle avoidance and semi-autonomous driving with conversational obstacle reporting. Both experiments achieve real-time performance and demonstrate effective adaptation to user preferences and environmental changes.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive Environment-Aware Transformer Autoencoder for UAV-FSO with Dynamic Complexity Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks sets high demands on UAV-assisted Free Space Optical (FSO) communications, where the channel environment becomes more complex and variable due to both atmospheric turbulence and UAV-induced vibrations. These factors increase the challenge of maintaining reliable communication and require adaptive processing methods. Autoencoders are promising as they learn optimal encodings from channel data. However, existing autoencoder designs are generic and lack the specific adaptability and computational flexibility needed for UAV-FSO scenarios. To address this, we propose AEAT-AE (Adaptive Environment-aware Transformer Autoencoder), a Transformer-based framework that integrates environmental parameters into both encoder and decoder via a cross-attention mechanism. Moreover, AEAT-AE incorporates a Deep Q-Network (DQN) that dynamically selects which layers of the Transformer autoencoder to activate based on real-time environmental inputs, effectively balancing performance and computational cost. Experiments demonstrate that AEAT-AE outperforms conventional methods in bit error rate while maintaining efficient runtime, representing a novel tailored solution for next-generation UAV-FSO communications.</description>

      <title>Beamforming Control in RIS-Aided Wireless Communications: A Predictive Physics-Based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) into wireless communication systems is a promising approach for enhancing coverage and data rates by intelligently redirecting signals, through a process known as beamforming. However, the process of RIS beamforming (or passive beamforming) control is associated with multiple latency-inducing factors. As a result, by the time the beamforming is effectively updated, the channel conditions may have already changed. For example, the low update rate of localization systems becomes a critical limitation, as a mobile UE's position may change significantly between two consecutive measurements. To address this issue, this work proposes a practical and scalable physics-based solution that is effective across a wide range of UE movement models. Specifically, we propose a kinematic observer and predictor to enable proactive RIS control. From low-rate position estimates provided by a localizer, the kinematic observer infers the UE's speed and acceleration. These motion parameters are then used by a predictor to estimate the UE's future positions at a higher rate, allowing the RIS to adjust promptly and compensate for inherent delays in both the RIS control and localization systems. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, demonstrating real-time RIS adjustments with low computational complexity, even in scenarios involving rapid UE movement.</description>

      <title>Geometric Decentralized Stability Condition for Power Systems Based on Projecting DW Shells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of decentralized stability conditions has gained considerable attention due to the need to analyze heterogeneous multi-converter power systems. A recent advance is the application of the small-phase theorem, which extends the passivity theory. However, it requires the transfer function matrix to be sectorial, which may not hold in some frequency range and will result in conservatism. This letter tackles this problem by leveraging the Davis-Wielandt (DW) shells for decentralized stability analysis. We develop a geometric decentralized stability condition that visually displays how heterogeneous converters interact with the power grid and enable modular system analysis.</description>

      <title>Frequency Response Identification of Low-Order Systems: Finite-Sample Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a frequency-domain system identification method for learning low-order systems. The identification problem is formulated as the minimization of the l2 norm between the identified and measured frequency responses, with the nuclear norm of the Loewner matrix serving as a regularization term. This formulation results in an optimization problem that can be efficiently solved using standard convex optimization techniques. We derive an upper bound on the sampled-frequency complexity of the identification process and subsequently extend this bound to characterize the identification error over all frequencies. A detailed analysis of the sample complexity is provided, along with a thorough interpretation of its terms and dependencies. Finally, the efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated through an example, along with numerical simulations validating the growth rate of the sample complexity bound.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Energy and Spectral Efficiency in IoT-Cellular Networks via Active SIM-Equipped LEO Satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite communication system enhanced by an active stacked intelligent metasurface (ASIM), mounted on the backplate of the satellite solar panels to efficiently utilize limited onboard space and reduce the main satellite power amplifier requirements. The system serves multiple ground users via rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) and IoT devices through a symbiotic radio network. Multi-layer sequential processing in the ASIM improves effective channel gains and suppresses inter-user interference, outperforming active RIS and beyond-diagonal RIS designs. Three optimization approaches are evaluated: block coordinate descent with successive convex approximation (BCD-SCA), model-assisted multi-agent constraint soft actor-critic (MA-CSAC), and multi-constraint proximal policy optimization (MCPPO). Simulation results show that BCD-SCA converges fast and stably in convex scenarios without learning, MCPPO achieves rapid initial convergence with moderate stability, and MA-CSAC attains the highest long-term spectral and energy efficiency in large-scale networks. Energy-spectral efficiency trade-offs are analyzed for different ASIM elements, satellite antennas, and transmit power. Overall, the study demonstrates that integrating multi-layer ASIM with suitable optimization algorithms offers a scalable, energy-efficient, and high-performance solution for next-generation LEO satellite communications.</description>

      <title>Safety Under State Uncertainty: Robustifying Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safety-critical control is a crucial aspect of modern systems, and Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) have gained popularity as the framework of choice for ensuring safety. However, implementing a CBF requires exact knowledge of the true state, a requirement that is often violated in real-world applications where only noisy or estimated state information is available. This paper introduces the notion of Robust Control Barrier Functions (R-CBF) for ensuring safety under such state uncertainty without requiring prior knowledge of the magnitude of uncertainty. We formally characterize the class of robustifying terms that ensure robust closed-loop safety and show how a robustly safe controller can be constructed. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach through simulations and compare it to existing methods, highlighting the additional robustness and convergence guarantees it provides.</description>

      <title>One Equation to Rule Them All -- Part I: Direct Data-Driven Cascade Stabilisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we present a framework for direct data-driven control for general problems involving interconnections of dynamical systems. We first develop a method to determine the solution of a Sylvester equation from data. Such solution is used to describe a subspace that plays a role in a large variety of problems. We then provide an error analysis of the impact that noise has on this solution. This is a crucial contribution because, thanks to the interconnection approach developed throughout the article, we are able to track how the noise propagates at each stage, and thereby provide bounds on the final designs. Among the many potential problems that can be solved with this framework, we focus on three representatives: cascade stabilisation, model order reduction, and output regulation. This manuscript studies the first problem, while the companion Part II addresses the other two. For each of these settings we show how the problems can be recast in our framework. In the context of cascade stabilisation, we consider the 2-cascade problem, the effect of noise through the cascade, as well as N-cascade case, and we demonstrate that our proposed method is data efficient. The proposed designs are illustrated by means of a numerical example.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sylvester equation underpins a wide spectrum of control synthesis and systems analysis tools associated with cascade interconnections. In the preceding Part I [1] of this article, it was shown that such an equation can be reformulated using data, enabling the production of a collection of data-driven stabilisation procedures. In this second part of the article, we continue to develop the framework established in Part I to solve two important control-theoretic problems: model order reduction and output regulation. For the model order reduction problem we provide a solution from input-state measurements, from input-output measurements, and we study the effect of the noise. For the output regulation problem, we provide data-driven solutions for the static and dynamic feedback problem. The proposed designs are illustrated by means of examples.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Circuit-based Per-Panel Diode Model of Photovoltaic Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar photovoltaic systems are increasing in size and number on the grid. In regions with high penetration, such as California, PV systems serve multiple functions, including peak shaving and demand response. Therefore, the criticality of PV systems to grid operations calls for accurate models. The current practice is to represent the PV array, composed of multiple PV panels, with an aggregated single-diode model (SDM). The highly abstract model has a limited ability to capture real-world behaviors, such as partial shading and hotspots. Thus, we develop a circuit-based per-panel PV array model that uses a single diode model for each panel and interconnects them to form an array. This approach bridges the tradeoff between cell-level physics and control-dependent system-level behavior. We establish conditions for mathematical equivalence between the proposed per-panel array circuit model and the aggregated single-diode array model. We generate empirical evidence by running simulations using parameters derived from real-world PV panels. Results indicate that the proposed per-panel array model can represent the electrical behavior of the array under non-ideal conditions, such as partial shading, more accurately. With maximum power point tracking control, the proposed model is 21.2% more accurate when estimating the real power output of an array under a partial shading scenario and 8.1% more accurate under a hot spot scenario.</description>

      <title>Modular electronic microrobots with on board sensor-program steered locomotion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: True microrobots, in contrast with externally controlled microparticles, must harvest or carry their own source of energy, as well as their own (preferably programmable) microcontroller of actuators for locomotion, using information acquired from their own sensors. Building on recent published work [1], we demonstrate here, for the first time, that microrobotic smartlets, hitherto buoyancy divers, can also be equipped to navigate in 2D on surfaces, with on-board control responding to both sensor information and their internal electronic program. Fabricating modular microrobots, with all dimensions of 1mm and below, has been difficult to achieve because of competing demands for the limited surface area and the challenges of integrating and interconnecting the diverse functionalities of energy harvesting, actuation, sensing, communication, docking and control. A novel high density heterogeneous integration, via soft-substrate micro flip-chip bonding of custom CMOS and LED microchiplets onto fold-up polymer surfaces, compatible with roll-up isotropic ambient light harvesting, now makes this possible. Fabricating electrolytic bubble actuators on multiple cube-faces and connecting them to a custom sensor-controlled on-board microchiplet (lablet), allows the smartlets to locomote on wet surfaces, changing direction in response to both timed programmed control as well as programmed response to locally sensed signals. Such locomoted robotic microcubes can also move to and selectively dock with other modules via patterned surfaces. This is powered by ambient light in natural aqueous media on smooth surfaces.</description>

      <title>Input-Output Data-Driven Sensor Selection for Cyber-Physical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of input-output data-driven sensor selection for unknown cyber-physical systems (CPS). In particular, out of a large set of sensors available for use, we choose a subset of them that maximizes a metric of observability of the CPS. The considered observability metric is related to the $\mathcal{H}_2$ system norm, which quantifies the average output energy of the selected sensors over a finite or an infinite horizon. However, its computation inherently requires knowledge of the unknown matrices of the system, so we draw connections from the reinforcement learning literature and design an input-output data-driven algorithm to compute it in a model-free manner. We then use the derived data-driven metric expression to choose the best sensors of the system in polynomial time, effectively obtaining a provably convergent model-free sensor selection process. Additionally, we show how the proposed data-driven approach can be exploited to select sensors that optimize volumetric measures of observability, while also noting its applicability to the dual problem of actuator selection. Simulations are performed to demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Coordinated UAV Beamforming and Control for Directional Jamming and Nulling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient mobile jamming against eavesdroppers in wireless networks necessitates accurate coordination between mobility and antenna beamforming. We study the coordinated beamforming and control problem for a UAV that carries two omnidirectional antennas, and which uses them to jam an eavesdropper while leaving a friendly client unaffected. The UAV can shape its jamming beampattern by controlling its position, its antennas' orientation, and the phases of the antennas' interference signals. We derive a closed-form expression for the antennas' phases that guarantees zero jamming impact on the client. In addition, we determine the antennas' orientation and the UAV's position that maximizes jamming impact on the eavesdropper through an optimal control problem, optimizing the orientation pointwise and the position through the UAV's control input. Simulations show how this coordinated beamforming and control scheme enables directional GPS denial while guaranteeing zero interference towards a friendly direction.</description>

      <title>A Consensus Algorithm for Second-Order Systems Evolving on Lie Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a consensus algorithm is proposed for interacting multi-agents, which can be modeled as simple Mechanical Control Systems (MCS) evolving on a general Lie group. The standard Laplacian flow consensus algorithm for double integrator systems evolving on Euclidean spaces is extended to a general Lie group. A tracking error function is defined on a general smooth manifold for measuring the error between the configurations of two interacting agents. The stability of the desired consensus equilibrium is proved using a generalized version of Lyapunov theory and LaSalle's invariance principle applicable for systems evolving on a smooth manifold. The proposed consensus control input requires only the configuration information of the neighboring agents and does not require their velocities and inertia tensors. The design of tracking error function and consensus control inputs are demonstrated through an application of attitude consensus problem for multiple communicating rigid bodies. The consensus algorithm is numerically validated by demonstrating the attitude consensus problem.</description>

      <title>A Data-Driven Forced Oscillation Locating Method for Power Systems with Inverter-Based Resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forced Oscillations (FO) stemming from external periodic disturbances threaten power system security and stability. The increasing penetration of Inverter-Based Resources(IBRs) further introduces FO, leading to new challenges in identifying and locating FO sources in modern power systems. In this paper, a novel data-driven method for locating FO in power systems with IBRs is proposed. Unlike previous works, a unified representation of FO originating from IBRs is considered, which further facilitates the development of the FO locating algorithm. Leveraging on Sparse Identification for a Nonlinear Dynamical (SINDy), a purely data-driven methodology is developed for locating the source of FO by interpreting the proposed model from measurements. Numerical results on the WECC 240-bus system validate the performance of the proposed approach in successfully locating FO in the presence of IBRs.</description>

      <title>Fast RLS Identification Leveraging the Linearized System Sparsity: Predictive Cost Adaptive Control for Quadrotors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a centralized predictive cost adaptive control (PCAC) strategy for the position and attitude control of quadrotors. PCAC is an optimal, prediction-based control method that uses recursive least squares (RLS) to identify model parameters online, enabling adaptability in dynamic environments. Addressing challenges with black-box approaches in systems with complex couplings and fast dynamics, this study leverages the unique sparsity of quadrotor models linearized around hover points. By identifying only essential parameters related to nonlinear couplings and dynamics, this approach reduces the number of parameters to estimate, accelerates identification, and enhances stability during transients. Furthermore, the proposed control scheme removes the need for an attitude setpoint, typically required in conventional cascaded control designs.</description>

      <title>Deception in Asymmetric Information Homicidal Chauffeur Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classic Homicidal Chauffeur game is a pursuit-evasion game played in an unbounded planar environment between a pursuer constrained to move with fixed speed on curves with bounded curvature, and a slower evader with fixed speed but with simple kinematics. We introduce a new variant of this game with asymmetric information in which the evader has the ability to choose its speed among a finite set of choices that is unknown to the pursuer a priori. Therefore the pursuer is required to estimate the evader's maximum speed based on the observations so far. This formulation leads to the question of whether the evader can exploit this asymmetry by moving deceptively by first picking a slower speed to move with and then switching to a faster speed when a specified relative configuration is attained to increase the capture time as compared to moving with the maximum speed at all times. Our contributions are as follows. First, we derive optimal feedback Nash equilibrium strategies for the complete information case of this game in which the evader is allowed to vary its speed in a given interval. Second, for the version with asymmetric information, we characterize regions of initial player locations in the game space from which the evader does not have any advantage in using deceptive strategies. Finally, we provide numerical evidence of regions in the game space from which the evader can increase the capture time by moving deceptively.</description>

      <title>Multiple STAR-RISs-Empowered Multi-User Communications with Diversified QoS Provisioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a quality-of-service (QoS)-aware multi-user communication framework facilitated by multiple simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (STAR-RISs). The user groups are established based on their QoS requirements specified by the minimum data rate, which is provisioned by the optimized transmission and reflection configurations of the STAR-RISs. Particularly, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the aggregate link rate across all users, under group-specified rate requirements by jointly considering the transmit beamforming and STAR-RIS configurations. Then, we employ the Lagrangian duality with quadratic transformation to tackle the non-convexity of the objective. We decompose the problem within a block coordinate descent framework, and the subproblems are solved through convex approximation and iterated to approach the optimal solution. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in enhancing the system sum rate with guaranteed QoS performance for heterogeneous users, offering valuable insights for the deployment of STAR-RISs in future QoS-aware wireless networks.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Incremental and Ensemble Learning Approach for Forecasting Individual Electric Vehicle Charging Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electric vehicles (EVs) have the potential to reduce grid stress through smart charging strategies while simultaneously meeting user demand. This requires accurate forecasts of key charging parameters, such as energy demand and connection time. Although previous studies have made progress in this area, they have overlooked the importance of dynamic training to capture recent patterns and have excluded EV sessions with limited information, missing potential opportunities to use these data. To address these limitations, this study proposes a dual-model approach incorporating incremental learning with six machine-learning models to predict EV charging session parameters. This approach includes dynamic training updates, optimal features, and hyperparameter set selection for each model to make it more robust and inclusive. Using a data set of 170,000 measurements from the real world electric vehicle session, week-long charging parameters were predicted over a one-year period. The findings reveal a significant difference between workplace and residential charging locations regarding connection duration predictability, with workplace sessions being more predictable. The proposed stacking ensemble learning method enhanced forecasting accuracy, improving R2 by 2.83% to 43.44% across all parameters and location settings. A comparison of the two models reveals that incorporating user IDs as a feature, along with the associated historical data, is the most significant factor influencing the accuracy of the forecast. Forecasts can be used effectively in smart charging and grid management applications by incorporating uncertainty quantification techniques, allowing charge point operators to optimize charging schedules and energy management.</description>

      <title>Linear Power System Modeling and Analysis Across Wide Operating Ranges: A Hierarchical Neural State-Space Equation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing a unified small-signal model for modern, large-scale power systems that remains accurate across a wide range of operating ranges presents a formidable challenge. Traditional methods, spanning mechanistic modeling, modal identification, and deep learning, have yet to fully overcome persistent limitations in accuracy, universal applicability, and interpretability. In this paper, a novel hierarchical neural state-space equation approach is proposed to overcome these obstacles, achieving strong representation, high interpretability, and superior adaptability to both system scale and varying operating points. Specifically, we first introduce neural state-space equations integrated with virtual state observers to accurately characterize the dynamics of power system devices, even in the presence of unmeasurable states. Subsequently, a hierarchical architecture is designed to handle the modeling complexity across a wide range of operating conditions, flexibly decoupling device and grid models to effectively mitigate the curse of dimensionality. Finally, a set of spatiotemporal data transformations and a multi-stage training strategy with a multi-objective loss function is employed to enhance the models efficiency and generalization. Numerical results on the two-machine three-bus system and the Guangdong Power Grid verify the superior performance of the proposed method, presenting it as a powerful new tool for small-signal stability analysis.</description>

      <title>A Predictive Framework for Adversarial Energy Depletion in Inbound Threat Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a predictive framework for adversarial energy-depletion defense against a maneuverable inbound threat (IT). The IT solves a receding-horizon problem to minimize its own energy while reaching a high-value asset (HVA) and avoiding interceptors and static lethal zones modeled by Gaussian barriers. Expendable interceptors (EIs), coordinated by a central node (CN), maintain proximity to the HVA and patrol centers via radius-based tether costs, deny attack corridors by harassing and containing the IT, and commit to intercept only when a geometric feasibility test is confirmed. No explicit opponent-energy term is used, and the formulation is optimization-implementable. No simulations are included.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the asymptotic properties of the Two-Stage (TS) estimator -- a simulation-based parameter estimation method that constructs estimators offline from synthetic data. While TS offers significant computational advantages compared to standard approaches to estimation, its statistical properties have not been previously analyzed in the literature. Under simple assumptions, we establish that the TS estimator is strongly consistent and asymptotically normal, providing the first theoretical guarantees for this class of estimators.</description>

      <title>Tractable Stochastic Hybrid Model Predictive Control using Gaussian Processes for Repetitive Tasks in Unseen Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Improving the predictive accuracy of a dynamics model is crucial to obtaining good control performance and safety from Model Predictive Controllers (MPC). One approach involves learning unmodelled (residual) dynamics, in addition to nominal models derived from first principles. Varying residual models across an environment manifest as modes of a piecewise residual (PWR) model that requires a) identifying how modes are distributed across the environment and b) solving a computationally intensive Mixed Integer Nonlinear Program (MINLP) problem for control. We develop an iterative mapping algorithm capable of predicting time-varying mode distributions. We then develop and solve two tractable approximations of the MINLP to combine with the predictor in closed-loop to solve the overall control problem. In simulation, we first demonstrate how the approximations improve performance by 4-18% in comparison to the MINLP while achieving significantly lower computation times (upto 250x faster). We then demonstrate how the proposed mapping algorithm incrementally improves controller performance (upto 3x) over multiple iterations of a trajectory tracking control task even when the mode distributions change over time.</description>

      <title>AI Data Centers Need Pioneers to Deliver Scalable Power via Offgrid AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scalable computing revolution of the late '80s through mid- '00s forged a new technical and economic model for computing that delivered massive societal impact, but its economic benefit has driven scalability to sizes that are now exhausting the energy grid's capacity. Our time demands a new revolution in scalable energy, mirroring in key ways the scalable computing revolution; e.g., compelling economic forces, use of mass-market components, overcoming foibles of those components, judicious use of physical locality, and the the difficult integration into an effective system. The offgrid AI approach closely fits this mold, combining local mostly renewable generation and storage to power an AI data center, starting offgrid. Obstacles to delivering this approach are social, technical, and project, but the potential is massive. I argue that the offgrid-AI approach needs pioneers among both system developers and AI-data-center operators to move it quickly from concept to large-scale deployment.</description>

      <title>Flight-Ready Precise and Robust Carrier-Phase GNSS Navigation Software for Distributed Space Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the full requirements analysis, design, development, and testing of high-precision navigation flight software for Distributed Space Systems (DSS) using Carrier Phase Differential GNSS (CDGNSS). Five main contributions are made. First, a survey of flown and upcoming DSS missions with stringent precision requirements is conducted, from which a thorough requirements analysis is distilled to guide development and testing. Second, a real-time navigation functional architecture is designed, and adopts a sparse and regularized Consider Kalman Filter with options for numerical stability in-flight. The filter rigorously accounts for uncertainties in process noise, measurement noise, and biases. It tracks float ambiguities with integer resolution where possible. The covariance correlation structure is preserved under all navigation modes, including contingencies and outages. Third, a lightweight, memoryless Fault Detection, Isolation, and Recovery (FDIR) module is developed to guard against anomalous measurements, providing statistical screening and ensuring robust navigation. Fourth, the software architecture is proposed for ease of integration, with strategies presented for modularity and computational efficiency tailored to constrained flight systems. Fifth, a comprehensive test campaign is conducted, mapped to a requirements verification matrix, spanning unit, interface, software-in-the-loop, and real-time hardware-in-the-loop tests, emphasizing gradual test fidelity for efficient fault isolation. Finally, flight-like results are demonstrated using the VISORS mission, due to the generalizability of the VISORS navigation operations, and the stringency which demands sub-centimeter relative position and sub-millimeter-per-second velocity accuracy. This architecture aims to serve as a reference for next-generation DSS missions adopting CDGNSS.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While governments and international organizations have set the net-zero target to prevent a climate event horizon, practical solutions are lacking mainly because of the impracticability to completely replace combustion processes. Hence, in this paper, we first design a compartmental network whose states must remain in the nonnegative orthant for physical consistency and in which the carbon dioxide emissions result from the combustion of diesel in vehicles and gas in house heaters. Then, we designed both full-state and output-feedback linear-quadratic regulators of the compartmental network to bring the mass of carbon dioxide to the pre-industrial era, which is reached in approximately 25 and 60 days, respectively. The output feedback tolerates for 6 days the combustion taking place in 5,000 vehicles and in 10,000 house heating systems, it meets the net-zero target, and it nullifies the extraction of finite natural resources. The tropospheric temperature with closed-loop reaches the equilibrium at 133 {\deg}C after 16.4 years; while such an high value requires to further investigate with climate experts the model of the dynamics of the temperature, this work is a first step in designing optimal network control systems for climate stability.

      <title>Autonomous UAV Flight Navigation in Confined Spaces: A Reinforcement Learning Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspecting confined industrial infrastructure, such as ventilation shafts, is a hazardous and inefficient task for humans. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) offer a promising alternative, but GPS-denied environments require robust control policies to prevent collisions. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has emerged as a powerful framework for developing such policies, and this paper provides a comparative study of two leading DRL algorithms for this task: the on-policy Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and the off-policy Soft Actor-Critic (SAC). The training was conducted with procedurally generated duct environments in Genesis simulation environment. A reward function was designed to guide a drone through a series of waypoints while applying a significant penalty for collisions. PPO learned a stable policy that completed all evaluation episodes without collision, producing smooth trajectories. By contrast, SAC consistently converged to a suboptimal behavior that traversed only the initial segments before failure. These results suggest that, in hazard-dense navigation, the training stability of on-policy methods can outweigh the nominal sample efficiency of off-policy algorithms. More broadly, the study provides evidence that procedurally generated, high-fidelity simulations are effective testbeds for developing and benchmarking robust navigation policies.</description>

      <title>Predictability Enables Parallelization of Nonlinear State Space Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of parallel computing hardware has made it increasingly important to understand which nonlinear state space models can be efficiently parallelized. Recent advances like DEER (arXiv:2309.12252) or DeepPCR (arXiv:2309.16318) have shown that evaluating a state space model can be recast as solving a parallelizable optimization problem, and sometimes this approach can yield dramatic speed-ups in evaluation time. However, the factors that govern the difficulty of these optimization problems remain unclear, limiting the larger adoption of the technique. In this work, we establish a precise relationship between the dynamics of a nonlinear system and the conditioning of its corresponding optimization formulation. We show that the predictability of a system, defined as the degree to which small perturbations in state influence future behavior, impacts the number of optimization steps required for evaluation. In predictable systems, the state trajectory can be computed in $O((\log T)^2)$ time, where $T$ is the sequence length, a major improvement over the conventional sequential approach. In contrast, chaotic or unpredictable systems exhibit poor conditioning, with the consequence that parallel evaluation converges too slowly to be useful. Importantly, our theoretical analysis demonstrates that for predictable systems, the optimization problem is always well-conditioned, whereas for unpredictable systems, the conditioning degrades exponentially as a function of the sequence length. We validate our claims through extensive experiments, providing practical guidance on when nonlinear dynamical systems can be efficiently parallelized, and highlighting predictability as a key design principle for parallelizable models.</description>

      <title>Fairness of Energy Distribution Mechanisms in Collective Self-Consumption Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In several European countries, regulatory frameworks now allow households to form energy communities and trade energy locally via local energy markets (LEMs). While multiple mechanisms exist to allocate locally produced energy among members, their fairness remains insufficiently understood despite energy justice being a key concern for communities. This paper first provides a thorough description of the collective self-consumption process in France, offering a real world framework for researchers. We then review the main types of fairness relevant to LEMs and identify appropriate indicators for each, including a new scalable indicator to evaluate meritocratic fairness. Using simulations across 250 randomly generated residential communities of 20 households, we assess and compare fairness across different LEM distribution mechanisms. Results show that average financial savings reach 12% with 40% PV uptake. Among the four widely used LEM mechanisms assessed, glass-filling with prioritization yields the highest egalitarian and min max fairness. Double auction and pro rata schemes promote meritocracy, while standard glass filling offers a strong balance across fairness objectives.</description>

      <title>Relative Navigation and Dynamic Target Tracking for Autonomous Underwater Proximity Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating a target's 6-DoF motion in underwater proximity operations is difficult because the chaser lacks target-side proprioception and the available relative observations are sparse, noisy, and often partial (e.g., Ultra-Short Baseline (USBL) positions). Without a motion prior, factor-graph maximum a posteriori estimation is underconstrained: consecutive target states are weakly linked and orientation can drift. We propose a generalized constant-twist motion prior defined on the tangent space of Lie groups that enforces temporally consistent trajectories across all degrees of freedom; in SE(3) it couples translation and rotation in the body frame. We present a ternary factor and derive its closed-form Jacobians based on standard Lie group operations, enabling drop-in use for trajectories on arbitrary Lie groups. We evaluate two deployment modes: (A) an SE(3)-only representation that regularizes orientation even when only position is measured, and (B) a mode with boundary factors that switches the target representation between SE(3) and 3D position while applying the same generalized constant-twist prior across representation changes. Validation on a real-world dynamic docking scenario dataset shows consistent ego-target trajectory estimation through USBL-only and optical relative measurement segments with an improved relative tracking accuracy compared to the noisy measurements to the target. Because the construction relies on standard Lie group primitives, it is portable across state manifolds and sensing modalities.</description>

      <title>Stability Optimization and Analysis of Energy Flow Networks versus Different Centrality Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimizing the stability and control performance of complex networks often hinges on effectively identifying critical nodes for targeted intervention. Due to their inherent complexity and high dimensionality, large-scale energy flow networks, prevalent in domains like power grids, transportation, and financial systems, present unique challenges in selecting optimal nodes for resource allocation. While numerous centrality measurements, such as Katz centrality, eigenvector centrality, closeness centrality, betweenness centrality, and PageRank, have been proposed to evaluate node importance, the impact of different centrality metrics on stability outcomes remains inadequately understood. Moreover, networks manifest diverse structural characteristics-including small-world, scale-free, and random graph properties-which further complicates the optimization problem. This paper systematically investigates how various node centrality measurements influence control stability across representative complex network structures. A unified energy-flow dynamical model is developed, and performance metrics such as the L1 norm are employed to quantify the network stability implications of employing different centrality metrics. Extensive numerical simulations over statistically generated network ensembles reveal significant variances in stability outcomes, highlighting the crucial role of centrality selection. The findings underscore the sensitivity of energy-flow stability to seemingly minor changes in topological node rankings, providing practical insights for enhancing control efficiency and robustness in real-world networked systems.</description>

      <title>A Rapid Iterative Trajectory Planning Method for Automated Parking through Differential Flatness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As autonomous driving continues to advance, automated parking is becoming increasingly essential. However, significant challenges arise when implementing path velocity decomposition (PVD) trajectory planning for automated parking. The primary challenge is ensuring rapid and precise collision-free trajectory planning, which is often in conflict. The secondary challenge involves maintaining sufficient control feasibility of the planned trajectory, particularly at gear shifting points (GSP). This paper proposes a PVD-based rapid iterative trajectory planning (RITP) method to solve the above challenges. The proposed method effectively balances the necessity for time efficiency and precise collision avoidance through a novel collision avoidance framework. Moreover, it enhances the overall control feasibility of the planned trajectory by incorporating the vehicle kinematics model and including terminal smoothing constraints (TSC) at GSP during path planning. Specifically, the proposed method leverages differential flatness to ensure the planned path adheres to the vehicle kinematic model. Additionally, it utilizes TSC to maintain curvature continuity at GSP, thereby enhancing the control feasibility of the overall trajectory. The simulation results demonstrate superior time efficiency and tracking errors compared to model-integrated and other iteration-based trajectory planning methods. In the real-world experiment, the proposed method was implemented and validated on a ROS-based vehicle, demonstrating the applicability of the RITP method for real vehicles.</description>

      <title>PowerChain: Automating Distribution Grid Analysis with Agentic AI Workflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the rapid pace of electrification and decarbonization, distribution grid (DG) operation and planning are becoming more complex, necessitating advanced computational analyses to ensure grid reliability and resilience. State-of-the-art DG analyses rely on disparate workflows of complex models, functions, and data pipelines, which require expert knowledge and are challenging to automate. Many small-scale utilities and cooperatives lack a large R&amp;D workforce and therefore cannot use advanced analysis at scale. To address this gap, we develop a novel agentic AI system, PowerChain, to solve unseen DG analysis tasks via automated agentic orchestration and large language models (LLMs) function-calling. Given a natural language query, PowerChain dynamically generates and executes an ordered sequence of domain-aware functions guided by the semantics of an expert-built power systems function pool and a select reference set of known, expert-generated workflow-query pairs. Our results show that PowerChain can produce expert-level workflows with both GPT-5 and open-source Qwen models on complex, unseen DG analysis tasks operating on real utility data.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we explore the use of Convolutional Neural Networks for improving train speed estimation accuracy, addressing the complex challenges of modern railway systems. We investigate three CNN architectures - single-branch 2D, single-branch 1D, and multiple-branch models - and compare them with the Adaptive Kalman Filter. We analyse their performance using simulated train operation datasets with and without Wheel Slide Protection activation. Our results reveal that CNN-based approaches, especially the multiple-branch model, demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness compared to traditional methods, particularly under challenging operational conditions. These findings highlight the potential of deep learning techniques to enhance railway safety and operational efficiency by more effectively capturing intricate patterns in complex transportation datasets.</description>

Abstract: We explore natural user interactions using a virtual reality simulation of a robot arm for assembly tasks. Using a Wizard-of-Oz study, participants completed collaborative LEGO and instructive PCB assembly tasks, with the robot responding under experimenter control. We collected voice, hand tracking, and gaze data from users. Statistical analyses revealed that instructive and collaborative scenarios elicit distinct behaviors and adopted strategies, particularly as tasks progress. Users tended to use put-that-there language in spatially ambiguous contexts and more descriptive instructions in spatially clear ones. Our contributions include the identification of natural interaction strategies through analyses of collected data, as well as the supporting dataset, to guide the understanding and design of natural multimodal user interfaces for instructive interaction with systems in virtual reality.</description>

      <title>Collaborative-Online-Learning-Enabled Distributionally Robust Motion Control for Multi-Robot Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a novel COllaborative-Online-Learning (COOL)-enabled motion control framework for multi-robot systems to avoid collision amid randomly moving obstacles whose motion distributions are partially observable through decentralized data streams. To address the notable challenge of data acquisition due to occlusion, a COOL approach based on the Dirichlet process mixture model is proposed to efficiently extract motion distribution information by exchanging among robots selected learning structures. By leveraging the fine-grained local-moment information learned through COOL, a data-stream-driven ambiguity set for obstacle motion is constructed. We then introduce a novel ambiguity set propagation method, which theoretically admits the derivation of the ambiguity sets for obstacle positions over the entire prediction horizon by utilizing obstacle current positions and the ambiguity set for obstacle motion. Additionally, we develop a compression scheme with its safety guarantee to automatically adjust the complexity and granularity of the ambiguity set by aggregating basic ambiguity sets that are close in a measure space, thereby striking an attractive trade-off between control performance and computation time. Then the probabilistic collision-free trajectories are generated through distributionally robust optimization problems. The distributionally robust obstacle avoidance constraints based on the compressed ambiguity set are equivalently reformulated by deriving separating hyperplanes through tractable semi-definite programming. Finally, we establish the probabilistic collision avoidance guarantee and the long-term tracking performance guarantee for the proposed framework. The numerical simulations are used to demonstrate the efficacy and superiority of the proposed approach compared with state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Linear Dynamics meets Linear MDPs: Closed-Form Optimal Policies via Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many applications -- including power systems, robotics, and economics -- involve a dynamical system interacting with a stochastic and hard-to-model environment. We adopt a reinforcement learning approach to control such systems. Specifically, we consider a deterministic, discrete-time, linear, time-invariant dynamical system coupled with a feature-based linear Markov process with an unknown transition kernel. The objective is to learn a control policy that optimizes a quadratic cost over the system state, the Markov process, and the control input. Leveraging both components of the system, we derive an explicit parametric form for the optimal state-action value function and the corresponding optimal policy. Our model is distinct in combining aspects of both classical Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) and linear Markov decision process (MDP) frameworks. This combination retains the implementation simplicity of LQR, while allowing for sophisticated stochastic modeling afforded by linear MDPs, without estimating the transition probabilities, thereby enabling direct policy improvement. We use tools from control theory to provide theoretical guarantees on the stability of the system under the learned policy and provide a sample complexity analysis for its convergence to the optimal policy. We illustrate our results via a numerical example that demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach in learning the optimal control policy under partially known stochastic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Grasping in Legged Robots: A Deep Learning Approach to Loco-Manipulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quadruped robots have emerged as highly efficient and versatile platforms, excelling in navigating complex and unstructured terrains where traditional wheeled robots might fail. Equipping these robots with manipulator arms unlocks the advanced capability of loco-manipulation to perform complex physical interaction tasks in areas ranging from industrial automation to search-and-rescue missions. However, achieving precise and adaptable grasping in such dynamic scenarios remains a significant challenge, often hindered by the need for extensive real-world calibration and pre-programmed grasp configurations. This paper introduces a deep learning framework designed to enhance the grasping capabilities of quadrupeds equipped with arms, focusing on improved precision and adaptability. Our approach centers on a sim-to-real methodology that minimizes reliance on physical data collection. We developed a pipeline within the Genesis simulation environment to generate a synthetic dataset of grasp attempts on common objects. By simulating thousands of interactions from various perspectives, we created pixel-wise annotated grasp-quality maps to serve as the ground truth for our model. This dataset was used to train a custom CNN with a U-Net-like architecture that processes multi-modal input from an onboard RGB and depth cameras, including RGB images, depth maps, segmentation masks, and surface normal maps. The trained model outputs a grasp-quality heatmap to identify the optimal grasp point. We validated the complete framework on a four-legged robot. The system successfully executed a full loco-manipulation task: autonomously navigating to a target object, perceiving it with its sensors, predicting the optimal grasp pose using our model, and performing a precise grasp. This work proves that leveraging simulated training with advanced sensing offers a scalable and effective solution for object handling.</description>

      <title>Distributed Implementation of Variational Quantum Eigensolver to Solve QUBO Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a distributed algorithm and implementation of the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), termed distributed VQE (DVQE). DVQE, provided as an open-source Python package, enables the execution of parameterized quantum circuits across multiple logical quantum processing units (QPUs) in a distributed fashion. This approach addresses key hardware limitations of near-term quantum devices, including restricted qubit counts and limited circuit depth. Distributed ansatz circuits are constructed to preserve the quantum state fidelity of their monolithic counterparts, allowing consistent energy estimation while distributing the computational load. To improve the convergence and robustness of the optimization loop for identifying the variational parameters of the DVQE ansatz circuit, we use the ADAM optimizer in combination with metaheuristic initialization strategies, which outperform random initialization across various test cases. The complete DVQE pipeline is implemented in a modular Python package that accepts QUBO problems as input and supports monolithic and distributed execution modes. The framework leverages Qiskit to construct and simulate distributed circuits, and includes an internal greedy algorithm for automatic qubit allocation across multiple QPUs. Simulation results on QUBO benchmarks confirm the correctness of the approach, paving the way for real QPU deployment and further exploration of distributed quantum optimization. \textbf{The simulator is publicly available on \href{https://github.com/LSU-RAISE-LAB/DVQE.git}{GitHub} under a package named raiselab, with a collection of tutorial examples.}</description>

      <title>First and Second Order Optimal $\mathcal{H}_2$ Model Reduction for Linear Continuous-Time Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the optimal $\mathcal{H}_2$ model reduction problem for single-input single-output (SISO) continuous-time linear time-invariant (LTI) systems. A semi-definite relaxation (SDR) approach is proposed to determine globally optimal interpolation points, providing an effective way to compute the reduced-order models via Krylov projection-based methods. In contrast to iterative approaches, we use the controllability Gramian and the moment-matching conditions to recast the model reduction problem as a convex optimization by introducing an upper bound $\gamma$ to minimize the $\mathcal{H}_2$ norm of the model reduction error system. We also prove that the relaxation is exact for first order reduced models and demonstrate, through examples, that it is exact for second order reduced models. We compare the performance of our proposed method with other iterative approaches and shift-selection methods on examples. Importantly, our approach also provides a means to verify the global optimality of known locally convergent methods.</description>

      <title>SuperGen: An Efficient Ultra-high-resolution Video Generation System with Sketching and Tiling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have recently achieved remarkable success in generative tasks (e.g., image and video generation), and the demand for high-quality content (e.g., 2K/4K videos) is rapidly increasing across various domains. However, generating ultra-high-resolution videos on existing standard-resolution (e.g., 720p) platforms remains challenging due to the excessive re-training requirements and prohibitively high computational and memory costs. To this end, we introduce SuperGen, an efficient tile-based framework for ultra-high-resolution video generation. SuperGen features a novel training-free algorithmic innovation with tiling to successfully support a wide range of resolutions without additional training efforts while significantly reducing both memory footprint and computational complexity. Moreover, SuperGen incorporates a tile-tailored, adaptive, region-aware caching strategy that accelerates video generation by exploiting redundancy across denoising steps and spatial regions. SuperGen also integrates cache-guided, communication-minimized tile parallelism for enhanced throughput and minimized latency. Evaluations demonstrate that SuperGen harvests the maximum performance gains while achieving high output quality across various benchmarks.</description>

      <title>modelSolver: A Symbolic Model-Driven Solver for Power Network Simulation and Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of advanced software tools for power system analysis requires extensive programming expertise. Even when using open-source tools, programming skills are essential to modify built-in models. This can be particularly challenging for domain experts who lack coding proficiency. This paper introduces modelSolver, a software solution with a new framework centered around symbolic mathematical modeling. The proposed paradigm facilitates defining models through intuitive mathematical expressions, thus eliminating the need for traditional programming constructs such as arrays, loops, and sparse matrix computations. The modelSolver focuses on power flow and state estimation using an open-box approach, which allows users to specify custom models using either real or complex variables. Unlike existing tools that rely on hard-coded models, modelSolver enables the representation of a wide range of advanced functionalities, including power flow with voltage regulators and load tap changers, continuation power flow, and Gauss-Newton state estimation with equality constraints. Compatibility with MATPOWER is ensured via a converter that automates importing data files. The framework prioritizes model-driven development and empowers domain experts to focus on power system modeling without programming barriers. It aims to simplify power system computations, making them more accessible to students, scientists, and practitioners.</description>

      <title>AQ-PCDSys: An Adaptive Quantized Planetary Crater Detection System for Autonomous Space Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous planetary exploration missions are critically dependent on real-time, accurate environmental perception for navigation and hazard avoidance. However, deploying deep learning models on the resource-constrained computational hardware of planetary exploration platforms remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces the Adaptive Quantized Planetary Crater Detection System (AQ-PCDSys), a novel framework specifically engineered for real-time, onboard deployment in the computationally constrained environments of space exploration missions. AQ-PCDSys synergistically integrates a Quantized Neural Network (QNN) architecture, trained using Quantization-Aware Training (QAT), with an Adaptive Multi-Sensor Fusion (AMF) module. The QNN architecture significantly optimizes model size and inference latency suitable for real-time onboard deployment in space exploration missions, while preserving high accuracy. The AMF module intelligently fuses data from Optical Imagery (OI) and Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) at the feature level, utilizing an Adaptive Weighting Mechanism (AWM) to dynamically prioritize the most relevant and reliable sensor modality based on planetary ambient conditions. This approach enhances detection robustness across diverse planetary landscapes. Paired with Multi-Scale Detection Heads specifically designed for robust and efficient detection of craters across a wide range of sizes, AQ-PCDSys provides a computationally efficient, reliable and accurate solution for planetary crater detection, a critical capability for enabling the next generation of autonomous planetary landing, navigation, and scientific exploration.</description>

Abstract: Autonomous space robotics is poised to play a vital role in future space missions, particularly for In-space Servicing, Assembly, and Manufacturing (ISAM). A key capability in such missions is the Robot-to-Robot (R2R) handover of mission-critical objects. This work presents a dynamic model of a dual-arm space manipulator system and compares various tracking control laws. The key contributions of this work are the development of a cooperative manipulator dynamic model and the comparative analysis of control laws to support autonomous R2R handovers in ISAM scenarios.</description>

      <title>Realizing Reduced and Sparse Biochemical Reaction Networks from Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a direct optimization framework for learning reduced and sparse chemical reaction networks (CRNs) from time-series trajectory data. In contrast to widely used indirect methods-such as those based on sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy)-which infer reaction dynamics by fitting numerically estimated derivatives, our approach fits entire trajectories by solving a dynamically constrained optimization problem. This formulation enables the construction of reduced CRNs that are both low-dimensional and sparse, while preserving key dynamical behaviors of the original system. We develop an accelerated proximal gradient algorithm to efficiently solve the resulting non-convex optimization problem. Through illustrative examples, including a Drosophila circadian oscillator and a glycolytic oscillator, we demonstrate the ability of our method to recover accurate and interpretable reduced-order CRNs. Notably, the direct approach avoids the derivative estimation step and mitigates error accumulation issues inherent in indirect methods, making it a robust alternative for data-driven CRN realizations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The urgent need for renewable energy expansion, particularly wind power, is hindered by conflicts with wildlife conservation. To address this, we developed BirdRecorder, an advanced AI-based anti-collision system to protect endangered birds, especially the red kite (Milvus milvus). Integrating robotics, telemetry, and high-performance AI algorithms, BirdRecorder aims to detect, track, and classify avian species within a range of 800 m to minimize bird-turbine collisions.
  BirdRecorder integrates advanced AI methods with optimized hardware and software architectures to enable real-time image processing. Leveraging Single Shot Detector (SSD) for detection, combined with specialized hardware acceleration and tracking algorithms, our system achieves high detection precision while maintaining the speed necessary for real-time decision-making. By combining these components, BirdRecorder outperforms existing approaches in both accuracy and efficiency.
  In this paper, we summarize results on field tests and performance of the BirdRecorder system. By bridging the gap between renewable energy expansion and wildlife conservation, BirdRecorder contributes to a more sustainable coexistence of technology and nature.</description>

      <title>Robust Sensor-Limited Control with Safe Input-Output Constraints for Hydraulic In-Wheel Motor Drive Mobility Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11823v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In-wheel drive (IWD) systems enhance the responsiveness, traction, and maintenance efficiency of vehicles by enabling each wheel to operate independently. This paper proposes a novel robust torque-observed valve-based control (RTOVC) framework to address velocity tracking in hydraulic IWDs that actuate heavy-duty wheeled mobile robots (HWMRs), considering such challenges as wheel slippages, sensor limitations, rough terrains, and modeling uncertainties. To overcome the sensor-dependent control systems associated with the closed-loop torque/pressure in hydraulic IWD-actuated HWMRs, a robust observer network based on an adaptive barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) is proposed to estimate the required in-wheel motor torque to track the velocity references. Then, another adaptive BLF for valve control signals is employed to modulate the hydraulic fluid to generate the estimated torque for each IWD. The RTOVC strategy ensures user-defined safety within the logarithmic BLF framework by constraining the valve control signal, actual velocity, velocity tracking error, and torque of each hydraulic IWD in an HWMR to avoid exceeding specified limits. Despite its safety constraints, external disturbances, and modeling uncertainties, robustness and uniformly exponential stability of the RTOVC-applied hydraulic IWD mechanism are ensured in HWMRs. Experimental investigations using a 6,500-kg HWMR, actuated by four independent IWDs under intense disturbances and safety-defined constraints, validate the performance of the RTOVC.</description>

      <title>Model-Free Generic Robust Control for Servo-Driven Actuation Mechanisms with Layered Insight into Energy Conversions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11828v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To advance theoretical solutions and address limitations in modeling complex servo-driven actuation systems experiencing high non-linearity and load disturbances, this paper aims to design a practical model-free generic robust control (GRC) framework for these mechanisms. This framework is intended to be applicable across all actuator systems encompassing electrical, hydraulic, or pneumatic servomechanisms, while also functioning within complex interactions among dynamic components and adhering to control input constraints. In this respect, the state-space model of actuator systems is decomposed into smaller subsystems that incorporate the first principle equation of actuator motion dynamics and interactive energy conversion equations. This decomposition operates under the assumption that the comprehensive model of the servo-driven actuator system and energy conversion, uncertainties, load disturbances, and their bounds are unknown. Then, the GRC employs subsystem-based adaptive control strategies for each state-variant subsystem separately. Despite control input constraints and the unknown interactive system model, the GRC-applied actuator mechanism ensures uniform exponential stability and robustness in tracking desired motions. It features straightforward implementation, experimentally evaluated by applying it to two industrial applications.</description>

Abstract: The implementation of cyber-physical systems in real-world applications is challenged by safety requirements in the presence of sensor threats. Most cyber-physical systems, especially multi-sensor systems, struggle to detect sensor attacks when the attack model is unknown. In this paper, we tackle this issue by proposing a Gaussian-Bernoulli Secure (GBS) estimator, which transforms the detection problem into an optimal estimation problem concerning the system state and observation indicators. It encompasses two theoretical sub-problems: sequential state estimation with partial observations and estimation updates with disordered new observations. Within the framework of Kalman filter, we derive closed-form solutions for these two problems. However, due to their computational inefficiency, we propose the iterative approach employing proximal gradient descent to update the estimation in less time. Finally, we conduct experiments from three perspectives: computational efficiency, detection performance, and estimation error. Our GBS estimator demonstrates significant improvements over other methods.</description>

Abstract: We propose integrating an approximation of a predictive control barrier function (PCBF) in a safety filter framework, resulting in a prediction horizon independent formulation. The PCBF is defined through the value function of an optimal control problem and ensures invariance as well as stability of a safe set within a larger domain of attraction. We provide a theoretical analysis of the proposed algorithm, establishing input-to-state stability of the safe set with respect to approximation errors as well as exogenous disturbances. Furthermore, we propose a continuous extension of the PCBF within the safe set, reducing the impact of learning errors on filter interventions. We demonstrate the stability properties and computational advantages of the proposed algorithm on a linear system example and its application as a safety filter for miniature race cars in simulation.</description>

      <title>Real-time Traffic Simulation and Management for Large-scale Urban Air Mobility: Integrating Route Guidance and Collision Avoidance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01235v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given the spatial heterogeneity of land use patterns in most cities, large-scale UAM deployments will likely focus on specific areas, such as intertransfer traffic between suburbs and city centers. However, large-scale UAM operations connecting multiple origin-destination pairs raise concerns about air traffic safety and efficiency due to potential conflict movements, particularly at major conflict points analogous to roadway junctions. To meet the safety and efficiency requirements of future UAM operations, this work proposes an air traffic management framework that integrates route guidance and collision avoidance. The route guidance mechanism optimizes aircraft distribution across both spatial and temporal dimensions by regulating their paths (composed of waypoints). Given the optimized paths, the collision avoidance algorithm generates collision-free aircraft trajectories between waypoints in the 3D space. To enable large-scale applications, we develop fast approximation methods for centralized path planning and adopt the velocity obstacle model for distributed collision avoidance. To our knowledge, this work is one of the first to integrate route guidance and collision avoidance for UAM. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework enables efficient and flexible UAM operations, including air traffic assignment, local congestion mitigation, and dynamic no-fly zone management. Compared with a collision-free baseline strategy, the proposed framework achieves considerable improvements in traffic safety and efficiency, with increases in the average minimum separation (+98.2%), the average travel speed (+70.2%), and the trip completion rate (+130%), along with a reduction in the energy consumption (-23.0%). The proposed framework demonstrates its potential for real-time traffic simulation and management in large-scale UAM systems.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Yet Formal Policy Synthesis for Stochastic Nonlinear Dynamical Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01191v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The automated synthesis of control policies for stochastic dynamical systems presents significant challenges. A standard approach is to construct a finite-state abstraction of the continuous system, typically represented as a Markov decision process (MDP). However, generating abstractions is challenging when (1) the system's dynamics are nonlinear, and/or (2) we do not have complete knowledge of the dynamics. In this work, we introduce a novel data-driven abstraction technique for nonlinear Lipschitz continuous dynamical systems with additive stochastic noise that addresses both of these issues. As a key step, we use samples of the dynamics to learn the enabled actions and transition probabilities of the abstraction. We represent abstractions as MDPs with intervals of transition probabilities, known as interval MDPs (IMDPs). These abstractions enable the synthesis of policies for the concrete nonlinear system, with probably approximately correct (PAC) guarantees on the probability of satisfying a specified control objective. Our numerical experiments illustrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach in achieving reliable control under uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Output-feedback model predictive control under dynamic uncertainties using integral quadratic constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we propose an output-feedback tube-based model predictive control (MPC) scheme for linear systems under dynamic uncertainties that are described via integral quadratic constraints (IQC). By leveraging IQCs, a large class of nonlinear and dynamic uncertainties can be addressed. We leverage recent IQC synthesis tools to design a dynamic controller and an estimator that are robust to these uncertainties and minimize the size of the resulting constraint tightening in the MPC. Thereby, we show that the robust estimation problem using IQCs with peak-to-peak performance can be convexified. We guarantee recursive feasibility, robust constraint satisfaction, and input-to-state stability of the resulting MPC scheme.</description>

      <title>Synergising Hierarchical Data Centers and Power Networks: A Privacy-Preserving Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20575v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the era of digitization, data centers have emerged as integral contributors sustaining our interlinked world, bearing responsibility for an increasing proportion of the world's energy consumption. To facilitate the their fast rollout while progressing towards net-zero energy systems, the synergy of hierarchical data centers (cloud-fog-edge) and power networks can play a pivotal role. However, existing centralized co-dispatch manners encroach on the privacy of different agents within the integrated systems, meanwhile suffering from the combinatorial explosion. In this research, we propose a near-optimal distributed privacy-preserving approach to solve the non-convex synergy (day-ahead co-dispatch) problem. The synergy problem is formulated as a mixed integer quadratically constrained quadratic programming considering both communication and energy conservation, where Lyapunov optimization is introduced to balance operating costs and uncertain communication delays. To mitigate impacts of the highly non-convex nature, the normalized multi-parametric disaggregation technique is leveraged to reformulate the problem into a mixed integer non-linear programming. To further overcome non-smoothness of the reformulated problem, the customized $\ell_1-$surrogate Lagrangian relaxation method with convergence guarantees is proposed to solve the problem in a distributed privacy-preserving manner. The effectiveness, optimality, and scalability of the proposed methodologies for the synergy problem are validated via numerical simulations. Simulation results also indicate that computing tasks can be delayed and migrated within the hierarchical data centers, demonstrating the flexible resource allocation capabilities of the hierarchical data center architecture, further facilitating peak load balancing in the power network.</description>

      <title>Co-Investment with Payoff-Sharing Mechanism for Cooperative Decision-Making in Network Design Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Network-based systems are inherently interconnected, with the design and performance of subnetworks being interdependent. However, the decisions of self-interested operators may lead to suboptimal outcomes for users and the overall system. This paper explores cooperative mechanisms that can simultaneously benefit both operators and users. We address this challenge using a game-theoretical framework that integrates both non-cooperative and cooperative game theory. In the non-cooperative stage, we propose a network design game in which subnetwork decision-makers strategically design local infrastructures. In the cooperative stage, co-investment with payoff-sharing mechanism is developed to enlarge collective benefits and fairly distribute them. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, we conduct case studies on the Sioux Falls network and real-world public transport networks in Zurich and Winterthur, Switzerland. Our evaluation considers impacts on environmental sustainability, social welfare, and economic efficiency. The proposed framework provides a foundation for improving interdependent networked systems by enabling strategic cooperation among self-interested operators.</description>

      <title>Recursive Gaussian Process Regression with Integrated Monotonicity Assumptions for Control Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14715v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an extension to the recursive Gaussian Process (RGP) regression that enables the satisfaction of inequality constraints and is well suited for a real-time execution in control applications. The soft inequality constraints are integrated by introducing an additional extended Kalman Filter (EKF) update step using pseudo-measurements. The sequential formulation of the algorithm and several developed heuristics ensure both the performance and a low computational effort of the algorithm. A special focus lies on an efficient consideration of monotonicity assumptions for GPs in the form of inequality constraints. The algorithm is statistically validated in simulations, where the possible advantages in comparison with the standard RGP algorithm become obvious. The paper is concluded with a successful experimental validation of the developed algorithm for the monotonicity-preserving learning of heat transfer values for the control of a vapor compression cycle evaporator, leveraging a previously published partial input output linearization (IOL).</description>

      <title>On the Foundation of Distributionally Robust Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09018v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the need for a robust policy in the face of environment shifts between training and deployment, we contribute to the theoretical foundation of distributionally robust reinforcement learning (DRRL). This is accomplished through a comprehensive modeling framework centered around robust Markov decision processes (RMDPs). This framework obliges the decision maker to choose an optimal policy under the worst-case distributional shift orchestrated by an adversary. By unifying and extending existing formulations, we rigorously construct RMDPs that embrace various modeling attributes for both the decision maker and the adversary. These attributes include the structure of information availability-covering history-dependent, Markov, and Markov time-homogeneous dynamics-as well as constraints on the shifts induced by the adversary, with a focus on SA- and S-rectangularity. Within this RMDP framework, we investigate conditions for the existence or absence of the dynamic programming principle (DPP). From an algorithmic standpoint, the existence of DPP holds significant implications, as the vast majority of existing data and computationally efficient DRRL algorithms are reliant on the DPP. To investigate its existence, we systematically analyze various combinations of controller and adversary attributes, presenting streamlined proofs based on a unified methodology. We then construct counterexamples for settings where a fully general DPP fails to hold and establish asymptotically optimal history-dependent policies for key scenarios where the DPP is absent.</description>

      <title>Generalizations of data-driven balancing: What to sample for different balancing-based reduced models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12561v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quadrature-based balanced truncation (QuadBT) framework of arXiv:2104.01006 is a non-intrusive reformulation of balanced truncation (BT), a classical projection-based model-order reduction technique for linear systems. QuadBT is non-intrusive in the sense that it builds approximate balanced truncation reduced-order models entirely from system response data, e.g., transfer function measurements, without the need to reference an explicit state-space realization of the underlying full-order model. In this work, we generalize the QuadBT framework to other types of balanced truncation model reduction. Namely, we show what transfer function data are required to compute data-driven reduced models by balanced stochastic truncation, positive-real balanced truncation, and bounded-real balanced truncation. In each case, these data are evaluations of particular spectral factors associated with the system of interest. These results lay the theoretical foundation for data-driven reformulations of the aforementioned BT variants. Although it is not yet clear how to compute or obtain these spectral factor data in a practical real-world setting, examples using synthetic (numerically evaluated) transfer function data are included to validate the data-based reduced models.</description>

Abstract: Condition monitoring is essential for ensuring the safety, reliability, and efficiency of modern industrial systems. With the increasing complexity of industrial processes, artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a powerful tool for fault detection and diagnosis, attracting growing interest from both academia and industry. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of intelligent condition monitoring methods, with a particular emphasis on chemical plants and the widely used Tennessee Eastman Process (TEP) benchmark. State-of-the-art machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms are reviewed, highlighting their strengths, limitations, and applicability to industrial fault detection and diagnosis. Special attention is given to key challenges, including imbalanced and unlabeled data, and to strategies by which models can address these issues. Furthermore, comparative analyses of algorithm performance are presented to guide method selection in practical scenarios. This survey is intended to benefit both newcomers and experienced researchers by consolidating fundamental concepts, summarizing recent advances, and outlining open challenges and promising directions for intelligent condition monitoring in industrial plants.</description>

      <title>SINDy-RL: Interpretable and Efficient Model-Based Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09110v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has shown significant promise for uncovering sophisticated control policies that interact in complex environments, such as stabilizing a tokamak fusion reactor or minimizing the drag force on an object in a fluid flow. However, DRL requires an abundance of training examples and may become prohibitively expensive for many applications. In addition, the reliance on deep neural networks often results in an uninterpretable, black-box policy that may be too computationally expensive to use with certain embedded systems. Recent advances in sparse dictionary learning, such as the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy), have shown promise for creating efficient and interpretable data-driven models in the low-data regime. In this work we introduce SINDy-RL, a unifying framework for combining SINDy and DRL to create efficient, interpretable, and trustworthy representations of the dynamics model, reward function, and control policy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches on benchmark control environments and flow control problems, including gust mitigation on a 3D NACA 0012 airfoil at $Re=1000$. SINDy-RL achieves comparable performance to modern DRL algorithms using significantly fewer interactions in the environment and results in an interpretable control policy orders of magnitude smaller than a DRL policy.</description>

      <title>Co-Optimization of EV Charging Control and Incentivization for Enhanced Power System Stability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00947v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study how high charging rate demands from electric vehicles (EVs) in a power distribution grid may collectively cause poor dynamic performance, and propose a price incentivization strategy to steer customers to settle for lesser charging rate demands so that such performance degradation can be avoided. We pose the problem as a joint optimization and optimal control formulation. The optimization determines the optimal charging setpoints for EVs to minimize the $\mathcal{H}_2$-norm of the transfer function of the grid model, while the optimal control simultaneously develops a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) based state-feedback control signal for the battery currents of those EVs to jointly improve the small-signal dynamic performance of the system states. A subsequent algorithm is developed to determine how much customers may be willing to sacrifice their intended charging rate demands in return for financial incentives. Results are derived for both unidirectional and bidirectional charging, and validated using numerical simulations of multiple EV charging stations (EVCSs) in the IEEE 33-bus power distribution model.</description>

      <title>Sim-to-Real Transfer of Deep Reinforcement Learning Agents for Online Coverage Path Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04920v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coverage path planning (CPP) is the problem of finding a path that covers the entire free space of a confined area, with applications ranging from robotic lawn mowing to search-and-rescue. While for known environments, offline methods can find provably complete paths, and in some cases optimal solutions, unknown environments need to be planned online during mapping. We investigate the suitability of continuous-space reinforcement learning (RL) for this challenging problem, and propose a computationally feasible egocentric map representation based on frontiers, as well as a novel reward term based on total variation to promote complete coverage. Compared to existing classical methods, this approach allows for a flexible path space, and enables the agent to adapt to specific environment characteristics. Meanwhile, the deployment of RL models on real robot systems is difficult. Training from scratch may be infeasible due to slow convergence times, while transferring from simulation to reality, i.e. sim-to-real transfer, is a key challenge in itself. We bridge the sim-to-real gap through a semi-virtual environment, including a real robot and real-time aspects, while utilizing a simulated sensor and obstacles to enable environment randomization and automated episode resetting. We investigate what level of fine-tuning is needed for adapting to a realistic setting. Through extensive experiments, we show that our approach surpasses the performance of both previous RL-based approaches and highly specialized methods across multiple CPP variations in simulation. Meanwhile, our method successfully transfers to a real robot. Our code implementation can be found online.</description>

      <title>Geometry-Aware Edge-State Tracking for Resilient Affine Formation Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03911v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Affine formation control (AFC) is a subset of formation control methods that enables coordinated multiagent movement while preserving affine relationships, and has recently gained increasing popularity due to its broad applicability across diverse applications. AFC is inherently distributed, where each agent's local controller relies on the relative displacements of neighboring agents. The unavailability of these measurements in practice, due to node or communication failures, leads to a change in the underlying graph topology and subsequently causes instability or sub-optimal performance. In this work, each edge in the graph is modeled using a state-space framework, allowing the corresponding edge-states to be estimated with or without up-to-date measurements. We then propose a Kalman-based estimation framework where we fuse both temporal information from agents' dynamics and spatial information, which is derived from the geometry of the affine formations. We give convergence guarantees and optimality analysis on the proposed algorithm, and numerical validations show the enhanced resilience of AFC against these topology changes in several practical scenarios.</description>

      <title>Active Learning-Based Optimization of Hydroelectric Turbine Startup to Minimize Fatigue Damage</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14618v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hydro-generating units (HGUs) play a crucial role in integrating intermittent renewable energy sources into the power grid due to their flexible operational capabilities. This evolving role has led to an increase in transient events, such as startups, which impose significant stresses on turbines, leading to increased turbine fatigue and a reduced operational lifespan. Consequently, optimizing startup sequences to minimize stresses is vital for hydropower utilities. However, this task is challenging, as stress measurements on prototypes can be expensive and time-consuming. To tackle this challenge, we propose an innovative automated approach to optimize the startup parameters of HGUs with a limited budget of measured startup sequences. Our method combines active learning and black-box optimization techniques, utilizing virtual strain sensors and dynamic simulations of HGUs. This approach was tested in real-time during an on-site measurement campaign on an instrumented Francis turbine prototype. The results demonstrate that our algorithm successfully identified an optimal startup sequence using only seven measured sequences. It achieves a remarkable 42% reduction in the maximum strain cycle amplitude compared to the standard startup sequence. This study paves the way for more efficient HGU startup optimization, potentially extending their operational lifespans.</description>

      <title>On Erlang mixture approximations for differential equations with distributed time delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12984v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a general approach for approximate simulation and analysis of delay differential equations (DDEs) with distributed time delays based on methods for ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The key innovation is that we 1) approximate the kernel by the probability density function of an Erlang mixture and 2) use the linear chain trick to transform the approximate DDEs to ODEs. Furthermore, we prove that an approximation with infinitely many terms converges for continuous and bounded kernels and for specific choices of the coefficients. We show that the approximate ODEs can be used to assess the stability of the steady states of the original DDEs and that the solution to the ODEs converges if the kernel is also exponentially bounded. Additionally, we propose an approach based on bisection and least-squares estimation for determining optimal parameter values in the approximation. Finally, we present numerical examples that demonstrate the accuracy and convergence rate obtained with the optimal parameters and the efficacy of the proposed approach for bifurcation analysis and Monte Carlo simulation. The numerical examples involve a modified logistic equation, chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression, and a point reactor kinetics model of a molten salt nuclear fission reactor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02913v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social learning constitutes a fundamental framework for studying interactions among rational agents who observe each other's actions but lack direct access to individual beliefs. This paper investigates a specific social learning paradigm known as Word-of-Mouth (WoM), where a series of agents seeks to estimate the state of a dynamical system. The first agent receives noisy measurements of the state, while each subsequent agent relies solely on a degraded version of her predecessor's estimate. A defining feature of WoM is that the final agent's belief is publicly broadcast and subsequently adopted by all agents, in place of their own. We analyze this setting theoretically and through numerical simulations, noting that some agents benefit from using the belief of the last agent, while others experience performance deterioration.</description>

      <title>Fault Detection in New Wind Turbines with Limited Data by Generative Transfer Learning</title>

Abstract: Intelligent condition monitoring of wind turbines is essential for reducing downtimes. Machine learning models trained on wind turbine operation data are commonly used to detect anomalies and, eventually, operation faults. However, data-driven normal behavior models (NBMs) require a substantial amount of training data, as NBMs trained with scarce data may result in unreliable fault detection. To overcome this limitation, we present a novel generative deep transfer learning approach to make SCADA samples from one wind turbine lacking training data resemble SCADA data from wind turbines with representative training data. Through CycleGAN-based domain mapping, our method enables the application of an NBM trained on an existing wind turbine to a new one with severely limited data. We demonstrate our approach on field data mapping SCADA samples across 7 substantially different WTs. Our findings show significantly improved fault detection in wind turbines with scarce data. Our method achieves the most similar anomaly scores to an NBM trained with abundant data, outperforming NBMs trained on scarce training data with improvements of +10.3% in F1-score when 1 month of training data is available and +16.8% when 2 weeks are available. The domain mapping approach outperforms conventional fine-tuning at all considered degrees of data scarcity, ranging from 1 to 8 weeks of training data. The proposed technique enables earlier and more reliable fault detection in newly installed wind farms, demonstrating a novel and promising research direction to improve anomaly detection when faced with training data scarcity.</description>

      <title>Generative Machine Learning in Adaptive Control of Dynamic Manufacturing Processes: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00210v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamic manufacturing processes exhibit complex characteristics defined by time-varying parameters, nonlinear behaviors, and uncertainties. These characteristics require sophisticated in-situ monitoring techniques utilizing multimodal sensor data and adaptive control systems that can respond to real-time feedback while maintaining product quality. Recently, generative machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool for modeling complex distributions and generating synthetic data while handling these manufacturing uncertainties. However, adopting these generative technologies in dynamic manufacturing systems lacks a functional control-oriented perspective to translate their probabilistic understanding into actionable process controls while respecting constraints. This review presents a functional classification of Prediction-Based, Direct Policy, Quality Inference, and Knowledge-Integrated approaches, offering a perspective for understanding existing ML-enhanced control systems and incorporating generative ML. The analysis of generative ML architectures within this framework demonstrates control-relevant properties and potential to extend current ML-enhanced approaches where conventional methods prove insufficient. We show generative ML's potential for manufacturing control through decision-making applications, process guidance, simulation, and digital twins, while identifying critical research gaps: separation between generation and control functions, insufficient physical understanding of manufacturing phenomena, and challenges adapting models from other domains. To address these challenges, we propose future research directions aimed at developing integrated frameworks that combine generative ML and control technologies to address the dynamic complexities of modern manufacturing systems.</description>

      <title>Constrained Diffusion Models for Synthesizing Representative Power Flow Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11281v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-quality power flow datasets are essential for training machine learning models in power systems. However, security and privacy concerns restrict access to real-world data, making statistically accurate and physically consistent synthetic datasets a viable alternative. We develop a diffusion model for generating synthetic power flow datasets from real-world power grids that both replicate the statistical properties of the real-world data and ensure AC power flow feasibility. To enforce the constraints, we incorporate gradient guidance based on the power flow constraints to steer diffusion sampling toward feasible samples. For computational efficiency, we further leverage insights from the fast decoupled power flow method and propose a variable decoupling strategy for the training and sampling of the diffusion model. These solutions lead to a physics-informed diffusion model, generating power flow datasets that outperform those from the standard diffusion in terms of feasibility and statistical similarity, as shown in experiments across IEEE benchmark systems.</description>

      <title>Incremental Collision Laws Based on the Bouc-Wen Model: Improved Collision Models and Further Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07953v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the article titled "The Bouc-Wen Model for Binary Direct Collinear Collisions of Convex Viscoplastic Bodies" and published in the Journal of Computational and Nonlinear Dynamics (Volume 20, Issue 6, June 2025), the authors studied mathematical models of binary direct collinear collisions of convex viscoplastic bodies that employed two incremental collision laws based on the Bouc-Wen differential model of hysteresis. It was shown that the models possess favorable analytical properties, and several model parameter identification studies were conducted, demonstrating that the models can accurately capture the nature of a variety of collision phenomena. In this article, the aforementioned models are augmented by modeling the effects of external forces as time-dependent inputs that belong to a certain function space. Furthermore, the range of the parameters under which the models possess favorable analytical properties is extended to several corner cases that were not considered in the prior publication. Finally, the previously conducted model parameter identification studies are extended, and an additional model parameter identification study is provided in an attempt to validate the ability of the augmented models to represent the effects of external forces.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Modal IoT Node for Energy-Efficient Environmental Monitoring with Edge AI Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14165v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The widespread adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies has significantly advanced environmental monitoring (EM) by enabling cost-effective and scalable sensing solutions. Concurrently, machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) are introducing powerful tools for the efficient and accurate analysis of complex environmental data. However, current IoT platforms for environmental sensing are typically limited to a narrow set of sensors, preventing a comprehensive assessment of environmental conditions and lacking sufficient computational capabilities to support the deployment of advanced ML and AI algorithms on the edge. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a compact (17x38 mm2), multi-modal, MCU-based environmental IoT node integrating 11 sensors, including CO2 concentration, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), light intensity, UV radiation, pressure, temperature, humidity, visual sensing via an RGB camera, and precise geolocation through a GNSS module. It features GAP9, a parallel ultra-low-power system-on-chip, enabling real-time, energy-efficient edge processing of advanced ML models directly on-device. We implemented a YOLOv5-based occupancy detection pipeline (0.3 M parameters, 42 MOP per inference), demonstrating 42% energy savings over raw data streaming. Additionally, we present a smart indoor air quality (IAQ) monitoring setup that combines occupancy detection with adaptive sample rates, achieving operational times of up to 143 h on a single compact 600 mAh, 3.7 V battery. Our platform lays the groundwork for innovative applications such as predictive indoor IAQ, enabling efficient AI-driven on-edge forecasting for energy-efficient and autonomous, proactive pollution-mitigation control strategies</description>

      <title>Federated Nonlinear System Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider federated learning of linearly-parameterized nonlinear systems. We establish theoretical guarantees on the effectiveness of federated nonlinear system identification compared to centralized approaches, demonstrating that the convergence rate improves as the number of clients increases. Although the convergence rates in the linear and nonlinear cases differ only by a constant, this constant depends on the feature map $\phi$, which can be carefully chosen in the nonlinear setting to increase excitation and improve performance. We experimentally validate our theory in physical settings where client devices are driven by i.i.d. control inputs and control policies exhibiting i.i.d. random perturbations, ensuring non-active exploration. Experiments use trajectories from nonlinear dynamical systems characterized by real-analytic feature functions, including polynomial and trigonometric components, representative of physical systems including pendulum and quadrotor dynamics. We analyze the convergence behavior of the proposed method under varying noise levels and data distributions. Results show that federated learning consistently improves convergence of any individual client as the number of participating clients increases.</description>
