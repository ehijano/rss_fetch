      <title>Fedder type criteria for quasi-$F$-splitting I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.10076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.10076v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Yobuko recently introduced the notion of quasi-$F$-splitting and quasi-$F$-split heights, which generalize and quantify the notion of Frobenius-splitting, and proved that quasi-$F$-split heights coincide with Artin-Mazur heights for Calabi-Yau varieties. In this paper, we prove Fedder type criteria for quasi-$F$-splittings of complete intersections, and in particular, obtain a simple formula to compute Artin-Mazur heights of Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces. As one of its applications, we prove that there exist Calabi-Yau varieties of arbitrarily high Artin-Mazur height over $\mathbb{F}_2$. We also give explicit defining equations of quartic K3 surfaces over $\mathbb{F}_{3}$ realizing all the possible Artin-Mazur heights.</description>

      <title>Commutativity of operator algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17673v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We call an operator algebra A {\em reversible} if A with reversed multiplication is also an abstract operator algebra (in the modern operator space sense). This class of operator algebras is intimately related to the {\em symmetric operator algebras}: the subalgebras of B(H) on which the transpose map is a complete isometry. In previous work we studied the unital case, where reversibility is equivalent to commutativity. We give many sufficient conditions under which a nonunital reversible or symmetric operator algebra is commutative. We also give many complementary results of independent interest, and solve a few open questions from previous papers. Not every reversible or symmetric operator algebra is commutative, however we show that they all are 3-commutative. That is, order does not matter in the product of three or more elements from A. The proof of this relies on a technical analysis involving the injective envelope. Indeed nonunital algebras are often enormously more complicated than unital ones in regard to the topics we consider. On the positive side, our considerations raise very many questions even for low dimensional matrix algebras, some of which are of a computational nature and might be suitable for undergraduate research. The canonical anticommutation relations from mathematical physics play a significant role.</description>

      <title>Debordering Closure Results in Determinantal and Pfaffian Ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16492v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One important question in algebraic complexity is understanding the complexity of polynomial ideals (Grochow, Bulletin of EATCS 131, 2020). Andrews and Forbes (STOC 2022) studied the determinantal ideals $I^{\det}_{n,m,r}$ generated by the $r\times r$ minors of $n\times m$ matrices. Over fields of characteristic zero or of sufficiently large characteristic, they showed that for any nonzero $f \in I^{\det}_{n,m,r}$, the determinant of a $t \times t$ matrix of variables with $t = \Theta(r^{1/3})$ is approximately computed by a constant-depth, polynomial-size $f$-oracle algebraic circuit, in the sense that the determinant lies in the border of such circuits. An analogous result was also obtained for Pfaffians in the same paper.
  In this work, we deborder the result of Andrews and Forbes by showing that when $f$ has polynomial degree, the determinant is in fact exactly computed by a constant-depth, polynomial-size $f$-oracle algebraic circuit. We further establish an analogous result for Pfaffian ideals.
  Our results are established using the isolation lemma, combined with a careful analysis of straightening-law expansions of polynomials in determinantal and Pfaffian ideals.</description>
