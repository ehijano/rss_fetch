      <title>A New Bi-Objective Model for Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling and Cash Flow Problems with Financial Constraints under Uncertainty: A Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Owing to the importance of project cash flow, which comprises an entire history of all cash inflows and cash outflows, to economic survival of firms, it is vital to coping with project scheduling issues considering resource constraints in circumstances involving cash flow. Furthermore, since appropriate project management is subject to the innate uncertainties involved in most projects, they are required to be appraised respecting their profound impact. In this paper, a new comprehensive multi-mode multi-objective linear programming model with two conflicting objectives, which are maximizing final cash flow for profit optimization and shortening the duration of project execution, considering improving assumptions, that is, payments delays, project finance constraints, initial capital, different types of interest rates, credit limit to assuage financial distress, credit line usage, is presented in an uncertain environment. Since the model is considered as multi-objective with uncertain parameters, a new extended interval valued fuzzy - Torabi and Hassini (IVF-TH) approach is proposed to tackle the problem. The presented mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is solved applying CPLEX solver. In addition, a real construction project in oil and gas industry is presented as a case study to illustrate the model applications. Ultimately, for the purpose of assessing the outcomes, a sensitivity analysis is implemented, and the performance of the proposed solution approach is compared to the previous multi-objective optimization methods using both case study and large problem instances.</description>

      <title>Recurrence Relations for $\beta(2k)$ and $\zeta(2k + 1)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we study integrals of the form $\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{\tanh(x)}{x}\mathrm{sech}(x)^{L}\exp(-Tx)dx$. For $L \in \mathbb{N}$, $L \leq 4$ and $T \in \mathbb{R}$ we give explicit expressions in terms of derivatives of the Hurwitz zeta function at negative integers. We use these expressions to evaluate these integrals for $T \in \mathbb{N}_{0}$ exactly. For the special case $T = 0$ we give explicit evaluations for any $L \in \mathbb{N}$ based on the functional equations for $\beta(s)$ and $\zeta(s)$. As it turns out the value of $\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{\tanh(x)}{x}\mathrm{sech}(x)^{2N + 1}dx$ is a linear combination of $\beta(2)$, ..., $\beta(2N + 2)$ and the value of $\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{\tanh(x)}{x}\mathrm{sech}(x)^{2N}dx$ a linear combination of $\zeta(3)$, ..., $\zeta(2N + 1)$. We give recursive formulae for the coefficients in these linear combinations.</description>
