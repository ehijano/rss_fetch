      <title>Thermal Bhabha scattering under the influence of non-hermiticity effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the Bhabha scattering process within the framework of non-Hermitian QED at finite temperature. In this theory, the hermiticity condition, typically required in quantum field theory to ensure the reality of physical observables, is replaced by the condition of unbroken $PT$-symmetry which favors the introduction of an axial mass and a vector-axial gauge coupling. Using the Thermofield Dynamics formalism, we derive and comprehensively analyze the thermal differential cross section for the Bhabha scattering. Furthermore, we explore the high-energy limit of the scattering amplitude and establish constraints upon the axial coupling constant, offering valuable insights into the system's behavior under extreme conditions.</description>

      <title>Dispersive analysis of the $\boldsymbol{\phi \to \gamma \pi^0 \pi^0}$ process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the radiative decay $\phi \to \gamma \pi^0 \pi^0$ in a dispersive framework, where the two-pion subsystem undergoes strong final-state interactions that cover the $f_0(500)$ and $f_0(980)$ regions. We employ a coupled-channel Muskhelishvili-Omn\`es framework that allows for a consistent treatment of two scalar resonances and crossed-channel singularities induced by the Born and vector-meson exchanges. We explicitly verify the equivalence between the modified and standard Muskhelishvili-Omn\`es representations for vector-meson pole contributions when the isoscalar Omn\`es matrix is chosen asymptotically bounded, and we adopt the standard representation in decay kinematics. This yields, for the first time, a parameter-free dispersive prediction for the kaon Born rescattering, which provides a dominant contribution. To obtain a good fit to the KLOE and SND data, we employ a once-subtracted coupled-channel dispersion relation with heavier left-hand cut contributions and two unknown subtraction constants. The results demonstrate the consistency among the data for $\pi\pi$ scattering, $\gamma\gamma$ fusion, and $\phi $ radiative decay, thereby validating the underlying dispersive formalism and the input used for the hadronic Omn\`es matrix and left-hand cuts.</description>

      <title>The Sun Can Strongly Constrain Spin-Dependent Dark Matter Nucleon Scattering Below the Evaporation Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sun is a promising target for dark matter searches due to its ability to accumulate dark matter particles via scattering and catalyze their self-annihilation. However, at low dark matter masses, dark matter particles can also "evaporate" due to subsequent collisions with the hot thermal plasma of the Sun. While several modeling studies have calculated the competitive dynamics of dark matter evaporation and annihilation, observational studies have typically assumed a fixed 4 GeV "evaporation limit", below which dark matter evaporates before it can annihilate. In this paper, we carefully consider the competitive effects of dark matter evaporation and annihilation on the resulting spin-dependent dark matter nucleon cross-section limits, finding that Solar observations can continue to exceed terrestrial constraints by between 1-5 orders of magnitude for dark matter masses between 2-4 GeV for dark matter annihilation to both neutrinos and long-lived mediators.</description>

      <title>Excluding MeV-scale QCD axions by $K_L \to \pi^0\pi^0 a$ at KTeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An interesting proposal suggests that a QCD axion $(a)$ coupling to the up quark, down quark, and electron remains viable for an axion mass near 10~MeV. In this paper, this possibility is reexamined by deriving new bounds from kaon decays. In particular, we perform a detailed analysis of the $K_L \to \pi^0 \pi^0 e^+ e^-$ measurement reported by the KTeV experiment, and reinterpret $K^+$ decay measurements at the E949 and NA62 experiments to constrain both the diphoton decay and effectively invisible decay modes of the axion. We find that, combined with the previously known bounds, the viable window for the MeV-scale QCD axion is excluded, primarily due to the KTeV bound. Uncertainties associated with the chiral Lagrangian are further examined, and the scenario remains excluded even after accounting for these uncertainties, except for a tiny region of parameter space where higher-order corrections must finely cancel the leading-order contribution, suppressing the branching ratio of $K_L\to \pi^0\pi^0 a$ by three orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Cosmic-Ray Antinuclei Fluxes with Dark Matter Annihilation into SUEPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard-Model (SM) hadronic parton showers initiated by secondary cosmic-ray production or dark matter (DM) annihilations robustly predict very low antinuclei yields and a strong additional suppression for heavier antinuclei. We show that an important exception can arise if DM annihilates into a confining dark sector that produces Soft Unclustered Energy Patterns (SUEPs). The hallmark of SUEPs is the emission of very large multiplicities of soft dark mesons ($\pi_D$), which can overcome the usual phase-space suppression of antinuclei formation in parton showers, provided that the dark mesons decay promptly into SM quarks, i.e. within a SM hadronization length. We study several benchmark realizations and find that for DM masses $m_{\rm DM}\sim\mathcal{O}(10~\mathrm{TeV})$, dark meson masses $m_{\pi_D} \sim 400~\mathrm{GeV}$, $\pi_D$ dominantly decaying to $t\bar t$, and a SUEP temperature $T_{\rm SUEP}\simeq 0.1\,m_{\pi D}$, DM annihilation into SUEPs can yield tens of antideuterons and a few antihelium--3 events at AMS-02 at kinetic energies of $\mathcal{O}(\mathrm{GeV}$/n) and a few antideuterons and antihelium-3 events in GAPS at energies below 0.5 GeV/n. A future confirmation of an antinuclei signal by the AMS-02 or GAPS experiments could provide hints for hidden confining dynamics and would significantly constrain the relevant SUEP parameters.</description>

      <title>Back-to-back dijet production in DIS at arbitrary Bjorken-x: TMD gluon distributions to twist-3 accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the gluon transverse-momentum-dependent (TMD) operator structure of back-to-back quark-antiquark dijet production in deep inelastic scattering at arbitrary Bjorken-x to twist-3 accuracy. Working at leading order in the strong coupling and in the kinematic regime where the transverse momentum imbalance of the jets is much smaller than their individual transverse momenta, we perform a systematic gradient expansion of the quark propagator in a background gluon field. This expansion organizes multiple interactions with the target in terms of longitudinal Wilson lines and gauge-invariant field-strength insertions, yielding a TMD description valid beyond the strict high-energy eikonal (x -&gt; 0) approximation. We obtain explicit cross sections for longitudinally and transversely polarized virtual photons, identifying all contributing gluon TMD operators up to twist-3, including structures involving F_+-, F_ij, and three-gluon correlators. The full longitudinal phase associated with Bjorken-x is retained throughout. In the small-x limit, our results reproduce the known sub-eikonal expressions obtained in the Color Glass Condensate framework, establishing a direct connection between the general-x TMD expansion and high-energy factorization. We further reduce the operator basis using equations of motion, minimizing the number of independent nonperturbative matrix elements entering the cross section. This work provides a systematic foundation for extending TMD analyses of dijet production beyond leading twist, establishing a unified operator framework valid at arbitrary Bjorken x that smoothly interpolates between moderate- and small-x descriptions of gluon TMDs.</description>

      <title>The Roper Resonance: Still Controversial 60 Years Later</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Few baryon resonances have generated as much discussion, even controversy, as the first positive parity excited state with nucleon quantum numbers. We re-examine the issue using insight gained from lattice QCD, complemented by Hamiltonian effective field theory. In doing so, we also examine the distinction between a state that can be naturally described as a quark model state and one that is dynamically generated.</description>

      <title>Higher-twist effect in inclusive electron-positron annihilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a comprehensive theoretical framework for the electron-positron single-inclusive annihilation (SIA) process that incorporates higher-twist contributions up to twist-4 and demonstrate that these effects should be considered in low-energy reactions. Through a systematic collinear expansion of the hadronic tensor, we derive the complete set of structure functions in terms of collinear fragmentation functions (FFs), explicitly including multi-parton correlators up to the four-parton level. To evaluate the impact of these power corrections, we estimate the twist-4 unpolarized FF using a spectator model and compute the normalized differential cross section for $\pi^0$ production. Our numerical analysis reveals that the interplay between kinematic hadron mass corrections and dynamical twist-4 effects improves the theoretical description of recent BESIII data at relatively low-$z$ region. Furthermore, the $Q$-dependence confirms that higher-twist corrections are dominant at intermediate energy scales. These findings indicate that standard leading-twist global analyses must be extended to include these power corrections for precise studies of hadronization dynamics.</description>

Abstract: High flux of geoantineutrinos $^{40}$K and geoneutrinos $^{40}$K ($^{40}$K-geo-($\bar{\nu} + \nu$)) can be obtained from reanalysis of the Borexino Phase III data. Large amounts of $^{40}$K should produce a significant heat flow that should affect Earth's internal processes. We present the results of the modeling of mantle convection taking into account the excess heat from $^{40}$K.</description>

      <title>Residue-Enhanced Pion-Rho Mixing as the Origin of Nonmonotonic Charged Pion Mass in Magnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify the dynamical origin of the non-monotonic magnetic field dependence of the charged pion mass observed in lattice QCD. Using a near-pole effective action derived from the SU(2) Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model, we show that the lowest Landau level charged pion mixes with the longitudinally polarized charged rho meson, which shares the same quantum numbers in a magnetic background. This mixing, generated by quark-loop polarization and a gauge-invariant tree-level operator matched to the vacuum decay $\rho^\pm\rightarrow\pi^\pm\gamma$, induces strong level repulsion. Crucially, this effect is dynamically amplified by a rapid suppression of the rho-meson wave function renormalization near the pole. As a result, the lower eigenmode exhibits a turnover as the magnetic field increases. The mechanism is analogous to singlet-triplet mixing in positronium and provides a natural explanation for the lattice results. Such effects are expected to be generic for charged mesons in magnetic fields when symmetry allowed mixing and near-pole residue suppression are present.</description>

      <title>Primordial black hole evaporation in a thermal bath and gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) formed in the early Universe evaporate via Hawking radiation and constitute a generic source of stochastic gravitational waves. Existing studies of gravitational wave production from evaporating PBHs typically assume vacuum evaporation, neglecting the fact that PBHs in the early Universe are embedded in a hot thermal plasma. In this work, we investigate gravitational wave production from primordial black holes whose evaporation is thermally influenced by their surrounding environment. We adopt a thermal evaporation framework in which interactions with the ambient plasma modify the effective decay rate of the black hole, leading to enhanced mass loss at early times and a redistribution of the evaporation history compared to the standard non-thermal vacuum case. Since graviton emission is intrinsically tied to the evaporation history of PBHs, these thermal effects play a crucial role in determining the timing and spectral properties of the resulting stochastic gravitational wave background. Our results provide a consistent framework for incorporating thermal effects into gravitational wave production from evaporating primordial black holes and set the stage for a detailed analysis of their observational signatures.</description>

      <title>Four fermion soft emission in QCD hard scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the radiation of two distinguishable soft quark-antiquark pairs ($\mathrm{q}\bar{\mathrm{q}}\mathrm{Q}\bar{\mathrm{Q}}$) in a generic process for multiparton hard scattering in QCD. We evaluate the corresponding soft current at tree level in terms of an independent-emission contribution and an irreducible correlation component, which includes strictly non-abelian terms and also terms with an abelian character. The squared current for soft $\mathrm{q}\bar{\mathrm{q}}\mathrm{Q}\bar{\mathrm{Q}}$ emission produces colour dipole and colour tripole interactions between the hard-scattering partons, with structures similar to soft gluon-quark-antiquark emission. The colour tripole interactions are odd under charge conjugation and lead to charge asymmetry effects. We extend our analysis by including QED interactions, the emission of two distinguishable soft lepton-antilepton pairs, and mixed quark-antiquark-lepton-antilepton soft emission.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.15694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quark fragmentation functions describe the hadronization process of a quark where any of the final-state hadrons carries a fraction of its initial momentum. We compute these fragmentation functions for a cascade that includes pions, kaons, and the charmed $D$ and $D_s$ mesons, starting from the elementary quark-to-meson fragmentation process. The latter is obtained from the relevant cut diagram, and employs Poincar\'e covariant Bethe-Salpeter wave functions and quark propagators. We derive a set of twenty-five coupled jet equations that describe the cascade of emitted mesons in the fragmentation process. Their solutions yield full fragmentation functions that offer a consistent picture of the quark fragmentations across the light and heavy sectors.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore combinations of particle and anti-particle yields which can be used to test thermal models in a parameter free way. We also explore combinations which can be used to extract $\mu_B/T$, $\mu_S/T$ and $\mu_Q/T$. We use experimentally measured particle-antiparticle specific ratios for proton $p$, $\Lambda$, and cascade $\Xi$, for $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = $ 7.7-39 GeV from RHIC BES phase-1 to extract the $\mu_{B,S,Q}/T$. These compared well with published STAR freeze-out parameters. These combinations are verified to predict a similar combination of $\Omega$ and $\overline\Omega$ yields. We also extend this idea to predict (anti-)nuclei yields at energies where they are not measured. We also update parametrizations for the $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ dependence of freeze-out parameters $T$ and $\mu_B$, and present for the first time a similar parametrization of $\mu_S$.</description>

      <title>Hubble-Scale Tachyonic Shocks from Low-Scale Inflation -- A New Gravitational-Wave Window on Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current bounds on the tensor-to-scalar ratio imply that the energy scale of inflation may lie below the grand-unified scale. In this paper, we show that in a broad class of single-field inflation models with sufficiently small energy scales, an extremely efficient tachyonic instability develops at the end of inflation. This instability rapidly drives the system into a nonlinear regime before coherent oscillations can be established, leading to a first-order phase-transition--like phenomenon without tunneling or barrier crossing. The resulting ultra-relativistic shock fronts surrounding the bubble interiors expand to near the Hubble scale, corresponding to the most strongly enhanced tachyonic modes, and collide with one another, producing energetic inflaton particles and gravitational waves. As a result, the post-inflationary dynamics can differ significantly from the conventional high-scale inflationary scenario. Interestingly, inflation at MeV--EeV energy scales can be probed via gravitational-wave observations, including pulsar timing arrays, ground-based detectors, and future space-based experiments. Recent limits from the LIGO--KAGRA--Virgo collaboration already constrain EeV-scale inflation, while pulsar timing array results may be interpreted as evidence for gravitational waves generated by GeV-scale inflation. We also briefly discuss further implications of the resulting tachyonic shocks.</description>

      <title>Resonant Axion-Photon Conversion in the Early Inspiral of Neutron Star Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the early binary neutron star inspiral phase as a scenario to probe environmental axion--photon resonant conversion. For this we approximately model the merger site electromagnetic fields as the superposition of two rotating dipolar stellar magnetic fields at the thousand--km scale when both magnetospheres are not largely distorted. We capture the time-sliced near-zone magnetospheric geometry relevant for axion--photon mixing. Plasma effects are incorporated through an effective Goldreich--Julian charge density, used to determine the effective plasma frequency and the location of resonant conversion surfaces. Our results show that axion--photon resonant conversion in binary magnetospheres mostly occurs on extended peanut-shaped surfaces whose global geometry evolves as the binary inspiral evolves. As a consequence, the total electromagnetic power emitted through axion--photon conversion exhibits a characteristic dependence on axion mass and a slow temporal modulation correlated with the gravitational wave frequency emission. This feature is potentially detectable for $m_a \in [50,170] \,\rm \mu eV$ and set $g_{a \gamma} \lesssim 10^{-11}\rm \,GeV^{-1}$ as it lies within the sensitivity limits of current or planned radio observation missions. In light of our results we discuss the opportunity of binary neutron star inspirals as time-dependent, multimessenger probes of axion physics, and motivate coordinated searches combining gravitational wave observations with radio and millimeter wavelength electromagnetic measurements.</description>

      <title>Imprints of asymptotic freedom on confining strings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.15097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the Polyakov loop correlator in the confining phase of large $N$ Yang-Mills theory in three and four dimensions. It can be computed by summing over the exchange of closed flux tubes winding around the thermal cycle. At short separations, the leading divergence is controlled by perturbation theory. Combining these two facts allows us to determine the asymptotic spectral density of string states contributing to the correlator. This sharply relates the weakly-coupled UV of the gauge theory to the dynamics of highly energetic flux tubes. Then, in a toy integrable setting, we explore how this can bound the scattering data of the Goldstone modes on top of a long string. We derive a bound on the asymptotic behavior of the reflection amplitude of Goldstones against the flux tube boundary sourced by the Polyakov line, and rule out an asymptotically linear phase shift for the S-matrix. Along the way, we discuss how causality can impose bounds on thermodynamic quantities, and show how the positivity of time delays follows from unitarity and analyticity of $2d$ massless elastic S-matrices. We include a review on reflection amplitudes, and their computation in the theory of long effective strings.</description>

      <title>ABCMB: A Python+JAX Package for the Cosmic Microwave Background Power Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present ABCMB, a differentiable Einstein-Boltzmann solver for the cosmic microwave background (CMB). ABCMB is a complete code capturing important effects to linear order in $\Lambda{\rm CDM}$ cosmology. It computes the CMB power spectrum and includes effects like lensing, polarization, massive neutrinos, and a state-of-the-art treatment of BBN and recombination. ABCMB has sub-percent-level agreement with CLASS and can be run on a GPU with competitive, and sometimes even faster, run times. It is refactored compared to previous codes and takes advantage of object-oriented programming to improve extensibility, meaning new physics can be added to it without the need for modifying source files. ABCMB provides accurate and stable gradients to the user, making Fisher analyses straightforward, and enabling the use of efficient gradient-based sampling methods.</description>

      <title>Measuring Pulsar Distances from Chirping Orbital Periods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The observed orbital period time derivative (or orbital "chirp") of a millisecond binary pulsar (MSP) encodes information about both the intrinsic properties of the binary system and its environment. Orbital chirp has contributions from intrinsic energy loss due to gravitational wave emission, kinematic effects due to motion in the plane of the sky, and dynamical effects due to galactic acceleration, with the latter two contributions depending on the MSP distance. We use orbital chirp data to infer distances to 21 MSPs; and for four of which we obtain smaller uncertainties than those reported in previous distance measurements. We incorporate multiple realistic galactic acceleration models to assess the sensitivity of the inferred distances to the choice of galactic gravitational potential, finding a significant dependence for four MSPs.</description>

      <title>Orbital eccentricity can make neutron star g-mode resonances observable with current gravitational-wave detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamical tides can provide us vital information about the properties of neutron star (NS) matter. This is particularly true for g-modes, whose frequency and tidal coupling are highly sensitive to the composition of NSs, especially in their centers, where microphysical models are the least reliable. However, due to their weak coupling to external tidal fields, their effect on the gravitational-wave (GW) signal of binary inspirals can be difficult to observe. Here we show that the detectability of these tides can be significantly enhanced by binary NSs with moderate eccentricities. This is primarily due to higher eccentric harmonics in the early phase of the binary evolution experiencing larger phase shifts, which they transport to the sensitive band of GW detectors. In addition, g-mode tides in eccentric binaries undergo several epicyclic resonances, which also amplify the total phase shift. We demonstrate that these effects increase the detectability of g-mode dynamical tides by more than an order of magnitude for eccentricities of $e_\mathrm{10Hz}\sim0.2-0.4$, making it possible to put robust constraints on g-mode properties using current GW detectors, while all relevant models could potentially be constrained with eccentric binary NSs with Einstein Telescope.</description>

      <title>Experimental characterization of the hierarchy of quantum correlations in top quark pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent results from the Large Hadron Collider have demonstrated quantum entanglement of top quark-antiquark pairs using the spin degree of freedom. Based on the doubly differential measurement of the spin density matrix of the top quark and antiquark performed by the CMS collaboration in the helicity and beam bases, we evaluate a set of quantum observables, including discord, steering, Bell correlation, and magic. These observables allow for a quantitative characterization of the quantum correlations present in a top quark--antiquark system, thus enabling an interpretation of collider data in terms of quantum states and their properties. Discord is observed to be greater than zero with a significance of more than 5 standard deviations ($\sigma$). Evidence for steering is found with a significance of more than 3$\sigma$. This is the first evidence for steering, and the first observation of discord in a high-energy system. No Bell correlation is observed within the currently probed phase space, in agreement with the theoretical prediction. These results experimentally corroborate the full hierarchy of quantum correlations in top quarks with discord being the most basic form of quantum correlation, followed by entanglement, steering and Bell correlation. The significance of nonzero magic, which is a complementary observable to the quantum-correlation hierarchy, is found to exceed 5$\sigma$ in several regions of phase space.</description>

      <title>Detection horizon for the neutrino burst from the stellar helium flash</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-mass stars ($M\lesssim 2\,M_\odot$) ignite helium under degenerate conditions, eventually causing a nuclear run-away -- the helium flash. The alpha-capture process on $^{14}$N produces a large amount of $^{18}$F, whose subsequent decay spawns an intense $\nu_e$ burst (with average energy of $0.38$ MeV) lasting about a day. We show that, in addition, a strong $1.7$ MeV neutrino line is generated by electron capture on $^{18}$F. Detection is hindered by large backgrounds in state-of-the-art neutrino observatories, such as JUNO. In next-generation facilities, such as the Jinping neutrino experiment, the horizon for a detection with a local significance of $3 \sigma$ would be extended to almost $3$ pc. Although helium flashes occur a few times per year in our Galaxy, there are no stellar candidates approaching the tip of the red giant branch within $10$ pc. Hence, to date, asteroseismology remains the most promising tool for probing the most energetic thermonuclear event in the life of a low-mass star.</description>

      <title>Learning the S-matrix from data: Rediscovering gravity from gauge theory via symbolic regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that modern machine-learning methods can autonomously reconstruct several flagship analytic structures in scattering amplitudes directly from numerical on-shell data. In particular, we show that the Kawai--Lewellen--Tye (KLT) relations can be rediscovered using symbolic regression applied to colour-ordered Yang--Mills amplitudes with Mandelstam invariants as input features. Using standard feature-selection techniques, specifically column-pivoted QR factorisation, we simultaneously recover the Kleiss--Kuijf and Bern--Carrasco--Johansson (BCJ) relations, identifying a minimal basis of partial amplitudes without any group-theoretic input. We obtain the tree-level KLT relations with high numerical accuracy up to five external legs, using only minimal theoretical priors, and we comment on the obstacles to generalising the method to higher multiplicity. Our results establish symbolic regression as a practical tool for exploring the analytic structure of the scattering-amplitude landscape, and suggests a general data-driven strategy for uncovering hidden relations in general theories. For comparison, we benchmark this general approach with a recently introduced neural-network based method.</description>

      <title>A fresh look at boundary terms in Einstein-Hilbert gravity via an initial value variational principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key tenet of general relativity is the dynamical nature of space-time, ideally represented as an initial value problem. Here we explore the variational formulation of classical Einstein-Hilbert gravity as initial value problem by constructing its Schwinger-Keldysh-Galley (SKG) action, including a careful treatment of boundary terms. The construction is based on a doubling of degrees of freedom and independent of a foliation. The action naturally decomposes into a bulk term furnishing Einstein's equations and a boundary term, which is related to conserved quantities, such as the Komar mass. We find that since only trivial connecting conditions must be specified on boundaries, the variational action principle for gravity as an initial value problem is rendered well-posed without the need to add additional boundary terms. The SKG approach to gravity offers a novel and complementary avenue to solve for the metric of spacetime directly from the action, bypassing the governing equations.</description>

      <title>Cosmic topology. Part IIc. Detectability with non-standard primordial power spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-trivial spatial topology of the Universe can imprint potentially observable signatures on the cosmic microwave background (CMB). In this study, we investigate how deviations from the standard nearly-scale-free primordial power spectrum impact observables for the fully compact, orientable Euclidean topologies ($E_1$--$E_6$). We examine how such deviations modify the detectability of the underlying topology, depending on whether they are an intrinsic consequence of non-trivial topology or independent of it. We compute CMB temperature correlation matrices across a range of topologies, fundamental domain sizes, and observer locations for both standard and modified primordial power spectra. The impact of these modifications on the detectability of topology is quantified using the Kullback-Leibler divergence, providing an estimate of the distinguishability of non-trivial and simply-connected topologies based solely on CMB temperature observations. In addition, we employ the CatBoost machine learning algorithm to classify harmonic-space realizations of CMB temperature maps and thereby assess the observational prospects for topology detection. Signatures of non-trivial topology are encoded in the off-diagonal structure of the CMB temperature correlation matrices and are most prominent on the largest angular scales. Deviations from the simple power-law primordial spectrum at these scales can substantially alter the detectability of topology, either enhancing its characteristic CMB imprints or suppressing them below observational sensitivity. Our results demonstrate that uncertainties in the primordial power spectrum must be carefully accounted for in robust searches for cosmic topology using the CMB.</description>

      <title>Searching for Axion-like particle Dark Matter with Time-domain Polarization: Constraints from a protoplanetary disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axion-like particles (ALPs) can induce a birefringence effect that rotates the polarization angle of light, offering a probe of ultralight dark matter. We analyze archival near-infrared polarimetric data of the protoplanetary disk (PPD) around HD 163296. Whereas previous studies considered only single-epoch snapshots, we perform a consistent multi-epoch time-series analysis, extracting the polarization angle and its uncertainty from the polarized images. The resulting six-epoch time series is consistent with a constant polarization angle within the measurement uncertainties, while being sensitive to timescales of $\sim 170-400$ days. The typical polarization angle uncertainties are $1.6$--$6.4$ degrees, partly driven by multiple scattering in the optically thick disk, which broadens the intrinsic polarization angle distribution and introduces additional dispersion in the representative polarization angle. Based on these data, we derive the first upper limits on the ALP-photon coupling from PPD polarization variability, $g_{a\gamma} \lesssim 7.5 \times 10^{-12} (m_a / 10^{-22}\,{\rm eV})\,{\rm GeV}^{-1}$. Furthermore, we forecast that achieving a polarization angle uncertainty of $\sigma \sim 0.1$ degrees would enable world-leading sensitivity to ALP-induced birefringence.</description>

      <title>The COHERENT Experiment: 2026 Update</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.15652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The COHERENT experiment measures neutrino-induced recoils from coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEvNS) with multiple nuclear targets at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), USA. Several successful CEvNS measurements have been achieved in recent years with tens-of-kg detector masses, with a CsI scintillating crystal, a liquid argon single-phase detector, and high-purity germanium spectrometers. For the next phase, COHERENT aims at high-statistics detection of CEvNS events for precision tests of the standard model of particle physics, and to probe new physics beyond-the-standard model. Percent-level precision can be achieved by lowering thresholds, reducing backgrounds, and by scaling up the detector masses. It goes hand in hand with benchmarking the neutrino flux from the SNS. Further detectors will measure CEvNS in additional nuclei, including lighter target nuclei such as sodium and neon, to continue to test the expected neutron-number-squared dependence of the cross section. COHERENT can furthermore study charged-current and neutral-current inelastic neutrino-nucleus cross sections on various nuclei at neutrino energies below $\sim$50 MeV. Many of these cross sections have never been measured before, but are critical input for the interpretation of core-collapse supernova detection in large-scale neutrino experiments such as DUNE, Super-K, Hyper-K, and HALO.</description>

      <title>Neural Scaling Laws for Boosted Jet Tagging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.15781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has established that scaling compute, through joint increases in model capacity and dataset size, is the primary driver of performance in modern machine learning. While machine learning has long been an integral component of High Energy Physics (HEP) data analysis workflows, the compute used to train state-of-the-art HEP models remains orders of magnitude below that of industry foundation models. With scaling laws only beginning to be studied in the field, we investigate neural scaling laws for boosted jet classification using the public JetClass dataset. We derive compute optimal scaling laws and identify an effective performance limit that can be consistently approached through increased compute. We study how data repetition, common in HEP where simulation is expensive, modifies the scaling yielding a quantifiable effective dataset size gain. We then study how the scaling coefficients and asymptotic performance limits vary with the choice of input features and particle multiplicity, demonstrating that increased compute reliably drives performance toward an asymptotic limit, and that more expressive, lower-level features can raise the performance limit and improve results at fixed dataset size.</description>

Abstract: Spin-1 particles, is a fundamental bound state for the two quarks, and play a crucial role in elucidating the electromagnetic properties within the realm of hadronic physics. Their intrinsic relativistic nature mandates a quantum field theory (QFT) framework for a comprehensive analysis. In this investigation, we employ both the instant form of QFT and light-front quantum field theory (LFQFT) as our theoretical tools. While conventional LFQFT approaches predominantly focus on the plus component of the electromagnetic current to extract the properties of spin-1 vector particles, our study extends this analysis by systematically incorporating the minus component as well. Our findings demonstrate that achieving a rigorous equivalence between these distinct current components necessitates the inclusion of nonvalence terms within the electromagnetic current operator. This crucial inclusion serves to restore manifest covariance and ensures a robust consistency with the results independently

      <title>LAYCAST: LAYered CAvern Surface Tracker at future electron-positron colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a detector concept, LAYered CAvern Surface Tracker (LAYCAST), to be installed on the ceiling and the wall of the cavern hosting the main experiment of future electron-positron colliders such as CEPC and FCC-ee. With detailed and realistic considerations of the design of such a new experiment, the proposed detector is dedicated to extending the sensitivity reach of the main detector to various theoretical scenarios of long-lived particles (LLPs). We study carefully four such scenarios involving a light scalar boson $X$, the heavy neutral lepton $N$, the lightest neutralino $\tilde{\chi}^0_1$ in the R-parity-violating supersymmetry, and the axion-like particle $a$. Long-lived light scalar bosons are considered to be produced from the Standard-Model (SM) Higgs boson's decay ($h \to X X$) at the center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s} =$ 240 GeV, while the other three types of LLPs are produced either from $Z$-boson decays (viz. $Z \to \nu\, N, ~\tilde{\chi}^0_1\, \tilde{\chi}^0_1 $) or direct scattering process ($ e^- e^+ \to ~\gamma\, a$) at $\sqrt{s} =$ 91.2 GeV, where $\gamma$ and $\nu$ denote the SM photon and neutrino, respectively. With Monte-Carlo simulations, we derive the sensitivities of the proposed experiment to these LLPs and the corresponding signal-event numbers. We also provide a dedicated estimate of a potentially important SM background from long-lived neutral kaons in hadronic $Z$ decays, and show that it is strongly suppressed by the combined requirements of the main detector and LAYCAST. Our findings show that LAYCAST can probe large new parameter space beyond both current bounds and the expected reach of the main experiments at CEPC and FCC-ee. Comparison with existing works in similar directions is also made.</description>

      <title>Locating the QCD critical point through contours of constant entropy density</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16206v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new method to investigate the existence and location of the conjectured high-temperature critical point of strongly interacting matter via contours of constant entropy density. By approximating these lines as a power series in the baryon chemical potential $\mu_B$, one can extrapolate them from first-principle results at zero net-baryon density, and use them to locate the QCD critical point, including the associated first-order and spinodal lines. As a proof of principle, we employ currently available continuum-extrapolated first-principle results from the Wuppertal--Budapest collaboration to find a critical point at a temperature and a baryon chemical potential of $T_c = 114.3 \pm 6.9$ MeV and $\mu_{B,c} = 602.1 \pm 62.1$ MeV, respectively. We advocate for a more precise determination of the required expansion coefficients via lattice QCD simulations as a means of pinpointing the location of the critical endpoint in the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19896v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a novel production and decay mechanism for a bi-adjoint spin zero particle in the ($8,3,0$) representation of the Standard Model gauge groups. This work is part of a series studying new production processes for exotic particles in higher representations of Standard Model color and weak charge. Here, we study a specific new dimension 5 effective operator model which couples an exotic bi-adjoint scalar field to the SU(3) and SU(2) field strength tensors. The W-gluon resonant decay of the charged component of this new exotic field is explored. We discuss LHC production modes of both the charged and neutral bi-adjoint states and find a new single production mode for the charged state. This is the dominant LHC production mode for TeV-scale masses. We introduce a new HL-LHC search in which a single bi-adjoint is produced in association with a hard forward quark jet from asymmetric W-gluon fusion. This search yields a 5-sigma discovery potential for bi-adjoint masses up to 3 TeV for 10 TeV scalar effective operator cutoffs. We also find 2-sigma sensitivity at the HL-LHC for bi-adjoint masses up to 4 TeV and effective cutoffs in the 15 TeV range for the full 3 inverse atto-barn data set.</description>

      <title>Explaining the PeV Neutrino Fluxes at KM3NeT and IceCube with Quasi-Extremal Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The KM3NeT experiment has recently observed a neutrino with an energy around 100PeV, and IceCube has detected five neutrinos with energies above 1PeV. While there are no known astrophysical sources, exploding primordial black holes could have produced these high-energy neutrinos. For Schwarzschild black holes this interpretation results in tensions between the burst rates inferred from the KM3NeT and IceCube observations, with indirect constraints from the extragalactic gamma ray background and with the non-observation of an associated gamma ray signal at LHAASO. In this letter we show that if there is a population of primordial black holes charged under a new dark $u(1)$ symmetry which spend most of their time in a quasi-extremal state, the neutrino emission at 1PeV may be more suppressed than at 100PeV. The burst rates implied by the KM3NeT and IceCube observations and the indirect constraints can then all be consistent at $1\sigma$, and no associated gamma-ray signal was expected at LHAASO. Furthermore, these black holes could constitute all of the observed dark matter in the universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dark matter may freeze-out and undergo composite assembly while decoupled from the Standard Model. In this secluded composite scenario, while individual dark matter particles may be too weakly-coupled to detect, the assembled composite can potentially be detected since its effective coupling scales with number of constituents. We examine models and observables for secluded composites, and in particular we investigate the cosmological abundance of the composite binding field, which is generated during freeze-out annihilation and secluded composite assembly. This binding field could be discovered as a new relativistic species in the early universe or through later interactions as a subdominant dark component.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dissipative properties of relativistic strongly interacting nuclear matter significantly influence the damping of stellar oscillations and density fluctuations during compact star mergers. In this work, we derive the evolution equation for the bulk viscous pressure in unpaired quark matter under small deviations from equilibrium. Our analysis reveals that it behaves like a two-component Burgers fluid. We identify four key transport coefficients -- two relaxation times and two bulk viscosity coefficients -- expressed in terms of equilibrium parameters and electroweak nonleptonic and semi-leptonic decay rates. The transport coefficients are evaluated for two distinct equations of state: one based on perturbative quantum chromodynamics and the other on a modified MIT bag model, valid in different density regimes. We also determine the temperature and density region where nonleptonic electroweak processes dominate the dissipation. Our formulation establishes a new way of describing bulk viscous effects in quark matter, applicable for numerical simulations of compact star mergers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We forecast the reach of the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) to the full set of real representations within the paradigm of minimal dark matter. We employ effective field theory techniques to compute the annihilation cross section and photon spectrum that results when fermionic dark matter is the neutral component of an arbitrary odd and real representation of SU(2), including the Sommerfeld enhancement, next-to-leading log resummation of the relevant electroweak effects, and the contribution from bound states. We also compute the corresponding signals for scalar dark matter, with the exception of the bound state contribution. Results are presented for all real representations from the $\sim$3 TeV triplet (or wino), a $\mathbf{3}$ of SU(2), to the $\sim$300 TeV tredecuplet, a $\mathbf{13}$ of SU(2) that is at the threshold of the unitarity bound. Using these results, we forecast that with 500 hrs of Galactic Center observations and assuming background systematics are controlled at the level of ${\cal O}(1\%)$, then should no signal emerge, CTAO could exclude all representations up to the $\mathbf{11}$ of SU(2) in even the most conservative models for the dark-matter density in the inner galaxy, in both the fermionic and scalar dark matter cases. Assuming the default CTAO configuration, the tredecuplet will marginally escape exclusion, although we outline steps that CTAO could take to test even this scenario. In summary, CTAO appears poised to make a definitive statement on whether real WIMPs constitute the dark matter of our universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18615v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the two-dimensional Fourier transform of the generalized parton distributions (GPDs) has two distinct interpretations: at zero skewness ($\eta=0$) it yields the familiar impact-parameter density, while at finite skewness ($\eta \neq 0$) it encodes a genuine parton-nucleon correlation whose norm decreases predictably with the rapidity gap $\Delta y = 2\mathrm{artanh} \eta$. This rapidity dependence produces universal rapidity-modified Ji identities linking helicity, orbital, and total angular momenta analytically. Using linear open- and closed string Regge trajectories constrained by empirical PDFs, spectroscopy and form factor data, we obtain the leading twist GPDs $H,E,\widetilde{H}$ across the full $(x,\eta,t)$ range. Numerical Mellin Barnes inversion agrees with existing lattice data and yields rapidity resolved predictions for Jefferson Lab 12 GeV, the Electron Ion Collider, and forthcoming lattice studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00817v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct an analytic, string based representation of the nucleon's axial and helicity flip conformal moments of generalized parton distributions that holds for any skewness and for both the quark and gluon channels. The starting point is the Mellin Barnes resummation of the conformal partial wave expansion, where the moments are parametrized by open (Reggeon) and closed string (Pomeron) trajectories with slopes determined by experimental form factors and meson/glueball spectroscopy. The forward limits are fixed by the empirical unpolarized and polarized parton distributions. Polynomiality, crossing symmetry and support are satisfied by construction. After NLO DGLAP ERBL evolution to $\mu=2$ GeV our analytic framework (i) reproduces some of the currently available lattice moments of $\mathbb{E}$ and $\widetilde{\mathbb{H}}$ in the non singlet sector, (ii) predicts sea quark and gluon polarized moments that will be testable by forthcoming simulations and experiments at Jefferson Lab and the future EIC, and (iii) yields axial and helicity flip GPDs in $x$ space in reasonable agreement with lattice QCD.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the modified Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model -- incorporating exchange interactions via the Fierz transformation -- to finite temperatures in both two- and three-flavor scenarios, and investigate the properties of protoquark stars in $\beta$-equilibrium. Our results show that increasing the strength of exchange interactions, characterized by the parameter $\alpha$, changes the chiral phase transition from first-order to crossover. We examine the effects of finite temperature, lepton fraction, and exchange interactions on the equation of state (EOS). We find that, in the crossover regime, the EOS is significantly stiffer than in the first-order case due to the substantial contribution of repulsive interactions in the exchange channels, while it remains relatively insensitive to variations in temperature and lepton fraction. Imposing the thermodynamic consistency, which requires the minimum of free energy per baryon $f / \rho_B$ occurs at zero pressure, further constrains the minimum value of vacuum pressure.</description>

Abstract: The substantial data volumes encountered in modern particle physics and other domains of fundamental physics research allow (and require) the use of increasingly complex data analysis tools and workflows. While the use of machine learning (ML) tools for data analysis has recently proliferated, these tools are typically special-purpose algorithms that rely, for example, on encoded physics knowledge to reach optimal performance. In this work, we investigate a new and orthogonal direction: Using recent progress in large language models (LLMs) to create a team of agents -- instances of LLMs with specific subtasks -- that jointly solve data analysis-based research problems in a way similar to how a human researcher might: by creating code to operate standard tools and libraries (including ML systems) and by building on results of previous iterations. If successful, such agent-based systems could be deployed to automate routine analysis components to counteract the increasing complexity of modern tool chains. To investigate the capabilities of current-generation commercial LLMs, we consider the task of anomaly detection via the publicly available and highly-studied LHC Olympics dataset. Several current models by OpenAI (GPT-4o, o4-mini, GPT-4.1, and GPT-5) are investigated and their stability tested. Overall, we observe the capacity of the agent-based system to solve this data analysis problem. The best agent-created solutions mirror the performance of human state-of-the-art results.</description>

      <title>Theory uncertainties of the irreducible background to VBF Higgs production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10368v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Higgs boson production through gluon fusion in association with two jets is an irreducible background to Higgs boson production through vector boson fusion, one of the most important channels for analyzing and understanding the Higgs boson properties at the Large Hadron Collider. Despite a range of available simulation tools, precise predictions for the corresponding final states are notoriously hard to achieve. Using state-of-the-art fixed-order calculations as the baseline for a comparison, we perform a detailed study of similarities and differences in existing event generators. We provide consistent setups for the simulations that can be used to obtain identical parametric precision in various programs used by experiments. We find that NLO calculations for the two-jet final state are essential to achieve reliable predictions.</description>

      <title>A Way of Axion Detection with Mass $10^{-4} \text{-}10^{-3}$eV Using Cylindrical Sample with Low Electric Conductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16746v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A dark matter axion with mass $m_a$ induces an oscillating electric field in a cylindrical sample placed under a magnetic field $B_0$ parallel to the cylinder axis. When the cylinder is made of a highly electrically conductive material, the induced oscillating current flows only at the surface. In contrast, if the cylinder is composed of a material with small conductivity, e.g. $\sigma = 10^{-3}\text{eV}$, the electric current flows inside the bulk of the cylinder. Within the QCD axion model, the power $P$ is estimated as $P\simeq 5.7\times 10^{-27}\mbox{W}g_{\gamma}^2 \Big(\frac{L}{100\mbox{cm}}\Big)\Big(\frac{R}{6\mbox{cm}}\Big)^2 \Big(\frac{B_0}{15\mbox{T}}\Big)^2 \Big(\frac{m_a}{10^{-4}\mbox{eV}}\Big)\Big(\frac{10}{\epsilon}\Big)\Big(\frac{\rho_a}{0.3\rm GeVcm^{-3}}\Big)$ with radius $R$, length $L$, permittivity $\epsilon = 10$ of the cylinder and axion energy density $\rho_a$, where $g_{\gamma}$ is model dependent parameter; $g_{\gamma}(\text{KSVZ}) = -0.96$ and $g_{\gamma}(\text{DFSZ}) = 0.37$. The signal of the axion can be detected by observing electric current in parallel LC circuit with quality factor $Q\ge 2$. The detection of dark matter axions in our method may be feasible in the mass range $m_a =10^{-4}\text{-}10^{-3}\text{eV}$.</description>

      <title>Complex $\tau$ Electric Dipole Moment from GeV-Scale New Physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Among the charged leptons, the $\tau$ electric dipole moment~($d_\tau$) is the least constrained. We show that the Im[$d_\tau$] imposes strong constraints on new physics that have yet to be discussed. Motivated in particular by the Super Tau-Charm Facility (STCF), which will provide a uniquely clean environment for precision $\tau$-physics, we study the momentum-transfer dependence of $d_\tau(q^2)$ and compare the projected sensitivities of STCF and Belle II. Our analysis shows that an axion-like coupling of the $\tau$ lepton can induce sizable real and imaginary components of the EDM. The predicted EDM values may approach the present experimental sensitivities, making them accessible to future measurements at Belle II and the STCF.</description>

      <title>Radiative corrections to $\tau\to\pi\pi\nu_\tau$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07507v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hadronic $\tau$ decays present an opportunity to determine the isovector part of the hadronic-vacuum-polarization contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon in a way complementary to $e^+e^-\to\text{hadrons}$ cross sections. However, the required isospin rotation is only exact in the isospin limit, and corrections need to be under control to draw robust conclusions, most notably for $\tau\to\pi\pi\nu_\tau$ decays to determine the two-pion contribution, $a_\mu^\text{HVP, LO}[\pi\pi,\tau]$. In this work, we present a novel analysis of the required radiative corrections using dispersion relations, thereby extending in a model-independent way the previous analysis in chiral perturbation theory (ChPT) beyond the threshold region. In particular, we include the dominant structure-dependent virtual corrections from pion-pole diagrams, leading to sizable changes in the vicinity of the $\rho(770)$ resonance. Moreover, we work out the matching to ChPT and devise a strategy for a stable numerical evaluation of real-emission contributions near the two-pion threshold, which proves important to capture isospin-breaking corrections enhanced by the threshold singularity. For the numerical analysis, we use a dispersive representation of the pion form factor including the $\rho'$, $\rho''$ resonances, perform fits to the available data sets for the $\tau\to\pi\pi\nu_\tau$ spectral function, and calculate the corresponding radiative correction factor $G_\text{EM}(s)$ in a self-consistent manner. Based on these results, we evaluate the $\tau$-specific isospin-breaking corrections to $a_\mu^\text{HVP, LO}[\pi\pi,\tau]$.</description>

      <title>Discovery prospects for photophobic axion-like particles at a 100 TeV proton--proton collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study heavy photophobic axion-like particles (ALPs) in the limit of an effectively vanishing diphoton coupling, $g_{a\gamma\gamma}\simeq 0$, for which diphoton production and decay are suppressed and collider phenomenology is driven by electroweak interactions ($aWW$, $aZ\gamma$, $aZZ$). We perform detector-level searches at a future $\sqrt{s}=$ 100 TeV $pp$ collider (SppC/FCC-hh), with an integrated luminosity of $\mathcal{L} =$ 20 ab$^{-1}$. We consider $a\to Z\gamma$ and $a\to W^+W^-$ decays. For $pp\to jj\,a$ we include both $s$-channel electroweak exchange and vector boson fusion (VBF)-like topologies, while the tri-$W$ signature arises from associated production $pp\to W^\pm a$ (via $s$-channel exchange) followed by $a\to W^+W^-$. We analyze three final states--$Z\gamma jj$ with $Z\to\ell^+\ell^-$, tri-$W$ ($W^\pm W^\pm W^\mp$) with same-sign dimuons plus jets, and $W^+W^-jj$ with opposite-sign, different-flavor dilepton ($e^\pm\mu^\mp$) plus jets. Among the two $WW$ final states, the VBF-assisted $jj\,a(\to W^+W^-)$ channel overtakes the purely $s$-channel tri-$W$ mode for $m_a \stackrel{&gt;}{\sim}$ 1 TeV, reflecting 100~TeV signal/background kinematic shifts beyond naive energy/luminosity rescaling. A boosted-decision-tree (BDT) classifier built from kinematic observables provides the final signal--background separation, using detector-level simulations of signal and high-statistics SM backgrounds. At $\sqrt{s}=100$ TeV and $\mathcal{L} =$ 20 ab$^{-1}$, we present discovery sensitivities to the ALP--$W$ coupling $g_{aWW}$ over $m_a\in[100,\,7000]$ GeV. In parallel, we report model-independent discovery thresholds on $\sigma\times\mathrm{Br}$ for $pp\to jj\,a$ with $a\to Z\gamma$ and $a\to W^+W^-$, as well as for associated production $pp\to W^\pm a$ with $a\to W^+W^-$....</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The renormalisation group running of fermion mixing matrices in the Standard model and beyond is studied. For the massless 1-loop running with three generations six fixed points are found. Their associated anomalous dimension matrices are calculated and the nature of each fixed point, whether attractive, repulsive or mixed, is determined. An argument is given that the fixed points found at 1-loop must remain fixed points to all orders in perturbation theory and even non-perturbatively, as they are associated with certain differential geometric properties of vector fields on the space of mixing matrices. With $N_g$ dark or sterile neutrinos there is a multiple of $N_g!$ fixed points of the fermion mixing matrix.</description>

      <title>Central exclusive production of $\eta$ and $\eta'$ mesons in diffractive proton-proton collisions at the LHC and the nature of the pomeron</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14870v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Central exclusive production (CEP) of $\eta$ and $\eta'$ mesons in proton-proton collisions at high-energies is discussed. At the LHC the main mechanism for the production of these mesons should be double-pomeron ($\rm I\!P$-$\rm I\!P$) exchange, that is, the fusion reactions ${\rm I\!P I\!P} \to \eta, \eta'$. We show that for a scalar pomeron these fusion reactions are not possible. In contrast, in the tensor-pomeron model CEP of $\eta$ and $\eta'$ mesons via double-pomeron exchange is allowed. We discuss these reactions for the c.m. energy $\sqrt{s} = 29.1$ GeV realised at the WA102 experiment and for $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV corresponding to the LHC experiments. Cross sections and distributions are presented and discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14906v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: CP-odd observables originating from the strange-quark electric dipole moment ($d_s$) are identified in $\gamma^\ast\to K^+K^-\pi^0$ and evaluated in the chiral limit. A nonzero T-odd asymmetry $A_T$ requires anomalous couplings descending from a five-dimensional Chern-Simons construction. Modeling the running of $F_A$ and $F_V$ with vector-meson dominance, we estimate sensitivities to $d_s$ at the level of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-16})\,e\cdot\mathrm{cm}$ in $e^+e^-$ data at CMD-3 and $\mathcal{O}(10^{-18})\,e\cdot\mathrm{cm}$ using existing $J/\psi$ samples at BESIII. Future experiments at the Super Tau-Charm Facility and Belle~II can further improve the reach by an order of magnitude.</description>

Abstract: There is growing interest in viable quantum theories with PT-symmetric non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, but a formulation of transition matrix elements consistent with positivity and perturbative unitarity has so far proved elusive. This Letter provides such a formulation, which relies crucially on the ability to span the state space in such a way that the interaction and energy eigenstates are orthonormal with respect to the same positive-definite inner product. We apply this non-Hermitian approach to two-neutrino flavour oscillations, and show how it can accommodate the seesaw mechanism.</description>

Abstract: We present the first results of the search for sub-MeV fermionic dark matter absorbed by electron targets of germanium using the 205.4~kg$\cdot$day data collected by the CDEX-10 experiment, with the analysis threshold of 160~eVee. No significant dark matter (DM) signals over the background are observed. Results are presented as limits on the cross section of DM--electron interaction. We present new constraints of cross section in the DM range of 0.1--10 keV/$c^2$ for vector and axial-vector interaction. The upper limit on the cross section is set to be $\rm 6.8\times10^{-46}~cm^2$ for vector interaction, and $\rm 2.3\times10^{-46}~cm^2$ for axial-vector interaction at DM mass of 5 keV/$c^2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20907v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmic strings represent an attractive source of gravitational waves (GWs) from the early Universe. However, numerical computation of the GW signal from cosmic strings requires the evaluation of complicated integral and sum expressions, which can become computationally costly in large parameter scans. This motivates us to rederive the GW signal from a network of local stable cosmic strings in the Nambu-Goto approximation and based on the velocity-dependent one-scale model from a ``pedestrian'' perspective. That is, we derive purely analytical expressions for the total GW spectrum, which remain exact wherever possible and whose error can be tracked and reduced in a controlled way in crucial situations in which we are forced to introduce approximations. In this way, we obtain powerful formulas that, unlike existing results in the literature, are valid across the entire frequency spectrum and across the entire conceivable range of cosmic-string tensions. We provide an in-depth discussion of the GW spectra thus obtained, including their characteristic break frequencies and approximate power-law behaviors, comment on the effect of changes in the effective number of degrees of freedom during radiation domination, and conclude with a concise summary of our main formulas that can readily be used in future studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07781v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the role of generalized symmetries in driving non-equilibrium and non-linear phenomena, specifically focusing on turbulent systems. While conventional turbulence studies have revealed inverse cascades driven by conserved quantities integrated over the entire space, such as helicity in three spatial dimensions, the influence of higher-form symmetries, whose conserved charges are defined by integration over subspaces, remains largely unexplored. We demonstrate a novel mechanism where higher-form symmetries naturally induce a self-similar inverse cascade. Taking axion electrodynamics with non-linear topological interaction as a paradigmatic example, we show that the conserved charge associated with its 1-form symmetry drives the system toward large-scale coherent structures through a universal scaling behavior characterized by analytically determined scaling exponents. Our findings suggest that higher-form symmetries can provide a fundamental organizing principle for understanding non-equilibrium phenomena and the emergence of coherent structures in turbulent systems.</description>

      <title>Thermal Field Theory in the Presence of a Background Magnetic Field and its Application to QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00075v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This review has explored the fundamental principles of thermal field theory in the context of a background magnetic field, highlighting its theoretical framework and some of its applications to the thermo-magnetic QCD plasma generated in heavy-ion collisions. Our discussion has been limited to equilibrium systems for clarity and conciseness. We analysed bulk thermodynamic characteristics, including the phase diagram as well as real-time observables, shedding light on the behaviour and dynamics of the thermo-magnetic QCD medium relevant to heavy-ion physics.</description>

      <title>Stochastic analysis of finite-temperature effects on cosmological parameters by artificial neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02223v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the impact of finite-temperature quantum gravity effects on cosmological parameters, particularly the cosmological constant $\Lambda$, by incorporating temperature-dependent quantum corrections into the Hubble parameter. For that purpose, we modify the Cosmic Linear Anisotropy Solving System. We introduce new density parameters, $\Omega_{\Lambda_2}$ and $\Omega_{\Lambda_3}$, arising from finite-temperature quantum gravity contributions, and analyze their influence on the cosmic microwave background power spectrum using advanced machine learning techniques, including artificial neural networks and stochastic optimization. Our results reveal that $\Omega_{\Lambda_2}$ assumes a negative value, consistent with dimensional regularization in renormalization and that the presence of $\Omega_{\Lambda_2}$ as well as $\Omega_{\Lambda_3}$ enhances model accuracy. Numerical analyses demonstrate that the inclusion of these parameters improves the fit to 2018 Planck data. Although further work is required, our results suggest that finite-temperature quantum gravity effects may play a non-negligible role in cosmological evolution. Although the Hubble tension persists, our findings highlight the potential of quantum gravitational corrections in refining cosmological models and motivate further investigation into higher-order thermal effects and polarization data constraints.</description>

      <title>Late-blooming magnetars: awakening as long period transients after a dormant cooling epoch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05373v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Long-period transients are an elusive class of compact objects uncovered by radio surveys. While magnetars are a leading candidate for those sources that appear isolated, several observational properties challenge the established evolutionary framework: (i) low quiescent X-ray luminosities, (ii) $\sim$hour-long rotational periods, and (iii) highly-variable radio flux. It is shown via magnetothermal modelling that, if electric currents thread the fluid core at the time of crust freezing, the neutron star remains multiband silent for an initial period of approximately 0.1 Myr while cooling passively. Once the crust becomes cold enough, the Hall effect begins to dominate the magnetic evolution, triggering crustal failures that inject magnetospheric twist that initiates radio pulsing while depleting rotational kinetic energy from an already-slow star. Depending on where electric currents circulate, such 'late-blooming' magnetars manifesting as long-period transients may thus form a distinct branch from soft gamma repeaters and anomalous X-ray pulsars.</description>

      <title>Di-nucleons do not form bound states at heavy pion mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05547v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a high-statistics lattice QCD calculation of the low-energy two-nucleon scattering amplitudes. In order to address discrepancies in the literature, the calculation is performed at a heavy pion mass in the limit that the light quark masses are equal to the physical strange quark mass, $m_\pi = m_K \simeq 714 $ MeV. Using a state-of-the-art momentum space method, we rule out the presence of a bound di-nucleon in both the isospin 0 (deuteron) and 1 (di-neutron) channels, in contrast with many previous results that made use of compact hexaquark creation operators. In order to diagnose the discrepancy, we add such hexaquark interpolating operators to our basis and find that they do not affect the determination of the two-nucleon finite volume spectrum, and thus they do not couple to deeply bound di-nucleons that are missed by the momentum-space operators. Further, we perform a high-statistics calculation of the HAL QCD potential on the same gauge ensembles and find qualitative agreement with our main results. We conclude that di-nucleons do not form bound states at heavy pion masses and that previous identification of deeply bound di-nucleons must have arisen from a misidentification of the spectrum from off-diagonal elements of a correlation function.</description>

      <title>Explaining higher-order correlations between elliptic and triangular flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09283v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ALICE and CMS Collaborations have analyzed a number of cumulants mixing elliptic flow ($v_2$) and triangular flow ($v_3$), involving up to $8$ particles, in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC. We unravel an unexpected simplicity in these complex mathematical quantities for collisions at fixed impact parameter. We show that as one increases the order in $v_2$, for a given order in $v_3$, the changes in the cumulants are solely determined by the mean elliptic flow in the reaction plane, which originates from the almond-shaped geometry of the overlap area between the colliding nuclei. We derive simple analytic relations between cumulants of different orders on this basis. These relations are in good agreement with recent data from the CMS Collaboration. We argue that agreement will be further improved if the analysis is repeated with a finer centrality binning. We make quantitative predictions for cumulants of order 10 which have not yet been analyzed.</description>

      <title>Geometry Induced Chiral Transport and Entanglement in $AdS_2$ Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09714v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the real-time chiral dynamics of Dirac fermions in AdS$_2$ and AdS$_2$ black hole backgrounds. The spacetime curvature generates a spin connection term, acting as an effective magnetic field and a position-dependent chiral chemical potential. This leads to strongly asymmetric wave propagation, confined within an inhomogeneous Lieb-Robinson cone. The front velocities decrease with increasing fermion mass and horizon radius. The entanglement entropy grows inside the causal cone, and it saturates due to screening/dephasing in the finite inhomogeneous chain. In dipole-dipole collision, the central bipartite entropy rises when the inward Lieb-Robinson fronts intersect, forming a bright ridge in the local entanglement profile. Charge and current correlators peak at the front arrival, providing a real-time diagnostic of chiral transport. These results establish a causality-respecting framework, linking curvature and horizons to transport and entanglement in (1+1)-dimensional fermionic matter.</description>

      <title>Coherent-state boundary conditions as the first-principles origin of background fields in QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21122v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: QED formulated in prescribed classical background electromagnetic fields is a standard framework for strong-field and laser\textendash matter interactions. It is usually treated as a theory modified by externally imposed fields, obscuring its precise relation to full QED and, in particular, the role of asymptotic boundary conditions for the gauge field. Starting from an operator-based formulation, we show that QED with background fields is not a distinct theory but arises as a well-defined boundary-condition limit of full QED, in which the classical background field emerges from coherent-state boundary conditions on the quantized electromagnetic field. In this limit, the conventional generating functional used in calculations with prescribed background fields is recovered naturally, while relaxing the boundary conditions allows depletion and backreaction effects to be incorporated within the same framework. The central new result is a rigorous operator-level proof of the equivalence between the fixed background-field approximation and coherent-state asymptotic boundary conditions\textemdash a formulation that, to our knowledge, has not been made explicit in previous approaches. We further demonstrate that the apparent time dependence of background fields does not originate from an explicitly time-dependent Hamiltonian, but instead reflects the choice of picture\textemdash Schr\"{o}dinger versus Heisenberg\textemdash in the underlying quantum theory. Rather than introducing new properties of coherent states, our analysis provides a first-principles reinterpretation of the fixed background-field approximation as a controlled and picture-dependent limit of full QED.</description>

      <title>Beyond Wigner: Non-Invertible Symmetries Preserve Probabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07110v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the traditional notion of symmetry in quantum theory was expanded to so-called generalised or categorical symmetries, which, unlike ordinary group symmetries, may be non-invertible. This appears to be at odds with Wigner's theorem, which requires quantum symmetries to be implemented by (anti)unitary -- and hence invertible -- operators in order to preserve probabilities. We resolve this puzzle for (higher) fusion category symmetries $\mathcal{C}$ by proposing that, instead of acting by unitary operators on a fixed Hilbert space, symmetry defects in $\mathcal{C}$ act as isometries between distinct Hilbert spaces constructed from twisted sectors. As a result, we find that non-invertible symmetries naturally act as trace-preserving quantum channels. Crucially, our construction relies on the symmetry category $\mathcal{C}$ being unitary. We illustrate our proposal through several examples that include Tambara-Yamagami, Fibonacci, and Yang-Lee as well as higher categorical symmetries.</description>
