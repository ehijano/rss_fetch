      <title>Diquarks in lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diquarks are often invoked as QCD effective degrees of freedom to describe baryons as well as certain exotic hadrons in phenomenology. However, even though they are successful in describing many of these low lying QCD states, they and their properties have been difficult to pin down. Here we present progress in studying diquarks in a gauge-invariant setup through embedding them in a parent hadron containing a heavy spectator quark using lattice QCD calculations.</description>

      <title>Hybrid renormalization for distribution amplitude of a light baryon in large momentum effective theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lightcone distribution amplitudes for a light baryon can be extracted through the simulation of the quasi-distribution amplitudes (quasi-DAs) on the lattice. We implement the hybrid renormalization for the quasi DAs of light baryons. Lattice simulations are performed using $N_f = 2+1$ stout-smeared clover fermions and a tree-level Symanzik-improved gauge action, with three lattice spacings of ${0.105, 0.077, 0.052}$ fm. By analyzing zero-momentum matrix elements for different lattice spacings, we extract the linear divergence associated with the Wilson-line self-energy. Matching to perturbative matrix elements in the $\overline{\text{MS}}$ scheme yields the residual self-renormalization factors. Using these factors, we renormalize the quasi-DAs within the hybrid scheme, which combines self-renormalization at large separations and the ratio scheme at short distances. The renormalized results demonstrate effective cancellation of linear divergences and yield smooth, continuum-like coordinate-space distributions suitable for subsequent Fourier transformation and perturbative matching. These results establish the viability of both self and hybrid renormalization frameworks for light baryon quasi-DAs, providing a robust foundation for LaMET-based determinations of light-cone distribution amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Current-Enhanced Excited States in Lattice QCD Three-Point Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excited-state contamination remains one of the leading sources of systematic uncertainty in the precise determination of hadron structure observables from lattice QCD. In this letter, we present a general argument, inspired by current-meson dominance and implemented through the variational method, to identify which excited states are enhanced by the choice of the inserted current and kinematics. The argument is supported by numerical evidence across multiple hadronic channels and provides both a conceptual understanding and practical guidance to account for excited-state effects in hadron three-point function analyses.</description>

      <title>Baryogenesis Induced by Magnetic Field Effects During the Electroweak Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16124v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the first-order electroweak phase transition in the background of a hypermagnetic field with three-dimensional lattice simulation. The generation of baryon asymmetry is observed, and we present the relationship between baryon number asymmetry and magnetic field strength and its helicity. We find the magnetic field strength required to achieve the correct matter-antimatter asymmetry is about $10^{-17}\sim10^{-14}$ Gauss at present, depending on the correlation length of the helical magnetic field. This study provides a mechanism for explaining the baryon number asymmetry with cosmic magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Gravitational form factors in the perturbative limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11316v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generalized distribution amplitudes (GDAs) have attracted significant attention in recent years due to their connection with the energy-momentum tensor (EMT) form factors (FFs). The GDAs can be experimentally accessed through the study of amplitudes in $\gamma^{\ast} \gamma \to M_1 M_2$ and $\gamma^{\ast} \to M_1 M_2 \gamma$, where $M_1M_2$ is a pseudoscalar meson pair such as $\pi \eta $ and $\eta \eta^{\prime}$. In this work, we calculate these amplitudes in the perturbative limit and express the extracted $M_1M_2$ GDAs in terms of meson distribution amplitudes that have been constrained by the previous experiments. Our explicit calculation verifies the existence of a new EMT FF that violates the conservation law of EMT when the hadronic matrix element of the EMT operator is considered separately for each quark flavor. In addition, our result shows that the $M_1M_2$ GDAs are identical in $\gamma^{\ast} \gamma \to M_1 M_2$ and $\gamma^{\ast} \to M_1 M_2 \gamma$, which confirms the universality of GDAs in the perturbative limit. In the future, the GDAs and the EMT FFs studied in this paper can be probed at Belle II. Our study enhances the accessibility to the $P$-wave GDAs in $\gamma^{\ast} \gamma \to M_1 M_2$ and $\gamma^{\ast} \to M_1 M_2 \gamma$, and provides a promising approach for searching for exotic hybrid mesons in future experiments.</description>
