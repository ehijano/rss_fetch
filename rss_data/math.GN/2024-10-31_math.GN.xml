      <title>Development of a Python-Based Software for Calculating the Jones Polynomial: Insights into the Behavior of Polymers and Biopolymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This thesis details a Python-based software designed to calculate the Jones polynomial, a vital mathematical tool from Knot Theory used for characterizing the topological and geometrical complexity of curves in \( \mathbb{R}^3 \), which is essential in understanding physical systems of filaments, including the behavior of polymers and biopolymers. The Jones polynomial serves as a topological invariant capable of distinguishing between different knot structures. This capability is fundamental to characterizing the architecture of molecular chains, such as proteins and DNA. Traditional computational methods for deriving the Jones polynomial have been limited by closure-schemes and high execution costs, which can be impractical for complex structures like those that appear in real life. This software implements methods that significantly reduce calculation times, allowing for more efficient and practical applications in the study of biological polymers. It utilizes a divide-and-conquer approach combined with parallel computing and applies recursive Reidemeister moves to optimize the computation, transitioning from an exponential to a near-linear runtime for specific configurations. This thesis provides an overview of the software's functions, detailed performance evaluations using protein structures as test cases, and a discussion of the implications for future research and potential algorithmic improvements.</description>

      <title>Eremenko's conjecture, wandering Lakes of Wada, and maverick points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.10256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.10256v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a general technique for realising full closed subsets of the complex plane as wandering sets of entire functions. Using this construction, we solve a number of open problems.
  (1) We construct a counterexample to Eremenko's conjecture, a central problem in transcendental dynamics that asks whether every connected component of the set of escaping points of a transcendental entire function is unbounded.
  (2) We prove that there is a transcendental entire function for which infinitely many Fatou components share the same boundary. This resolves the long-standing problem whether "Lakes of Wada continua" can arise in complex dynamics, and answers the analogue of a question of Fatou from 1920 concerning Fatou components of rational functions.
  (3) We answer a question of Rippon concerning the existence of non-escaping points on the boundary of a bounded escaping wandering domain, that is, a wandering Fatou component contained in the escaping set. In fact we show that the set of such points can have positive Lebesgue measure.
  (4) We give the first example of an entire function having a simply connected Fatou component whose closure has a disconnected complement, answering a question of Boc Thaler.
  In view of (3), we introduce the concept of "maverick points": points on the boundary of a wandering domain whose accumulation behaviour differs from that of internal points. We prove that the set of such points has harmonic measure zero, but that it can nonetheless be rather large. For example, it may have positive planar Lebesgue measure.</description>
