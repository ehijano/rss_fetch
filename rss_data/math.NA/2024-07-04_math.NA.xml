      <title>Properties of core-EP matrices and binary relationships</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, various properties of core-EP matrices are investigated. We introduce the MPDMP matrix associated with $A$ and by means of it, some properties and equivalent conditions of core-EP matrices can be obtained. Also, properties of MPD, DMP, and CMP inverses are studied and we prove that in the class of core-EP matrices, DMP, MPD, and Drazin inverses are the same. Moreover, DMP and MPD binary relation orders are introduced and the relationship between these orders and other binary relation orders are considered.</description>

      <title>A pair of Second-order complex-valued, N-split operator-splitting methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of operator-splitting methods to solve differential equations is widespread, but the methods are generally only defined for a given number of operators, most commonly two. Most operator-splitting methods are not generalizable to problems with $N$ operators for arbitrary $N$. In fact, there are only two known methods that can be applied to general $N$-split problems: the first-order Lie--Trotter (or Godunov) method and the second-order Strang (or Strang--Marchuk) method. In this paper, we derive two second-order operator-splitting methods that also generalize to $N$-split problems. These methods are complex valued but have positive real parts, giving them favorable stability properties, and require few sub-integrations per stage, making them computationally inexpensive. They can also be used as base methods from which to construct higher-order $N$-split operator-splitting methods with positive real parts. We verify the orders of accuracy of these new $N$-split methods and demonstrate their favorable efficiency properties against well-known real-valued operator-splitting methods on both real-valued and complex-valued differential equations.</description>

      <title>High-order In-cell Discontinuous Reconstruction path-conservative methods for nonconservative hyperbolic systems -- DR.MOOD generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we develop a new framework to deal numerically with discontinuous solutions in nonconservative hyperbolic systems. First an extension of the MOOD methodology to nonconservative systems based on Taylor expansions is presented. This extension combined with an in-cell discontinuous reconstruction operator are the key points to develop a new family of high-order methods that are able to capture exactly isolated shocks. Several test cases are proposed to validate these methods for the Modified Shallow Water equations and the Two-Layer Shallow Water system.</description>

      <title>Inf-sup theory for the quasi-static Biot's equations in poroelasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the two-field formulation of the quasi-static Biot's equations by means of the inf-sup theory. For this purpose, we exploit an equivalent four-field formulation of the equations, introducing the so-called total pressure and total fluid content as independent variables. We establish existence, uniqueness and stability of the solution. Our stability estimate is two-sided and robust, meaning that the regularity established for the solution matches the regularity requirements for the data and the involved constants are independent of all material parameters. We prove also that additional regularity in space of the data implies, in some cases, corresponding additional regularity in space of the solution. These results are instrumental to the design and the analysis of discretizations enjoying accurate stability and error estimates.</description>

      <title>Inf-sup stable discretization of the quasi-static Biot's equations in poroelasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new full discretization of the Biot's equations in poroelasticity. The construction is driven by the inf-sup theory, which we recently developed. It builds upon the four-field formulation of the equations obtained by introducing the total pressure and the total fluid content. We discretize in space with Lagrange finite elements and in time with backward Euler. We establish inf-sup stability and quasi-optimality of the proposed discretization, with robust constants with respect to all material parameters. We further construct an interpolant showing how the error decays for smooth solutions.</description>

      <title>A narrow band finite element method for the level set equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A finite element method is introduced to track interface evolution governed by the level set equation. The method solves for the level set indicator function in a narrow band around the interface. An extension procedure, which is essential for a narrow band level set method, is introduced based on a finite element $L^2$- or $H^1$-projection combined with the ghost-penalty method. This procedure is formulated as a linear variational problem in a narrow band around the surface, making it computationally efficient and suitable for rigorous error analysis. The extension method is combined with a discontinuous Galerkin space discretization and a BDF time-stepping scheme. The paper analyzes the stability and accuracy of the extension procedure and evaluates the performance of the resulting narrow band finite element method for the level set equation through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>A nonlocal traffic flow model with stochastic velocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a nonlocal traffic flow model based on a scalar conservation law, where a stochastic velocity function is assumed. In addition to the modeling, theoretical properties of the stochastic nonlocal model are provided, also addressing the question of well-posedness. A detailed numerical analysis offers insights how the stochasticity affects the evolution of densities. Finally, numerical examples illustrate the mean behavior of solutions and the influence of parameters for a large number of realizations.</description>

      <title>Numerical analysis of a porous natural convection system with vorticity and viscous dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we propose and analyse a new formulation and pointwise divergence-free mixed finite element methods for the numerical approximation of Darcy--Brinkman equations in vorticity--velocity--pressure form, coupled with a transport equation for thermal energy with viscous dissipative effect and mixed Navier-type boundary conditions. The solvability analysis of the continuous and discrete problems is significantly more involved than usual as it hinges on Banach spaces needed to properly control the advective and dissipative terms in the non-isothermal energy balance equation. We proceed by decoupling the set of equations and use the Banach fixed-point theorem in combination with the abstract theory for perturbed saddle-point problems. Some of the necessary estimates are straightforward modifications of well-known results, while other technical tools require a more elaborated analysis. The velocity is approximated by Raviart--Thomas elements, the vorticity uses N\'ed\'elec spaces of the first kind, the pressure is approximated by piecewise polynomials, and the temperature by continuous and piecewise polynomials of one degree higher than pressure. Special care is needed to establish discrete inf-sup conditions since the curl of the discrete vorticity is not necessarily contained in the discrete velocity space, therefore suggesting to use two different Raviart--Thomas interpolants. A discrete fixed-point argument is used to show well-posedness of the Galerkin scheme. Error estimates in appropriate norms are derived, and a few representative numerical examples in 2D and 3D and with mixed boundary conditions are provided.</description>

      <title>Randomized Implicitly Restarted Arnoldi method for the non-symmetric eigenvalue problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a randomized algorithm for solving the non-symmetric eigenvalue problem, referred to as randomized Implicitly Restarted Arnoldi (rIRA). This method relies on using a sketch-orthogonal basis during the Arnoldi process while maintaining the Arnoldi relation and exploiting a restarting scheme to focus on a specific part of the spectrum. We analyze this method and show that it retains useful properties of the Implicitly Restarted Arnoldi (IRA) method, such as restarting without adding errors to the Ritz pairs and implicitly applying polynomial filtering. Experiments are presented to validate the numerical efficiency of the proposed randomized eigenvalue solver.</description>

      <title>Monolithic overlapping Schwarz preconditioners for nonlinear finite element simulations of laser beam welding processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Highly resolved finite element simulations of a laser beam welding process are considered. The thermomechanical behavior of this process is modeled with a set of thermoelasticity equations resulting in a nonlinear, nonsymmetric saddle point system. Newton's method is used to solve the nonlinearity and suitable domain decomposition preconditioners are applied to accelerate the convergence of the iterative method used to solve all linearized systems. Since a onelevel Schwarz preconditioner is in general not scalable, a second level has to be added. Therefore, the construction and numerical analysis of a monolithic, twolevel overlapping Schwarz approach with the GDSW (Generalized Dryja-Smith-Widlund) coarse space and an economic variant thereof are presented here.</description>

      <title>When big data actually are low-rank, or entrywise approximation of certain function-generated matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The article concerns low-rank approximation of matrices generated by sampling a smooth function of two $m$-dimensional variables. We refute an argument made in the literature that, for a specific class of analytic functions, such matrices admit accurate entrywise approximation of rank that is independent of $m$. We provide a theoretical explanation of the numerical results presented in support of this argument, describing three narrower classes of functions for which $n \times n$ function-generated matrices can be approximated within an entrywise error of order $\varepsilon$ with rank $\mathcal{O}(\log(n) \varepsilon^{-2} \mathrm{polylog}(\varepsilon^{-1}))$ that is independent of the dimension $m$: (i) functions of the inner product of the two variables, (ii) functions of the squared Euclidean distance between the variables, and (iii) shift-invariant positive-definite kernels. We extend our argument to low-rank tensor-train approximation of tensors generated with functions of the multi-linear product of their $m$-dimensional variables. We discuss our results in the context of low-rank approximation of attention in transformer neural networks.</description>

      <title>A Graded Mesh Refinement for 2D Poisson's Equation on Non Convex Polygonal Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work delves into solving the two dimensional Poisson problem through the Finite Element Method which is relevant in various physical scenarios including heat conduction, electrostatics, gravity potential, and fluid dynamics. However, finding exact solutions to these problems can be complicated and challenging due to complexities in the domains such as re-entrant corners, cracks, and discontinuities of the solution along the boundaries, and due to the singular source function. Our focus in this work is to solve the Poisson equation in the presence of re entrant corners at the vertices of domain where some of the interior angles are greater than 180 degrees. When the domain features a re entrant corner, the numerical solution can display singular behavior near the corners. To address this, we propose a graded mesh algorithm that helps us to tackle the solution near singular points. We derive H1 and L2 error estimate results, and we use MATLAB to present numerical results that validate our theoretical findings. By exploring these concepts, we hope to provide new insights into the Poisson problem and inspire future research into the application of numerical methods to solve complex physical scenarios</description>

      <title>Time transient Simulations via Finite Element Network Analysis: Theoretical Formulation and Numerical Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper extends the finite element network analysis (FENA) to include a dynamic time-transient formulation. FENA was initially formulated in the context of the linear static analysis of 1D and 2D elastic structures. By introducing the concept of super finite network element, this paper provides the necessary foundation to extend FENA to linear time-transient simulations for both homogeneous and inhomogeneous domains. The concept of neural network concatenation, originally formulated to combine networks representative of different structural components in space, is extended to the time domain. Network concatenation in time enables training neural network models based on data available in a limited time frame and then using the trained networks to simulate the system evolution beyond the initial time window characteristic of the training data set. The proposed methodology is validated by applying FENA to the transient simulation of one-dimensional structural elements (such as rods and beams) and by comparing the results with either analytical or finite element solutions. Results confirm that FENA accurately predicts the dynamic response of the physical system and, while introducing an error on the order of 1% (compared to analytical or computational solutions of the governing differential equations), it is capable of delivering extreme computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Anvil: An integration of artificial intelligence, sampling techniques, and a combined CAD-CFD tool</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce an open-source integrated CAD-CFD tool, Anvil, which combines FreeCAD for CAD modeling and OpenFOAM for CFD analysis, along with an AI-based optimization method (Bayesian optimization) and other sampling algorithms. Anvil serves as a scientific machine learning tool for shape optimization in three modes: data generation, CFD evaluation, and shape optimization. In data generation mode, it automatically runs CFD evaluations and generates data for training a surrogate model. In optimization mode, it searches for the optimal design under given requirements and optimization metrics. In CFD mode, a single CAD file can be evaluated with a single OpenFOAM run. To use Anvil, experimenters provide a JSON configuration file and a parametric CAD seed design. Anvil can be used to study solid-fluid dynamics for any subsonic flow conditions and has been demonstrated in various simulation and optimization use cases. The open-source code for the tool, installation process, artifacts (such as CAD seed designs and example STL models), experimentation results, and detailed documentation can be found at \url{https://github.com/symbench/Anvil}.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of UAV-Assisted RF-UOWC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a relay-assisted solution for downlink communications in a mixed system of Radio Frequency (RF) and Underwater Optical Wireless Communications (UOWC) technologies. During the initial downlink phase, data transmission occurs via RF link between hovering Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and the floating buoys at the water surface. As fixed buoy acts as amplify-and-forward relays, the second UOWC link represents downlink signal transmission from the floating buoy to the underwater device. Best relay selection is adopted, meaning that only the buoy with the best estimated RF-based UAV-buoy channel will perform signal transmission to an underwater device. Analytical expression for the outage probability is derived and utilized to examine the system's performance behaviour for various UOWC and RF channel conditions.</description>

      <title>A novel shape optimization approach for source identification in elliptic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel shape optimization approach for the source identification of elliptic equations. This identification problem arises from two application backgrounds: actuator placement in PDE-constrained optimal controls and the regularized least-squares formulation of source identifications. The optimization problem seeks both the source strength and its support. By eliminating the variable associated with the source strength, we reduce the problem to a shape optimization problem for a coupled elliptic system, known as the first-order optimality system. As a model problem, we derive the shape derivative for the regularized least-squares formulation of the inverse source problem and propose a gradient descent shape optimization algorithm, implemented using the level-set method. Several numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>SFC: Achieve Accurate Fast Convolution under Low-precision Arithmetic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast convolution algorithms, including Winograd and FFT, can efficiently accelerate convolution operations in deep models. However, these algorithms depend on high-precision arithmetic to maintain inference accuracy, which conflicts with the model quantization. To resolve this conflict and further improve the efficiency of quantized convolution, we proposes SFC, a new algebra transform for fast convolution by extending the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) with symbolic computing, in which only additions are required to perform the transformation at specific transform points, avoiding the calculation of irrational number and reducing the requirement for precision. Additionally, we enhance convolution efficiency by introducing correction terms to convert invalid circular convolution outputs of the Fourier method into effective ones. The numerical error analysis is presented for the first time in this type of work and proves that our algorithms can provide a 3.68x multiplication reduction for 3x3 convolution, while the Winograd algorithm only achieves a 2.25x reduction with similarly low numerical errors. Experiments carried out on benchmarks and FPGA show that our new algorithms can further improve the computation efficiency of quantized models while maintaining accuracy, surpassing both the quantization-alone method and existing works on fast convolution quantization.</description>

      <title>Nesterov's Accelerated Jacobi-Type Methods for Large-scale Symmetric Positive Semidefinite Linear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solving symmetric positive semidefinite linear systems is an essential task in many scientific computing problems. While Jacobi-type methods, including the classical Jacobi method and the weighted Jacobi method, exhibit simplicity in their forms and friendliness to parallelization, they are not attractive either because of the potential convergence failure or their slow convergence rate. This paper aims to showcase the possibility of improving classical Jacobi-type methods by employing Nesterov's acceleration technique that results in an accelerated Jacobi-type method with improved convergence properties. Simultaneously, it preserves the appealing features for parallel implementation. In particular, we show that the proposed method has an $O\left(\frac{1}{t^2}\right)$ convergence rate in terms of objective function values of the associated convex quadratic optimization problem, where $t\geq 1$ denotes the iteration counter. To further improve the practical performance of the proposed method, we also develop and analyze a restarted variant of the method, which is shown to have an $O\left(\frac{(\log_2(t))^2}{t^2}\right)$ convergence rate when the coefficient matrix is positive definite. Furthermore, we conduct appropriate numerical experiments to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed method. Our numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the classical Jacobi-type methods and the conjugate gradient method and shows a comparable performance as the preconditioned conjugate gradient method with a diagonal preconditioner. Finally, we develop a parallel implementation and conduct speed-up tests on some large-scale systems. Our results indicate that the proposed framework is highly scalable.</description>

      <title>Tensor-train methods for sequential state and parameter learning in state-space models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.09891v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider sequential state and parameter learning in state-space models with intractable state transition and observation processes. By exploiting low-rank tensor train (TT) decompositions, we propose new sequential learning methods for joint parameter and state estimation under the Bayesian framework. Our key innovation is the introduction of scalable function approximation tools such as TT for recursively learning the sequentially updated posterior distributions. The function approximation perspective of our methods offers tractable error analysis and potentially alleviates the particle degeneracy faced by many particle-based methods. In addition to the new insights into the algorithmic design, our methods complement conventional particle-based methods. Our TT-based approximations naturally define conditional Knothe--Rosenblatt (KR) rearrangements that lead to parameter estimation, filtering, smoothing and path estimation accompanying our sequential learning algorithms, which open the door to removing potential approximation bias. We also explore several preconditioning techniques based on either linear or nonlinear KR rearrangements to enhance the approximation power of TT for practical problems. We demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of our proposed methods on several state-space models, in which our methods achieve state-of-the-art estimation accuracy and computational performance.</description>

      <title>Computing leaky Lamb waves for waveguides between elastic half-spaces using spectral collocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.10064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In non-destructive evaluation guided wave inspections, the elastic structure to be inspected is often embedded within other elastic media and the ensuing leaky waves are complex and non-trivial to compute; we consider the canonical example of an elastic waveguide surrounded by other elastic materials that demonstrates the fundamental issues with calculating the leaky waves in such systems. Due to the complex wavenumber solutions required to represent them, leaky waves pose significant challenges to existing numerical methods, with methods that spatially discretise the field to retrieve them suffering from the exponential growth of their amplitude far into the surrounding media. We present a spectral collocation method yielding an accurate and efficient identification of these modes, leaking into elastic half-spaces. We discretise the elastic domains and, depending on the exterior bulk wavespeeds, select appropriate mappings of the discretised domain to complex paths, in which the numerical solution decays and the physics of the problem are preserved. By iterating through all possible radiation cases, the full set of dispersion and attenuation curves are successfully retrieved and validated, where possible, against the commercially available software DISPERSE. As an independent validation, dispersion curves are obtained from finite element simulations of time-dependent waves using Fourier analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02208v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present difference schemes for stochastic transport equations with low-regularity velocity fields. We establish $L^2$ stability and convergence of the difference approximations under conditions that are less strict than those required for deterministic transport equations. The $L^2$ estimate, crucial for the analysis, is obtained through a discrete duality argument and a comprehensive examination of a class of backward parabolic difference schemes.</description>

      <title>Anti-symmetric and Positivity Preserving Formulation of a Spectral Method for Vlasov-Poisson Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05439v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the anti-symmetric properties of a spectral discretization for the one-dimensional Vlasov-Poisson equations. The discretization is based on a spectral expansion in velocity with the symmetrically weighted Hermite basis functions, central finite differencing in space, and an implicit Runge Kutta integrator in time. The proposed discretization preserves the anti-symmetric structure of the advection operator in the Vlasov equation, resulting in a stable numerical method. We apply such discretization to two formulations: the canonical Vlasov-Poisson equations and their continuously transformed square-root representation. The latter preserves the positivity of the particle distribution function. We derive analytically the conservation properties of both formulations, including particle number, momentum, and energy, which are verified numerically on the following benchmark problems: manufactured solution, linear and nonlinear Landau damping, two-stream instability, bump-on-tail instability, and ion-acoustic wave.</description>

Abstract: We establish necessary and sufficient conditions for invertibility of symmetric three-by-three block matrices having a double saddle-point structure \fb{that guarantee the unique solvability of double saddle-point systems}.

Abstract: This article presents the numerical verification and validation of several inversion algorithms for V-line transforms (VLTs) acting on symmetric 2-tensor fields in the plane. The analysis of these transforms and the theoretical foundation of their inversion methods were studied in a recent work [G. Ambartsoumian, R. K. Mishra, and I. Zamindar, Inverse Problems, 40 (2024), 035003]. We demonstrate the efficient recovery of an unknown symmetric 2-tensor field from various combinations of the longitudinal, transverse, and mixed VLTs, their corresponding first moments, and the star VLT. The paper examines the performance of the proposed algorithms in different settings and illustrates the results with numerical simulations on smooth and non-smooth phantoms.</description>

      <title>High Order Accurate Hermite Schemes on Curvilinear Grids with Compatibility Boundary Conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19496v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High order accurate Hermite methods for the wave equation on curvilinear domains are presented. Boundaries are treated using centered compatibility conditions rather than more standard one-sided approximations. Both first-order-in-time (FOT) and second-order-in-time (SOT) Hermite schemes are developed. Hermite methods use the solution and multiple derivatives as unknowns and achieve space-time orders of accuracy $2m-1$ (FOT) and $2m$ (SOT) for methods using $(m+1)^d$ degree of freedom per node in $d$ dimensions. The compatibility boundary conditions (CBCs) are based on taking time derivatives of the boundary conditions and using the governing equations to replace the time derivatives with spatial derivatives. These resulting constraint equations augment the Hermite scheme on the boundary. The solvability of the equations resulting from the compatibility conditions are analyzed. Numerical examples demonstrate the accuracy and stability of the new schemes in two dimensions.</description>

Abstract: We derive bounds on the moduli of the eigenvalues of special type of rational matrices using the following techniques/methods: (1) the Bauer-Fike theorem on an associated block matrix of the given rational matrix, (2) by associating a real rational function, along with Rouch$\text{\'e}$ theorem for the rational matrix and (3) by a numerical radius inequality for a block matrix for the rational matrix. These bounds are compared when the coefficients are unitary matrices. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the results obtained.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.13824v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present TriMe++, a multi-threaded software library designed for generating two-dimensional meshes for intricate geometric shapes using the Delaunay triangulation. Multi-threaded parallel computing is implemented throughout the meshing procedure, making it suitable for fast generation of large-scale meshes. Three iterative meshing algorithms are implemented: the DistMesh algorithm, the centroidal Voronoi diagram meshing, and a hybrid of the two. We compare the performance of the three meshing methods in TriMe++, and show that the hybrid method retains the advantages of the other two. The software library achieves significant parallel speedup when generating a large mesh with $10^6$ points. TriMe++ can handle complicated geometries and generates adaptive meshes of high quality.</description>

      <title>A New Fast Adaptive Linearized Alternating Direction Multiplier Method for Convex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11435v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work proposes a novel adaptive linearized alternating direction multiplier method (LADMM) to convex optimization, which improves the convergence rate of the LADMM-based algorithm by adjusting step-size iteratively.The innovation of this method is to utilize the information of the current iteration point to adaptively select the appropriate parameters, thus expanding the selection of the subproblem step size and improving the convergence rate of the algorithm while ensuring convergence.The advantage of this method is that it can improve the convergence rate of the algorithm as much as possible without compromising the convergence. This is very beneficial for the solution of optimization problems because the traditional linearized alternating direction multiplier method has a trade-off in the selection of the regular term coefficients: larger coefficients ensure convergence but tend to lead to small step sizes, while smaller coefficients allow for an increase in the iterative step size but tend to lead to the algorithm's non-convergence. This balance can be better handled by adaptively selecting the parameters, thus improving the efficiency of the algorithm.</description>

      <title>Operator Learning of Lipschitz Operators: An Information-Theoretic Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Operator learning based on neural operators has emerged as a promising paradigm for the data-driven approximation of operators, mapping between infinite-dimensional Banach spaces. Despite significant empirical progress, our theoretical understanding regarding the efficiency of these approximations remains incomplete. This work addresses the parametric complexity of neural operator approximations for the general class of Lipschitz continuous operators. Motivated by recent findings on the limitations of specific architectures, termed curse of parametric complexity, we here adopt an information-theoretic perspective. Our main contribution establishes lower bounds on the metric entropy of Lipschitz operators in two approximation settings; uniform approximation over a compact set of input functions, and approximation in expectation, with input functions drawn from a probability measure. It is shown that these entropy bounds imply that, regardless of the activation function used, neural operator architectures attaining an approximation accuracy $\epsilon$ must have a size that is exponentially large in $\epsilon^{-1}$. The size of architectures is here measured by counting the number of encoded bits necessary to store the given model in computational memory. The results of this work elucidate fundamental trade-offs and limitations in operator learning.</description>

      <title>Neurodevelopmental disorders modeling using isogeometric analysis, dynamic domain expansion and local refinement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00810v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) have arisen as one of the most prevailing chronic diseases within the US. Often associated with severe adverse impacts on the formation of vital central and peripheral nervous systems during the neurodevelopmental process, NDDs are comprised of a broad spectrum of disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and epilepsy, characterized by progressive and pervasive detriments to cognitive, speech, memory, motor, and other neurological functions in patients. However, the heterogeneous nature of NDDs poses a significant roadblock to identifying the exact pathogenesis, impeding accurate diagnosis and the development of targeted treatment planning. A computational NDDs model holds immense potential in enhancing our understanding of the multifaceted factors involved and could assist in identifying the root causes to expedite treatment development. To tackle this challenge, we introduce optimal neurotrophin concentration to the driving force and degradation of neurotrophin to the synaptogenesis process of a 2D phase field neuron growth model using isogeometric analysis to simulate neurite retraction and atrophy. The optimal neurotrophin concentration effectively captures the inverse relationship between neurotrophin levels and neurite survival, while its degradation regulates concentration levels. Leveraging dynamic domain expansion, the model efficiently expands the domain based on outgrowth patterns to minimize degrees of freedom. Based on truncated T-splines, our model simulates the evolving process of complex neurite structures by applying local refinement adaptively to the cell/neurite boundary. Furthermore, a thorough parameter investigation is conducted with detailed comparisons against neuron cell cultures in experiments, enhancing our fundamental understanding of the mechanisms underlying NDDs.</description>
