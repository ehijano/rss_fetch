      <title>The silent threat of methane to ecosystems: Insights from mechanistic modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past century, atmospheric methane levels have nearly doubled, posing a significant threat to ecosystems. Despite this, studies on its direct impact on species interactions are lacking. Although bioaccumulation theory explains the effects of contaminants in trophic levels, it is inadequate for gaseous pollutants such as methane. This study aims to bridge the gap by developing a methane-population-detritus model to investigate ecological impacts in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Our findings show that low methane concentrations can enhance species growth, while moderate accumulation may induce sub-lethal effects over time. Elevated methane levels, however, lead to ecosystem collapse. Furthermore, prolonged exposure to the gas increases the sensitivity of species towards rising temperatures. Multiscale analysis reveals that rapid methane accumulation leads to long transients near the extinction states. We argue that high emission rates can push the system towards a critical threshold, where the ecosystem shifts to an alternative stable state characterized by elevated methane concentrations. This work highlights the urgent need for a better understanding of the fatal role of methane in ecosystems for developing strategies to mitigate its effects amid climate change.</description>

      <title>An individual-based stochastic model reveals strong constraints on allometric relationships with minimal metabolic and ecological assumptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We design a stochastic individual-based model structured in energy, for single species consuming an external resource, where populations are characterized by a typical energy at birth in $\mathbb{R}^{*}_{+}$. The resource is maintained at a fixed amount, so we benefit from a branching property at the population level. Thus, we focus on individual trajectories, constructed as Piecewise Deterministic Markov Processes, with random jumps modelling births and deaths in the population; and a continuous and deterministic evolution of energy between jumps. We are mainly interested in the case where metabolic (i.e. energy loss for maintenance), growth, birth and death rates depend on the individual energy over time, and follow allometric scalings (i.e. power laws). Our goal is to determine in a bottom-up approach what are the possible allometric coefficients (i.e. exponents of these power laws) under elementary -- and ecologically relevant -- constraints, for our model to be valid for the whole spectrum of possible body sizes. We show in particular that assuming an allometric coefficient $\alpha$ related to metabolism strongly constrains the range of possible values for the allometric coefficients $\beta$, $\delta$, $\gamma$, respectively related to birth, death and growth rates. We further identify and discuss the precise and minimal ecological mechanisms that are involved in these strong constraints on allometric scalings.</description>

      <title>Earth, a planetary PCR machine to create life, or the brief history of a tRNA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: About 4 billion years ago, the Earth probably fulfilled the environmental conditions necessary to favour the transition from primitive chemistry to life. Based on a theoretical hairpin duplication origin of tRNAs and their putative peptide-coding capability before ribosomes existed, here I postulate that, at this hypothetical environment, Earth's daily temperature cycles could have provided a unique planetary thermocycler to create self-replicating RNA hairpins that simultaneously templated amino acids polymerization in a primordial PCR well of prebiotic molecules. This early RNA hairpin-peptide interaction could have established a reciprocal nucleopeptide replicator that paved the way for catalytic translation and replication machineries towards the origin of LUCA.</description>

      <title>Impact of spatial structure on early and long-term adaptation in rugged fitness landscapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the exploration of rugged fitness landscapes by spatially structured populations with demes on the nodes of a graph, connected by migrations. In the rare migration regime, we find that finite structures can adapt more efficiently than very large ones, especially in high-dimensional fitness landscapes. Furthermore, we show that, in most landscapes, migration asymmetries associated with some suppression of natural selection allow the population to reach higher fitness peaks first. In this sense, suppression of selection can make early adaptation more efficient. However, the time it takes to reach the first fitness peak is then increased. We also find that suppression of selection tends to enhance finite-size effects. We extend our study to frequent migrations, suggesting that our conclusions hold in this regime. We then investigate the impact of spatial structure with rare migrations on long-term evolution by studying the steady state of the population. For this, we define an effective population size for the steady-state distribution. We find that suppression of selection is associated to reduced steady-state effective population sizes, and reduced average steady-state fitnesses.</description>

      <title>Reducing Size Bias in Sampling for Infectious Disease Spread on Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Epidemiological models can aid policymakers in reducing disease spread by predicting outcomes based on disease dynamics and contact network characteristics. Calibrating these models requires representative network samples. In this connection, we investigate two sampling algorithms, Random Walk (RW), and Metropolis-Hastings Random Walk (MHRW), across three network types: Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi (ER), Small-world (SW), and Scale-free (SF). Disease transmission is simulated using a susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) framework. Our findings show that RW overestimates infected individuals and secondary infections by $25\%$ for ER and SW networks due to size bias, favouring highly connected nodes. MHRW, which corrects for size bias, provides estimates that are more consistent with the underlying network. Also, both methods yield estimates significantly closer to the underlying network for time-to-infection. However, sampling SF networks exhibits significant variability, for both algorithms. Removing duplicate sampled nodes reduces MHRW's accuracy across all network types. We apply both algorithms to a cattle movement network of $46,512$ farms, exhibiting ER, SW, and SF network features. RW overestimates infected farms by approximately $100\%$ and secondary infections by $&gt;900\%$, reflecting size bias whereas MHRW estimates align closely with the cattle network dynamics. Time-to-infection estimates reveal that RW underestimates by approximately $40\%$, while MHRW slightly overestimates by $10\%$. Estimates differ greatly when duplicate nodes are removed. These findings underscore choosing algorithms based on network structure and disease severity. RW's conservative estimates suit high-mortality, fast-spreading diseases, while MHRW provides precise interventions suitable for less severe outbreaks. These insights can guide policymakers in optimizing resource allocation and disease control strategies.</description>
