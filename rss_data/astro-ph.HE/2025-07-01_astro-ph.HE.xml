      <title>Exploring the parameter space of hierarchical triple black hole systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive exploration of hierarchical triple black hole (BH) systems to address the "initial separation" problem in gravitational wave astrophysics. This problem arises because isolated BH binaries must have extremely small initial separations to merge within a Hubble time via gravitational wave (GW) emission alone, separations at which their stellar progenitors would have merged prematurely. Using a modified JADE secular code incorporating GW energy loss, we systematically investigate a seven-dimensional parameter space: masses of three BHs (5-100 $M_\odot$ inner binary, 1-200 $M_\odot$ tertiary), inner/outer semimajor axes (1-200 AU and 100-10,000 AU), outer orbit eccentricity (0-0.9), and mutual inclination (40{\deg}-80{\deg}). We employed an adaptive MCMC approach sampling the merger/nonmerger transition boundary across nearly 15 million simulations. Results reveal merger-conducive regions correspond to asymmetric inner binary masses, large inner separations where von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (ZLK) mechanism operates effectively without relativistic precession suppression, small outer separations providing stronger perturbations, and large outer eccentricities bringing the tertiary closer at pericenter. Merger probability correlates positively with mutual inclination. We developed a classification scheme for nonmerging systems based on GW emission and ZLK oscillations. A trained neural network predicts merger outcomes with 99% ROC score and 95% accuracy (99.7% for high-confidence predictions), enabling rapid population synthesis. Validation against N-body integrations showed 87% qualitative agreement, confirming our methodology captures essential triple BH dynamics while enabling unprecedented-scale exploration of configurations resolving the initial separation problem.</description>

      <title>Multimessenger Emission from Very-High-Energy Black Hole-Jet Systems in the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microquasars, compact binary systems with an accreting stellar-mass black hole or neutron star, are promising candidates for high-energy particle acceleration. Recently, the LHAASO collaboration reported on the detection of $&gt;100$ TeV $\gamma$-ray emission from five microquasars, suggesting that these sources are efficient particle accelerators. In microquasars, high-energy $\gamma$-rays can be produced in large-scale jets or winds. In this work, we explore the X-ray, $\gamma$-ray and neutrino emission from SS 433, V4641 Sgr and GRS 1905+105. We consider leptonic and hadronic scenarios to explain the spectra observed by LHAASO and other high-energy $\gamma$-ray detectors. We estimate the neutrino flux associated with the hadronic component and investigate the detectability of neutrinos from these sources in current and future neutrino telescopes. We find that among the three sources, V4641 Sgr has the best prospects of observation with a combined next-generation neutrino telescopes.</description>

      <title>Ultrahigh Energy Cosmic Ray Production in Binary Neutron Star Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We predict the spectrum and composition of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays (UCRs for short) generated in a binary neutron star merger, exploiting the highly constrained initial conditions to make quantitative predictions for the cutoff energy for various nuclei. The key mechanism producing UCRs heavier than helium is acceleration in the magnetized turbulent outflow outside the jets. We find the rigidity cutoff of this component is $\mathcal{R}_{\rm cut} \equiv E_{\rm cut}/eZ \approx 6-9$ EV, consistent with the measured value $\mathcal{R}_{\rm cut} = 6.8^{+5.8}_{-2.8}\,$EV from fitting data. This agreement strengthens the case that BNS mergers are the main site of UCR production.
  The jets may also be capable of accelerating particles to ultrahigh energy: these UCRs would be protons and/or helium, in a ratio that depends on the neutron star equation of state. We estimate the cutoff energies of such a component to be $E_{\rm cut}\approx\! 10\,$EeV for p and $\approx\! 30\,$EeV for He. Such a jet component may explain the hint of a secondary light population at higher energy found in the analysis of Muzio et al. (2019). With more precise data, the locus of production of helium and intermediate mass nuclei can be inferred from their rigidity structure, and the predicted small deviations from a pure Peters Cycle can be checked. Predicting the relative abundances of different elements and the total energy in UCRs per merger event is feasible, but beyond the scope of this paper.
  This scenario predicts that each neutrino above 1 PEV is co-directional with a gravitational wave arriving ~1 day earlier, and that the highest energy UCRs have masses heavier than iron.</description>

      <title>Kilonova constraints for the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA neutron star merger candidate S250206dm: GW-MMADS observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) neutron star mergers with an associated electromagnetic counterpart constitute powerful probes of binary evolution, the production sites of heavy elements, general relativity, and the expansion of the universe. Only a handful of candidate GW binary mergers during the fourth LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA observing run (O4) so far are believed to include a neutron star. We present optical-near infrared follow-up observations of the candidate neutron-star black hole GW merger S250206dm. This is the first high-significance mass gap neutron star-black hole candidate observed by multiple GW detectors (thus having a significantly smaller sky localization than one-detector events), offering the first opportunity to effectively follow up a GW event of this kind. Our GW MultiMessenger Astronomy DECam Survey (GW-MMADS) campaign consisted of a wide-field search using the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) and T80-South (T80S), as well as galaxy-targeted observations using the Southern Astrophysical Research (SOAR) imager and the Wendelstein 2.1m 3-channel camera. No viable kilonova counterpart was found in our observations. We use our observation depths to place competitive constraints on kilonova models similar to or brighter than the GW170817 kilonova AT 2017gfo within our observed fields, ruling out 100\% of such models with SOAR galaxy-targeted observations and $\sim43$\% (48\%) with DECam (DECam and T80S).</description>

      <title>First results from the UTMOST-NS pulsar timing programme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The UTMOST-NS pulsar timing programme operated at the Molonglo Observatory Synthesis Telescope from April 2021 to June 2023, observing 173 pulsars with an average cadence of 50 pulsars per day. An overview of the programme is presented, detailing the hardware, software, and observing strategy. Pulsar timing results are discussed, focusing on timing noise and glitches. It is shown that the scaling of residuals due to timing noise with pulsar parameters and observing timespan is consistent with earlier studies, and that the recovered timing noise parameters remain consistent as the observing timespan is increased. Second frequency derivatives are investigated, and it is shown that the uncertainty on $\ddot{\nu}$ is sensitive to the frequency cutoff in the timing noise model, varying by three-fold approximately depending on whether Fourier modes with frequency lower than the reciprocal of the observing timespan are included. We measure 39 non-zero values of $\ddot{\nu}$ when considering both models with and without low-frequency modes. An analytic scaling relating anomalous braking indices to timing noise amplitude is also validated. Glitches in the sample are discussed, including three detected by an ``online'' glitch detection pipeline using a hidden Markov model (HMM). In total 17 glitches are discussed, one of which, in PSR J1902+0615, has not been reported elsewhere. An ``offline'' glitch search pipeline using the HMM framework is used to search for previously undetected glitches. Systematic upper limits are set on the size of undetected glitches. The mean upper limit is $\Delta\nu^{90\%}/\nu = 6.3 \times 10^{-9}$ at 90\% confidence.</description>

      <title>The diffuse supernova neutrino background: a modern approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new, state-of-the-art computation of the Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background (DSNB), where we use neutrino spectra from multi-dimensional, multi-second core collapse supernova simulations - including both neutron-star and black-hole forming collapses - and binary evolution effects from modern population synthesis codes. Large sets of numerical results are processed and connected in a consistent manner, using two key quantities: the mass of the star's Carbon-Oxygen (CO) core at an advanced pre-collapse stage - which depends on binary evolution effects - and the compactness parameter, which is the main descriptor of the post-collapse neutrino emission. The method enables us to model the neutrino emission of a very diverse, binary-affected population of stars, which cannot unambiguously be mapped in detail by existing core collapse simulations. We find that including black hole-forming collapses enhances the DSNB by up to 50% at energies greater than 30-40 MeV. Binary evolution effects can change the total rate of collapses and generate a sub-population of high core mass stars that are stronger neutrino emitters. However, the net effect on the DSNB is moderate - up to a 15% increase in flux - due to the rarity of these super-massive cores and to the relatively modest dependence of the neutrino emission on the CO core mass. The methodology presented here is suitable for extensions and generalizations, and therefore it lays the foundation for modern treatments of the DSNB.</description>

      <title>Timing results of 22 years for PSR J0922+0638</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conducted a timing analysis of PSR J0922+0638 (B0919+06) using data from the Nanshan 26 m radio telescope and the MeerKAT telescope, spanning from January 2001 to March 2023. During this 22-year period, we discovered a previously unreported small glitch (glitch 1) before the well-known large glitch (glitch 2), occurring at ${\rm MJD} \sim 53325(3)$, with a frequency jump amplitude of $\Delta \nu/\nu \sim 0.79(6) \times 10^{-9}$. We also identified ten slow glitch events, half of which were newly detected. These slow glitches occurred quasi-periodically, with an average interval of approximately 553(21) days, fractional frequency changes ranging from $\Delta \nu/\nu \sim 1.13(1) \times 10^{-9}$ to $4.08(5) \times 10^{-9}$, and a maximum fractional change in the first derivative of the frequency of $\Delta \dot{\nu}/\dot{\nu} \sim -4.6 \times 10^{-3}$. Additionally, our timing noise analysis reveals a change in the spectral index for noise power before and after glitch 2, with values of $-6.0$ and $-5.3$, respectively, likely due to this large glitch. Throughout the entire observation period, the first derivative of the spin frequency ($\dot{\nu}$) showed a periodic structure. The possible modulation period was estimated to be 537(24) days before the 700-day data gap at MJD 56716 and 600(58) days afterward. We discuss the periodic oscillations in pulsar rotation as a possible manifestation of spin-down noise and quasi-periodic slow glitches.</description>

      <title>Bayesian constraints on quark and neutron stars from multi-messenger observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We constrain the quark matter equation of state (EOS) with color superconductivity (2SC, 2SC+s, CFL phases) and QCD corrections using Bayesian inference informed by multi-messenger observations from the NICER pulsars, HESS J1731-347 and GW170817. Our results reveal that the bag constant $B$ = 47$\text{--}$55 MeV/fm$^{3}$ are tightly constrained, the QCD correction strength $a_4$ is phase-dependent ($a_4 \approx$ 0.9 for 2SC, $\sim$0.6 for 2SC+s). A large surface tension is required for 2SC phase ($\sigma \gtrsim 95$ MeV/fm$^2$) according to the stability constraints of ${^{266}\mathrm{Hs}}$. The mass-radius relations support quark stars as explanations for HESS J1731-347. The squared speed of sound converges to $c^2/3$, ruling out extreme stiffening. The inferred maximum quark star mass $M_{\mathrm{max}}&lt; 2.28M_\odot$ (90\% confidence level) rules out the secondary component of GW190814 (2.59$\pm$0.08$M_\odot$) as a quark star. In particular, the quark stars (2SC phase) is strongly favored when including HESS J1731-347 data with the bayes factor $B_{\text{2SC, NS}}$ = 10.6, but neutron stars are moderately preferred with $B_{\text{NS, 2SC}}$ = 3.22 if HESS J1731-347 data is excluded. This demonstrates low-mass compact objects critically discriminate between quark matter phases and between quark and neutron-star models.</description>

      <title>Probing Binary Neutron Star Merger Ejecta and Remnants with Gravitational Wave and Radio Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study aimed at quantifying the detectability of radio counterparts of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers with total masses $\lesssim 3$\,M$_{\odot}$, which may form neutron star (NS) remnants. We focus on mergers localized by gravitational-wave (GW) observations to sky areas $\lesssim 10$\,deg$^2$, a precision that greatly facilitates optical counterpart identification and enables radio discovery even without detections at other wavelengths. Widely separated GW detectors are essential for building samples of well-localized BNS mergers accessible to US-based radio telescopes, with minimum yearly detection rates (assuming the smallest values of the BNS local merger rate) ranging from a few with current GW detectors to hundreds with next-generation GW instruments. Current GW networks limit well-localized detections to $z\lesssim 0.2$, while next-generation GW detectors extend the reach to $z\lesssim 0.8$, encompassing the median redshift of short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). With next-generation radio arrays operating at a several tens of GHz and providing an order of magnitude improvement in sensitivity compared to the most sensitive ones available today, short GRB-like jet afterglows can be detected for a large fraction of the considered BNS mergers. At lower radio frequencies, detections with current radio interferometric arrays are feasible, though subject to synchrotron self-absorption effects. The enhanced sensitivity and survey speed of future radio interferometers operating at a few GHz, combined with the higher detection rate of well-localized BNSs enabled by next-generation GW observatories, are key to probing disk-wind and dynamical ejecta afterglows, as well as remnant diversity.</description>

      <title>The effectively optically thin accretion flow and its implication in supermassive black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on a unified description of various accretion flows, we find a long-ignored solution - the effectively optically thin accretion flow, occurring at accretion rates around Eddington value. As a consequence of radiation-pressure dominance, the density in a standard thin disc (SSD) decreases with the increase of accretion rates, making the innermost region effectively optically thin. Further increase in accretion rate leads to a rise of the temperature so that the Compton cooling is able to balance the accretion released energy. We demonstrate that the effectively optically thin flow is characterized by moderate temperature and large scattering optical depth, producing a multi-color Wien spectrum. For an appropriate accretion rate, the accretion flow transforms from an outer SSD to an inner effectively optically thin flow. Thus, the spectra of the whole accretion flow exhibit two components, i.e., a multi-color Wien spectrum at higher frequency and a multi-color blackbody, the former could provide an alternative origin of soft X-ray excess or formation of warm corona in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Our stability analysis proves it is thermally stable and viscously unstable, indicating its existence in accreting systems. We show that effectively optically thin accretion flow exists in supermassive black holes for accretion rates around 0.1 to 10 times Eddington value, bridging the SSD at low accretion rates and slim disc at high rates. By comparing the predictions and average spectra of AGN, we constrain the viscosity parameter to be $\alpha \sim 0.03$, in good agreement with that derived from observed variability.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Statistical Study of Gamma-Ray Bursts and Supernovae Association</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The association between long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) and core-collapse supernovae (SNe) has been well established since the discovery of SN 1998bw, which was linked to the low-luminosity LGRB 980425. However, long-term monitoring of several well-localized, low-redshift LGRBs has yielded compelling evidence for the absence of accompanying supernovae. Notably, two long bursts, GRB 211211A and GRB 230307A, show signatures consistent with kilonova emission from compact binary mergers, indicating that at least some long events may originate from progenitors other than core-collapse supernovae. In this study, we conduct a comparative analysis of two samples of LGRBs, i.e., LGRBs with and without supernova associations, to investigate the differences that may reveal intrinsic distinctions in their progenitors. A detailed examination of their prompt emission properties, host galaxy environments, and event rates is performed. While the two samples exhibit considerable overlap in most observed properties, a significant discrepancy in their event rate is revealed. LGRBs without supernova association have an event rate that aligns well with the star formation rate, whereas that of SN-associated LGRBs differs significantly. It indicates that LGRBs without a supernova association may constitute a distinct subclass with intrinsically different progenitors.</description>

      <title>Braking index of the frequently glitching PSR J0537$-$6910</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PSR J0537$-$6910 is the most frequently glitching pulsar, exhibiting large glitches at a rate of roughly thrice per year. It displays a negative long-term effective braking index $n' = -1.234(9)$ and roughly constant positive frequency second derivatives extending all the way from one glitch to the next. We use the published RXTE and NICER timing data (i) to explore whether `persistent shifts' (non-relaxing parts of the glitch $\Delta\dot{\nu}$ in the spin-down rate, like those observed in the Crab pulsar) can explain the negative effective braking index; (ii) to ascribe part of the inter-glitch relaxation at constant frequency second derivative $\ddot{\nu}$ to internal torques due to the coupling between the observed surface and the interior of the neutron star like deduced for the Vela pulsar; (iii) to demonstrate, as a proof of concept, that after taking account of the persistent shifts and internal torques, the true braking index $n$ associated with the pulsar braking torque is $n\sim 3 $, and (iv) to explore various empirical or model dependent correlations between glitch parameters and the time to the next glitch. The average persistent shift derived for PSR J0537$-$6910 is in agreement with the persistent shift values for the Crab pulsar. By applying the crustquake model, we infer a broken plate size of $D=80$ m, similar to the value obtained for the minimum glitch size observed in the Crab pulsar. The inter-glitch $\ddot{\nu}$ values inferred for the internal torques are commensurate with those in the Vela pulsar. Delineating the effects of persistent shifts and inter-glitch relaxation due to internal torques as observed in the Crab, Vela and other pulsars, we obtained a true braking index value $n=2.75(47)$ for PSR J0537$-$6910, similar to braking indices observed from other young pulsars. PSR J0537$-$6910 is not a likely source of gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>XRISM View of the Newly Detected Galactic Source MAXI J1744-294</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transient Galactic source MAXI J1744-294 went into an outburst in 2025 for the very first time. We study the spectral properties of this source during this outburst using archival data from the XRISM satellite for both of its Resolve and Xtend instruments. We have analyzed the source during one epoch, on March 03, 2025, or MJD 60737, on which XRISM data were available. Using both phenomenological and physical model fitting approaches for continuum emissions, along with line emission and interstellar absorption models, we analyzed the spectral data in the broad 2-10 keV energy band. From our spectral analysis, we have found the existence of multiple iron lines, which are different components of the Fe XXV emission. These line complexes arise from two highly ionized plasmas with ionization rate ~ 10000 erg cm/s with distinct turbulent velocities: one broad (vturb ~ 2513 km/s) from hot gas at the inner accretion disk, and one narrow (vturb ~ 153 km/s ) scattered by nearby photoionized gas. The source is a moderately spinning black hole with a spin of 0.63-0.70, a mass of 5.7-10.1 Solar masses, and a disk inclination angle of 19-24 degrees. The spectral model fitted parameters suggest that the source is in the soft spectral state. The source is situated in a crowded field near the Galactic center, resulting in a very high hydrogen column density.</description>

      <title>On the origin of short-lived cocoon in 3C84: powered by tidal disruption events ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We evaluated the jet power and the density of ambient matter in 3C 84 by using the momentum balance along the jet axis and the transonic condition for the cocoons observed at two different scales (approximately 1 and 6 parsec scales). For the inner cocoon, we precisely determined the ratio of jet power to ambient density $L_{\rm j}/n_{\rm a}$ to be $(0.3-0.7)\times 10^{43}\,{\rm erg}\,{\rm s}^{-1}\,{\rm cm}^3$. Similarly, for the outer cocoon, we found that this value is more than an order of magnitude larger at $(0.9-3.7)\times 10^{44}\,{\rm erg}\,{\rm s}^{-1}\,{\rm cm}^3$. This indicates that the outer cocoon is formed by a powerful jet that propagates through an ambient density of $20-300\,{\rm cm}^{-3}$ with a jet power of $10^{45-46.5}\,{\rm erg}\,{\rm s}^{-1}$. On the other hand, the inner cocoon is formed by a weaker jet with a power of $10^{43-44}\,{\rm erg}\,{\rm s}^{-1}$, propagating through a relatively low-density environment of $6-20\, {\rm cm}^{-3}$. These results suggest that: 1) with respect to the difference in $n_{\rm a}$, it appears to support the hypothesis that the inner cocoon, recently formed about 10 years ago, is expanding in the low-density cocoon created by the jet emitted about 25-50 years ago. 2) to achieve the short-lived and high $L_{\rm j}$ that generated the outer cocoon, a large mass accretion rate must be required over a short period to activate the jet. These may imply the extreme accretion event driven by the tidal disruption events (TDEs) of massive stars and/or the disk instability.</description>

      <title>Ultra High Energy Neutrino Event KM3-230213A as a Signal of Electroweak Vacuum Turbulence in Merging Black Hole Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent detection of the ultra-high-energy neutrino event KM3-230213A ($\sim$220 PeV) by KM3NeT telescope poses a challenge to conventional astrophysical models, particularly in light of the absence of similar $\gtrsim$100 PeV events in IceCube data, despite its larger exposure. We propose a novel mechanism in which binary black hole mergers act as transient neutrino sources via gravitationally induced electroweak vacuum instability. In this scenario, the extreme spacetime curvature near the horizons during the final inspiral phase destabilizes the Higgs vacuum, triggering nucleation of true-vacuum bubbles. Collisions between these bubbles produce microscopic black holes that rapidly evaporate via Hawking radiation, emitting intense, short-lived bursts of neutrinos with energies exceeding 100 PeV. The resulting neutrino fluence follows a heavy-tailed distribution, allowing rare but highly luminous sources to account for events like KM3-230213A while remaining consistent with IceCube's non-detections. This framework links gravitational wave sources to ultra-high-energy neutrino production and suggests that future multi-messenger observations may detect electromagnetic signatures from microscopic black hole evaporation.</description>

      <title>An investigation into correlations between FRB and host galaxy properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Impulsive radio signals such as fast radio bursts (FRBs) are imprinted with the signatures of multi-path propagation through ionised media in the form of frequency-dependent temporal broadening of the pulse profile (scattering). The dominant source of scattering for most FRBs is expected to be within their host galaxies, an assumption which can be tested by examining potential correlations between properties of the FRBs and global properties of their hosts. Using results from the CRAFT survey, we investigate correlations across a range of host galaxy properties against attributes of the FRB that encode propagation effects: scattering timescale tau, polarisation fractions, and absolute Faraday rotation measure. From 21 host galaxy properties considered, we find three correlated with tau, including the stellar surface density (or compactness; Pearson p-value p = 0.002 and Spearman p = 0.010), mass-weighted age (Spearman p-value p = 0.009), and a weaker correlation with gas-phase metallicity (Spearman p = 0.017). Weakly significant correlations are also found with Halpha equivalent widths and gravitational potential. From 10,000 trials of reshuffled datasets, we expect 2 strong Spearman correlations only 2% of the time, and three weaker correlations in 6.6% of cases. Compact host galaxies may have more ionised content which scatters the FRB further. No correlation is seen with host galaxy inclination, which weakens the case for an inclination bias, as previously suggested for samples of localised FRBs. A strong (p = 0.002) correlation is found for absolute rotation measure with optical disc axis ratio b/a; greater rotation measures are seen for edge-on host galaxies. Further high-time resolution FRB detections, coupled with localisation and detailed follow-up on their host galaxies, are necessary to corroborate these initial findings and shed further light into the FRB mechanism.</description>

      <title>Probing the detectability of electromagnetic signatures from Galactic isolated black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23427v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: A large number of isolated black holes (IBHs) are expected to populate the Galaxy. However, only one has been confirmed by the analysis of a microlensing event, and no confirmed emission detection from an IBH has been reported so far.
  Aims: We analysed the detectability of electromagnetic signatures from IBHs moving in the Galaxy. Methods: We considered accretion from the interstellar medium onto an IBH and assumed the formation of an outflow. We modelled the accretion process and the interaction of the outflow with the surrounding medium on large scales, including mechanical feedback on the accretion process. Furthermore, we also calculated the emission from three different regions: the accretion region, the radiation from the outflow medium interaction structure, and the emission of relativistic particles that diffuse in the surrounding medium.
  Results: Multiwavelength emission associated with Galactic IBHs can be detected in systems moving through a very dense medium. Thermal emission from accretion could be observed in the mid infrared and in hard X rays with current and forthcoming observatories. Thermal and non thermal emission from the outflow medium shock could also be detected in the radio and millimetre ranges. Moreover, detection of the emission from particles diffusing in a dense medium could be feasible in gamma rays. Applying our model to the IBH associated with the gravitational microlensing event MOA2011BLG191 OGLE2011BLG0462, we inferred that radio and infrared detection of the IBH is plausible. Also, we derived that IBHs could be modest Galactic cosmic ray contributors, potentially reaching a 1% contribution at 1 PeV. Finally, by extending our model to primordial black holes, we conclude that efficient leptonic acceleration in their outflow medium interactions would rule them out as a major dark matter component.</description>

      <title>Search for Higher Harmonic Signals from Close White Dwarf Binaries in the mHz Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Space-based gravitational wave (GW) detectors, such as LISA, are expected to detect thousands of Galactic close white dwarf binaries emitting nearly monochromatic GWs. In this study, we demonstrate that LISA is reasonably likely to detect higher harmonic GW signals, particularly the $(l, |m|) = (3, 3)$ mode, from a limited sample of nearby close white dwarf binaries, even with small orbital velocities $v/c$ of order $10^{-3}$. The amplitudes of these post-Newtonian modes provide robust probes of mass asymmetry in such systems, making them valuable observational targets, especially in mass-transferring binaries. Long-term, coordinated detector operations will further improve the prospects for detecting these informative signals.</description>

      <title>Acceleration and Transport of the Unstable Cosmic-ray Isotope $^{60}$Fe in Supernova-Enriched Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unstable isotope $^{60}$Fe, with a half-life of 2.6 million years, is produced primarily in supernova explosions. The observed presence of $^{60}$Fe in cosmic rays and its detection in deep-sea crusts and sediments suggest two possible scenarios: either the direct acceleration of $^{60}$Fe from supernova ejecta or its enrichment in the circumstellar material surrounding supernova progenitors, which indicates cosmic ray production in clusters of supernovae. Focusing on the latter scenario, we consider an environment shaped by successive supernova explosions, reminiscent of the Local Bubble around the time of the most recent supernova explosion. We independently tracked the evolution of the $^{60}$Fe mass ratio within the Local Bubble using passive scalars. To investigate the spectra of protons and $^{60}$Fe, we explicitly modelled cosmic-ray acceleration and transport at the remnant of the last supernova by simultaneously solving the hydrodynamical equations for the supernova outflow and the transport equations for cosmic rays, scattering turbulence, and large-scale magnetic field, using the time-dependent acceleration code RATPaC. The main uncertainty in our prediction of the local $^{60}$Fe flux at about $pc=1$ GeV/nuc is the magnetic-field structure in the Local Bubble and the cosmic-ray diffusion beyond the approximately $100$ kyr of evolution covered by our study. We found that if the standard galactic propagation applies, the local $^{60}$Fe flux would be around 3% of that measured. If there is a sustained reduction in the diffusion coefficient at and near the Local Bubble, then the expected $^{60}$Fe flux could be up to 30% of that measured.</description>

      <title>Multi-Model Framework for Reconstructing Gamma-Ray Burst Light Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mitigating data gaps in Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) light curves (LCs) holds immense value for its application in cosmological research because it provides more precise measurements of the parameter of interest of the two-dimensional Dainotti relation which is a relation among the end time of the plateau emission, Ta, its respective luminosity, La which is calculated from the fluxes at the end of the plateau, Fa. This study extends the work done by arXiv:2305.12126; arXiv:2412.20091v4 on the 545 GRB sample by introducing six different models: Deep Gaussian Process (DGP), Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN), Hybrid model of Convolutional Neural Network with Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM), Bayesian Neural Network (BNN), Polynomial Curve Fitting and Isotonic Regression. Our findings demonstrate that Isotonic Regression achieves the highest uncertainty reduction for all three parameters (36.3% for log Ta, 36.1% for log Fa, and 43.6% for {\alpha}) outperforming all the other models. The CNN- LSTM model shows consistent improvements across all GRB parameters with the lowest outlier rate for {\alpha} (0.550%), surpassing the performance of the LSTM model in arXiv:2412.20091v4. The DGP model offers reliable uncertainty reduction across all parameters and improves upon the single-layer GP baseline. These advancements are essential for using GRBs as theoretical model discriminators via the parameters of their LCs and standard candles in cosmology, investigating theoretical models, and predicting GRB redshifts through recent cutting-edge machine-learning analysis (arXiv:2411.10736,arXiv:2405.02263; arXiv:2410.13985).</description>

      <title>Studying the multi-phase interstellar medium in the Large Magellanic Cloud with SRG/eROSITA -- I. Analysis of diffuse X-ray emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), being a nearby and actively star-forming satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, is an ideal site to observe the multi-phase interstellar medium (ISM) of a galaxy across the electromagnetic spectrum. We aim to exploit the available SRG/eROSITA all-sky survey data to study the distribution, composition and properties of the diffuse X-ray emitting hot gas in the LMC. We construct multi-band X-ray images of the LMC, reflecting the morphology and temperatures of the diffuse hot gas. By performing spatially resolved X-ray spectroscopy of 175 regions, we constrain the distribution, physical state, and composition of the hot ISM phase throughout the LMC. We combine our constraints with multiwavelength data to obtain a comprehensive view of the different ISM phases.
  We measure a total X-ray luminosity of the hot ISM phase of $1.9\times10^{38}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$ ($0.2-5.0\,\mathrm{keV}$ band), and constrain its thermal energy to around $5\times10^{54}\,\mathrm{erg}$. The typical density and temperature of the X-ray emitting plasma are around $5\times10^{-3}\,\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ and $0.25\,\mathrm{keV}$, respectively, with both exhibiting broad peaks in the southeast of the LMC. The observed degree of X-ray absorption correlates strongly with the distribution of foreground HI gas, whereas a spatial anticorrelation between the hot and cold ISM phases is visible on sub-kpc scales within the disk. The abundances of light metals show a strong gradient throughout the LMC, with the north and east exhibiting a strong $\alpha$-enhancement, as expected from observed massive stellar populations there. In contrast, the enigmatic ``X-ray spur'' exhibits a local deficit in $\alpha$-elements, and a peak in hot-gas pressure at $P/k\sim10^5\,\mathrm{K\,cm^{-3}}$, consistent with a dominant energy input through tidally driven gas collisions.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Origin of FRB 20121102A's Persistent Radio Source with Long-Term Radio Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The persistent radio source (PRS) associated with FRB 20121102A, the first precisely localized repeating fast radio burst (FRB), provides key constraints on both its local environment and the nature of the underlying FRB engine. We present a seven-year (2016-2023) temporal analysis of the PRS, combining new uGMRT observations with archival data across L-band frequencies. We find no statistically significant long-term trend in its L-band flux density. The observed variability is consistent with refractive interstellar scintillation, and the data do not require the PRS to be a source exhibiting strong intrinsic variability. This stability challenges models predicting rapid fading from evolving magnetized outflows, such as those powered by young magnetars or relativistic shocks. Our low-frequency observations show no evidence for spectral evolution between 1.4 GHz and 745 MHz, with a measured spectral index of $\alpha = -0.15 \pm 0.08$, in agreement with values reported from earlier observations in 2016-2017. The PRS remains compact, exhibits a flat radio spectrum, and-if powered by an intermediate-mass black hole accreting at a low Eddington ratio-its radio and X-ray properties are broadly consistent with the fundamental plane of radio-loud AGNs. While not conclusive, this scenario represents a viable alternative to magnetar wind nebula models and warrants further investigation. Furthermore, we find no statistically significant correlation between FRB burst activity and the luminosity of associated PRSs among repeating sources. This apparent decoupling challenges simple progenitor models that directly link bursts and persistent emission. Together, these results suggest that the FRB engine and PRS may in some systems originate from physically distinct sources, underscoring the need for flexible models to explain the diverse environments of repeating FRBs.</description>

      <title>Modeling blazar broadband emission with convolutional neural networks -- III. proton synchrotron and hybrid models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling the broadband emission of blazars has become increasingly challenging with the advent of multimessenger observations. Building upon previous successes in applying convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to leptonic emission scenarios, we present an efficient CNN-based approach for modeling blazar emission under proton synchrotron and hybrid lepto-hadronic frameworks. Our CNN is trained on extensive numerical simulations generated by SOPRANO, which span a comprehensive parameter space accounting for the injection and all significant cooling processes of electrons and protons. The trained CNN captures complex interactions involving both primary and secondary particles, effectively reproducing electromagnetic and neutrino emissions. This allows for rapid and thorough exploration of the parameter space characteristic of hadronic and hybrid emission scenarios. The effectiveness of the trained CNN is demonstrated through fitting the spectral energy distributions of two prominent blazars, TXS 0506+059 and PKS 0735+178, both associated with IceCube neutrino detections. The modeling is conducted under assumptions of constant neutrino flux across distinct energy ranges, as well as by adopting a fitting that incorporates the expected neutrino event count through a Poisson likelihood method. The trained CNN is integrated into the Markarian Multiwavelength Data Center (MMDC; https://www.mmdc.am), offering a robust tool for the astrophysical community to explore blazar jet physics within a hadronic framework.</description>

      <title>Continuum optical-UV and X-ray variability of AGN: current results and future challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are believed to be powered by accretion of matter onto a supermassive black hole. A fundamental ingredient in shaping our understanding of AGN is their variability across the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Variability studies have the potential to help us understand the geometry of the emitting regions (in various energy bands), their causal relations, and the physics of the accretion processes. This review focuses on the observational properties of AGN variability in the optical/UV/X-ray bands (where most of the AGN luminosity is emitted) and their dependence on the AGN physical parameters (i.e. mass, luminosity, accretion rate). We also discuss possible interpretations in the context of accreting compact systems, and we review the use of variability as a tool to discover AGN and trace their properties across cosmic time, using both ground and space facilities. Finally, we discuss the opportunities and challenges provided by current and next-generation optical/X-ray surveys, to use variability as an effective tool to probe the growth of super massive black holes in the Universe.</description>

      <title>A possible two-fold scenario for the disc-corona of the luminous AGN 1H 0419--577: a high-density disc or a warm corona</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: [abridged] 1H 0419-577 is a highly-accreting, luminous BLS1 AGN. This study aims to characterise its disc-corona system using, for the first time, simultaneous XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observations, performed in May and November 2018. We conducted high-resolution grating spectroscopy to identify potential soft X-ray absorption and emission features. To measure the hot corona temperatures from the spectral analysis above 3 keV, we also included data from a previous NuSTAR observation from June 2015. We characterised the disc-corona system properties by analysing the broadband spectra and the SED from UV to hard X-rays. 1H 0419-577 was observed in a bare-like high-flux state at both epochs, with negligible neutral and ionised absorption along its line of sight at both Galactic and AGN rest-frames. However, several soft X-ray emission lines were detected, notably a broad and intense OVII line indicating an accretion disc origin at only a few tens of gravitational radii. The broadband X-ray spectra revealed a prominent, absorption-free smooth soft X-ray excess, a weak Fe Kalpha complex, and a lack of a Compton hump. Fitting data above 3 keV yielded apparent moderate hot corona temperatures of ~20-30 keV for the 2018 and 2015 observations, depending on the model applied. The 2018 X-ray broadband spectra were well reproduced by either a relativistic reflection model with a high-density accretion disc (~10^18 cm^-2), or a hybrid model combining warm and hot coronae with relativistic reflection. We performed the SED analysis for the latter scenario, which indicated that both the hot and warm coronae would have a small spatial extent. Both scenarios can successfully reproduce the two 2018 observations of 1H 0419-577, but they imply very different physical conditions, for example, in terms of disc density, temperature and accretion power released in the hot corona and the origin of the UV emission.</description>

      <title>Sagittarius A* near-infrared flares polarization as a probe of space-time I: Non-rotating exotic compact objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The center of our galaxy hosts Sagittarius~A*, a supermassive compact object of $\sim 4.3\times 10^6$ solar masses, usually associated with a black hole. Nevertheless, black holes possess a central singularity, considered unphysical, and an event horizon, which leads to loss of unitarity in a quantum description of the system. To address these theoretical inconsistencies, alternative models, collectively known as exotic compact objects, have been proposed. In this paper, we investigate the potential detectability of signatures associated with non-rotating exotic compact objects within the Sgr~A* polarized flares dataset, as observed through GRAVITY and future instruments. We examine a total of eight distinct metrics, originating from four different categories of static and spherically symmetric compact objects: Black Holes, Boson stars, Fluid spheres, and Gravastars. Our approach involves utilizing a toy model that orbits the compact object in the equatorial plane, at the Schwarzschild-Keplerian velocity. Using simulated astrometric and polarimetric data with present GRAVITY and future GRAVITY+ uncertainties, we fit the datasets across all metrics examined. We evaluated the detectability of the metric for each dataset based on the resulting $\chi^2_\mathrm{red}$ and BIC-based Bayes factors. Plunge-through images of ECOs affect polarization and astrometry. With GRAVITY's present uncertainties, only a compact boson-star model is discernible. GRAVITY+'s improved sensitivity allows detection of most exotic compact object models. However, enhancing the astrophysical complexity of the hot spot model diminishes these outcomes. Presently, GRAVITY's uncertainties limit us to detecting just one exotic compact object metric. With GRAVITY+'s enhanced sensitivity, we can expect to uncover additional exotic compact object models and use Sgr~A* as a laboratory for fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>Recurring region for neutron-star observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we report a new phenomena of recurring regions when relating observables for hybrid neutron stars and hybrid neutron-star mergers. To describe dense matter within hybrid stars, we introduce a percolation to vary the size and characteristics of the deconfinement phase transition to quark matter. Before and after the percolation, we keep the hadronic and quark phases the same, described by different realistic models for the equation of state of beta-equilibrated, charge-neutral, zero-temperature matter. When solving spherical and deformed equations for neutron stars in general relativity, we find that: no matter the size or characteristics of the percolation region, or the order of the phase transition on either side (hadronic and quark), as long as we minimize the average sound speed from the beginning of the percolation region to the central density for a given star, we can produce equations of state that cross through the same, small recurring region within mass-radius and mass-tidal deformability diagrams. Our findings provide a new way to produce hybrid equations of state for dense matter that match a given observation of neutron stars or neutron star mergers.</description>

      <title>Bahamas: BAyesian inference with HAmiltonian Montecarlo for Astrophysical Stochastic background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The LISA datastream will be populated by large instrumental and astrophysical noises, both potentially exhibiting long-term non-stationarities. Modelling and inferring on them is a challenging task, central for accurate signal reconstruction. In this paper, we introduce $\texttt{bahamas}$, a codebase designed to characterize noises and stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds (SGWBs) in LISA. $\texttt{bahamas}$ adopts a time-frequency data representation, based on the Short Time Fourier Transform, to accurately describe the signal temporal evolution and accommodate for the presence of data gaps. In addition, $\texttt{bahamas}$ supports a variety of SGWB spectral models proposed in literature, enabling joint inference on them. Posterior sampling leverages No-U-Turn sampling an efficient variant of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, inheriting the cross-hardware capabilities provided by NumPyro (CPU/GPU/TPU). We benchmark $\texttt{bahamas}$ performances on a simple test case, and present ongoing developments to appear in future releases.</description>

      <title>Constraining Cubic Curvature Corrections to General Relativity with Quasi-Periodic Oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate observational constraints on cubic curvature corrections to general relativity by analyzing quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in accreting black hole systems. In particular, we study Kerr black hole solution corrected by cubic curvature terms parameterized by $\beta_5$ and $\beta_6$. While $\beta_6$ corresponds to a field-redefinition invariant structure, the $\beta_5$ term can in principle be removed via a field redefinition. Nonetheless, since we work in the frame where the accreting matter minimally couples to the metric, $\beta_5$ is in general present. Utilizing the corrected metric, we compute the QPO frequencies within the relativistic precession framework. Using observational data from GRO J1655$-$40 and a Bayesian analysis, we constrain the coupling parameters to $|\beta_5| &lt; (27.73\,\mathrm{km})^4$ and $|\beta_6| &lt; (15.34\,\mathrm{km})^4$. These bounds improve upon existing constraints from big-bang nucleosynthesis and the speed of gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Double Compact Binary Merger Rate Density in Open Star Clusters: Black Holes, Neutron Stars, and White Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Studying compact-object binary mergers in star clusters is crucial for understanding stellar evolution and dynamical interactions in galaxies. Open clusters in particular are more abundant over cosmic time than globular clusters, however, previous research on low-mass clusters with $\lesssim 10^3~\textrm{M}_{\odot}$ has focused on binary black holes (BBHs) or black hole-neutron star (BH-NS) binaries. Binary mergers of other compact objects, such as white dwarfs (WDs), are also crucial as progenitors of transient phenomena such as Type Ia supernovae and Fast Radio Bursts. We present simulations of three types of open clusters with masses of $10^2$, $10^3$, and $10^4~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. In massive clusters with $\gtrsim 10^4~\textrm{M}_{\odot}$, BBHs are dynamically formed, however, less massive compact binaries such as WD-WD and WD-NS are perturbed inside the star clusters, causing them to evolve into other objects. We further find BH-NS mergers only in $10^3~\textrm{M}_{\odot}$ clusters. Considering star clusters with a typical open cluster mass, we observe that WD-WD merger rates slightly increase for $10^3~\textrm{M}_{\odot}$ clusters but decrease for $10^2~\textrm{M}_{\odot}$ clusters. Since the host clusters are tidally disrupted, most of them merge outside of the clusters. Our WD-WD merger results have further implications for two classes of transients. Super-Chandrasekhar WD-WD mergers are present in our simulations, demonstrating potential sources of Fast Radio Bursts at a rate of 70-780 Gpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$, higher than the rate estimated for globular clusters. Additionally, we find that Carbon-Oxygen WD-WD mergers in our open clusters (34-640 $\textrm{Gpc}^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$) only account for 0.14-2.6% of the observed Type Ia supernova rate in our local Universe.</description>

      <title>Optical appearance of Schwarzschild black holes with optically thin and thick accretion disks at various inclination angles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we systematically investigate the optical appearance of a Schwarzschild black hole illuminated by three geometrically thin accretion disk models under varying observational inclination angles. Based on the geometric relationship between the black hole and observer, we first divide the accretion disk into co-side and counter-side semi-disks. Subsequently, we analyze their differences in photon orbit distributions, transfer functions, and received intensities. Our results reveal distinct inclination-dependent behaviors between the two semi-disks: when the inclination approaches $\pi/2$, the co-side semi-disk develops richer ring structures with the lensed emission dominating the total brightness. Furthermore, through explicit specification of the emission profiles of the three models, we present optical images for both optically thin and thick disk scenarios at different inclinations. The results demonstrate that: (i) the bright rings in all three models become progressively compressed and deviate from circularity as inclination increases; (ii) for thick disks, partial rings are obscured and the overall intensity is lower than thin disks. These results may advance our understanding of general black hole imaging processes and provide a new approach to test gravitational theories through optical morphology studies.</description>

      <title>ACT DR6 Leads to Stronger Evidence for Dynamical Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark matter is fundamental to the composition, structure, and evolution of the universe. Combining the ACT's cosmic microwave background, DESI's baryon acoustic oscillations with DESY5 type Ia supernova observations, we find a $3.4\,\sigma$ evidence for dynamical dark matter (DDM) with an equation of state, $\omega_{dm}(a)=\omega_{dm0}+\omega_{dma}(1-a)$. Independent of the Planck measurements, the ACT data confirms the linear relation $\omega_{dma}=-\omega_{dm0}$, inducing that the equation of state of dark matter is directly proportional to the scale factor $a$. Furthermore, the effects of DDM on the large-scale structure observables are thoroughly studied. Our findings are of great significance for understanding cosmic acceleration, structure growth, and the fate of the universe.</description>

      <title>From new physics to a running power law and back again: Minimal refitting techniques for the reconstruction of the gravitational-wave background signal in pulsar timing array data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations recently presented evidence for a gravitational-wave background (GWB) signal at nanohertz frequencies. In this paper, we introduce new refitting techniques for PTA data analysis that elevate related techniques in the literature to a more rigorous level and thus provide the basis for fast and accurate Bayesian inference and physically intuitive model comparisons. The key idea behind our approach is to construct maps \Phi from GWB spectral models to a running-power-law (RPL) reference model, such that the pullback \Phi^* P_RPL of the RPL posterior density P_RPL induces a likelihood on the GWB model parameter space; in other words, we refit spectral models to the RPL posterior density. In order to construct \Phi, we introduce a matched-filtering approach in which \Phi follows from a \chi^2 minimization that accounts for the frequency dependence of PTA sensitivity curves. We validate and illustrate our techniques by three concrete examples: GWs from stable cosmic strings, GWs from metastable strings, and scalar-induced GWs.</description>

      <title>Searching for quasinormal modes from Binary Black Hole mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new method to search for gravitational waves from quasinormal modes in the ringdowns of the remnants of the mergers of the binary black hole systems. The method is based on maximum likelihood estimation. We derive a time-domain matched-filtering statistic that can be used to search for any number of modes in the data. The parameters of the modes can be estimated and the modes present in the data can be reconstructed. We perform Monte Carlo simulations of the method by injecting the quasinormal mode waveforms to noise. We analyze performance of the method for searches of quasinormal modes in the advanced detectors data like LIGO and Virgo, in the third generation of detectors like Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer and in the space detector LISA data. We analyze ringdown of publicly available GW190521 event and we compare our results with analysis by other methods.</description>

      <title>A hierarchical Bayesian approach to point source analysis in high-energy neutrino telescopes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach to the detection of point-like sources of high-energy neutrinos. Motivated by evidence for emerging sources in existing data, we focus on the characterization and interpretation of these sources rather than the rejection of the background-only hypothesis. The hierarchical Bayesian model is implemented in the Stan platform, enabling computation of the posterior distribution with a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm. We simulate a population of weak neutrino sources detected by the IceCube experiment and use the resulting data set to demonstrate and validate our framework. We show that even for the challenging case of sources at the threshold of detection and using limited prior information, it is possible to correctly infer the source properties. Additionally, we demonstrate how modeling flexible connections between similar sources can be used to recover the contribution of sources that would not be detectable individually. While a direct comparison of our method to existing approaches is challenged by the fundamental differences in frequentist and Bayesian frameworks, we draw parallels where possible. In particular, we highlight how including more complexity into the source modeling can increase the sensitivity to sources and their populations.</description>

      <title>Two-Component gamma-ray Emission Spectrum and X-Ray Polarization of the Radio Galaxy Pictor A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21277v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pictor A is a $\gamma$-ray emitting radio galaxy and has a bright hotspot called WHS, located $\sim$4 arcmin away from the nucleus. In this work, we present an analysis of its 16-year Fermi-LAT data and report the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) observations for this source. Our analysis of the Fermi-LAT observations reveals evidence of two components in the average $\gamma$-ray spectrum of Pictor A, exhibiting a statistically significant hardening from $\Gamma_{\rm \gamma,1}=3.25\pm0.15$ to $\Gamma_{\rm \gamma,2}=1.81\pm0.07$ at a break energy of $2.46\pm0.09$ GeV. Notably, variability of $\gamma$-rays is evident in Pictor A, predominantly driven by the component below the break energy, while the component above the break energy remains stable. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that a power-law function provides an adequate fit for the high-flux-state spectrum, while a broken power-law function remains necessary to accurately model the low-flux-state spectrum. We suggest that the low-energy component originates from the nucleus, while the high-energy component primarily stems from WHS. The broadband spectral energy distributions of both nucleus and WHS can be well represented by a simple leptonic model, with both $\gamma$-ray components attributed to the synchrotron-self-Compton (SSC) process. Analysis of IXPE data provides upper limits on the polarization degree of $\Pi_{\rm X}&lt;$6.6% for the nucleus and $\Pi_{\rm X}&lt;$56.4% for the WHS within the 2--8 keV band. For the nucleus, this result aligns with X-ray emission originating from the SSC process. However, the upper limit of $\Pi_{\rm X}&lt;$56.4% for WHS is insufficient to conclusively determine the X-ray emission mechanism in this region.</description>

Abstract: More than 60 broad-lined type Ic (Ic-BL) supernovae (SNe) are associated with a long gamma-ray burst (GRB). However, many type Ic-BL SNe exhibit no sign of an associated GRB. On average, the expansion velocities of GRB-associated type Ic-BL SNe (GRB-SNe) are greater than those of type Ic-BL SNe without an associated GRB. This work presents the largest spectroscopic sample of type Ic-BL SNe with and without GRBs to date, consisting of 61 ordinary type Ic-BL SNe and 13 GRB-SNe. The goal of this work is to compare the evolution of SN expansion velocities in cases where an ultra-relativistic jet has been launched (GRB-SNe) and cases where no GRB jet is inferred from observations (ordinary type Ic-BL SNe), to search for possible jet influences. To do this we measured the expansion velocities of the Fe II and Si II features observed in the spectra of type Ic-BL SNe using a spline fitting method and fitted the velocity evolution with single and broken power-laws. In each analysis we compared two populations: ordinary type Ic-BL SNe and GRB-SNe. We find that the expansion velocities of the Fe II and Si II features are similar between these populations, in contrast with previous studies. The Fe II and Si II power-law indices indicate that GRB-SNe decline at similar rates to ordinary type Ic-BL supernovae. Broken power-law evolution appears to be more common for the Si II feature. This observation may hint at a two-component ejecta model, such as a GRB jet or a cocoon. Neither the velocities nor their evolution can be used to distinguish between ordinary type Ic-BL SNe and GRB-SNe. Velocities consistent with broken power-law evolution may indicate the presence of a GRB jet in some of these ordinary type Ic-BL SNe, but this is likely not as robust as late-time radio surveys. These results suggest that GRB-SNe and ordinary type Ic-BL SNe are drawn from the same underlying population of events.</description>

      <title>Exploring the anisotropic gravitational wave background from all-sky mock gravitational wave event catalogues</title>

Abstract: Anisotropic stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) serves as a potential probe of the large-scale structure (LSS) of the universe. In this work, we explore the anisotropic SGWB from local ($z &lt; \sim 0.085$) merging stellar mass compact binaries, specifically focusing on merging stellar binary black holes, merging neutron-star-black-hole binaries, and merging binary neutron stars. The analysis employs seven all-sky mock lightcone gravitational wave event catalogues, which are derived from the Millennium simulation combined with a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation and a binary population synthesis model. We calculate the angular power spectra $\mathrm{C}_\ell$ at multipole moments $\ell$, expressed as $\text{log}_{10} [\ell(\ell+1)\mathrm{C}_\ell/(2\pi)]$, based on the skymaps of the overdensity $\delta_\mathrm{GW}$ in the anisotropic SGWB. The spectra for all three source types exhibit an approximately linear increase with $\text{log}_{10} \ell$ at higher $\ell$ (e.g., $\ell &gt; \sim 30 - 300$) in seven catalogues, with a characteristic slope of $\sim 2$. The spectra of seven catalogues exhibit considerable variations, arising from fluctuations in spatial distribution, primarily in the radial distribution, of nearby sources (e.g., $&lt; 50$ Mpc/h). After subtracting these nearby sources, the variations become much smaller and the spectra for the three source types become closely aligned (within discrepancies of a factor of $\sim 2$ across $\ell = 1 - 1000$ for all catalogues). We also find that including further sources results in a rapid decrease in the anisotropy.</description>

      <title>Revealing the $\chi_{\rm eff}$-$q$ correlation among Coalescing Binary Black Holes and { Tentative} Evidence for AGN-driven Hierarchical Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09495</link>

Abstract: The origin of the correlation between the effective spins ($\chi_{\rm eff}$) and mass ratios ($q$) of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's binary black holes (BBHs) is still an open question. Motivated by the recent identification of two subpopulations of the BBHs, in this work we investigate the potential $\chi_{\rm eff}-q$ correlation for each subpopulation. Surprisingly, the $\chi_{\rm eff}$-$q$ correlation {either significantly weakens or disappears} for the low-mass subpopulation if we introduce a second $\chi_{\rm eff}$ distribution for the high-mass subpopulation, which likely originates from hierarchical mergers. {This suggests that the $\chi_{\rm eff}$-$q$ correlation in the overall population can be explained by the superposition of two distinct subpopulations.} {We find Bayesian evidence strongly favoring two separate $\chi_{\rm eff}$ distributions over a single mass-ratio-dependent distribution, with Bayes factors $\ln\mathcal{B}&gt;4.2$.} The first subpopulation has a narrow $\chi_{\rm eff}$ distribution peaking at $\sim0.05$, whose primary-mass function {showing a rapid decline beyond} $\sim 40M_{\odot}$, in agreement with first-generation BBHs. The second $\chi_{\rm eff}$ distribution is broad and peaks at $\mu_{\chi,2} \sim 0.4$, aligning with predictions for hierarchical mergers in active galactic nucleus (AGN) disks. {However, we cannot exclude negative $\chi_{\rm eff}$values in the second subpopulation, suggesting hierarchical mergers might occur both in AGN disks and stellar clusters. Furthermore, the inferred second $\chi_{\rm eff}$ distribution might alternatively arise from other formation channels, such as stable mass transfer or chemically homogeneous evolution, if not interpreted as hierarchical mergers.}</description>

      <title>Neutrino emission and corona heating induced by high-energy proton interactions in Seyfert galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16273v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent detection of very-high-energy neutrino emission from Seyfert type active galactic nuclei (AGN) provides a new insight into the physics of the AGN central engines. We notice that if high-energy protons responsible for neutrino emission are accelerated close to the surface of the accretion disk, the neutrino flux may have no unambiguously identifiable electromagnetic counterpart. This is because the electromagnetic power released in interactions of high-energy protons would only contribute to the heating of the disk surface and corona above the disk, rather than escape from the source. Given that the heat deposited in the corona is released in the hard X-ray range we notice that there still might be an "indirect" electromagnetic counterpart of the neutrino signal: the hard X-ray flux variability may be strongly or weakly correlated with the neutrino flux variations, depending on the importance of the high-energy proton heating in the disk/corona heat balance. If heating by high-energy protons provides a sizable contribution to the overall corona heating rate, the overall flux of diffuse GeV neutrino background from Seyfert galaxies may be comparable to the X-ray background flux and the high-energy tail of this background can provide a sizable contribution to the astrophysical neutrino flux in the TeV band.</description>

      <title>Revealing the nature of ultra-long period objects with space-based gravitational-wave interferometers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06125v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A few members of the recently-discovered class of ultra-long period objects have been identified as binaries with white-dwarf primaries. In most cases however, electromagnetic data are inconclusive and isolated magnetars or compact binaries remain viable. If the pulsation period matches that of the orbit though -- as is the case for ILT J1101+5521 and GLEAM-X J0704-37 -- some of these elusive radio transients could be gravitational-wave bright in the mHz band. Space-based interferometers could thus be used to provide independent constraints on their nature. We quantify the signal-to-noise ratio for the known systems, under a variety of scenarios, and show that a few could be detectable for sufficiently large chirp masses. Astrophysical implications for (non-)detections are discussed.</description>

      <title>NuSTAR Detection of an Absorption Feature in ESP 39607: Evidence for an Ultra-Fast Inflow?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07963v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the serendipitous discovery of an absorption feature at 4.8 keV in the NuSTAR spectra of ESP 39607, a Seyfert 2 galaxy at $z = 0.201$, observed in May 2023 and August 2024. The feature is detected in both observations with individual significance levels between 2 and 3$\sigma$, computed with multiple statistical methods. The combined probability of detecting it in both observations is $\gtrsim$4$\sigma$. The absorption feature is consistent with an ultra-fast inflow (UFI) potentially associated with Fe XXV or Fe XXVI K$\alpha$ transitions. The inferred inflow velocity is $\sim$0.15-0.20$c$, with an estimated launching radius of 22-89 $R_g$, depending on the assumed iron transition and whether radiation pressure is accounted for. Photoionization modeling associates the UFI primarily with Fe XXV K$\alpha$ absorption, blended with a minor contribution from Fe XXVI K$\alpha$. Alternative explanations, including associations with the warm-hot intergalactic medium or outflows of lighter elements, were investigated but found unlikely. If confirmed, this detection represents a rare example of a UFI, providing valuable evidence into extreme and/or non-standard accretion processes near supermassive black holes. Follow-up observations with higher-resolution X-ray spectroscopy, such as with XMM-Newton or XRISM, will be essential to confirm the nature of this feature and better constrain the physical mechanisms driving it.</description>

      <title>Birthplaces of X-ray emission lines in Cygnus X-3</title>

Abstract: We investigate the formation of X-ray emission lines in the wind of the Wolf-Rayet (WR) companion in Cyg X-3 by analyzing their orbital dynamics using Chandra High Energy Transmission Grating (HEG) observations during a hypersoft state. Our goal is to constrain the X-ray transparency of the recently discovered funnel-like structure surrounding the compact star, as revealed by X-ray polarimetry. All lines exhibit sinusoidal orbital modulation, with the velocity amplitude generally increasing and the orbital phase with the highest blueshift generally decreasing for ions with a higher ionisation potential. The {Fe}{xxvi}-line displays velocity extremes at phase 0.25 (blueshift) and 0.75 (redshift), indicating that the line-emitting region is close to the compact component (disc or corona) and thus reflects the orbital motion. The {Fe}{xxv}-line shows a complex behaviour that cannot be fully resolved with the Chandra/HEG resolution. Other lines display velocity extremes scattered around phase 0.5 (blueshift) and 0.0 (redshift), with velocity amplitudes of 100--300 km/s, suggesting their origin in the WR stellar wind between the two components along 3D \xi-surfaces. Parts of the emission lines of {Ar}{xviii} and {Ca}{xx} originated around the compact star (disc or corona). The recent polarisation funnel-modelling is consistent with the present results during the hypersoft state.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal mode frequencies and gravitational perturbations of spinning black holes in modified gravity through METRICS: The dynamical Chern-Simons gravity case</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11759v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first precise calculations of the gravitational quasinormal-mode (QNM) frequencies for spinning black holes with dimensionless angular momenta $J/M^2 := a \lesssim 0.75$ in dynamical Chern-Simons gravity. Using the \textit{Metric pErTuRbations wIth speCtral methodS} (METRICS) framework, we compute the QNM frequencies of both axial and polar metric perturbations, focusing on the $nl m = 022$, $033$, and $032$ modes. The METRICS frequencies for the 022 mode achieve numerical uncertainties $\lesssim 10^{-4}$ when $0 \leq a \leq 0.5$ and $\lesssim 10^{-3}$ for $0.5 \leq a \leq 0.75$, without decoupling or simplifying the linearized field equations. We also derive optimal fitting polynomials to enable efficient and accurate evaluations of the leading-order frequency shifts in these modes. The METRICS frequencies and fitting expressions are a robust and indispensable step toward enabling gravitational-wave ringdown tests of dynamical Chern-Simons gravity.</description>

      <title>Impact of convective overshooting on the single-degenerate model of Type Ia supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02551v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The single-degenerate (SD) model is one of the principal models for the progenitors of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). However, it faces some challenges, the primary being its inability to account for the observed SN Ia birth rate. Many studies have attempted to address this issue by expanding the parameter space, defined by the initial donor star mass and orbital period, that can lead to SNe Ia, as well as by improving binary population synthesis. While these efforts have led to significant progress, many uncertainties in stellar physics persist, which influences the outcomes of such studies. Convective overshooting, which can significantly affect the internal structure of a star and subsequently its evolution within a binary system, is one of the most significant sources of uncertainty in stellar physics. We investigate the effect of convective overshooting on the parameter space and birth rate of SNe Ia within the SD model. We employed the common-envelope wind (CEW) model, a new version of the SD model, as our progenitor model. Using MESA, we obtained the parameter space that leads to SNe Ia for three different convective overshooting parameters and calculated the corresponding SN Ia birth rate. Convective overshooting expands the upper boundaries (corresponding to a larger initial donor mass) and right boundaries (corresponding to a longer initial orbital period) of the parameter space for systems with massive white dwarfs (WDs; &gt;= 0.75Msun). However, the minimum WD mass and the parameter space for low-mass WDs - and, consequently, the calculated SN Ia birth rate - vary non-monotonically with convective overshooting parameters. The CEW model may explain the SNe Ia that interact with the circumstellar medium (CSM), i.e., SNe Ia-CSM. We find that the parameter space for SNe Ia-CSM increases with convective overshooting parameters, as does their birth rate.</description>

      <title>To collapse or not to collapse: Halo evolution with self-interacting dark matter mass segregation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06272v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Surprisingly compact substructures in galaxies and galaxy clusters, but also field halos, have been observed by gravitational lensing. They could be difficult to explain with collisionless dark matter (DM). To explain those objects, recent studies focused on the gravothermal collapse that halos consisting of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) can undergo. However, simple models of elastic scattering could face problems explaining those compact objects during very later stages of the collapse and the post-collapse phase, where a black hole may have formed from DM. We aim to explain compact halos while avoiding the gravothermal catastrophe to which typical SIDM models are subject. Therefore, we investigate the evolution of a DM halo for an SIDM model consisting of two species with unequal masses, which features only interactions between the different species but not within themselves. Employing $N$-body simulations, we study the effect of unequal-mass SIDM models on the evolution of an isolated DM halo. In particular, the late stages of its evolution with high central densities are simulated. We find that our two-species SIDM models can produce density cores with their size depending on the mass ratio of the two species. Moreover, mass segregation caused by the unequal particle masses leads to a finite final density state or at least a slowly growing density, which depends on the mass ratio and the mass fraction of the two DM species. SIDM models consisting of two DM species can simultaneously explain DM halos with density cores, as well as systems that are denser in their centre than expected from collisionless DM, while avoiding the gravothermal catastrophe. They are a compelling alternative to single-species models, offering a rich phenomenology.</description>

      <title>X-ray investigation of the remarkable galaxy group Nest200047</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11312v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Galaxy groups are more susceptible to feedback from the central active galactic nuclei (AGN) due to their lower gravitational binding energy compared to clusters. This makes them ideal laboratories to study feedback effects on the overall energy and baryonic mass budget. We study the LOFAR-detected galaxy group Nest200047, where there is clear evidence of multiple generations of radio lobes from the AGN. Using 140 ks Chandra and 25 ks XMM-Newton data, we investigate thermodynamic properties of the the intragroup medium including any excess energy due to the central AGN. We also investigate X-ray properties of the central black hole and constrain the $2-10$ keV X-ray flux. We used spectral analysis techniques to measure various thermodynamic profiles across the whole field of view. We also used both imaging and spectral analysis to detect and estimate the energy deposited by potential shocks and cavities. Due to the faint emission from the object beyond the core, various background effects were considered. Nest200047 has significant excess entropy, and the AGN likely contributes to a part of it. There is an excess energy of $(5-6.5) \times 10^{60}$ erg within 400 kpc, exceeding the binding energy. The pressure profile indicates that gas is likely being ejected from the system, resulting in a baryon fraction of $\sim4\%$ inside $r_{500}$. From scaling relations, we estimate a black hole mass of $(1-4)\times 10^9 M_{\odot}$. An upper limit of $2.1 \times 10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$ was derived on the black hole bolometric luminosity, which is $\sim$2.5% of the Bondi accretion power. Nest200047 is likely part of a class of over-heated galaxy groups like ESO 3060170, AWM 4 and AWM 5. Such excessive heating may lead to high quenching of star formation. Moreover, the faint X-ray nuclear emission in Nest is likely due to the accretion energy being converted into jets rather than radiation.</description>
