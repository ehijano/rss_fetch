      <description>arXiv:2503.06159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Skyrmions, topologically protected textures, have been observed in different fields of nanotechnology and have emerged as promising candidates for different applications due to their topological stability, low-power operation, and dynamic response to external stimuli. First introduced in particle physics, skyrmions have since been observed in different condensed matter fields, including magnetism, ferroelectricity, photonics, and acoustics. Their unique topological properties enable robust manipulation and detection, paving the way for innovative applications in room temperature sensing, storage, and computing. Recent advances in materials engineering and device integration have demonstrated several strategies for an efficient manipulation of skyrmions, addressing key challenges in their practical implementation. In this review, we summarize the state-of-the-art research on skyrmions across different platforms, highlighting their fundamental properties and characteristics, recent experimental breakthroughs, and technological potential. We present future perspectives and remaining challenges, emphasizing the interdisciplinary impact of skyrmions on nanotechnology.</description>

      <title>Quantum response theory and momentum-space gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a quantum response approach to momentum-space gravity in dissipative multiband systems, which dresses both the quantum geometry--through an interband Weyl transformation--and the equations of motion. In addition to clarifying the roles of the contorsion and symplectic terms, we introduce the three-state quantum geometric tensor and discuss the significance of the emergent terms from a gravitational point of view. We also identify a dual quantum geometric drag force in momentum space that provides an entropic source term for the multiband matrix of Einstein field equations.</description>

      <title>The second-order intrinsic Wiedemann-Franz law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the nonlinear anomalous thermal Hall effect has attracted substantial attention. In this paper, we carry out a theoretical exploration of the intrinsic anomalous thermal Hall and Nernst effect that is induced by the thermal Berry connection polarizability. This effect is independent of the relaxation time and can be present in antiferromagnets possessing PT symmetry. Additionally, we put forward a second-order intrinsic Wiedemann-Franz law, which represents the ratio of the second-order intrinsic thermal conductivity coefficient to the second-order intrinsic electrical conductivity coefficient . When analyzed within a four-band PT symmetric Dirac model, we observe that the second-order intrinsic thermal conductivity coefficient is linearly proportional to the second-order intrinsic electrical conductivity coefficient , and the second-order intrinsic Wiedemann-Franz law is characterized by the chemical potential $\mu$ in the low-temperature regime. These findings provide significant implications for experimental verification.</description>

      <title>Single-layer magnet phase in intrinsic magnetic topological insulators, $[\mathrm{MnTe}][\mathrm{Bi}_{2}\mathrm{Te}_{3}]_{\mathrm{n}}$, far beyond the thermodynamic limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intrinsic magnetic topological insulator (IMTI) family $[\mathrm{MnTe}][\mathrm{Bi}_{2}\mathrm{Te}_{3}]_{\mathrm{n}}$ has demonstrated magneto-topological properties dependent on $n$, making it a promising platform for advanced electronics and spintronics. However, due to technical barriers in sample synthesis, their properties in the large $n$ limit remain unknown. To overcome this, we utilized the atomic layer-by-layer molecular beam epitaxy (ALL-MBE) technique and achieved IMTIs with $n$ as large as 15, far beyond the previously reported in bulk crystals or thin films. Then, we discover that the "single-layer magnet (SLM)" phase, primarily determined by intralayer ferromagnetic coupling, emerges for $n &gt;$ $\sim 4$ and remains little affected up to $n = 15$. Nonetheless, still, non-zero, interlayer ferromagnetic coupling is necessary to stabilize the SLM phase, suggesting that the SLM phase eventually disappears in the $n\to\infty$ limit. This study uncovers the secrets of IMTIs beyond the thermodynamic limit and opens a door to diverse magneto-topological applications.</description>

      <title>Highly tunable valley polarization of potential-trapped moir\'e excitons in WSe2/WS2 heterojunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moir\'e superlattices created by stacking atomic layers of transition metal dichalcogenide semiconductors have emerged as a class of fascinating artificial photonic and electronic materials. An appealing attribute of these structures is the inheritance of the valley degree of freedom from the constituent monolayers. Recent studies show evidence that the valley polarization of the moir\'e excitons is highly tunable. In heterojunctions of WSe2/WS2, marked improvement in valley polarization is observed by increasing optical excitation power, a behavior that is quite distinct from the monolayers, and lacks a clear understanding so far. In this work, we show that this highly tunable valley property arises from filling of the moir\'e superlattice, which provides an intriguing mechanism for engineering these quantum opto-valleytronic platforms. Our data further demonstrate that the long-range electron-hole exchange interaction, despite being significantly weakened in the junctions, is the dominant source of moir\'e exciton intervalley scattering at low population. Using magnetic field tuning, we quantitatively determine the exchange interaction strength to be 0.03 meV and 0.24 meV for 0- and 60-degrees twisted samples respectively in our experiments, about one order of magnitude weaker than that in the monolayers.</description>

      <title>Driven Magnon-Photon System as a Tunable Quantum Heat Rectifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling the flow of heat in quantum systems or circuits is very desirable for the development of quantum technologies. Here, we investigate the quantum heat transport in a driven hybrid magnonphoton system in contact with two thermal baths operating at different temperatures. Specifically, we analyze the role of the parameters of the hybrid quantum system in the processes that lead to the asymmetry of the steady-state heat current. We find that the thermal rectification is high in the regime of weak magnon-photon hybridization strength and large magnon-drive. Moreover, this driving and the system parameters could serve as experimental knobs to tune the thermodynamic properties of the magnon-photon system, as we demonstrate for the rectification parameter tunable by the drive in its entire physical range. The results from this research would provide very useful insight into the design of quantum thermal machines with a driven magnon-photon system.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Transfer of Chiral Edge States in Topological Type-II Hyperbolic Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of hyperbolic lattice, a discretized regularization of non-Euclidean space with constant negative curvature, has provided an unprecedented platform to extend topological phases of matter from Euclidean to non-Euclidean spaces. To date, however, all previous hyperbolic topological states are limited to conventional type-I hyperbolic lattice with a single edge, leaving the dynamic transfer of hyperbolic topological states between different edges completely unresolved. Here, by extending the hyperbolic topological physics from the conventional type-I hyperbolic lattices to the newfangled type-II hyperbolic lattices, we report the type-II hyperbolic Chern insulator featuring outer and inner chiral edge states and demonstrate their dynamic transfer across the bulk to the opposite edge via two distinct mechanisms: anti-parity-time phase transition and Landau-Zener single-band pumping. Our work lays the foundation for further exploring the dynamic evolution of hyperbolic topological effects, with the final goal of inspiring applications leveraging dynamic manipulations of the hyperbolic topological states.</description>

      <title>Superconducting Coherence Peak in Near-Field Radiative Heat Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enhancement and peaks in near-field radiative heat transfer (NFRHT) typically arise due to surface phonon-polaritons, plasmon-polaritons, and electromagnetic (EM) modes in structured materials. However, the role of material quantum coherence in enhancing near-field radiative heat transfer remains unexplored. Here, we unravel that NFRHT in superconductor-ferromagnetic systems displays a unique peak at the superconducting phase transition that originates from the quantum coherence of Bogoliubov quasiparticles in superconductors. Our theory takes into account evanescent EM radiation emanating from fluctuating currents comprising Cooper pairs and Bogoliubov quasiparticles in stark contrast to the current-current correlations induced by electrons in conventional materials. Our proposed NFRHT configuration exploits ferromagnetic resonance at frequencies deep inside the superconducting band gap to isolate this superconducting coherence peak. Furthermore, we reveal that Cooper pairs and Bogoliubov quasiparticles have opposite effects on near-field thermal radiation and isolate their effects on many-body radiative heat transfer near superconductors. Our proposed phenomenon can have applications for developing thermal isolators and heat sinks in superconducting circuits.</description>

      <title>Skyrmion Molecule Lattices Enabling Stable Transport and Flexible Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Skyrmions--topologically protected nanoscale spin textures with vortex-like configurations--hold transformative potential for ultra-dense data storage, spintronics and quantum computing. However, their practical utility is challenged by dynamic instability, complex interaction, and the lack of deterministic control. While recent efforts using classical wave systems have enabled skyrmion simulations via engineered excitations, these realizations rely on fragile interference patterns, precluding stable transport and flexible control. Here, we introduce a skyrmion molecule lattice, a novel architecture where pairs of spin skyrmions with opposite polarizability are symmetry-locked into stable molecule configurations. These molecules emerge as propagating eigenstates of the system, overcoming the static limitations of previous realizations. We further develop a boundary engineering technique, achieving precise control over skyrmion creation, deformation, annihilation, and polarizability inversion. As a proof of concept, we design a graphene-like acoustic surface wave metamaterial, where meta-atom pairs generate vortices with opposite orbital angular momenta, which couple to acoustic spin textures, forming skyrmion molecules. Experimental measurements confirm their stable transport and flexible control. Our work leverages the symmetry-locked molecule lattice to preserve the topological quasiparticle nature of skyrmions, offering a universal framework for their stabilization, transportation and manipulation. This bridges critical gaps in skyrmion physics, with potential impacts on wave-based sensing, information processing, and topological waveguiding.</description>

      <title>The Orbital Angular Momentum of Azimuthal Spin-Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of a growing interdisciplinary interest in the angular momentum of wave fields, the spin-wave case has yet to be fully explored, with the extensively studied notion of spin transport being only part of the broader picture. Here we report experimental evidence for magnon orbital angular momentum, demonstrating that the mode exhibits rotation rather than remaining stationary. This conclusion is drawn from observations of the lifted degeneracy of waves with counter-rotating wave fronts. This requires an unambiguous formulation of spin and orbital angular momenta for spin waves, which we provide in full generality based on a systematic application of quantum field theory techniques. The results unequivocally establish magnetic dipole-dipole interactions as a magnetic-field controllable spin-orbit interaction for magnons. Our findings open a new research direction, leveraging the spectroscopic readability of angular momentum for azimuthal spin waves and other related systems.</description>

      <title>Field Theory of Linear Spin-Waves in Finite Textured Ferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of an ever-expanding experimental and theoretical interest in the magnetization dynamics of mesoscopic magnetic structures, both in the classical and quantum regimes, we formulate a low energy field theory for the linear spin-waves in finite and textured ferromagnets and we perform its constrained canonical quantization. The introduction of a manifestly gauge invariant Lagrangian enables a straightforward application of the Noether's theorem. Taking advantage of this in the context of a broad class of axisymmetric ferromagnets of special conceptual and experimental relevance, a general expression of the conserved and quantized spin-wave total angular momentum is rigorously derived, while separate conservation and quantization of its orbital and spin components are established for a more restricted class of uniaxial exchange ferromagnets. Further particularizing this general framework to the case of axially saturated magnetic thin disks, we develop a semi-analytic theory of the low frequency part of the exchange-dipole azimuthal spin wave spectrum, providing a powerful theoretical platform for the analysis and interpretation of magnetic resonance experiments on magnetic microdots as further demonstrated in a joint paper [arxiv The Orbital Angular Momentum of Azimuthal Spin-Waves]</description>

      <title>Probing the Design Space of InSb Topological Superconductor Nanowires for the Realization of Majorana Zero Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Abelian anyons such as Majorana zero modes (MZMs) have the potential to enable fault-tolerant quantum computing through topological protection. Experimentally reported InSb topological superconductor nanowires (TSNW) are investigated theoretically and numerically to evaluate their suitability to host MZMs. We employ eigenspectra analysis and quantum transport based on the non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism to investigate the eigenenergies, Majorana wave functions via local density of states, transmission spectra for Andreev processes, and zero-bias conductance peaks (ZBCPs) in InSb TSNWs. For 1.6 {\mu}m- and 2.2 {\mu}m-long InSb TSNWs we demonstrate the existence of the optimum design space defined by the applied magnetic field and electrochemical potential, which leads to clear ZBCP signatures with a Majorana localization length down to ~340 nm.</description>

      <title>Aharonov-Bohm and Altshuler-Aronov-Spivak oscillations in the quasi-ballistic regime in phase-pure GaAs/InAs core/shell nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The realization of various qubit systems based on high-quality hybrid superconducting quantum devices, is often achieved using semiconductor nanowires. For such hybrid devices, a good coupling between the superconductor and the conducting states in the semiconductor wire is crucial. GaAs/InAs core/shell nanowires with an insulating core, and a conductive InAs shell fulfill this requirement, since the electronic states are strongly confined near the surface. However, maintaining a good crystal quality in the conducting shell is a challenge for this type of nanowire. In this work, we present phase-pure zincblende GaAs/InAs core/shell nanowires and analyze their low-temperature magnetotransport properties. We observe pronounced magnetic flux quantum periodic oscillations, which can be attributed to a combination of Aharonov-Bohm and Altshuler-Aronov-Spivak oscillations. From the gate and temperature dependence of the conductance oscillations, as well as from supporting theoretical transport calculations, we conclude that the conducting states in the shell are in the quasi-ballistic transport regime, with few scattering centers, but nevertheless leading to an Altshuler-Aronov-Spivak correction that dominates at small magnetic field strengths. Our results demonstrate that phase-pure zincblende GaAs/InAs core/shell nanowires represent a very promising alternative semiconductor nanowire-based platform for hybrid quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Electron-channel blockade for plasmonic wavepackets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective excitation of an interacting electron liquid called plasmon has distinct properties compared to those of a bare electron. Plasmons excited by a short voltage pulse and transmitted through quantum devices will distribute amongst electron conduction channels via Coulomb interactions, which is known as charge fractionalization. This process spreads plasmons into all Coulomb-coupled electron conduction channels, including those in neighbouring circuits, and makes it difficult to control them in quantum circuits. Here we demonstrate the isolation and on-demand selection of electron conduction channels contributing to the plasmon using a cavity, which enables us to control the velocity of propagating plasmons. We demonstrate an electron-channel blockade effect, where charge fractionalization to cavity-confined electron conduction channels is prohibited by the narrow energy distribution of the plasmon itself. This effect is unaffected by the energy fluctuation of the surrounding circuits. The electron-channel blockade offers a powerful tool for designing plasmonic circuits as it can be used to control the plasmon velocity by local parameters, suppress unwanted plasmonic excitation in nearby circuits, and select electron-channels of plasmon eigenstates in quantum interferometers.</description>

Abstract: We calculate the shift current response in twisted double bilayer graphenes (TDBG) by applying the perturbative approach to the effective continuum Hamiltonian. We have performed a systematic study of the shift current in AB-AB and AB-BA stacked TDBG, where we have investigated the dependence of the signal on the twist angle, the vertical bias voltage and the Fermi level. The numerical analyses demonstrate that a large signal is generated from the formation of the moir\'e minibands. Notably, we also found that there is a systematic sign reversal of the signal in the two stacking configurations below the charge neutrality point for large bias voltages. We qualitatively explain the origin of this sign reversal by studying the shift current response in AB-stacked bilayer graphene.</description>

      <title>Out-of-plane displacement of quantum color centers in monolayer h-BN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Color centers exhibiting deep-level states within the wide bandgap h-BN monolayer possess substantial potential for quantum applications. Uncovering precise geometric characteristics at the atomic scale is crucial for understanding defect performance. In this study, first-principles calculations were performed on the most extensively investigated CBVN and NBVN color centers in h-BN, focusing on the out-of-plane displacement and their specific impacts on electronic, vibrational, and emission properties. We demonstrate the competition between the {\sigma}*-like antibonding state and the {\pi}-like bonding state, which determines the out-of-plane displacement. The overall effect of vibronic coupling on geometry is elucidated using a pseudo Jahn-Teller model. Local vibrational analysis reveals a series of distinct quasi-local phonon modes that could serve as fingerprints for experimental identification of specific point defects. The critical effects of out-of-plane displacement during the quantum emission process are carefully elucidated to answer the distinct observations in experiments, and these revelations are universal in quantum point defects in other layered materials.</description>

      <title>Exceptional Topology of Non-Hermitian Brillouin Klein Bottles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs) are prominent non-Hermitian band degeneracies that give rise to a variety of intriguing and unconventional phenomena. Similar to Weyl and Dirac points, EPs carry topological charges and comply with the celebrated fermion doubling theorems in lattices. Beyond these characteristics, EPs exhibit more exotic topological properties, particularly non-Abelian braiding topologies not seen in conventional degeneracies. Here, we investigate these foundational concepts of EPs in two-dimensional non-Hermitian lattices where the fundamental domain of the Brillouin zone is a Klein bottle, rather than a torus assumed in previous studies. We find that EPs do not necessarily appear in pairs with opposite topological charges in the Brillouin Klein bottle, thus violating the fermion doubling theorem. The violation occurs because, without crossing the boundary, the sum of the topological charges of EPs is in fact an even number rather than zero. Moreover, we uncover unique braiding topologies of EPs that cannot be captured by existing theories. Specifically, the composite braidings around all EPs equals the braiding along the boundary of the Brillouin Klein bottle. This novel braiding topology further confirms the failure of the fermion doubling theorem, and allows us to explore the non-Abelian braidings of EPs beyond the scope of topological charges. Our work highlights the fundamental role of Brillouin-zone topology in non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Signatures of hydrodynamic flow of topological carriers in SnTe multi-terminal nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we used 20 nm thick CdTe/SnTe/CdTe [001] quantum wells to make 6- and 8-terminal nano-structures with the etched cross-junctions of sub-micron width with walls directed along the [10], [01], and [11] surface crystallographic directions. We studied the low-temperature quantum magneto-transport to investigate the impact of lateral confinement on the states of topological carriers. Calculations showed that for narrow SnTe channels, almost flat bands with small energy dispersion are formed, and in the case of the [11] direction, the dispersionless states are strongly localized at the mesa edges. The measurements indicated that a current path associated with trivial states inside the quantum well was considerably narrowed due to disorder, leading to a significant reduction in channel conductivity. Such a high-resistance cross-junction has been used for measurements of non-linear transport in non-local configurations. The dependence of the differential resistance $R_\text{d}$ on the direct current $I_\text{DC}$ flowing through a selected pair of contacts was studied. For temperatures $T&lt;1$ K, first an increase and then a decrease followed by a minimum of $R_\text{d}$ were observed. This is a characteristic $R_\text{d}(I_\text{DC})$ relationship that is often considered as the signature of the hydrodynamic flow of a fermionic liquid in narrow quantum channels, which in the case of SnTe can be formed by topological states located entirely at the inner edges of a planar cross-junction.</description>

      <title>Multiple Manifestations of Negative Local Partial Density of States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revealed that with the measurement of the scattering phase shift of electron in low-dimensional or mesoscopic systems local objects of hierarchy of density of states can also determine experimentally. In recent times, it has been exhibited that in mesoscopic systems certain objects of density of states (DOS) hierarchy like local partial DOS, partial DOS, injectivity, emissivity, etc. can become negative in presence of Fano resonance. Negativity of local partial density of states can be interpreted as the losing coherent electrons in reverse time. This may have implications for the thermodynamic properties of these mesoscopic systems. In these negative local partial states, electrons may behave akin to positrons, resulting in practical the possibility of electron-electron interaction. The objective of this research is to reveal some manifestations of local objects in mesoscopic systems, employing rigorous calculations utilizing two different approaches: a continuum model and a discrete or tight binding model. It has been demonstrated that negative local partial states are correlated with Fano-resonance featuring a {\pi} phase drop.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Meets Topological Hall Effect in Cr2Ge2Te6 Heterostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Introducing topologically protected skyrmions in graphene holds significant importance for developing high-speed, low-energy spintronic devices. Here, we present a centrosymmetric ferromagnetic graphene/trilayer Cr2Ge2Te6/graphene heterostructure, demonstrating the anomalous and topological Hall effect due to the magnetic proximity effect. Through gate voltage control, we effectively tune the emergence and size of skyrmions. Micromagnetic simulations reveal the formation of skyrmions and antiskyrmions, which respond differently to external magnetic fields, leading to oscillations in the topological Hall signal. Our findings provide a novel pathway for the formation and manipulation of skyrmions in centrosymmetric two-dimensional magnetic systems, offering significant insights for developing topological spintronics.</description>

      <title>Fermi arcs around magnetic domain walls in a compensated ferrimagnetic Weyl semimetal Ti$_2$MnAl</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fermi arcs are one of the characteristic features of Weyl semimetals, appearing as surface states that connect Weyl points with opposite chiralities. It has also been suggested that Fermi arcs can emerge in the bulk due to the interplay between magnetic textures and Weyl physics. We focus on Ti$_2$MnAl which is an ideal magnetic Weyl semimetal with a compensated ferrimagnetic order. We systematically analyze domain wall-induced Fermi arcs in Ti$_2$MnAl using an effective tight-binding model. By varying the strength of spin-orbit coupling, we confirmed that these domain wall-induced Fermi arcs emerge as a result of shifts in the positions of the Weyl points. Furthermore, we found that these domain wall-induced Fermi arcs in Ti$_2$MnAl originate from the Chern number and represent a topologically robust state that is independent of the domain wall width.</description>

      <title>Self-modulation instability in high power ferromagnetic resonance of BiYIG nanodisks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the high power ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) of perpendicularly magnetized BiYIG nanodisks where the uniaxial anisotropy almost compensates the shape anisotropy. We observe a strong saturation of the averaged magnetization upon moderately increasing the amplitude of the rf field and a broadening of the FMR line towards lower and higher magnetic field. Full micromagnetic simulations reveal that a self-modulation of the dynamic magnetization is responsible of this behavior. To get more insight into this unstable dynamics, it is analysed in terms of normal modes. The number of modes involved is found to rapidly increase above the critical threshold. Still, a normal modes model taking into account only a few of them and their mutual nonlinear couplings allows us to qualitatively reproduce the observed phenomenon. The normal modes analysis and micromagnetic simulations also predict a Suhl-like instability at larger excitation power when it is slowly increased from low values, and bistability. Using two-tone spectroscopy, we directly measure the self-modulation spectrum and provide experimental evidence of bistable dynamics. These findings open some perspectives of using high dimensional dynamics in magnetic nanostructures for unconventional information processing.</description>

      <title>Origin of Cusp-Like Feature in Hall Resistivity of Uniaxial Ferromagnet in Non-Orthogonal Hall Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent magnetotransport studies on uniaxial ferromagnets have reported a cusp-like feature in Hall resistivity when the magnetic field is tilted away from the conventional orthogonal direction of the Hall measurement. This feature has often been attributed to the topological Hall effect arising from a non-coplanar spin structure. In this Letter, we have studied the uniaxial ferromagnet SmMn$_2$Ge$_2$ to demonstrate that this feature is rather a consequence of the non-orthogonal geometry of the Hall measurement and is expected to appear whenever the magnetic field is applied away from the easy axis of magnetization, non-orthogonal to the sample plane. The Hall resistivity, exhibiting this feature, scales with the orthogonal component of the magnetization, indicating that the observed feature is simply a manifestation of the anomalous Hall effect. We explain the origin of this feature based on the evolution of ferromagnetic domains under a non-orthogonal external magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Strain and doping transfer between suspended and supported bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to their unique dimensionality, the physical properties of two-dimensional materials are deeply impacted by their surroundings, calling for a thorough understanding and control of these effects. We investigated the influence of the substrate and the pressure transmitting medium on bilayer graphene in a unique high-pressure environment where the sample is partially suspended and partially supported. By employing Raman spectroscopy with a sub-micron spatial resolution, we explored the evolution of strain and doping, and demonstrated that they are both similarly induced in the suspended and supported regions of the bilayer graphene within the studied pressure range. Almost full strain and doping transfer between the supported and suspended regions is concluded. We observed that charge carrier density saturates quickly at low pressures (2 GPa) while biaxial strain continuously increases with pressure. Additionally, Raman spatial mapping highlights a rather uniform doping and strain distribution, yet with significant local variations revealing a more complex scenario than previously documented by single-point studies at high pressure.</description>

      <title>Chiral damping with persistent edge states: interplay of spectral topology and band topology in open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamical consequences of combining the non-Hermitian skin effect with topological edge states. Focusing on the paradigmatic dissipative Hofstadter model, we find that the time-dependent particle density exhibits both chiral damping (due to the non-Hermitian skin effect) and edge-selective extremal damping (rooted in persistent topological edge states). We find that the time scales of chiral damping and edge-selective extremal damping decouple due to boundary-induced spectral topology, thus allowing observation of both effects under dynamics. We identify intermediate magnetic fields as the most favorable regime, since chiral damping is then partially recovered. More generally, our work sheds light on how open quantum systems are impacted by the combined presence of spectral and band topologies, and how their interplay can be probed directly.</description>

      <title>Bright quantum dot light sources using monolithic microlenses on gold back-reflectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the fabrication process of bright $GaAs$ quantum dot (QD) photon sources by non-deterministic embedding into broadband monolithic $Al_{0.15}Ga_{0.85}As$ microlens arrays on gold-coated substrates. Arrays of cylindrical photoresist templates, with diameters ranging from $2$ $\mu m$ to $5$ $\mu m$, are thermally reflowed and subsequently transferred into the $Al_{0.15}Ga_{0.85}As$ thin-film semiconductor heterostructure with embedded quantum dots through an optimized anisotropic and three-dimensional shape-preserving reactive ion etching process. This methodology facilitated the fabrication of large-scale ($2$ $mm$ $\times$ $4$ $mm$) and densely packed arrays of uniformly shaped microlenses ($\sim$ $40 \times 10^3$ $mm^{-1}$), with the brightest emissions from QDs embedded in microlenses exhibiting lateral diameters and heights of $2.7$ $\mu m$ and $1.35$ $\mu m$, respectively. Finite-difference time-domain simulations of both idealized and fabricated lens shapes provide a comprehensive three-dimensional analysis of the device performance and optimization potentials such as anti-reflection coatings. It is found that free-space extraction (fiber-coupled) efficiencies of up to $62$ $\%$ ($37$ $\%$) are achievable for hemispherical QD-microlenses on gold-coated substrates. A statistical model for the fabrication yield of QD-microlenses is developed and experimentally corroborated by photoluminescence spectroscopy of fabricated microlens arrays. This analysis exhibited a free-space intensity enhancement by factors of up to $\times 200$ in approximately $1$ out of $200$ microlenses, showing good agreement to the theoretical expectations. This scalable fabrication strategy underscores the potential of these compact, high-efficiency sources offering new prospects for applications of these devices in future large-scale quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Self-stabilized charge states in a double-decker molecular magnet on Pb(111)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron charging play key roles in physiochemical processes, whose intrinsic stabilization in single molecules is desirable for tailoring molecular functionality and developing molecular devices, but remains elusive on surfaces. Here, we show molecular charge states can be self-stabilized via intramolecular distortion in single bis(phthalocyaninato)terbium(III) (TbPc2) double-decker molecules, that were grown on Pb(111) substrate. Using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, we identify fractions of TbPc2 molecules reduce to 2-fold symmetry, expressing energy-split molecular orbitals and two types of different spin states. Our first principles calculations unveil that the symmetry reduction is induced by charging-triggered Jahn-Teller distortions, which lifts the degenerate orbitals into two 2-fold symmetric orbitals. Single or double occupancy of the lower-energy orbital results in different molecular spin states. Such intramolecular distortion traps the excess electrons stably without explicit involvement of the substrate, in contrast to previously observed molecular charge states. These charged single molecule can be manipulated with the tip individually. This study offers a new avenue for tailoring the charge and spin states of molecules.</description>

      <title>QBIOL: A quantum bioelectrochemical software based on point stochastic processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bioelectrochemistry is crucial for understanding biological functions and driving applications in synthetic biology, healthcare, and catalysis. However, current simulation methods fail to capture both the stochastic nature of molecular motion and electron transfer across the relevant picosecond-to-minute timescales. We present QBIOL, a web-accessible software that integrates molecular dynamics, applied mathematics, GPU programming, and quantum charge transport to address this challenge. QBIOL enables quantitative stochastic electron transfer simulations and has the potential to reproduce numerically any (bio) electrochemical experiments. We illustrate this potential by comparing our simulations with experimental data on the current generated by electrode-attached redox-labeled DNA, or by nanoconfined redox species, in response to a variety of electrical excitation waveforms, configurations of interest in biosensing and catalysis. The adaptable architecture of QBIOL extends to the development of devices for quantum and molecular technologies, positioning our software as a powerful tool for enabling new research in this rapidly evolving field.</description>

      <title>Floquet-engineered diode performance in a Majorana-quantum dot Josephson junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study nonreciprocal signatures of Josephson current (JC) in a quantum dot (QD)-based Josephson junction (JJ) that comprises of two periodically driven Kitaev chains (KCs) coupled with an intervening QD. The simultaneous breaking of the inversion symmetry ($\mathcal{IS}$) and the time-reversal symmetry ($\mathcal{TRS}$), indispensable for the Josephson diode effect (JDE), is achieved solely via the two Floquet drives that differ by a finite phase, which eventually results in a nonreciprocal current, and hence yields a finite JDE. It may be noted that the Floquet Majorana modes generated at both the far ends of the KCs (away from the QD) and adjacent to the QD junctions mediate the JC owing to a finite superconducting (SC) phase difference in the two KCs. We calculate the time-averaged JC and inspect the tunability of the current-phase relation (CPR) to ascertain the diode characteristics. The asymmetric Floquet drive also manifests an anomalous JC signature in our KC-QD-KC JJ. Furthermore, additional control over the QD energy level can be achieved via an external gate voltage that renders flexibility for the Josephson diode (JD) to act as an SC switching device. Tuning different system parameters, such as the chemical potential of the KCs, Floquet frequency, the relative phase mismatch of the drives, and the gate voltage, our model shows the highest possible rectification to be around $70\%$. Summarizing, our study provides an alternative scenario, replacing the traditional usage of an external magnetic field and spin-orbit coupling effects in a JD via asymmetrically driven Kitaev leads that entail Majorana-mediated transport.</description>

      <title>Coupled electron-phonon hydrodynamics and viscous thermoelectric equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-diffusive, hydrodynamic-like transport of charge or heat has been observed in several materials, and recent, pioneering experiments have suggested the possible emergence of electron-phonon bifluids. Here we introduce the first-principles theory and computational framework to describe these phenomena, showing that the viscosity of electron-phonon bifluids is microscopically determined by composite ``relaxon'' electron-phonon excitations that also describe electron-phonon drag effects on thermoelectric transport coefficients. We show that these composite excitations emerge from the microscopic coupled electron-phonon Boltzmann transport equation, and demonstrate that the latter can be coarse-grained into a set of mesoscopic Viscous Thermoelectric Equations (VTE). The VTE unify the established hydrodynamic equation for electrons derived by Gurzhi [Sov. Phys. Usp. 11 1968], and the recently developed Viscous Heat Equations for phonons [PRX 10, 2020], while also extending them to cover the mixed electron-phonon bifluid regime. We employ this framework to elucidate from first principles the conditions under which electron and phonon fluids can coexist and mix, as well as to rationalize experimental signatures of electron-phonon drag in graphite.</description>

      <title>Electric polarization in Chern insulators: Unifying many-body and single-particle approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, it has been established that Chern insulators possess an intrinsic two-dimensional electric polarization, despite having gapless edge states and non-localizable Wannier orbitals. This polarization, $\vec{P}_{\text{o}}$, can be defined in a many-body setting from various physical quantities, including dislocation charges, boundary charge distributions, and linear momentum. Importantly, there is a dependence on a choice of real-space origin $\text{o}$ within the unit cell. In contrast, Coh and Vanderbilt extended the single-particle Berry phase definition of polarization to Chern insulators by choosing an arbitrary point in momentum space, $\vec{k}_0$. In this paper, we unify these two approaches and show that when the real-space origin $\text{o}$ and momentum-space point $\vec{k}_0$ are appropriately chosen in relation to each other, the Berry phase and many-body definitions of polarization are equal.</description>

      <title>$\mathbb{Z}_2$ Vortex Crystals and Topological Magnons in a Tetrahedral Antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the formation of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ vortex crystal in the tetrahedral antiferromagnetic order on a triangular lattice. The noncoplanar tetrahedral state consists of four sublattices with spins oriented along the faces of a tetrahedron in spin space. The long-range order characterized by a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topology arises due to the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and appears at zero temperature and without external fields. The $\mathbb{Z}_2$ vortex crystal is composed of four interpenetrating skyrmion-like topological defects. Its magnetic excitations include magnetically active gyrotropic and breathing modes, which -- under an external magnetic field -- carry nontrivial Chern numbers that stabilize chiral magnon edge states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores how molecular shape changes influence the phase behavior of liquid crystals, particularly the nematic (N) phase of 5CB, through all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The results demonstrate that molecular shape anisotropy increases in the N phase, with molecules adopting more elongated conformations as aggregation occurs. We find that the shape distribution is temperature- and aggregation-dependent, and the molecular shape relaxation time is longer in the N phase compared to isolated molecules. Additionally, the study proposes a revision to Onsager and Maier-Saupe theories, considering molecular shape distribution changes, which could improve the explanation of the N-I phase transition in liquid crystals. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the molecular behavior in liquid crystalline phases.</description>

      <title>Topological superconductivity in two-dimensional $\pi$-junction Dirac semimetals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Odd-parity pairings offer a natural pathway for realizing topological superconductivity. When two identical even-parity superconductors form a $\pi$-junction, the metallic material sandwiched between them experiences an effective odd-parity pairing, facilitating the emergence of topological superconductivity in the intermediate region. In this work, we consider the intermediate material to be a two-dimensional spin-orbit-coupled Dirac semimetal. When the two superconductors are conventional s-wave superconductors, we find that a helical topological superconductor can be realized. This phase is characterized by the presence of a pair of helical Majorana edge states. Interestingly, when the superconductors are $s_{\pm}$-wave superconductors, we observe not only the helical topological superconductor but also an unconventional topological superconductor. The latter is distinguished by the existence of two pairs of helical Majorana edge states, despite the fact that the global topological invariants for this system take on trivial values. By further applying an in-plane magnetic field, we demonstrate that second-order topological superconducting phases can be achieved. These phases host isolated Majorana corner modes as well as twofold Majorana corner modes. Our findings reveal that two-dimensional $\pi$-junction Dirac semimetals can support a rich variety of topological superconducting phases, offering a versatile platform for exploring exotic topological phenomena.</description>

      <title>Energy-efficient antiferromagnetic skyrmion creation and its dynamics in structure-dependent magneto-elastic coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing skyrmion nucleation methods lead to increased Joule heating, limiting the applicability to metallic Antiferromagnetic (AFM) systems. In this study, we propose a novel, energy-efficient mechanical method for nucleating AFM skyrmions using Surface Acoustic Waves (SAWs). SAWs, which propagate along material surfaces with minimal attenuation, generate dynamic strain that induces a spatially varying torque on magnetic spins, offering a viable alternative to traditional current-based methods. Using the Thiele approach we investigate skyrmion dynamics in special AFMs, NiO-like or CoO-like, incorporating a magnetoelastic term that accounts for the unique spin arrangements, where spins align oppositely within parallel planes. Our findings reveal that the deformation induced by SAWs, influenced by the magnetostriction of materials like NiO and CoO, can modify the spin configuration, consequently, alters the skyrmion dynamics. This study not only demonstrates the potential of SAWs for efficient skyrmion nucleation in AFMs but also introduces new theoretical insights into specific magnetoelastic-induced skyrmion dynamics in AFM systems.</description>

      <title>Scalable entanglement of nuclear spins mediated by electron exchange</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of nuclear spins for quantum computation is limited by the difficulty in creating genuine quantum entanglement between distant nuclei. Current demonstrations of nuclear entanglement in semiconductors rely upon coupling the nuclei to a common electron, which is not a scalable strategy. Here we demonstrate a two-qubit Control-Z logic operation between the nuclei of two phosphorus atoms in a silicon device, separated by up to 20 nanometers. Each atoms binds separate electrons, whose exchange interaction mediates the nuclear two-qubit gate. We prove that the nuclei are entangled by preparing and measuring Bell states with a fidelity of 76 +/- 5 $\%$ and a concurrence of 0.67 +/- 0.05. With this method, future progress in scaling up semiconductor spin qubits can be extended to the development of nuclear-spin based quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Spin of fractional quantum Hall neutral modes and "missing states" on a sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A low-energy neutral quasiparticle in a fractional quantum Hall system appears in the latter's energy spectrum on a sphere as a series of many-body excited states labeled by the angular momentum $L$ and whose energy is a smooth function of $L$ in the limit of large sphere radius. We argue that the signature of a nonvanishing spin (intrinsic angular momentum) $s$ of the quasiparticle is the absence, in this series, of states with total angular momentum less than $s$.We reinterpret the missing of certain states, observed in an exact-diagonalization calculation of the spectrum of the $\nu=7/3$ FQH state in a wide quantum well as well as in many proposed wave functions for the excited states as a consequence of the spin-2 nature of the zero-momentum magnetoroton.</description>

      <title>Sum frequency generation from real-time simulations in two-dimensional crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sum frequency generation (SFG) and difference frequency generation (DFG) are second order nonlinear processes where two lasers with frequencies $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ combine to produce a response at frequency $\omega = \omega_1 \pm \omega_2$ . Compared with other nonlinear responses such as second-harmonic generation, SFG and DFG allow for tunability over a larger range. Moreover, the optical response can be enhanced by selecting the two laser frequencies in order to match specific electron-hole transitions. Here, we propose a first-principles framework based on the real-time solution of an effective Schr\"odinger equation to calculate the SFG and DFG in various systems, such as bulk materials, 2D materials, and molecules. Within this framework, one can select from various levels of theory for the effective one-particle Hamiltonian to account for local-field effects and electron-hole interactions. To assess the approach, we calculate the SFG and DFG of two-dimensional crystals, h-BN and MoS$_2$ monolayers, both within the independent-particle picture and including many-body effects. Additionally, we demonstrate that our approach can also extract higher-order response functions, such as field-induced second-harmonic generation. We provide an example using bilayer h-BN.</description>

      <title>Feedback controlled microengine powered by motor protein</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a template for realization of a novel microengine which is able to harness and convert the activity driven movement of individual motor protein into work output of the system. This engine comprises of a micron size bead-motor protein complex that is subject to a time-varying, feedback controlled optical potential, and a driving force due to the action of the motor protein which stochastically binds, walks and unbinds to an underlying microtubule filament. Using a Stochastic thermodynamics framework and theoretical modeling of bead-motor transport in a harmonic optical trap potential, we obtain the engine characteristics, e.g., work output per cycle, power generated, efficiency and the probability distribution function of the work output as a function of motor parameters and optical trap stiffness. The proposed engine is a work-to-work converter. Remarkably, the performance of this engine can vastly supersede the performance of other microengines that have been realized so far for feasible biological parameter range for kinesin-1 and kinesin-3 motor proteins. In particular, the work output per cycle is ~ (10-15) k_b T while the power output is (5-8) k_b T s^{-1}. Furthermore, we find that even with time delay in feedback protocol, the performance of the engine remains robust as long as the delay time is much smaller than the Brownian relaxation time of the micron size bead. Indeed such low delay time in feedback in the optical trap setup can easily be achieved with current Infrared (IR) lasers and optical trap sensor. The average work output and power output of the engine, exhibits interesting non-monotonic dependence on motor velocity and optical trap stiffness. As such this motor protein driven microengine can be a promising potential prototype for fabricating an actual microdevice engine which can have practical utility.</description>

      <title>Vortex frequency locking and Shapiro steps in superconductor open nanotubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The movement of magnetic flux quanta (Abrikosov vortices) in superconductors leads to dissipation and is influenced by various ordering effects arising from vortex-vortex, vortex-defect, and vortex-edge interactions. Under combined dc and ac stimuli, when the distance traveled by fluxons during an ac cycle corresponds to an integer multiple of the vortex lattice period, the superconductor's current-voltage (I-V) curve displays synchronization (Shapiro) steps. However, in planar constrictions, frequency-locking effects rely on a perfectly ordered vortex lattice and are typically observed when periodic vortex pinning arrays dominate over intrinsic uncorrelated disorder. Here, we propose 3D superconducting open nanotubes as systems free of periodic disorder, where the I-V curves are expected to display pronounced Shapiro steps. Using the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation, we attribute the predicted effect to a reduction in the dimensionality of vortex motion. Namely, rolling a planar film into a tube causes the 2D vortex array, which initially moves throughout the film, to evolve into quasi-1D vortex chains that are restricted to areas where the normal component of the magnetic field is near its maximum. The discussed effects are relevant for superconducting devices, where vortex nucleation frequency and voltage stabilization by an external ac stimulus can enhance their operation.</description>

      <title>Probing Topological Anderson Transition in Quasiperiodic Photonic Lattices via Chiral Displacement and Wavelength Tuning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay of topology and disorder in quantum dynamics has recently attracted significant attention across diverse platforms, including solid-state devices, ultracold atoms, and photonic systems. Here, we report on a topological Anderson transition caused by quasiperiodic inter-cell coupling disorder in photonic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger lattices. As the quasiperiodic strength is varied, the system exhibits a reentrant transition from a trivial phase to a topological phase and back to a trivial phase. Unlike the traditional detection of photonic topological edge modes, we measure the mean chiral displacement from the transport of light in the bulk of the lattices. In our photonic lattices with a fixed length, the propagation dynamics is retrieved by varying the wavelength of light, which tunes the inter-waveguide couplings.</description>

      <title>Layered Topological Antiferromagnetic Metal at Room Temperature -- YbMn$_2$Ge$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metallic antiferromagnets are essential for efficient spintronic applications due to their fast switching and high mobility, yet room-temperature metallic antiferromagnets are rare. Here, we investigate YbMn$_2$Ge$_2$, a room temperature antiferromagnet, and establish it as an exfoliable layered metal with altermagnetic surface states. Using multi-orbital Hubbard model calculations, we reveal that its robust metallic AFM ordering is stabilized by electronic correlations and a partially nested Fermi surface. Furthermore, we show that YbMn$_2$Ge$_2$ hosts symmetry-protected topological Dirac crossings, connecting unique even-order spin-polarized surface states with parabolic and inverted Mexican-hat-like dispersion. Our findings position YbMn$_2$Ge$_2$ as a promising platform for exploring the interplay of correlation, topology, and surface altermagnetism of layered antiferromagnets.</description>

Abstract: Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian provides the elemental description of a two-level system interacting with a photonic mode. In this Article, we derive an expression for the transmission response via a photonic signal that describes the hybridized states as separate photonic modes. As a result, we obtain the effective input/output couplings and the internal losses of each mode. These set the decoherence rate of the hybridized states, and provide a simple description of the strength of the response signal, that we call "visibility", and its linewidth. In particular, the result allows us to describe a situation where the coherence increases significantly while the signal remains strongly visible in the response.</description>

      <title>Volume dependence of microwave induced excess quasiparticles in superconducting resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The presence of quasiparticles typically degrades the performance of superconducting microwave circuits. The readout signal can generate non-equilibrium quasiparticles, which lead to excess microwave loss and decoherence. To understand this effect quantitatively, we measure quasiparticle fluctuations and extract the quasiparticle density across different temperatures, readout powers, and resonator volumes. We find that microwave power generates a higher quasiparticle density as the active resonator volume is reduced and show that this effect sets a sensitivity limit on kinetic inductance detectors. We compare our results with theoretical models of direct microwave photon absorption by quasiparticles and conclude that an unknown, indirect mechanism plays a dominant role in quasiparticle generation. These results provide a route to mitigate quasiparticle generation due to readout power in superconducting devices.</description>

      <title>Oriented 2D Ruddlesden-Popper Metal Halides by Pulsed Laser Deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) Metal Halides present unique and tunable properties, offering a plethora of applications in optoelectronics. However, the direct and oriented synthesis of these materials is challenging due to the low formation energies that result in fast, uncontrollable growth dynamics during solution-based processing. Here, we report the solvent-free growth of oriented and n = 1 2D $(\mbox{PEA})_2\mbox{PbI}_4$ RP films by pulsed laser deposition (PLD). In situ photoluminescence (PL) during PLD reveal that the n =1 RP phase of $(\mbox{PEA})_2\mbox{PbI}_4$ forms at the first stages of growth. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and grazing-incidence wide-angle scattering (GIWAXS) measurements confirm the formation of single oriented n = 1 phase of $(\mbox{PEA})_2\mbox{PbI}_4$ independent of the underlying substrate. Co-localized spatially resolved PL and AFM further validate the conformal growth of the n = 1 phase. While oriented growth is substrate-independent, the stability of the 2D films is influenced by the substrate. PLD-grown 2D RP films grown onto epitaxial $\mbox{MAPbI}_3$ films are stable over 80 days, showing no sign of cation exchange. This work highlights the potential of PLD for direct, room-temperature synthesis of 2D $(\mbox{PEA})_2\mbox{PbI}_4$ RP films on diverse substrates and demonstrates the feasibility of stable 2D/3D heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Feshbach Resonances in Exciton-Charge-Carrier Scattering in Semiconductor Bilayers</title>

Abstract: Feshbach resonances play a vital role in the success of cold atoms investigating strongly-correlated physics. The recent observation of their solid-state analog in the scattering of holes and intralayer excitons in transition metal dichalcogenides [Schwartz et al., Science 374, 336 (2021)] holds compelling promise for bringing fully controllable interactions to the field of semiconductors. Here, we demonstrate how tunneling-induced layer hybridization can lead to the emergence of two distinct classes of Feshbach resonances in atomically thin semiconductors. Based on microscopic scattering theory we show that these two types of Feshbach resonances allow to tune interactions between electrons and both short-lived intralayer, as well as long-lived interlayer excitons. We predict the exciton-electron scattering phase shift from first principles and show that the exciton-electron coupling is fully tunable from strong to vanishing interactions. The tunability of interactions opens the avenue to explore Bose-Fermi mixtures in solid-state systems in regimes that were previously only accessible in cold atom experiments.</description>

      <title>Exact time-evolving scattering states in open quantum-dot systems with an interaction: Discovery of time-evolving resonant states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10251v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study exact time-evolving many-electron states of an open double quantum-dot system with an interdot Coulomb interaction. A systematic construction of the time-evolving states for arbitrary initial conditions is proposed. For any initial states of one- and two-electron plane waves on the electrical leads, we obtain exact solutions of the time-evolving scattering states, which converge to known stationary scattering eigenstates in the long-time limit. For any initial states of localized electrons on the quantum dots, we find exact time-evolving states of a new type, which we refer to as time-evolving resonant states. In contrast to stationary resonant states, whose wave functions spatially diverge and not normalizable, the time-evolving resonant states are normalizable since their wave functions are restricted to a finite space interval due to causality. The exact time-evolving resonant states enable us to calculate the time-dependence of the survival probability of electrons on the quantum dots for the system with the linearized dispersions. It decays exponentially in time on one side of an exponential point of resonance energies while, on the other side, it oscillates during the decay as a result of the interference of the two resonance energies.</description>

      <title>Variational Mapping of Chern Bands to Landau Levels: Application to Fractional Chern Insulators in Twisted MoTe$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20307v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a theoretical study of mapping between Chern bands and generalized Landau levels in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ ($t$MoTe$_2$), where fractional Chern insulators down to zero magnetic fields have been observed. We construct an exact Landau-level representation of moir\'e bands, where the basis functions, characterized by a uniform quantum geometry, are derived from Landau-level wavefunctions dressed by spinors aligned or antialigned with the layer pseudospin skyrmion field. We further generalize the dressed zeroth Landau level to a variational wavefunction with an ideal yet nonuniform quantum geometry and variationally maximize its weight in the first moir\'e band. The variational wavefunction has a high overlap with the first band and quantitatively captures the exact diagonalization spectra of fractional Chern insulators at hole-filling factors $\nu_h=2/3$ and $3/5$, providing a clear theoretical mechanism for the formation and properties of the fractionalized states. Our work introduces a variational approach to studying fractional states by mapping Chern bands to Landau levels, with application to other systems beyond $t$MoTe$_2$ also demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Localization and entanglement characterization of edge states in HgTe quantum wells in a finite strip geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum information measures are proposed to analyze the structure of near-gap electronic states in HgTe quantum wells in a strip geometry $(x,y)\in (-\infty,\infty)\times [0,L]$ of finite width $L$. This allows us to establish criteria for distinguishing edge from bulk states in the topological insulator phase, including the transition region and cutoff of the wave number $k_x$ where edge states degenerate with bulk states. Qualitative and quantitative information on the near-gap Hamiltonian eigenstates, obtained by tight-binding calculations, is extracted from localization measures, like the inverse participation ratio (IPR), and entanglement entropies of the reduced density matrix (RDM) to the spin sector, measuring quantum correlations due to the spin-orbit coupling (SOC). The analysis of IPR and entanglement entropies in terms of spin, wave number $k_x$ and position $y$, evidences a spin polarization structure and spatial confinement of near-gap wave functions at the boundaries $y=0,L$ and low $k_x$, as correspond to helical edge states. IPR localization measures provide momentum $k_x$ cutoffs from which near-gap states are no longer localized at the boundaries of the sample and become part of the bulk. Below this $k_x$-point cutoff, the entanglement entropy and the spin probabilities of the RDM also capture the spin polarization structure of edge states and exhibit a higher variability compared to the relatively low entropy of the bulk state region.</description>

      <title>Friedel oscillations in two-dimensional materials with inverted bands and Mexican-hat dispersion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Friedel oscillations (FOs) in two-dimensional topological materials with Mexican hat band dispersion, which attract great interest due to the bunch of its inherent non-trivial features, including the Van Hove singularity, doubly connected Fermi surface, non-trivial quantum-geometric properties, and the presence of states with negative effective mass. These factors are found to lead to a three-mode structure of the FOs. One of the modes, arising from electron transitions between the Fermi contours, has an unexpectedly large amplitude. The evolution of the amplitudes of all modes with Fermi energy is largely determined by the interplay of three main factors: intra-contour and inter-contour electron transitions, the quantum metric of the basis states, and the electron-electron interaction. We traced the role of each factor in the formation of the FO pattern and identified the corresponding features of the FO evolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02931v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work introduces a new class of two-dimensional crystals with the structure AC$_8$XC$_8$, consisting of two layers of graphene, a chalcogen (X = O, S, Se, Te) intercalation layer, and an alkaline earth (A = Be, Ca, Mg, Sr, Ba) adlayer. The electronic band structure for the 20 compounds was studied using density functional theory. The chalcogen $p$ orbitals interact with the carbon $\pi$ orbitals to form weakly dispersing bands that give rise to complex Fermi surfaces featuring electron and hole pockets whose densities exactly compensate each other, and van Hove singularities that are very close to, or coincident with, the Fermi level in the majority of compounds studied. The resulting electron-electron interaction effects are studied using both the temperature-flow renormalisation group approach and a spin fluctuation model, which show a dominant ferromagnetic instability coexisting with $p$- or $f$-wave spin triplet superconductivity over a range of temperatures.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocity of hydrodynamic electron transport in noncentrosymmetric conductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01955v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the nonreciprocity of hydrodynamic electron transport in noncentrosymmetric conductors with broken time-reversal symmetry (TRS) is significantly enhanced compared to the disorder-dominated regime. This enhancement is caused by the linear dependence of the viscosity of the electron liquid on the flow velocity, which is allowed in the absence of TRS and Galilean invariance. The resulting nonlinear flows break dynamical similarity and must be characterized by two dimensionless parameters: the Reynolds number and the emergent nonreciprocity number. The latter is linear in velocity but independent of system size. We determine the nonlinear conductance of a Hall bar and show that the nonreciprocal correction to the current can be of comparable magnitude to its reciprocal counterpart.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Spin Transport in a Topological Insulator Thin Film</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological insulators (TIs) are intriguing materials for advanced computing applications based on spintronics because they can host robust spin effects. For instance, TIs have intrinsically large spin generation enabled by their large spin-orbit coupling. Furthermore, topological surface states (TSS) with spin-momentum locking and Dirac dispersion lead to long spin diffusion. Future spintronic device technology will require scalable film growth of high-quality material. We grow epitaxial films of Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_x$Te$_{3-y}$Se$_y$ (BSTS, $x = 0.58, y = 1$) and confirm the gapless band structure with optimal doping using angle-resolved photoelectron spectra. The temperature dependence of longitudinal resistivity shows bulk transport is suppressed as temperature is decreased, and at low temperature surface transport dominates. We evaluate the spin transport properties in BSTS without using ferromagnetic tunnel contacts via a non-local resistance experiment as a function of temperature and applied charge current. As expected, these experiments reveal the necessity of decreasing the bulk conduction to best enhance the spin transport. In the TSS, we find high efficiency of charge-to-spin conversion (spin Hall angle, $\theta_{SH} \approx 1$) and spin diffusion over several microns. Further development of high-quality TIs will make them viable candidates for efficient and lossless spintronics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the sheared graphene bilayers can be tuned to have flat low-energy bands for sufficiently large size of their moir\'e supercell. In this regime, the interacting system becomes prone to develop broken-symmetry phases, with valley symmetry breaking as the dominant pattern. The strong signal of symmetry breaking favors the onset of a pairing instability in which the electrons with opposite spin projection in the Cooper pairs live in different valleys. The Fermi lines become distorted due to the repulsive Coulomb interaction, which makes the screening highly anisotropic, leading easily to attraction in some of the interaction channels. We also show that the sheared graphene bilayers offer the possibility to realize the combined breakdown of parity and valley symmetry, making them very suitable to study the interplay between correlations and topology in a two-dimensional electron system.</description>

      <title>Defects induce phase transition from dynamic to static rippling in graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials display nanoscale dynamic ripples that significantly impact their properties. Defects within the crystal lattice are the elementary building blocks to tailor the material's morphology. While some studies have explored the link between defective structures and rippling dynamics in 2D materials, a comprehensive understanding of this relationship has yet to be achieved. Here, we address this using machine learning-driven molecular dynamics simulations. Specifically, we find that above a critical concentration of defects, free-standing graphene sheets undergo a dynamic transition from freely propagating to static ripples. Our computational approach captures the dynamics with atomic resolution, and reveals that the transition is driven by elastic interactions between defects. The strength of these interactions is found to vary across defect types and we identify a unifying set of principles driving the dynamic-to-static transition in 2D materials. Our work not only rationalises puzzling experimental results for defective 2D materials, but also paves the way to design two-dimensional devices with tailored rippling dynamics. These insights could lay the foundations for a new class of disorder-based catalytic and interfacial materials.</description>

      <title>Correlation measurement of propagating microwave photons at millikelvin</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05147v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Microwave photons are important carriers of quantum information in many promising platforms for quantum computing. They can be routinely generated, controlled, and teleported in experiments, indicating a variety of applications in quantum technology. However, observation of quantum statistical properties of microwave photons remains demanding: The energy of several microwave photons is considerably smaller than the thermal fluctuation of any room-temperature detector, while amplification necessarily induces noise. Here, we present a measurement technique with a nanobolometer that directly measures the photon statistics at the millikelvin temperature and overcomes this trade-off. We apply our method to thermal states generated by a blackbody radiator operating in the regime of circuit quantum electrodynamics. We demonstrate the photon number resolvedness of the nanobolometer, and reveal the n(n+1)-scaling law of the photon number variance as indicated by the Bose--Einstein distribution. By engineering the coherent and incoherent proportions of the input field, we observe the transition between super-Poissonian and Poissonian statistics of the microwave photons from the bolometric second-order correlation measurement. This technique is poised to serve in fundamental tests of quantum mechanics with microwave photons and function as a scalable readout solution for a quantum information processor.</description>

      <title>Efficient light upconversion via resonant exciton-exciton annihilation of dark excitons in few-layer transition metal dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03387v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we report a pronounced light upconversion in few-layer transition metal dichalcogenides. Our joint theory-experiment study attributes the upconversion photoluminescence to a resonant exciton-exciton annihilation involving a pair of dark excitons with opposite momenta, followed by the spontaneous emission of upconverted bright excitons, which can have a high upconversion efficiency. Additionally, the upconversion photoluminescence is generic in MoS2, MoSe2, WS2, and WSe2, showing a high tuneability from green to ultraviolet light.</description>

      <title>Spatially-resolved dynamics of the amplitude Schmid-Higgs mode in disordered superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11647v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the spatially-resolved dynamics of the collective amplitude Schmid-Higgs (SH) mode in disordered $s$-wave superconductors and fermionic superfluids. By analyzing the analytic structure of the zero-temperature SH susceptibility in the complex frequency plane, we find that when the coherence length greatly exceeds the mean free path: (i) the SH response at fixed wave vectors exhibits late-time oscillations decaying as $1/t^2$ with frequency $2\Delta$, where $\Delta$ is the superconducting gap; (ii) sub-diffusive oscillations with a dynamical exponent $z{=}4$ emerge at late times and large distances; and (iii) spatial oscillations at fixed frequency decay exponentially, with a period that diverges as the frequency approaches $2\Delta$ from above. When the coherence length is comparable to the mean free path, additional exponentially-decaying oscillations at fixed wave vectors appear with frequency above $2\Delta$. Furthermore, we show that the SH mode induces an extra peak in the third-harmonic generation current at finite wave-vectors. The frequency of this peak is shifted from the conventional resonance at $\Delta$, thereby providing an unambiguous signature of order parameter amplitude dynamics.</description>

      <title>Exploring functionalized Zr$_2$N and Sc$_2$N MXenes as superconducting candidates with $\textit{ab initio}$ calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12052v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the possibility of obtaining new superconductor candidates from functionalized MXene compounds Zr$_2$NS$_2$, Zr$_2$NCl$_2$, and Sc$_2$NCl$_2$ based on $\textit{ab initio}$ calculations with density functional theory for superconductors (SCDFT). The predicted superconducting transition temperature $(T_c)$ at ambient pressure may reach up to 9.48 K (Zr$_2$NS$_2$), while further $T_c$ improvements may be achieved with applied strain. We note a correlation between the profiles of superconducting gap $(\Delta)$ and electron-phonon coupling $(\lambda)$ across the Fermi surface for all compounds, which may be influenced by their modified electronic bandstructure components.</description>

      <title>Multi-scale physics of cryogenic liquid helium-4: Inverse coarse-graining properties of smoothed particle hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14244v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our recent numerical studies on cryogenic liquid helium-4 strongly indicate the features of multiscale physics that can be identified using the Landau's two-fluid model. This study presents the possibility that two-fluid models based on classical and quantum hydrodynamics have a relationship between the scale transformation using filtering in large eddy simulations (LES) and the inverse scale transformation using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). We show that the spin angular momentum conservation term, which we previously introduced into the two-fluid model as a quantum mechanical correction, formally corresponds to the subgrid-scale (SGS) model, which can be derived from the scale transformation of the two-fluid model from quantum to classical hydrodynamics. Our theoretical analysis shows that solving the two-fluid model based on classical hydrodynamics using SPH can reproduce the microscopic fluctuations even at the macroscopic scale because the truncation errors owing to the smoothing kernel approximation can substitute the microscopic fluctuations. In particular, the fluctuations can be amplified according to the size of the kernel radius at the macroscopic scale. Our further theoretical analysis shows that the Condiff viscosity model can serve as an SGS model and incorporate the quantum vortex interactions into the two-fluid model. Our results and discussion provide new insights into the microscopic composition of the cryogenic liquid helium-4 within a multiscale framework. First, a normal fluid can be a mixture of inviscid and viscous fluid particles. Second, a flow identified as a normal fluid on the microscopic scale because of the presence of molecular viscosity is still classified as an inviscid fluid on the hydrodynamic scale because its viscosity is insufficient to produce eddy viscosity.</description>

      <title>Is attention all you need to solve the correlated electron problem?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05383v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The attention mechanism has transformed artificial intelligence research by its ability to learn relations between objects. In this work, we explore how a many-body wavefunction ansatz constructed from a large-parameter self-attention neural network can be used to solve the interacting electron problem in solids. By a systematic neural-network variational Monte Carlo study on a moir\'e quantum material, we demonstrate that the self-attention ansatz provides an accurate, efficient, and unbiased solution. Moreover, our numerical study finds that the required number of variational parameters scales roughly as $N^2$ with the number of electrons, which opens a path towards efficient large-scale simulations.</description>
