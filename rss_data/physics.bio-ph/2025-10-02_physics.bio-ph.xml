      <title>Collective is different: Information exchange and speed-accuracy trade-offs in self-organized patterning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During development, highly ordered structures emerge as cells collectively coordinate with each other. While recent advances have clarified how individual cells process and respond to external signals, understanding collective cellular decision making remains a major challenge. Here, we introduce a minimal, analytically tractable, model of cell patterning via local cell-cell communication. Using this framework, we identify a trade-off between the speed and accuracy of collective pattern formation and, by adapting techniques from stochastic chemical kinetics, quantify how information flows between cells during patterning. Our analysis reveals counterintuitive features of collective patterning: globally optimized solutions do not necessarily maximize intercellular information transfer and individual cells may appear suboptimal in isolation. Moreover, the model predicts that instantaneous information shared between cells can be non-monotonic in time as patterning occurs. An analysis of recent experimental data from lateral inhibition in Drosophila pupal abdomen finds a qualitatively similar effect.</description>

      <title>In Situ Observation of Proton-Induced DNA Fragmentation in the Bragg Peak: Evidence for a Protective Role of Water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report in situ single-molecule measurements of proton-induced double-strand breaks (DSBs) in DNA immersed in water, using real-time fluorescence tracking along the entire proton path, including the Bragg peak region. By chemically suppressing radical-mediated processes, we isolate direct DNA damage mechanisms and determine DSB cross sections as a function of depth. Near the Bragg peak, we observe a tenfold reduction in DSB cross sections in aqueous DNA compared to dry DNA, providing quantitative evidence for the protective role of water. These findings highlight the importance of intermolecular energy dissipation in mitigating radiation-induced damage in condensed biological matter, with implications for radiobiology and proton therapy modeling.</description>

      <title>Optimization of sequential therapies to maximize extinction of resistant bacteria through collateral sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) threatens global health. A promising and underexplored strategy to tackle this problem are sequential therapies exploiting collateral sensitivity (CS), whereby resistance to one drug increases sensitivity to another. Here, we develop a four-genotype stochastic birth-death model with two bacteriostatic antibiotics to identify switching periods that maximize bacterial extinction under subinhibitory concentrations. We show that extinction probability depends nonlinearly on switching period, with stepwise increases aligned to discrete switch events: fast sequential therapies are suboptimal as they do not allow for the evolution of resistance, a key ingredient in these therapies. A geometric distribution framework accurately predicts cumulative extinction probabilities where the per-switch extinction probability rises with switching period. We further derive a heuristic approximation for the extinction probability based on times to fixation of single-resistant mutants. Sensitivity analyses reveal that strong reciprocal CS is required for this strategy to work, and we explore how increasing antibiotic doses and higher mutation rates modulate extinction in a nonmonotonic manner. Finally, we discuss how optimal switching periods depend on treatment duration. Our results provide quantitative design principles for in vitro and clinical sequential antibiotic therapies, underscoring the potential of CS-guided regimens to suppress resistance evolution and eradicate infections.</description>

      <title>Folding lattice proteins confined on minimal grids using a quantum-inspired encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Steric clashes pose a challenge when exploring dense protein systems using conventional explicit-chain methods. A minimal example is a single lattice protein confined on a minimal grid, with no free sites. Finding its minimum energy is a hard optimization problem, withsimilarities to scheduling problems. It can be recast as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem amenable to classical and quantum approaches. We show that this problem in its QUBO form can be swiftly and consistently solved for chain length 48, using either classical simulated annealing or hybrid quantum-classical annealing on a D-Wave system. In fact, the latter computations required about 10 seconds. We also test linear and quadratic programming methods, which work well for a lattice gas but struggle with chain constraints. All methods are benchmarked against exact results obtained from exhaustive structure enumeration, at a high computational cost.</description>

      <title>Inferring Optical Tissue Properties from Photoplethysmography using Hybrid Amortized Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Smart wearables enable continuous tracking of established biomarkers such as heart rate, heart rate variability, and blood oxygen saturation via photoplethysmography (PPG). Beyond these metrics, PPG waveforms contain richer physiological information, as recent deep learning (DL) studies demonstrate. However, DL models often rely on features with unclear physiological meaning, creating a tension between predictive power, clinical interpretability, and sensor design. We address this gap by introducing PPGen, a biophysical model that relates PPG signals to interpretable physiological and optical parameters. Building on PPGen, we propose hybrid amortized inference (HAI), enabling fast, robust, and scalable estimation of relevant physiological parameters from PPG signals while correcting for model misspecification. In extensive in-silico experiments, we show that HAI can accurately infer physiological parameters under diverse noise and sensor conditions. Our results illustrate a path toward PPG models that retain the fidelity needed for DL-based features while supporting clinical interpretation and informed hardware design.</description>

      <title>Imaging and controlling electron motion and chemical structural dynamics of biological system in real time and space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultrafast electron microscopy (UEM) has found widespread applications in physics, chemistry, and materials science, enabling real-space imaging of dynamics on ultrafast timescales. Recent advances have pushed the temporal resolution of UEM into the attosecond regime, enabling the attomicroscopy technique to directly visualize electron motion. In this work, we extend the capabilities of this powerful imaging tool to investigate ultrafast electron dynamics in a biological system by imaging and controlling light induced electronic and chemical changes in the conductive network of multicellular cable bacteria. Using electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), we first observed a laser induced increase in {\pi}-electron density, accompanied by spectral peak broadening and a blueshift features indicative of enhanced conductivity and structural modification. We also traced the effect of ultrafast laser pumping on bulk plasmon electron oscillations by monitoring changes in the plasmon like resonance peak. Additionally, we visualized laser induced chemical structural changes in cable bacteria in real space. The imaging results revealed carbon enrichment alongside a depletion of nitrogen and oxygen, highlighting the controllability of chemical dynamics. Moreover, time resolved EELS measurements further revealed a picosecond scale decay and recovery of both {\pi}-electron and plasmonic features, attributed to electron phonon coupling. In addition to shedding light on the mechanism of electron motion in cable bacteria, these findings demonstrate ultrafast modulation and switching of conductivity, underscoring their potential as bio-optoelectronic components operating on ultrafast timescales.</description>

      <title>Contact temporal network during motility induced phase separation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08642v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motility-induced phase separation (MIPS) is a paradigmatic non-equilibrium transition in active matter, determined by the P\'eclet number and packing fraction. We investigate the single-phase and phase-separated regimes of MIPS using a complex network approach, where networks are constructed from particle interactions over finite time windows. In the single-phase (gas-like) regime, the degree distributions $P(k)$ exhibit Gaussian behavior and resemble those of random graphs. Plotting the location and height of the $P(k)$ peak reveals a universal curve across different P\'eclet numbers at fixed packing fraction. In the phase-separated regime, we analyze the dense and dilute phases independently. The $P(k)$ distributions unveil distinct collective dynamics, including caging in the dense phase and the emergence of active solid-like structures at longer times. Clustering coefficients and average path lengths in both phases stabilize rapidly, indicating that short simulations are sufficient to capture essential network features. Overall, our results show that network metrics expose both universal and phase-specific aspects of active matter dynamics. Notably, we identify distinct and previously unreported topological structures arising in the dense and dilute phases within the MIPS regime.</description>

      <title>TopoSPAM: Topology grounded Simulation Platform for morphogenesis and biological Active Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24905v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a topology grounded, multiscale simulation platform for morphogenesis and biological active matter. Morphogenesis and biological active matter represent keystone problems in biology with additional, far-reaching implications across the biomedical sciences. Addressing these problems will require flexible, cross-scale models of tissue shape, development, and dysfunction that can be tuned to understand, model, and predict relevant individual cases. Current approaches to simulating anatomical or cellular subsystems tend to rely on static, assumed shapes. Meanwhile, the potential for topology to provide natural dimensionality reduction and organization of shape and dynamical outcomes is not fully exploited. TopoSPAM combines ease of use with powerful simulation algorithms and methodological advances, including active nematic gels, topological-defect-driven shape dynamics, and an active 3D vertex model of tissues. It is capable of determining emergent flows and shapes across scales.</description>

      <title>Renormalized mechanics and stochastic thermodynamics of growing vesicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24120v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Uncovering the rules governing the nonequilibrium dynamics of the membranes that define biological cells is of central importance to understanding the physics of living systems. We theoretically and computationally investigate the behavior of flexible quasispherical vesicles that exchange membrane constituents, internal volume, and heat with an external reservoir. The excess chemical potential and osmotic pressure difference imposed by the reservoir act as generalized thermodynamic driving forces that modulate vesicle morphology. We show that the renormalization of membrane mechanical properties by nonequilibrium driving gives rise to a morphological transition between a weakly driven regime, in which growing vesicles remain quasispherical, and a strongly driven regime, in which vesicles accommodate rapid membrane uptake by developing surface wrinkles. Additionally, we propose a minimal vesicle growth-shape law, derived using insights from stochastic thermodynamics, that robustly describes vesicle growth dynamics even in strongly driven, far-from-equilibrium regimes.</description>
