      <title>Quantitative analysis of vectorial torques in thin 3d Co ferromagnet using orbital-spin conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent findings in orbitronics pointed out large current-induced torques originating, in the current understanding, from incident orbital currents. These are generated by orbital Rashba-Edelstein effect (OREE) produced at the interface between some light metal and oxides films e.g. by naturally oxidized copper layer (Cu*). In the present work, by using second harmonic Hall techniques, we determine the ratio of orbital vs spin currents exerting torques on thin transition metals Co ferromagnet in systems using an orbit-to-spin Pt converter as interlayer with Cu*. Our results quantifying damping like torques show that both orbital and spin currents are enhanced in these systems. Moreover, the experimental determination of the decoherence length in a sample series with varying Co thickness clearly demonstrates the interfacial generation of the orbital currents in Cu* by Orbital Rashba-Edelstein effects (REE) leading to subsequent magnetic torque in Co over a typical lengthscale of several nanometers</description>

      <title>Simultaneous achievement of large anomalous Nernst effect and reduced thermal conductivity in sintered polycrystalline topological Heusler ferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study reports the observation of the large anomalous Nernst effect in polycrystalline ferromagnetic Co$_{2}$MnGa (CMG) slabs prepared by a spark plasma sintering method. By optimizing the sintering conditions, the anomalous Nernst coefficient reaches ~7.5 $\mu$V K$^{-1}$ at room temperature, comparable to the highest value reported in the single-crystalline CMG slabs. Owing to the sizable anomalous Nernst coefficient and reduced thermal conductivity, the dimensionless figure of merit in our optimized CMG slab shows the record-high value of ~8$\times$10$^{-4}$ at room temperature. With the aid of the nano/microstructure characterization and first-principles phonon calculation, this study discusses the dependence of the transport properties on the degree of crystalline ordering and morphology of crystal-domain boundaries in the sintered CMG slabs. The results reveal a potential of polycrystalline topological materials for transverse thermoelectric applications, enabling the construction of large-scale modules.</description>

      <title>Mapping the three-dimensional fermiology of the triangular lattice magnet EuAg$_4$Sb$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we report the temperature-field phase diagram as well as present a comprehensive study of the electronic structure and three-dimensional fermiology of the triangular-lattice magnet EuAg$_4$Sb$_2$, utilizing quantum oscillation measurements, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and first-principles calculations. The complex magnetic phase diagram of EuAg$_4$Sb$_2$ highlights many transitions through nontrivial AFM states. Shubnikov-de Haas and de Haas-van Alphen oscillations were observed in the polarized ferromagnetic state of EuAg$_4$Sb$_2$, revealing three pairs of distinct spin-split frequency branches with small effective masses. A comparison of the angle-dependent oscillation data with first-principles calculations in the ferromagnetic state and angle-resolved photoemission spectra shows good agreement, identifying tubular hole pockets and hourglass-shaped hole pockets at the Brillouin zone center, as well as diamond-shaped electron pockets at the zone boundary. As the temperature increases, the frequency branches of the tiny hourglass pockets evolve into a more cylindrical shape, while the larger pockets remain unchanged. This highlights that variations in exchange splitting, driven by changes in the magnetic moment, primarily impact the small Fermi pockets without significantly altering the overall band structure. This is consistent with first-principles calculations, which show minimal changes near the Fermi level across ferromagnetic and simple antiferromagnetic states or under varying on-site Coulomb repulsion.</description>

      <title>Giant topological Hall effect in epitaxial Ni$_{80}$Fe$_{20}$/La$_{0.65}$Sr$_{0.35}$MnO$_3$ thin film heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of new physical properties at the interfaces between complex oxides has always been of both fundamental and practical importance. Here, we report the observation of a giant topological Hall resistivity of $\sim 2.8 \mu \Omega$ \text{cm} at room temperature in an epitaxial thin-film heterostructure of permalloy (Py, Ni$_{80}$Fe$_{20}$) and the half-metallic ferromagnet La$_{0.65}$Sr$_{0.35}$MnO$_3$ (LSMO). This large magnitude of the topological Hall effect in the Py/LSMO heterostructure, compared to a single-layer Py thin film, is attributed to the optimized combination of ferromagnetism in LSMO and the strong spin-orbit-coupling-driven Rashba interaction at the interface. The introduction of a ferroelectric BaTiO$_3$ (BTO) sandwich layer in the Py/LSMO heterostructure also leads to an enhanced topological Hall resistivity compared to the single-layer Py thin film. Interestingly, magnetic force microscopy measurements reveal skyrmion-like features, suggesting the origin of the topological Hall effect. Our theoretical model calculations for the skyrmion lattice further indicate that the Rashba interaction, driven by the broken inversion symmetry in the Py/LSMO films, can account for the observed changes in the topological Hall effect at the interface. Our work opens the door for the potential use of Py/LSMO thin films in spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Room-Temperature Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect in Terbium monohalide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following the successful experimental realization of the long-sought Quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect in thin films of chromium-doped (Bi,Sb)$_2$Te$_3$, enhancing the work temperature of QAH effect has emerged as a significant and challenging task in condensed matter physics. In this work, we demonstrate monolayer TbCl as a promising candidate to realize the room temperature QAH effect. Based on density functional theory + HSE hybrid functional, we identify the topological properties with Hall conductivity $G = -e^2/h$ per layer in three-dimensional ferromagnetic insulator TbCl, which is weakly staked by the QAH layers. The monolayer TbCl inherits the magnetic and topological properties, and exhibits the QAH effect corresponding to the Chern number $C=-1$. The topological band gap is significantly large and reaches 42.8 meV, which is beyond room temperatue. Meanwhile, the magnetic study finds that the extended $5d$ electrons contribute to the magnetic momentum of Tb and lead to sizable exchange and superexchange interactions, resulting in a high Curie temperature $T_c \sim 457$K. All these features demonstrate that monolayer TbCl will provide an ideal platform to realize the room temperature QAH effect.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional ferroelectric crystal with temperature-invariant ultralow thermal conductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of temperature-invariant ultralow thermal conductivity ($\kappa$) in monolayer \bpinse, a two-dimensional ferroelectric crystal with in-plane polarization. Using a combination of generalized Wigner transport equation theory and machine-learning-assisted molecular dynamics simulations, we reveal that the balance between particle-like phonon propagating and wave-like tunneling transport mechanisms results in a propagating-tunneling-invariant (PTI) ultralow thermal conductivity of approximately 0.6 W/mK (comparable to that of glass) over a broad temperature range ($150&lt;T&lt;800$~K). This behavior stems from intrinsic strong lattice anharmonicity driven by ferroelectric dipolar fluctuations, eliminating the need for extrinsic structural modifications. In contrast, the \ainse~monolayer, which shares the same stoichiometry, exhibits a conventional temperature-dependent thermal conductivity, $\kappa (T) \propto T^{-1}$, typical of simple crystals. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the anharmonicity in \bpinse~can be precisely modulated by an external electric field, enabling on-demand control of thermal transport properties, including modifying the temperature scaling behavior of heat conductivity and achieving a large thermal switching ratio of $\approx$2.5. These findings provide fundamental insights into the interplay between field-tunable lattice anharmonicity, phonon dynamics, and thermal transport mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Triangular and dice quasicrystals modulated by generic 1D aperiodic sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method for generating hexagonal aperiodic tilings that are topologically equivalent to the triangular and dice lattices. This approach incorporates aperiodic sequences into the spacing between three sets of grids for the triangular lattice, resulting in "modulated triangular lattices". Subsequently, by replacing the triangles with rhombuses, parallelograms, or hexagons, modulated dice or honeycomb lattices are constructed. Using generalized Fibonacci, Thue-Morse, and tribonacci sequences, we demonstrate several examples of hexagonal aperiodic tilings. Structural analysis confirms that their diffraction patterns reflect the properties of the one-dimensional aperiodic sequences, namely pure point (Bragg peaks) or singular continuous. Our method establishes a general framework for constructing a broad range of hexagonal aperiodic systems, advancing aperiodic-crystal research into higher dimensions that were previously focused on one-dimensional aperiodic sequences.</description>

      <title>Transformations in Perovskite Photovoltaics: Film Formation, Processing Conditions, and Recovery Outlook</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Organometallic halide perovskites have garnered considerable attention in recent times due to their promising optoelectronic attributes, particularly within the realm of solar photovoltaics (PV). How perovskite films form is of utmost significance in shaping their structural and functional characteristics. In this context, the application of methylamine vapour during the precursor deposition and subsequent treatment during the film formation stages emerges as crucial for the development of high-quality perovskite films for solar cell applications. The utilization of methylamine vapour annealing is pivotal in improving the crystallinity, morphology, and overall integrity of perovskite films. This work investigates the characteristics of perovskite films based on methylamine lead iodide, focusing on aspects such as crystallographic structure and vibrational modes, which are directly linked to the performance of the devices. The maximum power conversion efficiencies (PCE) obtained are 19.5% and 18.6% using 1-step and 2-step processes are obtained. The effect of factors like trap states, film homogeneity, and interfaces on the device performance are explored through capacitance measurements, photoluminescence, and electroluminescence behaviour. The recombination behaviour of the perovskite films is correlated with the crystallographic properties. These findings provide valuable insights into the influence of different processing techniques, such as methylamine vapour treatment and vacuum annealing, on rejuvenating perovskite solar cells.</description>

      <title>Phase and sulfur vacancy engineering in cadmium sulfide for boosting hydrogen production from catalytic plastic waste photoconversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cadmium sulfide (CdS) is a well-known low-bandgap photocatalyst, but its efficiency is often hindered by rapid photo-generated carrier recombination and a limited number of active catalytic sites. To overcome these challenges, this study introduces an efficient CdS photocatalyst through a novel strategy combining metastable-to-stable phase transformation and sulfur vacancy generation. This strategy integrates hydrothermal treatment and a high-pressure process to create sulfur vacancies, which serve as active catalytic sites, within a thermodynamically stable wurtzite (hexagonal) phase known for its superior photocatalytic properties. The resulting CdS photocatalyst demonstrates exceptional performance in photoreforming for hydrogen production and the conversion of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic into valuable materials. Compared to commercial CdS catalysts, this new material shows a 23-fold increase in both hydrogen production and plastic degradation without the need for co-catalysts. Quenching experiments reveal that holes and hydroxyl radicals play crucial roles in the photoreforming process of this vacancy-rich CdS. First-principles calculations via density functional theory (DFT) indicate that the hexagonal phase possesses a lower bandgap and it exhibits further bandgap narrowing with the introduction of sulfur vacancies. These findings not only present an innovative approach to CdS processing but also highlight the critical role of sulfur vacancies as effective defects for the catalytic photoreforming of microplastics.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic properties of fcc lead: A scalar and fully relativistic first principle study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the thermodynamic properties of face-centered cubic lead (fcc-Pb) using ab-initio methods within the quasi-harmonic approximation (QHA), examining the influence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and the exchange-correlation functionals. Two types of ultrasoft pseudopotential (US-PP) are considered: one that excludes (scalar relativistic PP) and one that includes the SOC effects (fully relativistic PP). Further, for each PP, we test the performance of three popular exchange-correlation functionals: Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof generalized gradient approximation (PBE) (Perdew et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 77, 3865 (1996)), PBE modified for dense solids (PBEsol) (Perdew et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 136406 (2008)), and local density approximation (LDA) (Perdew et al. Phys. Rev. B 23, 5048 (1981)). We calculate the Helmholtz free energy, incorporating lattice vibrations (phonons) and electronic excitation contributions. The estimated equation of state (at 4 K and 301 K), phonon dispersions (at 100 K and 300 K), mode-Gr\"uneisen parameters ({\gamma}q{\eta}) (at 100 K), volume thermal expansion coefficient (\b{eta}), isobaric heat capacity (CP), bulk modulus (BS), and thermodynamic average Gr\"uneisen parameter ({\gamma}) are compared with the available experimental and theoretical studies. Moreover, the 0 K pressure-dependent elastic constant-coefficient (Cij) of fcc lead and Pugh ratio, Debye temperature, and longitudinal and transverse sound velocities for polycrystalline lead are presented. The contributions of electronic excitations in all the thermodynamic properties are found to be negligible. With increasing pressure, the role of spin-orbit effects decreases but does not vanish. Our findings demonstrate that SOC leads to results distinct from the SR approach, but agreement with the experiment is not consistently improved by including SOC.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-adapted closest Wannier modeling based on complete multipole basis set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have developed a method to construct a symmetry-adapted Wannier tight-binding model based on the closest Wannier formalism and the symmetry-adapted multipole theory. Since the symmetry properties of the closest Wannier functions are common to those of the original atomic orbitals, symmetry-adapted multipole basis (SAMB) can be defined as the complete orthonormal matrix basis set in the Hilbert space of the closest Wannier functions. Utilizing the completeness and orthonormality of SAMBs, the closest Wannier Hamiltonian can be expressed as a linear combination of SAMBs belonging to the identity irreducible representation, thereby fully restoring the symmetry of the system. Moreover, the linear coefficients of each SAMB (model parameters) related to crystalline electric fields, spin-orbit coupling, and electron hoppings are determined through simple matrix projection without any iterative procedure. Thus, this method allows us to unveil mutual interplay among hidden electronic multipole degrees of freedom in the Hamiltonian and numerically evaluate them. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by modeling monolayer graphene under a perpendicular electric field, highlighting its utility in symmetrizing the closest Wannier model, quantifying symmetry breaking, and predicting unusual responses. The method is implemented in the open-source Python library SymClosestWannier, with the codes available on GitHub (https://github.com/CMT-MU/SymClosestWannier).</description>

      <title>Simultaneous mapping of the ultrafast time and fluence dependence of the laser-induced insulator-to-metal transition in magnetite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pump-probe methods are a ubiquitous tool in the field of ultrafast dynamic measurements. In recent years, X-ray free-electron laser experiments have gained importance due to their ability to probe with high chemical selectivity and at atomic length scales. To obtain the complete dynamic information, measurements are typically repeated many thousands of times with varying delay and/or fluence settings. This generally necessitates that the sample fully recovers before the subsequent excitation and that probe pulses and the induced dynamic evolution are comparable to each other. These conditions present a significant challenge when the sample fluctuates between different initial states or when it is susceptible to damage. Also, source fluctuations are normally intrinsic to free-electron laser pulses. Here, we present a time-to-space mapping imaging scheme that enables us to record a delay range of several picoseconds as well as a laser fluence range of about one order of magnitude in every single shot of the x-ray probe. This approach can circumvent the aforementioned preconditions. We demonstrate the use of this scheme by mapping the femto- and picosecond dynamics of the optically induced insulator-to-metal Verwey transition in a magnetite thin film. We employ resonant diffraction at the free-electron laser FLASH for probing. The dynamics of the magnetite thin film are found to follow a biexponential decay in line with earlier studies on bulk crystals. By extrapolating our results towards the conditions found at X-ray free-electron lasers with higher energy, we demonstrate that the presented data could be recorded in a single shot.</description>

Abstract: Self-intercalated van der Waals magnets, characterized by self-intercalating native atoms into van der Waals layered structures with intrinsic magnetism, exhibit a variety of novel physical properties. Here, using first-principles calculations and Monte Carlo simulations, we report a self-intercalated van der Waals ferromagnet, Cr$_3$Ge$_2$Te$_6$, which has a high Curie temperature of 492 K. We find that Cr$_3$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ is nearly half-metallic with a spin polarization reaching up to 90.9%. Due to the ferromagnetism and strong spin-orbit coupling effect in Cr$_3$Ge$_2$Te$_6$, a large anomalous Hall conductivity of 138 $\Omega^{-1}$ cm$^{-1}$ and 305 $\Omega^{-1}$ cm$^{-1}$ can be realized when its magnetization is along its magnetic easy axis and hard axis, respectively. By doping electrons (holes) into Cr$_3$Ge$_2$Te$_6$, these anomalous Hall conductivities can be increased up to 318 $\Omega^{-1}$ cm$^{-1}$ (648 $\Omega^{-1}$ cm$^{-1}$). Interestingly, a 5-layer Cr$_3$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ thin film retains the room-temperature ferromagnetism with a higher spin polarization and larger anomalous Hall conductivity. Our work demonstrates that Cr$_3$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ is a novel room-temperature self-intercalated ferromagnet with high spin polarization and large anomalous Hall conductivity, offering great opportunities for designing nano-scale electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional deformations in single-layer $\alpha$ antimonene and interaction with a Au(111) surface from first principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using density functional theory, we investigate the electronic structure of the alpha phase of an antimony monolayer in its isolated form and in contact to the (111) surface of gold. We demonstrate that the isolated single-layer actually displays a slightly modulated puckering that stabilizes the monolayer, not a uniform one as often assumed. Moreover, it has dramatic consequences on the electronic band structure: the material is a semiconductor with low-dispersing bands near the Brillouin zone center. By further application of about 12% strain on the armchair direction, a double-cone features develops wherein an electronic bandgap of about 21~meV is found. When in contact with a Au(111) surface, a strong interaction with gold arises, as it appears clearly from (i) substantial atomic displacements compared to the isolated form, and (ii) hybridization of Sb and Au orbitals. The latter profoundly modifies the electronic band structure by strengthening the spin-orbit splitting of hybridized bands and spoiling the double-cone feature whose manipulation through substrate-induced strain appears therefore questionable, at least in the simulated epitaxial implementation.</description>

      <title>Dynamical response of noncollinear spin systems at constrained magnetic moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noncollinear magnets are notoriously difficult to describe within first-principles approaches based on density-functional theory (DFT) because of the presence of low-lying spin excitations. At the level of ground-state calculations, several methods exist to constrain the magnetic moments to a predetermined configuration, and thereby accelerate convergence towards self-consistency. Their use in a perturbative context, however, remains very limited. Here we present a general methodological framework to achieve parametric control over the local spin moments at the linear-response level. Our strategy builds on the concept of Legendre transform to switch between various flavors of magnetic functionals, and to relate their second derivatives via simple linear-algebra operations. Thereby, we can address an arbitrary response function at the time-dependent DFT level of theory with optimal accuracy and minimal computational effort. In the low frequency limit, we identify the leading correction to the existing adiabatic formulation of the problem [S. Ren \emph{et al.}, Phys. Rev. X {\bf 14}, 011041 (2024)], consisting in a renormalization of the phonon and magnon masses due to electron inertia. As a demonstration, we apply our methodology to the study of the THz optical response in bulk CrI$_3$, where we identify a hybrid electromagnon with mixed spin-lattice character.</description>

      <title>Absence of orbital current torque in Ta/ferromagnet bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has become a heated debate as to whether the orbital Hall effect of a material could generate a non-local orbital current and a non-zero spin-orbit torque on an adjacent magnetic layer. Here, we report unambiguous evidence that, regardless of the ferromagnets (FMs) (e.g., Ni, Ni81Fe19, Fe, Fe60Co20B20, and FePt), the spin-orbit torque generated by an adjacent Ta, which is predicted to have a 50 times greater positive orbital Hall conductivity than the negative spin Hall conductivity, has essentially the same, negative efficiency, in agreement with the spin Hall effect of Ta being the only source of the interfacial torque. We identify that the constant, positive estimate of the torque of the Ta/FM samples from spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance (ST-FMR) analysis in a specific FM thickness range (&gt;2 nm for Ni), that was heavily cited in the literature to signify an orbital current torque but strongly disagrees with the fairly long relaxation length in other orbital current torque claims, results from the overlook of a significant thick-dependent self-induced ST-FMR signal of the FM. These results indicate the absence of orbital current torque in Ta/ferromagnet systems, regardless of the type, the SOC strength, and the layer thickness of the ferromagnets.</description>

      <title>Linear and Nonlinear Edelstein Effects in Chiral Topological Semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, there has been growing interest in achieving on-demand control of magnetism through electrical and optical means. In this work, we provide first-principles predictions for the linear and nonlinear Edelstein effects (LEE and NLEE) in the chiral topological semimetal CoSi. The LEE and NLEE represent first- and second-order magnetic responses to external electric fields, enabling precise manipulation of magnetization via electrical and optical methods. We demonstrate that although both LEE and NLEE require time-reversal symmetry breaking, they can still be realized in non-magnetic materials, as time-reversal symmetry can be spontaneously broken by heat and dissipation, according to the second law of thermodynamics. Meanwhile, due to different inversion symmetry selection rules, the LEE and NLEE manifest opposite and identical signs in the two enantiomers of CoSi, respectively. We further quantify the magnitude of LEE and NLEE, showing that electrically or optically induced magnetization can reach 10 Bohr magneton per unit cell when the external electric field strength is comparable with the internal atomic electric field, which is on the order of 1 V/A. Our work offers a systematical approach for predicting the electrical and optical control of magnetism in real materials, paving the way for potential applications in areas such as spintronics and magnetic memories.</description>

      <title>Static Born charges and quantum capacitance in metals and doped semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Born dynamical charges ($\textbf{Z}^\text{dyn}$) play a key role in the lattice dynamics of most crystals, including both insulators and metals in the nonadiabatic ("clean") regime. Very recently, the so-called static Born charges, $\textbf{Z}^\text{stat}$, were introduced [G. Marchese, et al., Nat. Phys. $\mathbf{20}$, 88 (2024)] as a means to modeling the long-wavelength behavior of polar phonons in overdamped ("dirty") metals. Here we present a method to calculate $\textbf{Z}^\text{stat}$ directly at the zone center, by applying the $2n+1$ theorem to the long-wavelength expansion of the charge response to a phonon. Furthermore, we relate $\textbf{Z}^\text{stat}$ to the charge response to a uniform strain perturbation via an exact sum rule, where the quantum capacitance of the material plays a crucial role. We showcase our findings via extensive numerical tests on simple metals aluminum and copper, polar metal LiOsO$_3$, and doped semiconductor SrTiO$_3$. Based on our results, we critically discuss the physical significance of $\textbf{Z}^\text{stat}$ in light of their dependence on the choice of the electrostatic reference, and on the length scale that is assumed in the definition of the macroscopic potentials.</description>

      <title>Gold nanocone array with wide angles and high absorptivity for light absorber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gold nanocone array, fabricated with the ion track method, exhibits exceptionally high light absorptivity, making it a wide angle light absorber. The finite difference time domain (FDTD) method was employed to study the influence of the geometric parameters on total absorptivity and promote strategies to enhance the absorptivity of the gold nanocone array. Experimental measurements were concluded to assess the total absorption and bidirectional reflection distribution function (BRDF) properties of the gold nanocone array. The absorptivity measurement results demonstrate that the gold nanocone array exhibits a wide angle (5-75{\deg}) of incidence and high absorptivity properties, achieving an absorptivity over 0.98. The BRDF results show that the reflection of the gold nanocone array is predominantly attributed to non-specular reflections, and exhibits excellent Lambert properties. This study reveals the influence of structural parameters and light incidence angle on the absorptivity of the gold nanocone array, which plays an important role in further understanding the light absorption/reflection mechanism and enhancing the absorptivity.</description>

      <title>Low-Loss Superconducting Resonators Fabricated from Tantalum Films Grown at Room Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of $\alpha$-tantalum in superconducting circuits has enabled a considerable improvement of the coherence time of transmon qubits. The standard approach to grow $\alpha$-tantalum thin films on silicon involves heating the substrate, which takes several hours per deposition and prevents the integration of this material with wafers containing temperature-sensitive components. We report a detailed experimental study of an alternative growth method of $\alpha$-tantalum on silicon, which is achieved at room temperature through the use of a niobium seed layer. Despite a substantially higher density of oxygen-rich grain boundaries in the films sputtered at room temperature, resonators made from these films are found to have state-of-the-art quality factors, comparable to resonators fabricated from tantalum grown at high temperature. This finding challenges previous assumptions about correlations between material properties and microwave loss of superconducting thin films, and opens a new avenue for the integration of tantalum into fabrication flows with limited thermal budget.</description>

      <title>In-plane anisotropy of charge density wave fluctuations in 1$T$-TiSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report measurements of anisotropic triple-$q$ charge density wave (CDW) fluctuations in the transition metal dichalcogenide 1$T$-TiSe$_2$ over a large volume of reciprocal space with X-ray diffuse scattering. Above the transition temperature, $T_{\text{CDW}}$, the out-of-plane diffuse scattering is characterized by rod-like structures which indicate that the CDW fluctuations in neighboring layers are largely decoupled. In addition, the in-plane diffuse scattering is marked by ellipses which reveal that the in-plane fluctuations are anisotropic. Our analysis of the diffuse scattering line shapes and orientations suggests that the three charge density wave components contain independent phase fluctuations. At $T_{\text{CDW}}$, long range coherence is established in both the in-plane and out-of-plane directions, consistent with the large observed value of the CDW gap compared to $T_{\text{CDW}}$, and the predicted presence of a hierarchy of energy scales.</description>

      <title>Microwave scattering by rough polyhedral particles on a surface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electromagnetic (EM) scattering by non-symmetric wavelength-scale particles on a planar surface has numerous applications in the remote sensing of planetary bodies, both in planetary and geo-sciences. We conduct numerical simulations of EM scattering by rough polyhedral particles (with 12 or 20 faces) using the discrete-dipole approximation and contrast the results to that of spheres. The particles have permittivities corresponding to common minerals in the microwave regime ($\epsilon_r=4.7 + 0.016$i and $7.8 + 0.09$i), and a size-frequency distribution (SFD) consistent with the observed scattering properties (power law distribution of size parameters between 0.5 and 8 with an index from $-2.5$ to $-3.5$). The assumed substrate permittivity $2.4 + 0.012$i corresponds to a powdered regolith. We present what roles the particle roundness, permittivity, and SFD for a realistic range of parameters play in the EM scattering properties as a function of incidence angle with a focus on backscattering in microwave-remote-sensing applications. The particle roundness and SFD have a clearly observable effect on the polarimetric properties, while the role of permittivity is relatively minor (in the studied range). Among various backscattering observables, the circular polarization ratio is the least sensitive to the decrease of the upper boundary (down to a size parameter of 3) and the index of the SFD.</description>

      <title>Experimental realization of the ground state for the antiferromagnetic Ising model on a triangular lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The antiferromagnetic Ising model on a triangular lattice (AFIT) exemplifies the most classical frustration system, arising from its triangular geometry that prevents all interactions from being simultaneously satisfied. Understanding geometric frustration in AFIT is crucial for advancing our knowledge of materials science and complex phases of matter. Here, we present a simple platform to study AFIT by arranging cylindrical magnets in vertical cavities of a triangular lattice, where magnets can slide along the cavity axis and stabilize either at the bottom or at the top of the cavity, analogous to the bistability of the Ising spin. The strong interactions of the magnets and the unique growing process allow the frustrated behavior and its ground state configurations to be directly observed. Notably, we observe a curved stripe phase, which is exotic to the Ising model. An effective thermalization process is developed to minimize the interaction energy, facilitating the evolution of various magnetic states, thereby visually realizing the ground state antiferromagnetic Ising model. Theoretical simulations and machine learning are performed concurrently to reveal the ground state and its evolution under effective thermal fluctuations, which are remarkably consistent with experimental results. Our system provides a unique platform to study frustrated systems and pave the way for future explorations in complex geometries.</description>

      <title>Emergent scales and spatial correlations at the yielding transition of glassy materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Glassy materials yield under large external mechanical solicitations. Under oscillatory shear, yielding shows a well-known rheological fingerprint, common to samples with widely different microstructures. At the microscale, this corresponds to a transition between slow, solid-like dynamics and faster liquid-like dynamics, which can coexist at yielding in a finite range of strain amplitudes. Here, we capture this phenomenology in a lattice model with two main parameters: glassiness and disorder, describing the average coupling between adjacent lattice sites, and their variance, respectively. In absence of disorder, our model yields a law of correspondent states equivalent to trajectories on a cusp catastrophe manifold, a well-known class of problems including equilibrium liquid-vapour phase transitions. Introducing a finite disorder in our model entails a qualitative change, to a continuous and rounded transition, whose extent is controlled by the magnitude of the disorder. We show that a spatial correlation length $\xi$ emerges spontaneously from the coupling between disorder and bifurcating dynamics. With vanishing disorder, $\xi$ diverges and yielding becomes discontinuous, suggesting that the abruptness of yielding can be rationalized in terms of a lengthscale of dynamic heterogeneities.</description>

      <title>Surrogate-based multiscale analysis of experiments on thermoplastic composites under off-axis loading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a surrogate-based multiscale approach to model constant strain-rate and creep experiments on unidirectional thermoplastic composites under off-axis loading. In previous contributions, these experiments were modeled through a single-scale micromechanical simulation under the assumption of macroscopic homogeneity. Although efficient and accurate in many scenarios, simulations with low-off axis angles showed significant discrepancies with the experiments. It was hypothesized that the mismatch was caused by macroscopic inhomogeneity, which would require a multiscale approach to capture it. However, full-field multiscale simulations remain computationally prohibitive. To address this issue, we replace the micromodel with a Physically Recurrent Neural Network (PRNN), a surrogate model that combines data-driven components with embedded constitutive models to capture history-dependent behavior naturally. The explainability of the latent space of this network is also explored in a transfer learning strategy that requires no re-training. With the surrogate-based simulations, we confirm the hypothesis raised on the inhomogeneity of the macroscopic strain field and gain insights into the influence of adjustment of the experimental setup with oblique end-tabs. Results from the surrogate-based multiscale approach show better agreement with experiments than the single-scale micromechanical approach over a wide range of settings, although with limited accuracy on the creep experiments, where macroscopic test effects were implicitly taken into account in the material properties calibration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hubbard model is believed to capture the essential physics of cuprate superconductors. However, recent theoretical studies suggest that it fails to reproduce a robust and homogeneous superconducting ground state. Here, using resonant inelastic x-ray scattering and density matrix renormalization group calculations, we show that magnetic excitations in the prototypical cuprate ladder Sr$_{14}$Cu$_{24}$O$_{41}$ are inconsistent with those of a simple Hubbard model. The magnetic response of hole carriers, contributing to an emergent branch of spin excitations, is strongly suppressed. This effect is the consequence of d-wave-like pairing, enhanced by nearly an order of magnitude through a large nearest-neighbor attractive interaction. The similarity between cuprate ladders and the two-dimensional compounds suggests that such an enhanced hole pairing may be a universal feature of superconducting cuprates.</description>

      <title>Diffraction of Light from Optical Fourier Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffractive surfaces shape optical wavefronts for applications in spectroscopy, high-speed communication, and imaging. The performance of these structures is primarily determined by how precisely they can be patterned. Fabrication constraints commonly lead to square-shaped, "binary" profiles that contain unwanted spatial frequencies that contaminate the diffraction. Recently, "wavy" surfaces (known as optical Fourier surfaces, OFSs) have been introduced that include only the desired spatial frequencies. However, the optical performance and reliability of these structures have not yet been experimentally tested with respect to models and simulations. Such a quantitative investigation could also provide previously unobtainable information about the diffraction process from the most fundamental diffractive surfaces$\unicode{x2014}$sinusoidally pure profiles. Here, we produce and study two classes of reflective OFSs: (i) single-sinusoidal profiles of varying depth and (ii) double-sinusoidal profiles with varying relative phase. After refining our fabrication procedure to obtain larger and deeper OFSs at higher yields, we find that the measured optical responses from our OFSs agree quantitatively with full electrodynamic simulations. In contrast, our measurements diverge from analytical scalar diffraction models routinely used by researchers to describe diffraction. Overall, our results confirm that OFSs provide a precise and powerful platform for Fourier-spectrum engineering, satisfying the growing demand for intricately patterned interfaces for applications in holography, augmented reality, and optical computing.</description>

      <title>The dominant mechanisms for the formation of solute-rich clusters in low-Cu steels under irradiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.06828</link>
      <description>arXiv:1912.06828v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The formation of nano-sized, coherent, solute-rich clusters (NSRC) is known to be an important factor causing the degradation of the macroscopic properties of steels under irradiation. The mechanisms driving their formation are still debated. This work focuses on low-Cu reactor pressure vessel (RPV) steels, where solute species are generally not expected to precipitate. We rationalize the processes that take place at the nanometre scale under irradiation, relying on the latest theoretical and experimental evidence on atomic-level diffusion and transport processes. These are compiled in a new model, based on the object kinetic Monte Carlo (OKMC) technique. We evaluate the relevance of the underlying physical assumptions by applying the model to a large variety of irradiation experiments. Our model predictions are compared with new experimental data obtained with atom probe tomography and small angle neutron scattering, complemented with information from the literature. The results of this study reveal that the role of immobilized self-interstitial atoms (SIA) loops dominates the nucleation process of NSRC.</description>

      <title>Slip-dominated structural transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use molecular dynamics to show that plastic slip is a crucial component of the transformation mechanism of a square-to-triangular structural transition. The latter is a stylized analog of many other reconstructive phase transitions. To justify our conclusions we use a novel atomistically-informed mesoscopic representation of the field of lattice distortions in molecular dynamics simulations. Our approach reveals a hidden alternating slip distribution behind the seemingly homogeneous product phase which points to the fact that lattice invariant shears play a central role in this class of phase transformations. While the underlying pattern of anti-parallel displacements may be also interpreted as microscopic shuffling, its precise crystallographic nature strongly suggests the plasticity-centered interpretation.</description>

      <title>Higher order potential in the modified convective-viscous Cahn-Hilliard equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To describe highly heterogeneous systems using the Cahn-Hilliard equation, the standard form of the thermodynamic potential with a constant coefficient in the gradient term and a polynomial of the fourth degree may not be sufficient. The modification of the form of the thermodynamic potential with a polynomial of the sixth degree and the quadratic dependence of the coefficient at the gradient term is considered. Exact solutions in the form of a moving static wave and the conditions of their existence depending on the symmetry of the potential are obtained.</description>

      <title>Large Anomalous Hall Effect in a Noncoplanar Magnetic Heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07019v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The anomalous Hall effect (AHE) occurs in magnetic systems and also unexpectedly in non-magnetic materials adjacent to magnetic insulators via the heterointerface interactions. However, the AHE in heterostructures induced by magnetic proximity effect remains quite weak, restricting their practical device applications. Here, we report a large intrinsic AHE with a resistivity of 114 n{\Omega} cm at 5 K in noncoplanar magnetic heterostructures of Cr5Te6/Pt. This is the record-high AHE value among all the magnetic insulators/heavy metal heterostructures. A reversal of the AHE signal occurs due to the reconstruction of Berry curvature at the Fermi level, which is verified by the first-principles calculations. Topological spin textures at the interface are directly visualized via high-magnetic-field magnetic force microscopy, which accounts for the large AHE, as confirmed by the atomic simulations. These findings open a new avenue for exploring the large AHE in heterointerfaces and facilitate the potential applications in topological spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Dispersion Relations for Dislocation Modes and their Sensitivity to the Lattice Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.10587v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this letter we show that the dispersion relation for the dynamical modes of dislocations ("dislons") in solids is sensitive to the lattice symmetries. In particular, we show that in the IR, the dislon dispersion relation develops a logarithmic dependence on momenta for approximately isotropic lattices whereas for non-isotropic lattices, the linear term dominates. The renormalization group flows for dislocation tension are shown to be distinct for isotropic and anisotropic lattices.</description>

      <title>Compact computer controlled biaxial tensile device for low-temperature transport measurements of layered materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18336v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A biaxial tensile device for the transport study of layered materials is described. The device is mounted on the standard 24 pin zero force connector and can be moved between various setups. The compact design of the device makes it suitable for a wide range of studies. In our case, it is placed inside a 50 mm diameter chamber in the cryocooler and is used in the temperature range 9-310 K. A sample is glued in the center of a polyimide cruciform substrate, the ends of which are connected to a tension system driven by four computer-controlled stepper motors providing tensile force up to 30 N. Computer simulation results and their experimental verification show that tensile strain along one axis depends on the tensile load along the perpendicular direction, and this dependence turns out to be relatively strong and exceeds 40\%. The operation of the device is demonstrated by studying the effect of deformation on the electrical conductivity of the layered compound 2H-NbS2.</description>

      <title>Defect bound states in the continuum of bilayer electronic materials without symmetry protection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16844v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze a class of bound defect states in the continuum electronic spectrum of bilayer materials, which emerge independent of symmetry protection or additional degrees of freedom. Taking graphene as a prototypical example, our comparative analysis of AA- and AB-stacked bilayer graphene demonstrates that these states originate from the intrinsic algebraic structure of the tight-binding Hamiltonian when trigonal warping is neglected rather than any underlying symmetry. Inclusion of trigonal warping and higher-order hoppings broaden the bound states into long-lived resonances. This discovery provides a pathway to previously unexplored approaches in defect and band-structure engineering. We conclude with a proposed protocol for observing these states in scanning tunneling microscopy experiments.</description>

      <title>Thermophotovoltaic performance metrics and techno-economics: efficiency vs. power density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00940v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thermophotovoltaics (TPV) are a promising new approach for converting heat to electricity. Their performance is primarily characterized by two metrics: efficiency and power density. While recent works have shown high efficiency, it is important to understand how both of these metrics impact the techno-economics of a TPV system as efforts to commercialize the technology advance. In this work, we develop the first unification of efficiency and power density into a single techno-economic metric based on the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE). We find that the LCOE can be broken into two parts: heating cost, including infrastructure and inputs for providing heat to the TPV cells, and cell cost, the capital cost of the TPV cells. We show that systems with high heating costs should prioritize TPV efficiency, while systems with high cell costs should prioritize power density. We then develop a model to identify the most impactful cell properties in improving the important performance metric and reducing system LCOE. Namely, improving spectral control with increased back-surface reflectance is the most effective to reduce LCOE in systems with high infrastructural costs, while increasing the view factor and reducing front-surface reflectance are most critical in systems with high TPV cell cost. Improving just one or two of these properties can reduce the LCOE by 25-75%, reaching competitive values ~ 8 cents/kWh-e, less than the average cost of electricity in the US. This study thus elucidates which TPV performance metric is more important for system technoeconomics and how to maximize it.</description>

      <title>Normal liquid $^3$He studied by Path Integral Monte Carlo with a parametrized partition function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the energy per particle of normal liquid ${}^3$He in the temperature range $0.15-2$ K using Path Integral Monte Carlo simulations, leveraging a recently proposed method to overcome the sign problem -- a long-standing challenge in many-body fermionic simulations. This approach is based on introducing a parameter $\xi$ into the partition function, which allows a generalization from bosons ($\xi=1$) to fermions ($\xi=-1$). By simulating systems with $\xi \geq 0$, where the sign problem is absent, one can then extrapolate to the fermionic case at $\xi = -1$. Guided by an independent particle model that uncovers non-analytic behavior due to the superfluid transition, which is moderated by finite-size effects, we develop a tailored extrapolation strategy for liquid ${}^3$He that departs from the extrapolation schemes shown to be accurate in those cases were quantum degeneracy effects are weak, and enables accurate results in the presence of Bose-Einstein Condensation and superfluidity for $\xi &gt; 0$. Our approach extends the previously proposed framework and yields energy per particle values in good agreement with experimental data.</description>
