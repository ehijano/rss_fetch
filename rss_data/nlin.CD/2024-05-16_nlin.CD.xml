      <title>Quantum Dynamics in Krylov Space: Methods and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of quantum systems unfolds within a subspace of the state space or operator space, known as the Krylov space. This review presents the use of Krylov subspace methods to provide a compact and computationally efficient description of quantum evolution, with emphasis on nonequilibrium phenomena of many-body systems with a large Hilbert space. It provides a comprehensive update of recent developments, focused on the quantum evolution of operators in the Heisenberg picture as well as pure and mixed states. It further explores the notion of Krylov complexity and associated metrics as tools for quantifying operator growth, their bounds by generalized quantum speed limits, the universal operator growth hypothesis, and its relation to quantum chaos, scrambling, and generalized coherent states. A comparison of several generalizations of the Krylov construction for open quantum systems is presented. A closing discussion addresses the application of Krylov subspace methods in quantum field theory, holography, integrability, quantum control, and quantum computing, as well as current open problems.</description>

      <title>Near-horizon chaos beyond Einstein gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate chaos in the dynamics of outgoing massless particles near the horizon of static spherically symmetric (SSS) black holes in two well-motivated models of $f(R)$ gravity. In both these models, we probe chaos in the particle trajectories (under suitable harmonic confinement) in the vicinity of the black hole horizons, for a set of initial conditions. The particle trajectories, associated Poincar$\acute{e}$ sections, and Lyapunov exponents clearly illustrate the role played by the black hole horizon in the growth of chaos within a specific energy range. We demonstrate how this energy range is controlled by the parameters of the modified gravity theory under consideration. The growth of chaos in such a classical setting is known to respect a surface gravity bound arising from universal aspects of particle dynamics close to the black hole horizon [K. Hashimoto and N. Tanahashi, Phys. Rev. D 95, 024007 (2017)], analogous to the quantum MSS bound [J. Maldacena, S.H. Shenker and D. Stanford, JHEP 08 (2016) 106]. Interestingly, both models studied in our work respect the bound, in contrast to some of the other models of $f(R)$ gravity in the existing literature. The work serves as a motivation to use chaos as an additional tool to probe Einstein gravity in the strong gravity regime in the vicinity of black hole horizons.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Predicting Subsequent Steps in H\'enon Map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the prediction of subsequent steps in H\'enon Map using various machine learning techniques. The H\'enon map, well known for its chaotic behaviour, finds applications in various fields including cryptography, image encryption, and pattern recognition. Machine learning methods, particularly deep learning, are increasingly essential for understanding and predicting chaotic phenomena. This study evaluates the performance of different machine learning models including Random Forest, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Feed Forward Neural Networks (FNN) in predicting the evolution of the H\'enon map. Results indicate that LSTM network demonstrate superior predictive accuracy, particularly in extreme event prediction. Furthermore, a comparison between LSTM and FNN models reveals the LSTM's advantage, especially for longer prediction horizons and larger datasets. This research underscores the significance of machine learning in elucidating chaotic dynamics and highlights the importance of model selection and dataset size in forecasting subsequent steps in chaotic systems.</description>

      <title>Wake-induced response of vibro-impacting systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.04284v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stability and bifurcation behaviour of a wake-induced vibro-impacting oscillator is studied. The effects of a discontinuity on the stability of the structure while it is undergoing phase-locked motions due to the surrounding fluid-structure interactions (FSI) are examined. The primary structure and the near wake dynamics are modelled as a harmonic oscillator and a Van der Pol oscillator, respectively, and are weakly coupled to each other via acceleration coupling. Qualitative changes in the dynamical behaviour of this system are investigated in the context of discontinuity-induced bifurcations (DIBs) that result from the interaction of fluid flow and non-smoothness from the primary structure. Phenomenological behaviours like the co-existence of attractors and period-adding cascades of limit cycles separated by chaotic orbits are observed. The existence of these phenomena is demonstrated via stability analysis using Floquet theory and the associated Lyapunov spectra. In addition, the behaviour of orbits in the local neighbourhood of the barrier is defined using a higher-order transverse discontinuity map. This mapping is implemented to obtain the respective Lyapunov exponents. Solutions obtained using this modified algorithm are demonstrated to accurately predict both stable and chaotic regimes, as observed from the corresponding bifurcation diagrams.</description>

      <title>Reduced Dimensional Monte Carlo Method: Preliminary Integrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A technique for reducing the number of integrals in a Monte Carlo calculation is introduced. For integrations relying on classical or mean-field trajectories with local weighting functions, it is possible to integrate analytically at least half of the integration variables prior to setting up the particular Monte Carlo calculation of interest, in some cases more. Proper accounting of invariant phase space structures shows the system's dynamics is reducible into composite stable and unstable degrees of freedom. Stable degrees of freedom behave locally in the reduced dimensional phase space exactly as an analogous integrable system would. Classification of the unstable degrees of freedom is dependent upon the degree of chaos present in the dynamics. The techniques for deriving the requisite canonical coordinate transformations are developed and shown to block diagonalize the stability matrix into irreducible parts. In doing so, it is demonstrated how to reduce the amount of sampling directions necessary in a Monte Carlo simulation. The technique is illustrated by calculating return probabilities and expectation values for different dynamical regimes of a two-degree-of-freedom coupled quartic oscillator within a classical Wigner method framework.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Interplay of Intrinsic Fluctuation and Complexity in Intracellular Calcium Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09386v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The concentration of intracellular calcium ion (Ca$^{2+}$) exhibits complex oscillations, including bursting and chaos, as observed experimentally. These dynamics are influenced by inherent fluctuations within cells, which serve as crucial determinants in cellular decision-making processes and fate determination. In this study, we systematically explore the interplay between intrinsic fluctuation and the complexity of intracellular cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ dynamics using complexity measures such as permutation entropy (PE) and statistical complexity (SC). Using the chemical Langevin equation, we simulate the stochastic dynamics of cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$. Our findings reveal that PE and SC effectively characterize the diverse, dynamic states of cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ and illustrate their interactions with intrinsic fluctuation. PE analysis elucidates that the chaotic state is more sensitive to intrinsic fluctuation than the other periodic states. Furthermore, we identify distinct states of cytosolic Ca$^{2+}$ occupying specific locations within the theoretical bounds of the complexity-entropy causality plane. These locations indicate varying complexity and information content as intrinsic fluctuation varies. When adjusting the permutation order, the SC for the different states exhibits peaks in an intermediate range of intrinsic fluctuation values. Additionally, we identify scale-free or self-similar patterns in this intermediate range, which are further corroborated by multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis. These high-complexity states likely correspond to optimal Ca$^{2+}$ dynamics with biological significance, revealing rich and complex dynamics shaped by the interplay of intrinsic fluctuation and complexity. Our investigation enhances our understanding of how intrinsic fluctuation modulates the complexity of intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ dynamics that play crucial roles in biological cells.</description>
