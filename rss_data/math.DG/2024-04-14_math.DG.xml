      <title>On the covariant coefficients of geodesic sprays on Finsler manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a Finsler metric $F$, we introduce the notion of $F$-covariant coefficients $H_i$ of the geodesic spray of $F$ (Def. 3.1). We study some geometric consequences concerning the objects $H_i$. If the $F$-covariant coefficients $H_i$ are written in the form $H_i={\dot{\partial}}_iH$, for some smooth function $H$ on ${\mathcal T\hspace{-1pt}M}$, positively 3-homogeneous in y, then $H$ is called spray scalar or simply $S$-scalar. We prove that if the $S$-scalar exists, then it is of the form $H=\frac{1}{12}\,y^i\partial_iF^2$ and this expression is unique up to a function of position only. We prove also that on a Finsler maifold $(M,F)$, the $S$-scalar $H$ exists if and only if $(M,F)$ is dually flat. Generally, the $n^3$ functions $H^h_{ij}$ resulting from the $F$-covariant coefficients do not form a linear connection. We find out that in the case of projectively flat metrics, the $n^3$ functions $H^h_{ij}$ are coefficients of a linear connection. We introduce two new special Finsler spaces, namely, the $H$-Berwald and the $H$-Landsberg spaces and show that every $H$-Berwald metric is $H$-Landsbergian but the converse is not necessarily true. Also, we study the $F$-covariant coefficients $H_i$ of projectivly flat and dually flat spherically symmetric Finsler metrics and provide a solution of the "$H$-unicorn" Landsberg problem. Finally, we give some examples of $H$-Berwald and $H$-Landsberg metrics and an example of $H$-Landsberg metric which is not $H$-Berwaldian.</description>

      <title>New four-vertex type theorems for spherical polygons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove discrete analogs of four-vertex type theorems of spherical curves, which imply corresponding results for space polygons. The smooth theory goes back to the work of Beniamino Segre and, more recently, by Mohammad Ghomi, and consists of theorems that state, for a given closed spherical curve, nontrivial lower bounds on the number of spherical inflections plus the number of self and/or antipodal intersections counted with multiplicity. We study these concepts and results adapted to the case of spherical polygons and prove, using only discrete tools, the corresponding theorems.</description>

      <title>A classification of constant Gaussian curvature surfaces in the three-dimensional hyperbolic space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weakly complete constant Gaussian curvature $-1&lt;K&lt;0$ surfaces will be classified in terms of holomorphic quadratic differentials. For this purpose, we will first establish a loop group method for constant Gaussian curvature surfaces in $\mathbb H^3$ with $K&gt;-1$ but $K \neq 0$ by using harmonicities of Lagrangian and Legendrian Gauss maps. Then we will show that a spectral parameter deformation of the Lagrangian harmonic Gauss map gives a harmonic map into $\mathbb H^2$ for $-1&lt; K&lt;0$ or $\mathbb S^2$ for $K&gt;0$, respectively.</description>

      <title>On some relations between the Perimeter, the Area and the Visual Angle of a Convex Set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish some relations between the perimeter, the area and the visual angle of a planar compact convex set. Our first result states that Crofton's formula is the unique universal formula relating the visual angle, length and area. After that we give a characterization of convex sets of constant width by means of the behaviour of its isotopic sets at infinity. Also for this class of convex sets we prove that the existence of an isotopic circle is enough to ensure that the considered set is a disc.</description>

      <title>On weak inverse mean curvature flow and Minkowski-type inequalities in hyperbolic space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that a proper weak solution $\{ \Omega_{t} \}_{0 \leq t &lt; \infty}$ to inverse mean curvature flow in $\mathbb{H}^{n}$, $3\leq n \leq 7$, is smooth and star-shaped by the time
  \begin{equation*}
  T= (n-1) \log \left( \frac{\text{sinh} \left( r_{+} \right)}{ \text{sinh} \left( r_{-} \right)} \right), \end{equation*} where $r_{+}$ and $r_{-}$ are the geodesic out-radius and in-radius of the initial domain $\Omega_{0}$. The argument is inspired by the Alexandrov reflection method for extrinsic curvature flows in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ due to Chow-Gulliver and uses a result of Li-Wei.
  As applications, we extend the Minkowski inequalities of Brendle-Hung-Wang and De Lima-Girao to outer-minimizing domains $\Omega_{0} \subset \mathbb{H}^{n}$ in these dimensions. From this, we also extend the asymptotically hyperbolic Riemannian Penrose inequality to balanced asymptotically hyperbolic graphs over the exteriors of outer-minimizing domains of $\mathbb{H}^{n}$, $3 \leq n \leq 7$.</description>

      <title>Complete K\"ahler manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider complete K\"ahler manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature. The main results are: 1. When the manifold has nonnegative bisectional curvature, we show that $\lim\limits_{r\to\infty}\frac{r^{2}}{vol(B(p, r))}\int_{B(p, r)}S$ exists. In other words, it depends only on the manifold. This solves a question of Ni. Also, we establish estimates among volume growth ratio, integral of scalar curvature, and the degree of polynomial growth holomorphic functions. The new point is that the estimates are sharp for any prescribed volume growth rate. 2. We discover a strong rigidity for complete Ricci flat K\"ahler metrics. Let $M^n (n\geq 2)$ be a complete K\"ahler manifold with nonnegative Ricci curvature and Euclidean volume growth. Assume either the curvature has quadratic decay, or the K\"ahler metric is $dd^c$-exact with quadratic decay of scalar curvature. If one tangent cone at infinity is Ricci flat, then $M$ is Ricci flat. In particular, the tangent cone is unique. In other words, we can test Ricci flatness of the manifold by checking one single tangent cone. This seems unexpected, since apriori, there is no equation on $M$ and the Bishop-Gromov volume comparison is not sharp on Ricci flat (nonflat) manifolds. Such result is in sharp contrast to the Riemannian setting: Colding and Naber showed that tangent cones are quite flexible when $Ric\geq 0$ and $|Rm|r^2&lt;C$. This reveals subtle differences between Riemannian case and K\"ahler case. The result contains lots of examples, such as all noncompact Ricci flat K\"ahler surfaces of Euclidean volume growth (hyper-K\"ahler ALE 4-manifolds classified by Kronheimer), higher dimensional examples of Tian-Yau type, as well as an example with irregular cross section. It also covers Ricci flat K\"ahler metrics of Euclidean volume growth on Stein manifolds with $b_2 = 0$(e.g., $\mathbb{C}^n$).</description>

Abstract: We establish three circles theorems for subharmonic functions on Riemannian manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature, as well as on gradient shrinking Ricci solitons with scalar curvature bounded from below by $\frac{n-2}{2}$. We also establish a three circiles theorem for holomorphic functions on gradient shrinking K\"{a}hler-Ricci solitons with some curvature conditions. As applications, we prove some Liouville type theorems.</description>

      <title>Harmonic Riemannian submersions between Riemannian symmetric spaces of noncompact type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct harmonic Riemannian submersions that are retractions from symmetric spaces of noncompact type onto their rank-one totally geodesic subspaces. Among the consequences, we prove the existence of a non-constant, globally defined complex-valued harmonic morphism from the Riemannian symmetric space associated to a split real semisimple Lie group. This completes an affirmative proof of a conjecture of Gudmundsson.</description>

Abstract: Let $X$ be a compact normal complex space, $L$ be a big holomorphic line bundle on $X$ and $h$ be a continuous Hermitian metric on $L$. We consider the spaces of holomorphic sections $H^0(X, L^{\otimes p})$ endowed with the inner product induced by $h^{\otimes p}$ and a volume form on $X$, and prove that the corresponding sequence of normalized Fubini-Study currents converge weakly to the curvature current $c_1(L,h_{\mathrm{eq}})$ of the equilibrium metric $h_{\mathrm{eq}}$ associated to $h$. We also show that the normalized currents of integration along the zero divisors of random sequences of holomorphic sections converge almost surely to $c_1(L,h_{\mathrm{eq}})$, for very general classes of probability measures on $H^0(X, L^{\otimes p})$.</description>

      <title>The twisted G$_2$ equation for strong G$_2$-structures with torsion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.07128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss general properties of strong G$_2$-structures with torsion and we investigate the twisted G$_2$ equation, which represents the G$_2$-analogue of the twisted Calabi-Yau equation for SU$(n)$-structures introduced by Garcia-Fern\'andez - Rubio - Shahbazi - Tipler. In particular, we show that invariant strong G$_2$-structures with torsion do not occur on compact non-flat solvmanifolds. This implies the non-existence of non-trivial solutions to the twisted Calabi-Yau equation on compact solvmanifolds of dimensions $4$ and $6$. More generally, we prove that a compact, connected homogeneous space admitting invariant strong G$_2$-structures with torsion is diffeomorphic either to $S^3 \times T^4$ or to $S^3 \times S^3 \times S^1$, up to a covering, and that in both cases solutions to the twisted G$_2$ equation exist. Finally, we discuss the behavior of the homogeneous Laplacian coflow for strong G$_2$-structures with torsion on these spaces.</description>

      <title>A Weierstrass representation formula for discrete harmonic surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.08537v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A discrete harmonic surface is a trivalent graph which satisfies the balancing condition in the $3$-dimensional Euclidean space and achieves energy minimizing under local deformations. Given a topological trivalent graph, a holomorphic function, and an associated discrete holomorphic quadratic form, a version of the Weierstrass representation formula for discrete harmonic surfaces in the $3$-dimensional Euclidean space is proposed. By using the formula, a smooth converging sequence of discrete harmonic surfaces is constructed, and its limit is a classical minimal surface defined with the same holomorphic data. As an application, we have a discrete approximation of the Enneper surface.</description>

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to study almost rigidity properties of super Ricci flow whose Muller quantity is non-negative. We conclude almost splitting and quantitative stratification theorems that have been established by Bamler for Ricci flow. As a byproduct, we obtain an almost constancy for a certain integral quantity concerning scalar curvature at an almost selfsimilar point, which is new even for Ricci flow.</description>

Abstract: A fundamental goal of geometry of submanifolds is to find fascinating and significant classical examples. In this paper, depending on the theory we established in [5], along with the approach we provided for constructing constant $p$-mean curvature surfaces, we found some interesting examples of constant $p$-mean curvature surfaces. In particular, we give a complete description for rotationally invariant surfaces of constant $p$-mean curvature, including the geometric meaning of the energy $E$ (1.6}.</description>

Abstract: We prove that divergent, extended geometrically finite (in the sense of Weisman arXiv:2205.07183) representations can be interpreted as restricted Anosov (in the sense of Tholozan--Wang arXiv:2307.02934) representations over certain flow spaces. We also show that the representations of this type are stable under small type preserving deformations. As an example, we show that a representation induced from a geometrically finite one through a Galois covering, constructed in Tholozan--Wang arXiv:2307.02934, is divergent and extended geometrically finite with a non-homeomorphic boundary extension.</description>

      <title>Sharp systolic inequalities for invariant tight contact forms on principal S1-bundles over S2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The systole of a contact form $\alpha$ is defined as the shortest period of closed Reeb orbits of $\alpha$. Given a non-trivial $\mathbb S^1$-principal bundle over $\mathbb S^2$ with total space $M$, we prove a sharp systolic inequality for the class of tight contact form on $M$ invariant under the $\mathbb S^1$-action. This inequality exhibits a behavior which depends on the Euler class of the bundle in a subtle way. As applications, we prove a sharp systolic inequality for rotationally symmetric Finsler metrics on $\mathbb S^2$, a systolic inequality for the shortest contractible closed Reeb orbit, and a particular case of a conjecture by Viterbo.</description>
