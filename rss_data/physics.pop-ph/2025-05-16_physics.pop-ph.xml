      <title>Discovery of entanglement generation by elastic collision to realise the original Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen thought experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The amazing quantum effect of `entanglement' was discovered in the 1935 thought experiment by Albert Einstein, Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen (`EPR'). The ensuing research opened up fundamental questions and led to experiments that proved that quantum theory cannot be completed by local hidden variables. Remarkably, EPR did not discuss how to create the entanglement in their thought experiment. Here I add this part. What is required in the original EPR thought experiment is a simple elastic particle collision, an unbalanced mass ratio of e.g. 1:3 and initial states that are position and momentum squeezed, respectively. In the limiting case of infinite squeeze factors, the measurement of the position or momentum of one particle allows an absolutely precise conclusion to be drawn about the value of the same quantity of the other particle. The EPR idea has never been tested in this way. I outline a way to do this.</description>

      <title>Can a Referendum Solve Problems of Shared Sovereignty on Mars?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Space exploration technology continues to expand humanity's reach beyond Earth, and even more ambitious efforts are striving to establish long-duration human settlements on Mars. The dependence of martian settlers on life-support infrastructure and on resupply missions from the host nation could create conditions for tyranny or lead to other extreme and uncontrollable situations, but such risks could be reduced by thinking about the possibilities for effective decision making on Mars before any settlement efforts actually occur. This paper examines the extent to which referendums could be used on Mars as a means of political decision-making and sovereignty adjudication. Our approach draws on three terrestrial case studies -- the Great Idaho Movement in the United States, the Catalan Independence Movement in Spain, and the Quebec Independence Movement in Canada -- as potential analogs for Mars governance. We recommend advance determination of the conditions under which a martian referendum would be recognized as a best practice for any agency seeking to establish a long-duration settlement on Mars. We suggest that referendums can reduce the likelihood of multiple authoritative political entities existing on Mars, which could provide a more procedural approach toward resolving governance issues between Earth and Mars. However, if Mars settlement is successful in establishing settlements on the scale of cities or larger, then other uniquely martian tools may evolve as a supplement or replacement to referendums.</description>
