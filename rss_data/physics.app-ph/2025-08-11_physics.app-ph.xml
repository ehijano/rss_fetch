      <title>A Physics-Augmented Machine Learning Constitutive Model for Damage in Solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a data-driven constitutive framework for anisotropic damage mechanics based on the second-order damage tensor approach for both compressible and incompressible materials. The formulation is thermodynamically consistent and satisfies the Clausius-Duhem inequality. The strain energy density potentials are expressed as isotropic functions of the right Cauchy-Green deformation tensor, along with structural tensors that encode anisotropy either present in the virgin material or resulting from damage. To guarantee the polyconvexity condition, non-decreasing convex neural networks with inputs that ensure polyconvexity are used to parameterize the strain energy density potentials. The model vanishes in the undeformed state, fulfilling the normality condition. In contrast to classical [1-d] damage models, the expressiveness of the new data-driven model is enhanced by employing a family of nonlinear, convex, decreasing functions to capture the effect of damage. Damage evolution is governed through a damage potential, where the corresponding threshold is defined in terms of the damage conjugate forces. As a special case of the general formulation, a new anisotropic generic format is introduced to predict constitutive responses under damage-induced anisotropy in initially isotropic materials. To reduce the computational burden during training, a decoupled training scheme is introduced, and its accuracy is demonstrated in all numerical examples. These include benchmarks for incompressible isotropic, transversely isotropic, and compressible orthotropic materials. The framework is also validated against experimental data capturing anisotropic Mullins-type damage.</description>

      <title>A device-level compact model for mushroom-type phase change memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we introduce a compact model for mushroom-type phase-change memory devices that incorporates the shape and size of the amorphous mark under different programming conditions, and is applicable to both projecting and non-projecting devices. The model includes analytical equations for the amorphous and crystalline regions and uniquely features a current leakage path that injects current at the outer edge of the electrodes. The results demonstrate that accurately modeling the size and shape of the phase configurations is crucial for predicting the full-span of the RESET and SET programming, including the characteristics of threshold switching. Additionally, the model effectively captures read-out behaviors, including the dependence of resistance drift and bipolar current asymmetry behaviours on the phase configurations. The compact model is also provided in Verilog-A format, so it can be easily used in standard circuit-level simulation tools.</description>

      <title>Low-dimensional magnetocaloric materials for energy-efficient magnetic refrigeration: Does size matter?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetocaloric effect (MCE) provides a promising foundation for the development of solid-state refrigeration technologies that could replace conventional gas compression-based cooling systems. Current research efforts primarily focus on identifying cost-effective magnetic materials that exhibit large MCEs under low magnetic fields across broad temperature ranges, thereby enhancing cooling efficiency. However, practical implementation of magnetic refrigeration requires more than bulk materials; real-world devices demand efficient thermal management and compact, scalable architectures, often achieved through laminate designs or miniaturized geometries. Magnetocaloric materials with reduced dimensionality, such as ribbons, thin films, microwires, and nanostructures, offer distinct advantages, including improved heat exchange, mechanical flexibility, and integration potential. Despite these benefits, a comprehensive understanding of how size, geometry, interfacial effects, strain, and surface phenomena influence the MCE remains limited. This review aims to address these knowledge gaps and provide guidance for the rational design and engineering of magnetocaloric materials tailored for high-performance, energy-efficient magnetic refrigeration systems.</description>

      <title>Topological edge states and amplitude-dependent delocalization in quasiperiodic elliptically geared lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a class of mechanical lattices based on elliptical gears with quasiperiodic modulation and geometric nonlinearity, capable of exhibiting topologically protected modes and amplitude-driven transitions. Starting from a one-dimensional chain of modulated elliptical gears, we demonstrate the emergence of localized edge states arising from quasiperiodic variation in the gears' moments of inertia, analogous to the topological edge modes of the Aubry-Andre-Harper model. Under increasing excitation amplitude, the system undergoes a nonlinear transition, where edge localization breaks down and energy delocalizes into the bulk. By coupling multiple such chains with varying modulation phase, we construct a two-dimensional lattice in which the phase acts as a synthetic dimension. This structure supports topological wave propagation along the synthetic dimension. Nonlinearity again induces a breakdown of topological states, leading to complex, amplitude-dependent wave propagation. We further propose a numerical continuation approach to analyzing the periodic orbits and their linear stability, effectively discovering the boundary of the basin of bounded motion and detecting the occurrence of delocalization under certain excitation amplitudes. Our results reveal that elliptical geared systems offer a passive, amplitude-dependent platform for exploring topological phenomena and synthetic dimensionality in mechanical metamaterials.</description>

      <title>4D operando X-ray nano-holo-tomography reveals multiscale chemomechanics in Silicon-Graphite anode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linking electrode microstructure to electrochemical performance is essential for optimizing Li-ion batteries. However, this requires mechanistic 4D observations at ultimate spatio-temporal scales, which remains elusive. Here we demonstrate the use of operando synchrotron X-ray nano-holo-tomography combined with Digital Volume Correlation to track chemomechanical dynamics at both particle (local) and electrode (averaged) scales. Quantitative scale-bridging image analysis is applied to a high-capacity silicon-graphite anode during its formation cycle. Our findings reveal that local diffusion properties, graphite particle morphology and position in the electrode, distance to silicon clusters, surface contact with electrolyte and mechanical deformations, all have a direct impact on the local electrochemical activity and irreversibility - but these parameters are not equally important. Particularly, we identify fast diffusion channels that play a key role and counterbalance intrinsic depth-dependent reaction heterogeneities due to ionic/electronic diffusion limitations. The various structural factors that determine Gr-Si battery performance beyond ensemble properties are classified using a scale of influence, providing a practical framework for the optimization of materials and electrode manufacturing.</description>

      <title>Modeling Optical Key Distribution over a Satellite-to-Ground Link Under Weak Atmospheric Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we analyze the secret key capacity of intensity modulation/direct detection optical key distribution (IM/DD OKD) for a free-space optical (FSO) link between a low-Earth orbit satellite and an optical ground station. Focusing on downlink communication, we account for atmospheric turbulence, which causes random variations in the transmittance of the FSO channel. We implement an atmospheric channel model that accounts for absorption and scattering, geometric losses, pointing errors, and intensity fluctuations. The secret key capacity is quantified under different noise scenarios and reconciliation code efficiencies, assuming a hard decoding scheme. The performance of the IM/DD OKD protocol is compared under direct and reverse reconciliation regimes. Additionally, we examine the impact of weak and strong wind on the strength of atmospheric turbulence, leading to different results of the secret key capacity. Furthermore, we analyze the characteristics of error distributions that arise from protocol optimization. Our results provide insights into optimizing IM/DD OKD protocols for varying atmospheric conditions.</description>

      <title>Efficient high-quality photon pair generation in modal phase-matched thin-film lithium niobate micro-ring resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient generation of high-quality photon pairs is essential for modern quantum technologies. Micro-ring resonator is an ideal platform for studying on-chip photon sources due to strong nonlinear effect, resonant-enhanced optical fields, and high integration. Thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) micro-ring resonators with periodically poled quasi-phase matching have shown high-quality photon pair generation. However, periodic poling technology remains expensive and requires complex fabrication hindering its scalability and capability for practical application in nonlinear photonic devices. To address this, we propose a scalable approach using TFLN micro-ring resonators based on modal phase matching to achieve cost-effective, efficient high-quality photon-pair generation, significantly simplifying fabrication. We achieved pair generation rates up to 40.2 MHz/mW through spontaneous parametric down-conversion, with coincidence-to-accidental ratios exceeding 1200. By combining micro-ring resonance enhancement with modal phase matching, our approach reduces device size and fabrication cost while maintaining high nonlinear efficiency. These results advance the development of compact, efficient on-chip photon sources for next-generation nonlinear and quantum photonic applications.</description>

      <title>Scalable High-Temperature Superconducting Diodes in Intrinsic Josephson Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting diodes, characterized by nonreciprocal supercurrent transport, offer transformative opportunities for ultra-low-power circuits. However, achieving reliable operation at temperatures above liquid nitrogen remains a major challenge, limiting their practical applicability. Here, we present a scalable strategy for high-temperature superconducting diodes based on intrinsic Josephson junctions naturally present in a cuprate superconductor. We demonstrate that strong nonreciprocity arises not only from broken spatial and time-reversal symmetries, but also from enhanced anharmonicity in the current-phase relation, enabled by the atomically thin barrier of the intrinsic junction. The diode efficiency strongly depends on the number of stacked intrinsic junctions, with the highest efficiency occurring in single-junction devices. Notably, these high-temperature superconducting diodes are readily scalable to large arrays, marking a critical step toward practical implementation in energy-efficient computing architectures.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneously integrated lithium tantalate-on-silicon nitride modulators for high-speed communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Driven by the prospects of higher bandwidths for optical interconnects, integrated modulators involving materials beyond those available in silicon manufacturing increasingly rely on the Pockels effect. For instance, wafer-scale bonding of lithium niobate films onto ultralow loss silicon nitride photonic integrated circuits provides heterogeneous integrated devices with low modulation voltages operating at higher speeds than silicon photonics. However, in spite of its excellent electro-optic modulation capabilities, lithium niobate suffers from drawbacks such as birefringence and long-term bias instability. Among other available electro-optic materials, lithium tantalate can overcome these shortcomings with its comparable electro-optic coefficient, significantly improved photostability, low birefringence, higher optical damage threshold, and enhanced DC bias stability. Here, we demonstrate wafer-scale heterogeneous integration of lithium tantalate films on low-loss silicon nitride photonic integrated circuits. With this hybrid platform, we implement modulators that combine the ultralow optical loss ($\sim$ 14.2 dB/m), mature processing and wide transparency of silicon nitride waveguides with the ultrafast electro-optic response of thin-film lithium tantalate. The resulting devices achieve a 6 V half-wave voltage, and support modulation bandwidths of up to 100 GHz. We use single intensity modulators and in-phase/quadrature (IQ) modulators to transmit PAM4 and 16-QAM signals reaching up to 333 and 581 Gbit/second net data rates, respectively. Our results demonstrate that lithium tantalate is a viable approach to broadband photonics sustaining extended optical propagation, which can uniquely contribute to technologies such as RF photonics, interconnects, and analog signal processors.</description>

      <title>Scanning Acoustic Microscopy for Quantifying Bubble Evolution in Alkaline Water Electrolyzers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Improved understanding of gas/liquid transport in electrochemical gas-evolving systems is increasingly demanded for optimizing device performance. However, high-resolution measurement techniques for in-situ imaging remain limited. This work demonstrates the use of volumetric scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM) for quantifying hydrogen bubble evolution in porous nickel electrodes in a customized alkaline water electrolysis cell. By using high-frequency focused ultrasound, SAM enables volumetric imaging with high spatial resolution in the range of tens of micrometers. This allows the distribution of gas bubbles within the complex 3D architecture of porous electrodes to be resolved. Digital image processing methods are used to segment and quantify the gas content in the electrode. Thus, non-destructive SAM imaging is demonstrated to be an accessible and scalable analytical tool for the quantitative investigation of bubble evolution in operando electrochemical environments. Here, a solid foundation is established for future studies aimed at optimizing bubble dynamics and cell design under practically relevant operating conditions, ultimately contributing to higher electrolysis efficiencies.</description>

      <title>Leaky Mode Generation by means of All-Metal Corrugated Slotted Parallel-Plate Waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04229v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Periodic leaky-wave antennas can be realized with planar low-profile structures supporting the generation of highly directional beams with frequency scanning from backward to forward directions. We propose a method to generate leaky modes with continuous scanning with an all-metal periodic 2-D (i.e., invariant along a direction normal to the propagation) waveguide. Periodic corrugations are introduced to support a slow wave, which is transformed with periodic slots etched on the top plate into a fast radiating waves. Suitable choices of the corrugation and the slot periods lead to a single fast backward-forward spatial harmonic being responsible for well-defined and directional radiation. This new method is demonstrated here proposing an original unit cell, properly optimized to suppress the open stop band. The analysis and the design is accomplished with a rigorous in house periodic method-of-moment code, allowing for the computation of complex modes in open 2-D waveguides. The leaky-wave antenna is studied and validated by means of full-wave simulations in Ka band. The structure features continuous beam scanning with broadside radiation at 29.7 GHz with beam scanning, realized gain, and efficiency comparable to different antenna technologies having thickness ten times larger.</description>

      <title>Stimulated Raman Spectroscopy with Tunable Visible Broadband Probe Pulse Generated by Kerr-Instability Amplification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19080v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Femtosecond, broadband stimulated Raman spectroscopy is a popular approach to measuring molecular dynamics with excellent signal-to-noise and spectral resolution. We present a new method for broadband stimulated Raman spectroscopy that employs Kerr-instability amplification to amplify the supercontinuum spectrum from sapphire and create a highly tunable Raman probe spectrum spanning from 530 to 1000 nm (-6000 to 2800 cm^(-1)). Our method, called Kerr-instability amplification for broadband stimulated Raman spectroscopy (KAB-SRS) provides an alternative to optical parametric amplifiers by producing a broader and more tunable spectrum at a significantly reduced cost to OPA implementations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of KAB-SRS by measuring the stimulated Raman loss spectrum of 1-decanol.</description>
