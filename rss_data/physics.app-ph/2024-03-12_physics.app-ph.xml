      <title>A New Homogenization-Free Boundary Condition Towards Aperiodic Metasurface Design Using Full-Wave Surrogate Models of Printed Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new homogenization-free boundary condition is introduced for the design of metasurfaces. The boundary condition, linking the tangential electric field to the induced surface current density within a unit cell, is described as a matrix equation containing a surrogate model of a printed circuit. Full-wave simulations are performed to construct the data needed to capture the physics of a printed circuits response to exciting fields in terms of its induced current density. The matrix equation takes the form of a boundary condition which can be included in design and optimization algorithms incorporating mutual coupling in the form of an impedance matrix. Modelling the metasurface in this manner allows for direct design of the realizable model avoiding any homogenization or locally periodic approximations leading to a paradigm shift in metasurface design approaches. The surrogate models construction is described and its use in a 50 printed circuit example is provided.</description>

      <title>New Directions for Thermoelectrics: A Roadmap from High-Throughput Materials Discovery to Advanced Device Manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermoelectric materials, which can convert waste heat into electricity or act as solid-state Peltier coolers, are emerging as key technologies to address global energy shortages and environmental sustainability. However, discovering materials with high thermoelectric conversion efficiency is a complex and slow process. The emerging field of high-throughput material discovery demonstrates its potential to accelerate the development of new thermoelectric materials combining high efficiency and low cost. The synergistic integration of high-throughput material processing and characterization techniques with machine learning algorithms can form an efficient closed-loop process to generate and analyze broad data sets to discover new thermoelectric materials with unprecedented performances. Meanwhile, the recent development of advanced manufacturing methods provides exciting opportunities to realize scalable, low-cost, and energy-efficient fabrication of thermoelectric devices. This review provides an overview of recent advances in discovering thermoelectric materials using high-throughput methods, including processing, characterization, and screening. Advanced manufacturing methods of thermoelectric devices are also introduced to realize the broad impacts of thermoelectric materials in power generation and solid-state cooling. In the end, this paper also discusses the future research prospects and directions.</description>

      <title>Synchronization-based lossless non-reciprocal scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Breaking the reciprocity of wave propagation is a problem of fundamental interest, and a mucht-sought functionality in practical applications, both in photonics and phononics. Although it has been achieved using resonant linear scattering from cavities with broken time-reversal symmetry, such realizations have remained inescapably plagued by inherent passivity constraints, which make absorption losses unavoidable, leading to stringent limitations in transmitted power. In this work, we solve this problem by converting the cavity resonance into a limit cycle, exploiting the uncharted interplay between non-linearity, gain, and non-reciprocity. Remarkably, strong enough incident waves can synchronize with these self-sustained oscillations and use their energy for amplification. We theoretically and experimentally demonstrate that this mechanism can simultaneously enhance non-reciprocity and compensate absorption. Real-world acoustic scattering experiments allow us to observe perfect non-reciprocal transmission of audible sound in a synchronisation-based 3-port circulator with full immunity against losses.</description>

      <title>Giant Nonreciprocity of Surface Acoustic Waves induced by a positive-negative magnetostrictive heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lack of nonreciprocity is one of the major drawbacks of solid-state acoustic devices, which has hindered the development of microwave-frequency acoustic isolators and circulators. Here we report giant nonreciprocal transmission of shear-horizontal surface acoustic waves (SH-SAWs) on a LiTaO3 substrate coated with a negative-positive magnetostrictive bilayer structure of Ni/Ti/FeCoSiB. Although the static magnetic moments of two layers are parallel, SH-SAWs can excite optical-mode spin waves much stronger than acoustic-mode ones at relatively low frequencies via magnetoelastic coupling. The measured magnitude nonreciprocity exceeds 40 dB (or 80 dB/mm) at 2.333 GHz. In addition, maximum nonreciprocal phase accumulation reaches 188{\deg} (376{\deg}/mm), which is desired for an effective SAW circulator. Our theoretical model and calculations provide an insight into the observed phenomena and demonstrate a pathway for further improvement of nonreciprocal acoustic devices.</description>

Abstract: In this work we study the self-heating (1) effect (SHE) in nanoscale Silicon on Insulator Junctionless (SOI JL) FinFET transistor with fi cross section in rectangular, trapeze and triangle form. The lattice temperature dependence on the channel length as well as on buried oxide thickness is considered. It is shown that for considered transistor structure the lattice temperature in the middle of the channel is lower than at lateral sides, near source and drain. Also, we have found at the same conditions the lattice temperature depends on shape of channel cross section too</description>

      <title>Magnetic vortex polarity reversal induced gyrotropic motion spectrum splitting in a ferromagnetic disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the gyrotropic motion of the magnetic vortex core in a chain of a few micron-sized Permalloy disks by electrical resistance measurement with amplitude-modulated magnetic field. We observe a distinctive splitting of the resistance peak due to the resonant vortex-core motion under heightened radio frequency (RF) magnetic field excitation. Our micromagnetic simulation identifies the splitting of the resonant peak as an outcome of vortex polarity reversal under substantial RF amplitudes. This study enhances our understanding of nonlinear magnetic vortex dynamics amidst large RF amplitudes and proposes a potential pathway for spintronic neural computing thanks to their unique and controllable magnetization dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrated photonic network-on-chip (NoC) fabrics can provide multiple terabits per second (Tbps) bandwidth for high-performance computing servers supporting the latest artificial intelligence. To maximize the utility of the photonic hardware, these optical networks can multiplex data streams in multi-dimensional channels encoded in optical wavelengths, modes, and polarization states. A generic photonic platform that can be reconfigured to implement functionalities in those dimensions is highly desirable to streamline the design and manufacturing of integrated photonic networks. Here, we demonstrate a multi-functional photonic device using phase-change material Sb2Se3 that can be reconfigured from a wavelength-division demultiplexer to a mode-division demultiplexer. The reconfiguration is achieved by direct laser writing of phase patterns optimized with the inverse design technique. The demonstrated programmable phase-change photonic devices hold immense promise for a wide range of photonic applications requiring adaptable functionalities, including on-chip and in-package optical interconnects, optical signal processing, photonic tensor cores, and future optical computing for artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>Spin Waves and Spin Currents in Magnon-Phonon Composite Resonator Induced by Acoustic Waves of Various Polarizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present the results of a systematic experimental study of linear and parametric spin wave resonant excitation accompanied by spin currents (spin pumping) in a multifrequency composite bulk acoustic wave resonator with a ZnO-YIG-GGG-YIG/Pt structure. The features of magnetic dynamics excitation in YIG films due to magnetoelastic coupling with acoustic thickness modes of various polarizations are studied. Acoustic spin waves and spin pumping are detected by simultaneous frequency-field mapping of the inverse spin Hall effect voltage and the resonant frequencies of thickness extensional modes. In the parametric range of frequencies and fields, acoustic spin pumping induced by both shear and longitudinal polarization modes was observed. Linear acoustic spin waves are excited only by shear thickness extensional modes because longitudinal acoustic waves do not couple with the magnetic subsystem in linear regime.</description>

      <title>Active Control of Bound States in the Continuum in Toroidal Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The remarkable properties of toroidal metasurfaces, featuring ultrahigh-Q bound states in the continuum (BIC) resonances and nonradiating anapole modes, have garnered significant attention. The active manipulation of toroidal resonance characteristics offers substantial potential for advancing tunable metasurfaces. Our study specifically explores the application of vanadium dioxide, a widely used phase change material in active photonics and room-temperature bolometric detectors, to control BIC resonances in toroidal metasurfaces. The phase change transition of vanadium dioxide occurs in a narrow temperature range providing a large variation in material resistivity. Through heating thin film patches of vanadium dioxide integrated into a metasurface comprising gold split-ring resonators on a sapphire substrate, we achieve remarkable control over the amplitude and frequency of toroidal dipole BIC resonances due to their high sensitivity to losses present in the system. Breaking the symmetry of meta-atoms reveals enhanced tunability. The predicted maximum change in the amplitude of toroidal dipole BIC resonances reaches 14 dB with a temperature variation of approximately 10oC. The proposed tunable metasurface holds promise for various applications, including active photonic systems and room temperature bolometers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The properties of dielectric and piezoelectric oxides are determined by their processing history, crystal structure, chemical composition, microstructure, dopants (or defect) distribution, and defect kinetics. These materials are essential in a diverse range of applications including aerospace, medical, military, transportation, power engineering, and communication, where they are used as ceramic discs, thick and thin films, multilayer devices, etc. Significant advances in understanding the materials, processing, properties, and reliability of these materials have led to their widespread use in consumer electronics, military, and aerospace applications. This review delves into electrical degradation in dielectrics and piezoelectrics, focusing on defect chemistry and key characterization techniques. It also provides a detailed discussion of various spectroscopic, microscopic, and electronic characterization techniques essential for analyzing defects and degradation mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Suppression of flux jumps in high-$J_c$ Nb$_3$Sn conductors by ferromagnetic layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flux jumps observed in high-$J_c$ Nb$_3$Sn conductors are urgent problems to construct high field superconducting magnets. The low-field instabilities usually reduce the current-carrying capability and thus cause the premature quench of Nb$_3$Sn coils at low magnetic field. In this paper, we explore suppressing the flux jumps by ferromagnetic (FM) layer. Firstly, we experimentally and theoretically investigate the flux jumps of Nb$_3$Sn/FM hybrid wires exposed to a magnetic field loop with constant sweeping rate. Comparing with bare Nb$_3$Sn and Nb$_3$Sn/Cu wires, we reveal two underlying mechanisms that the suppression of flux jumps is mainly attributed to the thermal effect of FM layer for the case of lower sweeping rate, whereas both thermal and electromagnetic effects play a crucial role for the case of higher sweeping rate. Furthermore, we explore the flux jumps of Nb$_3$Sn/FM hybrid wires exposed to AC magnetic fields with amplitude $B_{a0}$ and frequency $\rm\omega$. We build up the phase diagrams of flux jumps in the plane $\rm\omega$-$B_{a0}$ for bare Nb$_{3}$Sn wire, Nb$_{3}$Sn/Cu wire and Nb$_{3}$Sn/FM wire, respectively. We stress that the region of flux jumps of Nb$_{3}$Sn/FM wire is much smaller than the other two wires, which indicates that the Nb$_{3}$Sn/FM wire has significant advantage over merely increasing the heat capacity. The findings shed light on suppression of the flux jumps by utilizing FM materials, which is useful for developing new type of high-$J_c$ Nb$_{3}$Sn conductors.</description>

      <title>Designing a K-state P-bit Engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Probabilistic bit (p-bit)-based compute engines utilize the unique capability of a p-bit to probabilistically switch between two states to solve computationally challenging problems. However, when solving problems that require more than two states (e.g., problems such as Max-3-Cut, verifying if a graph is K-partite (K&gt;2) etc.), additional pre-processing steps such as graph reduction are required to make the problem compatible with a two-state p-bit platform. Moreover, this not only increases the problem size by entailing the use of auxiliary variables but can also degrade the solution quality. In this work, we develop a unique framework for implementing a K-state (K&gt;2) p-bit engine. Furthermore, from an implementation standpoint, we show that such a K-state p-bit engine can be implemented using N traditional (2-state) p-bits, and one multi-state p-bit -- a novel concept proposed here. Augmenting traditional p-bit platforms, our approach enables us to solve an archetypal combinatoric problem class requiring multiple states, namely Max-K-Cut (K=3, 4 shown here), without using any additional auxiliary variables. Thus, our work fundamentally advances the functional capability of p-bit engines, enabling them to solve a broader class of computationally challenging problems more efficiently.</description>

      <title>Comparison between InAs-based and GaSb-based Interband cascade lasers with hybrid superlattice plasmon-enhanced claddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compare InAs-based and GaSb-based interband cascade lasers (ICLs) with the same 12 stages active region designed to emit at a wavelength of 4.6 {\mu}m. They employ a hybrid cladding architecture with the same geometry and inner claddings consisting of InAs/AlSb superlattices but different outer claddings: The InAs-based ICL employs plasmon enhanced n-type doped InAs layers while the GaSb-based ICL employs plasmon-enhanced n-type doped InAs_0.915 Sb_0.085 claddings lattice matched to GaSb. Due to the lower refractive index of n+-InAsSb (n=2.88) compared to n+-InAs (n=3.10), the GaSb-based ICL shows a 3.8 % higher optical mode confinement in the active region compared to the InAs-based ICL. Experimentally, the GaSb-based ICL shows a 17.3 % lower threshold current density in pulsed operation at room temperature. Also presented is the influence of geometry and doping variation on confinement factors and calculated free carrier absorption losses in the GaSb-based ICL.</description>

      <title>HiRA-Pro: High resolution alignment of multimodal spatio-temporal data: a process physics driven approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present HiRA-Pro, a novel procedure to align, at high spatio-temporal resolutions, multimodal signals from real-world processes and systems that exhibit diverse transient, nonlinear stochastic dynamics, such as manufacturing machines. It is based on discerning and synchronizing the process signatures of salient kinematic and dynamic events in these disparate signals. HiRA-Pro addresses the challenge of aligning data with sub-millisecond phenomena, where traditional timestamp, external trigger, or clock-based alignment methods fall short. The effectiveness of HiRA-Pro is demonstrated in a smart manufacturing context, where it aligns data from 13+ channels acquired during 3D-printing and milling operations on an Optomec-LENS MTS 500 hybrid machine. The aligned data is then voxelized to generate 0.25 second aligned data chunks that correspond to physical voxels on the produced part. The superiority of HiRA-Pro is further showcased through case studies in additive manufacturing, demonstrating improved machine learning-based predictive performance due to precise multimodal data alignment. Specifically, testing classification accuracies improved by almost 35% with the application of HiRA-Pro, even with limited data, allowing for precise localization of artifacts. The paper also provides a comprehensive discussion on the proposed method, its applications, and comparative qualitative analysis with a few other alignment methods. HiRA-Pro achieves temporal-spatial resolutions of 10-1000 us and 100 um in order to generate datasets that register with physical voxels on the 3D-printed and milled part. These resolutions are at least an order of magnitude finer than the existing alignment methods that employ individual timestamps, statistical correlations, or common clocks, which achieve precision of hundreds of milliseconds.</description>

      <title>Surface lattice resonance lasers with epitaxial InP gain medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surface lattice resonance (SLR) lasers, where gain is supplied by a thin film active material and the feedback comes from multiple scattering by plasmonic nanoparticles, have shown both low threshold lasing and tunability of the angular and spectral emission. However, typically used materials such as organic dyes and QD films suffer from photo-degradation which hampers practical applications. Here, we demonstrate photo-stable single-mode lasing of SLR modes sustained in an epitaxial solid-state InP slab waveguide. The nanoparticle array is weakly coupled to the optical modes, which decreases the scattering losses and hence the experimental lasing threshold is as low as 90 $\mu$J/cm$^{2}$. The nanoparticle periodicity defines the lasing wavelength and enables tuneable emission wavelengths over a 70 nm spectral range. Combining plasmonic nanoparticles with an epitaxial solid-state gain medium paves the way for large-area on-chip integrated SLR lasers for applications including optical communication, optical computing, sensing, and LiDAR.</description>

Abstract: Magnon frequency comb provides opportunities for exploring magnon nonlinear effects and measuring the transmission magnon frequency in magnets, whose controllability becomes vital for modulating the operating frequency and improving the measurement accuracy. Nevertheless, such controllable frequency comb remains to be explored. In this work, we investigate theoretically and numerically the skyrmion-induced magnon frequency comb effect generated by interaction between the magnon excitation mode and skyrmion breathing mode in synthetic ferrimagnets. It is revealed that both the skyrmion breathing mode and the magnon frequency gap closely depend on the net angular momentum {\delta}s, emphasizing the pivotal role of {\delta}s as an effective control parameter in governing the comb teeth. With the increase of {\delta}s, the skyrmion size decreases, which results in the enlargement of the breathing frequency and the distance between the comb teeth. Moreover, the dependences of the magnon frequency gap on {\delta}s and the inter-layer coupling allow one to modulate the comb lowest coherent frequency via structural control. Consequently, the coherent modes generated by the comb may range from gigahertz to terahertz frequencies, serving as a bridge between microwave and terahertz waves. Thus, this work represents a substantial advance in understanding the magnon frequency comb effect in ferrimagnets.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of the Environmental Stability of Perovskite Thin Films via PMMA and AZ5214-Photoresist Coatings</title>

Abstract: We introduce a pioneering strategy to enhance the environmental stability of perovskite thin films, a critical step forward in advancing their application in optoelectronics. Through the innovative application of matrix encapsulation techniques, we focus on the stabilization of methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) and methylammonium lead bromide (MAPbBr3) films. These films are meticulously prepared via a two-step solution deposition method under controlled ambient conditions. Our approach involves the application of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and AZ5214 photoresist layers through spin-coating, aimed at singularly encapsulating the perovskite films. This encapsulation acts as a robust hydrophobic barrier, significantly mitigating moisture ingress and simultaneously addressing the challenge of pinhole presence within the perovskite structure. Through a series of detailed characterizations-spanning scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy-we demonstrate that, despite the thicker nature of the AZ5214 photoresist compared to the PMMA layer, it exhibits markedly enhanced stability. Notably, the integrity and optical properties of the perovskite films are preserved for extended periods of up to 960 hours under environmental exposure. This breakthrough highlights the superior performance of AZ5214 photoresist over PMMA in prolonging the operational life of perovskite thin films, thereby offering a promising avenue for their deployment in a wide range of optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Gain-Loss-Induced Bipolar Non-Hermitian Skin Effect With Purely Imaginary Eigenenergies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05039v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study one-dimensional non-Hermitian lattices characterized by $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric gain and loss, where the real-gap transforms into an imaginary-gap with increasing strength of gain/loss. The energy spectrum, under open boundary conditions, consists of real eigenenergies in the presence of $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry, and the corresponding eigenstates are bulk modes. As the gain/loss is increased, $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry breaks, leading to an increase in the proportion of imaginary eigenenergies and the appearance of bipolar Non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE). Notably, the NHSE depending on the sign of their imaginary energy components. For Im$(E_{OBC})&gt;(&lt;)0$, the eigenstates localize at the right (left) boundary. These findings not only affirm the validity of our theoretical framework but also showcase the capability of engineered circuit systems to replicate intricate non-Hermitian phenomena. Our study unveils the unique characteristics of gain/loss-induced bipolar NHSE, shedding light on the exotic properties of non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional angular deviation and diffraction efficiency of a grating in Littrow-configuration ECDL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01079v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider in this paper the angular deviation and diffraction efficiency of the reflection gratings in Littrow-configuration for applications of external cavity diode laser using the rigorous coupled-wave analysis method. We consider the three-dimensional diffraction case in general, where the incidence plane is un-parallel with the grating vector, i.e. conical diffraction. The angular tolerance of arbitrary gratings under plane and conical diffraction are thus derived and presented. A typical blazed grating is chosen as an example to calculate its diffraction efficiency using the rigorous coupled-wave analysis method. Furthermore, we point out that the angular tolerance and reflection efficiency can be improved if the appropriate parameter settings are selected for Littrow-configuration devices, including incidence angle, diffraction order, grating period and blazed angle. Otherwise, a tiny slanting angle of the grating vector deviated from the incidence plane will deviate the feedback light away from entering the laser-diode-chip and halt laser oscillation in the external cavity. Finally, a general rule for the parameter settings in Littrow-configuration is provided as a benchmark.</description>

      <title>Elasto-Inertial Instability in Torsional Flows of Shear-Thinning Viscoelastic Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12050v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well known that inertia-free shearing flows of a viscoelastic fluid with curved streamlines, such as the torsional flow between a rotating cone and plate, or the flow in a Taylor-Couette geometry, can become unstable to a three-dimensional time-dependent instability at conditions exceeding a critical Weissenberg (Wi) number. However, the combined effects of fluid elasticity, shear thinning, and finite inertia (as quantified by the Reynolds number Re) on the onset of elasto-inertial instabilities are not fully understood. Using a set of cone-plate geometries, we experimentally explore the entire Wi - Re phase space for a series of rate-dependent viscoelastic fluids (quantified using a shear thinning parameter $\beta_P$). We tune $\beta_P$ by varying the polymer concentration in solutions. This progressively reduces shear-thinning but leads to finite inertial effects before the onset of elastic instability, thus naturally resulting in elasto-inertial coupling. Transient rheometric measurements and flow visualization experiments allow us to investigate the effects of flow geometry and document the combined effects of varying Wi, Re, and $\beta_P$ on the emergence of secondary motions at the onset of instability. The resulting critical state diagram quantitatively depicts the competition between the stabilizing effects of shear thinning and the destabilizing effects of inertia. We extend the curved streamline instability criterion of Pakdel and McKinley 1996 for the onset of purely elastic instability in curvilinear geometries by using scaling arguments to incorporate shear thinning and finite inertial effects. The augmented condition facilitates predictions of the onset of instability over a broader range of flow conditions, thus bridging the gap between purely elastic and elasto-inertial curved streamline instabilities.</description>

      <title>Engineering synthetic gauge fields through the coupling phases in cavity magnonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04915v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cavity magnonics, which studies the interaction of light with magnetic systems in a cavity, is a promising platform for quantum transducers, quantum memories, and devices with non-reciprocal behaviour. At microwave frequencies, the coupling between a cavity photon and a magnon, the quasi-particle of a spin wave excitation, is a consequence of the Zeeman interaction between the cavity's magnetic field and the magnet's macroscopic spin. For each photon/magnon interaction, a coupling phase factor exists, but is often neglected in simple systems. However, in "loop-coupled" systems, where there are at least as many couplings as modes, the coupling phases become relevant for the physics and lead to synthetic gauge fields. We present experimental evidence of the existence of such coupling phases by considering two spheres made of Yttrium-Iron-Garnet and two different re-entrant cavities. We predict numerically the values of the coupling phases, and we find good agreement between theory and the experimental data. Theses results show that in cavity magnonics, one can engineer synthetic gauge fields, which can be useful for cavity-mediated coupling, dark mode memories, and building nonreciprocal devices.</description>

      <title>Optical wood with switchable solar transmittance for all-round thermal management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Technologies enabling passive daytime radiative cooling and daylight harvesting are highly relevant for energy-efficient buildings. Despite recent progress demonstrated with passively cooling polymer coatings, however, it remains challenging to combine also a passive heat gain mechanism into a single substrate for all-round thermal management. Herein, we developed an optical wood (OW) with switchable transmittance of solar irradiation enabled by the hierarchically porous structure, ultralow absorption in solar spectrum and high infrared absorption of cellulose nanofibers. After delignification, the OW shows a high solar reflectance (94.9%) in the visible and high broadband emissivity (0.93) in the infrared region (2.5-25 $\mu$m). Owing to the exceptional mass transport of its aligned cellulose nanofibers, OW can quickly switch to a new highly transparent state following phenylethanol impregnation. The solar transmittance of optical wood (OW-II state) can reach 68.4% from 250 to 2500 nm. The switchable OW exhibits efficient radiative cooling to 4.5 {\deg}C below ambient temperature in summer (81.4 W m$^{-2}$ cooling power), and daylight heating to 5.6 {\deg}C above the temperature of natural wood in winter (heating power 229.5 W m$^{-2}$), suggesting its promising role as a low-cost and sustainable solution to all-season thermal management applications.</description>
