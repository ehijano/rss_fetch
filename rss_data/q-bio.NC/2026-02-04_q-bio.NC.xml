      <title>Estimating measures of information processing during cognitive tasks using functional magnetic resonance imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cognition is increasingly framed in terms of information processing, yet most fMRI analyses focus on activation or functional connectivity rather than quantifying how information is stored and transferred. To remedy this problem, we propose a framework for estimating measures of information processing: active information storage (AIS), transfer entropy (TE), and net synergy from task-based fMRI. AIS measures information maintained within a region, TE captures directed information flow, and net synergy contrasts higher-order synergistic to redundant interactions. Crucially, to enable this framework we utilised a recently developed approach for calculating information-theoretic measures: the cross mutual information. This approach combines resting-state and task data to address the challenges of limited sample size, non-stationarity and context in task-based fMRI. We applied this framework to the working memory (N-back) task from the Human Connectome Project (470 participants). Results show that AIS increases in fronto-parietal regions with working memory load, TE reveals enhanced directed information flows across control pathways, and net synergy indicates a global shift to redundancy. This work establishes a novel methodology for quantifying information processing in task-based fMRI.</description>

      <title>Systematic review of self-supervised foundation models for brain network representation using electroencephalography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated analysis of electroencephalography (EEG) has recently undergone a paradigm shift. The introduction of transformer architectures and self-supervised pretraining (SSL) has led to the development of EEG foundation models. These models are pretrained on large amounts of unlabeled data and can be adapted to a range of downstream tasks. This systematic review summarizes recent SSL-trained EEG foundation models that learn whole-brain representations from multichannel EEG rather than representations derived from a single channel. We searched PubMed, IEEE Xplore, Scopus, and arXiv through July 21, 2025. Nineteen preprints and peer-reviewed articles met inclusion criteria. We extracted information regarding pretraining datasets, model architectures, pretraining SSL objectives, and downstream task applications. While pretraining data heavily relied on the Temple University EEG corpus, there was significant heterogeneity in model architecture and training objectives across studies. Transformer architectures were identified as the predominant pretraining architecture with state-space models such as MAMBA and S4 as emerging alternatives. Concerning SSL objectives, masked auto-encoding was most common, and other studies incorporate contrastive learning. Downstream tasks varied widely and implemented diverse fine-tuning strategies, which made direct comparison challenging. Furthermore, most studies used single-task fine-tuning, and a generalizable EEG foundation model remains lacking. In conclusion, the field is advancing rapidly but still limited by limited dataset diversity and the absence of standardized benchmarks. Progress will likely depend on larger and more diverse pretraining datasets, standardized evaluation protocols, and multi-task validation. The development will advance EEG foundation models towards robust and general-purpose relevant to both basic and clinical applications.</description>

      <title>A Distinct Communication Strategies Model of the Double Empathy Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The double empathy problem recasts the difficulty of forming empathy bonds in social interactions between autistic and neurotypical individuals as a bidirectional problem, rather than due to a deficit exclusive to the person on the spectrum. However, no explicit mechanism to explain such a phenomenon has been proposed. Here we build a feedback-loop mathematical model that would theoretically induce the empathy degradation observed during communication in neurotypical-autistic pairs solely due to differences in communication preferences between neurotypical and neurodivergent individuals. Numerical simulations of dyadic interactions show the model, whose mechanism is based solely on communication preferences, can illustrate the breakdown of empathic bonding observed clinically. Stability analysis of the model provides a way to predict the overall trajectory of the interaction in the empathy space. Furthermore, we suggest experimental designs to measure several parameters outlined here and discuss the future directions for testing the proposed model.</description>

      <title>Fine-Tuning Language Models to Know What They Know</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metacognition is a critical component of intelligence, specifically regarding the awareness of one's own knowledge. While humans rely on shared internal memory for both answering questions and reporting their knowledge state, this dependency in LLMs remains underexplored. This study proposes a framework to measure metacognitive ability $d_{\rm{type2}}'$ using a dual-prompt method, followed by the introduction of Evolution Strategy for Metacognitive Alignment (ESMA) to bind a model's internal knowledge to its explicit behaviors. ESMA demonstrates robust generalization across diverse untrained settings, indicating a enhancement in the model's ability to reference its own knowledge. Furthermore, parameter analysis attributes these improvements to a sparse set of significant modifications.</description>

      <title>A Reproducible Framework for Bias-Resistant Machine Learning on Small-Sample Neuroimaging Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a reproducible, bias-resistant machine learning framework that integrates domain-informed feature engineering, nested cross-validation, and calibrated decision-threshold optimization for small-sample neuroimaging data. Conventional cross-validation frameworks that reuse the same folds for both model selection and performance estimation yield optimistically biased results, limiting reproducibility and generalization. Demonstrated on a high-dimensional structural MRI dataset of deep brain stimulation cognitive outcomes, the framework achieved a nested-CV balanced accuracy of 0.660\,$\pm$\,0.068 using a compact, interpretable subset selected via importance-guided ranking. By combining interpretability and unbiased evaluation, this work provides a generalizable computational blueprint for reliable machine learning in data-limited biomedical domains.</description>

      <title>Adversarial construction as a potential solution to the experiment design problem in large task spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite decades of work, we still lack a robust, task-general theory of human behavior even in the simplest domains. In this paper we tackle the generality problem head-on, by aiming to develop a unified model for all tasks embedded in a task-space. In particular we consider the space of binary sequence prediction tasks where the observations are generated by the space parameterized by hidden Markov models (HMM). As the space of tasks is large, experimental exploration of the entire space is infeasible. To solve this problem we propose the adversarial construction approach, which helps identify tasks that are most likely to elicit a qualitatively novel behavior. Our results suggest that adversarial construction significantly outperforms random sampling of environments and therefore could be used as a proxy for optimal experimental design in high-dimensional task spaces.</description>

      <title>A Minimal Task Reveals Emergent Path Integration and Object-Location Binding in a Predictive Sequence Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adaptive cognition requires structured internal models representing objects and their relations. Predictive neural networks are often proposed to form such "world models", yet their underlying mechanisms remain unclear. One hypothesis is that action-conditioned sequential prediction suffices for learning such world models. In this work, we investigate this possibility in a minimal in-silico setting. Sequentially sampling tokens from 2D continuous token scenes, a recurrent neural network is trained to predict the upcoming token from current input and a saccade-like displacement. On novel scenes, prediction accuracy improves across the sequence, indicating in-context learning. Decoding analyses reveal path integration and dynamic binding of token identity to position. Interventional analyses show that new bindings can be learned late in sequence and that out-of-distribution bindings can be learned. Together, these results demonstrate how structured representations that rely on flexible binding emerge to support prediction, offering a mechanistic account of sequential world modeling relevant to cognitive science.</description>

      <title>FOVI: A biologically-inspired foveated interface for deep vision models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human vision is foveated, with variable resolution peaking at the center of a large field of view; this reflects an efficient trade-off for active sensing, allowing eye-movements to bring different parts of the world into focus with other parts of the world in context. In contrast, most computer vision systems encode the visual world at a uniform resolution, raising challenges for processing full-field high-resolution images efficiently. We propose a foveated vision interface (FOVI) based on the human retina and primary visual cortex, that reformats a variable-resolution retina-like sensor array into a uniformly dense, V1-like sensor manifold. Receptive fields are defined as k-nearest-neighborhoods (kNNs) on the sensor manifold, enabling kNN-convolution via a novel kernel mapping technique. We demonstrate two use cases: (1) an end-to-end kNN-convolutional architecture, and (2) a foveated adaptation of the foundational DINOv3 ViT model, leveraging low-rank adaptation (LoRA). These models provide competitive performance at a fraction of the computational cost of non-foveated baselines, opening pathways for efficient and scalable active sensing for high-resolution egocentric vision. Code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/nblauch/fovi and https://huggingface.co/fovi-pytorch.</description>

      <title>Emergent time-keeping mechanisms in a deep reinforcement learning agent performing an interval timing task</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15784v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Drawing parallels between Deep Artificial Neural Networks (DNNs) and biological systems can aid in understanding complex biological mechanisms that are difficult to disentangle. Temporal processing, an extensively researched topic, is one such example that lacks a coherent understanding of its underlying mechanisms. In this study, we investigate temporal processing in a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent performing an interval timing task and explore potential biological counterparts to its emergent behavior. The agent was successfully trained to perform a duration production task, which involved marking successive occurrences of a target interval while viewing a video sequence. Analysis of the agent's internal states revealed oscillatory neural activations, a ubiquitous pattern in biological systems. Interestingly, the agent's actions were predominantly influenced by neurons exhibiting these oscillations with high amplitudes and frequencies corresponding to the target interval. Parallels are drawn between the agent's time-keeping strategy and the Striatal Beat Frequency (SBF) model, a biologically plausible model of interval timing. Furthermore, the agent maintained its oscillatory representations and task performance when tested on different video sequences (including a blank video). Thus, once learned, the agent internalized its time-keeping mechanism and showed minimal reliance on its environment to perform the timing task. A hypothesis about the resemblance between this emergent behavior and certain aspects of the evolution of biological processes like circadian rhythms, has been discussed. This study aims to contribute to recent research efforts of utilizing DNNs to understand biological systems, with a particular emphasis on temporal processing.</description>

      <title>Neural Thermodynamics: Entropic Forces in Deep and Universal Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12387v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rapid discovery of emergent phenomena in deep learning and large language models, understanding their cause has become an urgent need. Here, we propose a rigorous entropic-force theory for understanding the learning dynamics of neural networks trained with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants. Building on the theory of parameter symmetries and an entropic loss landscape, we show that representation learning is crucially governed by emergent entropic forces arising from stochasticity and discrete-time updates. These forces systematically break continuous parameter symmetries and preserve discrete ones, leading to a series of gradient balance phenomena that resemble the equipartition property of thermal systems. These phenomena, in turn, (a) explain the universal alignment of neural representations between AI models and lead to a proof of the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, and (b) reconcile the seemingly contradictory observations of sharpness- and flatness-seeking behavior of deep learning optimization. Our theory and experiments demonstrate that a combination of entropic forces and symmetry breaking is key to understanding emergent phenomena in deep learning.</description>

      <title>Relational reasoning and inductive bias in transformers and large language models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04289v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformer-based models have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities, but the mechanisms underlying relational reasoning remain poorly understood. We investigate how transformers perform \textit{transitive inference}, a classic relational reasoning task which requires inference indirectly related items (e.g., if $A&gt;B$ and $B&gt;C$, then $A&gt;C$), comparing in-weights learning (IWL) and in-context learning (ICL) strategies. We find that IWL naturally induces a generalization bias towards transitive inference despite training only on adjacent items, whereas ICL models develop induction circuits implementing match-and-copy strategies that fail to encode hierarchical relationships. However, when pre-trained on in-context linear regression tasks, transformers successfully exhibit in-context generalizable transitive inference, displaying both \textit{symbolic distance} and \textit{terminal item effects} characteristic of human and animal performance, without forming induction circuits. We extend these findings to large language models, demonstrating that prompting with linear geometric scaffolds improves transitive inference, while circular geometries (which violate transitivity by allowing wraparound) impair performance, particularly when models cannot rely on stored knowledge. Together, these results reveal that both the training regime and the geometric structure of induced representations critically determine transformers' capacity for transitive inference.</description>

      <title>NOBLE -- Neural Operator with Biologically-informed Latent Embeddings to Capture Experimental Variability in Biological Neuron Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04536v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Characterizing the cellular properties of neurons is fundamental to understanding their function in the brain. In this quest, the generation of bio-realistic models is central towards integrating multimodal cellular data sets and establishing causal relationships. However, current modeling approaches remain constrained by the limited availability and intrinsic variability of experimental neuronal data. The deterministic formalism of bio-realistic models currently precludes accounting for the natural variability observed experimentally. While deep learning is becoming increasingly relevant in this space, it fails to capture the full biophysical complexity of neurons, their nonlinear voltage dynamics, and variability. To address these shortcomings, we introduce NOBLE, a neural operator framework that learns a mapping from a continuous frequency-modulated embedding of interpretable neuron features to the somatic voltage response induced by current injection. Trained on synthetic data generated from bio-realistic neuron models, NOBLE predicts distributions of neural dynamics accounting for the intrinsic experimental variability. Unlike conventional bio-realistic neuron models, interpolating within the embedding space offers models whose dynamics are consistent with experimentally observed responses. NOBLE enables the efficient generation of synthetic neurons that closely resemble experimental data and exhibit trial-to-trial variability, offering a $4200\times$ speedup over the numerical solver. NOBLE is the first scaled-up deep learning framework that validates its generalization with real experimental data. To this end, NOBLE captures fundamental neural properties in a unique and emergent manner that opens the door to a better understanding of cellular composition and computations, neuromorphic architectures, large-scale brain circuits, and general neuroAI applications.</description>
