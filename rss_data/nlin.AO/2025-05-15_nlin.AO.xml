      <title>Emergent dynamical phases and collective motion in termites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Termites which are able to forage in the open can be often seen, in the field or in the lab: (i) wandering around, forming no observable pattern, or (ii) clustering themselves in a dense and almost immobile pack, or (iii) milling about in a circular movement. Despite been well reported patterns, they are normally regarded as independent phenomena whose specific traits have never been properly quantified. Evidence, however, favours the hypothesis that these are interdependent patterns, arisen from self-organised interactions and movement among workers. After all, termites are a form of active matter where blind cooperative individuals are self-propelled and lack the possibility of visual cues to spatially orientate and align. It follows that their non-trivial close-contact patterns could generate motion-collision induced phase separations. This would then trigger the emergence of these three patterns (disorder, clustering, milling) as parts of the same continuum. By inspecting termite groups confined in arenas, we could quantitatively describe each one of these patterns in detail. We identified disorder, clustering and milling spatial patterns. These phases and their transitions are characterised aiming to offer refinements in the understanding of these aspects of self-propelled particles in active matter where close-range contacts and collisions are important.</description>

      <title>Moving towards informative and actionable social media research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social media is nearly ubiquitous in modern life, and concerns have been raised about its putative societal impacts, ranging from undermining mental health and exacerbating polarization to fomenting violence and disrupting democracy. Despite extensive research, consensus on these effects remains elusive, with observational studies often highlighting concerns while randomized controlled trials (RCTs) yield conflicting or null findings. This review examines how the complexity inherent in social systems can account for such discrepancies, emphasizing that emergent societal and long-term outcomes cannot be readily inferred from individual-level effects. In complex systems, such as social networks, feedback loops, hysteresis, multi-scale dynamics, and non-linearity limit the utility of approaches for assessing causality that are otherwise robust in simpler contexts. Revisiting large-scale experiments, we explore how null or conflicting findings may reflect these complexities rather than a true absence of effects. Even in cases where the methods are appropriate, assessing the net impacts of social media provides little actionable insight given that eliminating social media is not a realistic option for whole populations. We argue that progress will require a complexity-minded approach focused on specific design choices of online platforms that triangulates experimental, observational and theoretical methods.</description>
