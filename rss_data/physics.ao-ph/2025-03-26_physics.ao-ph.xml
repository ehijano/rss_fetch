      <title>Deep learning in the abyss: a stratified Physics Informed Neural Network for data assimilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reconstruction of deep ocean currents is a major challenge in data assimilation due to the scarcity of interior data. In this work, we present a proof of concept for deep ocean flow reconstruction using a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN), a machine learning approach that offers an alternative to traditional data assimilation methods. We introduce an efficient algorithm called StrAssPINN (for Stratified Assimilation PINNs), which assigns a separate network to each layer of the ocean model while allowing them to interact during training. The neural network takes spatiotemporal coordinates as input and predicts the velocity field at those points. Using a SIREN architecture (a multilayer perceptron with sine activation functions), which has proven effective in various contexts, the network is trained using both available observational data and dynamical priors enforced at several collocation points. We apply this method to pseudo-observed ocean data generated from a 3-layer quasi-geostrophic model, where the pseudo-observations include surface-level data akin to SWOT observations of sea surface height, interior data similar to ARGO floats, and a limited number of deep ARGO-like measurements in the lower layers. Our approach successfully reconstructs ocean flows in both the interior and surface layers, demonstrating a strong ability to resolve key ocean mesoscale features, including vortex rings, eastward jets associated with potential vorticity fronts, and smoother Rossby waves. This work serves as a prelude to applying StrAssPINN to real-world observational data.</description>

      <title>Along-trajectory acoustic signal variations observed during the hypersonic reentry of the OSIRIS-REx Sample Return Capsule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reentry of the OSIRIS-REx Sample Return Capsule (SRC) on September 24, 2023, presented a rare opportunity to study atmospheric entry dynamics through a dense network of ground-based infrasound sensors. As the first interplanetary capsule to reenter over the United States since Stardust in 2006, this event allowed for unprecedented observations of infrasound signals generated during hypersonic descent. We deployed 39 single-sensor stations across Nevada and Utah, strategically distributed to capture signals from distinct trajectory points. Infrasound data were analyzed to examine how signal amplitude and period vary with altitude and propagation path for a non-ablating hypersonic object with well-defined physical and aerodynamic properties. Raytracing simulations incorporated atmospheric specifications from the Ground-2-Space model to estimate source altitudes for observed signals. Results confirmed ballistic arrivals at all stations, with source altitudes ranging from 44 km to 62 km along the trajectory. Signal period and amplitude exhibited strong dependence on source altitude, with higher altitudes corresponding to lower amplitudes, longer periods, and reduced high-frequency content. Regression analysis demonstrated strong correlations between signal characteristics and both altitude and propagation geometry. Our results suggest, when attenuation is considered, the amplitude is primarily determined by the source, with the propagation path playing a secondary role over the distances examined. These findings emphasize the utility of controlled SRC reentries for advancing our understanding of natural meteoroid dynamics, refining atmospheric entry models, and improving methodologies for planetary defense.</description>

      <title>A Revisit of Large-Scale Patterns in Middle Stratospheric Circulation Variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variations in stratospheric atmospheric circulation significantly influence tropospheric weather and climate, and understanding these variations can guide stratospheric aircraft development and operations. Despite a century of progress, large-scale patterns in stratospheric circulation remain poorly understood due to the stratosphere's complex nature. To address this, we applied the eigen microstate approach (EMA) to analyze zonal wind from 70-10 hPa using ERA5 reanalysis data from 1980-2022. We focused on the three leading modes, corresponding to the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) and stratospheric circulation in the Arctic and Antarctic. After removing high-frequency components, we observed a significant 11-year cycle in the Antarctic stratospheric circulation mode, possibly linked to the solar cycle. In contrast, the Arctic mode showed a 5-6-year cycle without 11-year periodicity. This difference likely arises from the seasonal timing of polar vortex breakdowns: the Antarctic vortex persists into late spring and summer, making it more sensitive to solar radiation, while the Arctic vortex peaks in winter and early spring. The fourth mode showed features of a Southern Hemisphere dipole and was significantly correlated with the Antarctic mode, leading it by about two months. Finally, we developed a linear prediction model that demonstrated predictive skill for the Antarctic polar vortex.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Mesoscale Weather Forecasting Combining Swin-Unet and Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-driven weather prediction models exhibit promising performance and advance continuously. In particular, diffusion models represent fine-scale details without spatial smoothing, which is crucial for mesoscale predictions, such as heavy rainfall forecasting. However, the applications of diffusion models to mesoscale prediction remain limited. To address this gap, this study proposes an architecture that combines a diffusion model with Swin-Unet as a deterministic model, achieving mesoscale predictions while maintaining flexibility. The proposed architecture trains the two models independently, allowing the diffusion model to remain unchanged when the deterministic model is updated. Comparisons using the Fractions Skill Score and power spectral analysis demonstrate that incorporating the diffusion model leads to improved accuracy compared to predictions without it. These findings underscore the potential of the proposed architecture to enhance mesoscale predictions, particularly for strong rainfall events, while maintaining flexibility.</description>

      <title>Rapid topographic scatter of near-inertial waves generated by storms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02275v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Internal waves propagate on the ocean's stratification, carrying energy and redistributing momentum through the ocean. When internal waves break, they contribute to diapycnal mixing in the ocean interior, but this breaking behaviour depends upon the scale of the waves. Low-mode internal waves have longer horizontal scales, and thus break less readily than higher-mode waves. The scattering of internal waves by topography is an important mechanism in downscaling internal waves smaller scales that are more conducive to wave breaking and mixing processes. In this study, we propose and investigate a mechanism in which storm-generated low-mode internal waves scatter at topography. We hypothesise that horizontally propagating internal wave modes generated by storm-like winds can rapidly dephase; these dephased waves can then be scattered from topography, resulting in higher-mode upward-propagating waves within hours of the passage of a storm. We investigate this phenomenon in an idealised numerical model of a storm passing over a prominent ridge, and perform several perturbation experiments in which ocean and wind properties are varied. Bottom-scattered near-inertial internal waves are identified propagating away from the ridge rapidly in the wake of the storm. We perform several perturbation experiments in which we vary the ocean, topography, and wind properties. The bottom scattered waves exhibit spatial downscaling, and have an energy flux equivalent to 10% the magnitude of the energy flux from surface-generated near-inertial waves in our domain. Although small in a globally averaged sense, we argue that the topographic scatter of storm-generated near-inertial waves could account for the unexplained near-inertial wave signals found in ocean observations and numerical studies.</description>

      <title>Investigating the relationship between bolide entry angle and apparent direction of infrasound signal arrivals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13972v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Infrasound sensing offers critical capabilities for detecting and geolocating bolide events globally. However, the observed back azimuths, directions from which infrasound signals arrive at stations, often differ from the theoretical expectations based on the bolide's peak brightness location. For objects with shallow entry angles, which traverse longer atmospheric paths, acoustic energy may be emitted from multiple points along the trajectory, leading to substantial variability in back azimuth residuals. This study investigates how the entry angle of energetic bolides affects the back azimuth deviations, independent of extrinsic factors such as atmospheric propagation, station noise, and signal processing methodologies. A theoretical framework, the Bolide Infrasound Back-Azimuth EXplorer Model (BIBEX-M), was developed to compute predicted back azimuths solely from geometric considerations. The model quantifies how these residuals vary as a function of source-to-receiver distance, revealing that bolides entering at shallow angles of 15 degrees can experience average residuals of 12.4 degrees, with deviations reaching up to 155 degrees at distances below 1500 km, and remaining significant even at 10,000 km. In contrast, bolides with steeper entry angles (greater than 60 degrees) show much smaller deviations, typically under 10 degrees at 1000 km and diminishing to less than two degrees beyond 5000 km. These findings attest to the need for careful interpretation when evaluating signal detections and estimating bolide locations. This work is not only pertinent to bolides but also to other high-energy, extended-duration atmospheric phenomena such as space debris and reentry events, where similar geometric considerations can influence infrasound arrival directions.</description>
