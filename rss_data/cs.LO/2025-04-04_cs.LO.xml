      <title>Are Users More Willing to Use Formally Verified Password Managers?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Formal verification has recently been increasingly used to prove the correctness and security of many applications. It is attractive because it can prove the absence of errors with the same certainty as mathematicians proving theorems. However, while most security experts recognize the value of formal verification, the views of non-technical users on this topic are unknown. To address this issue, we designed and implemented two experiments to understand how formal verification impacts users. Our approach started with a formative study involving 15 participants, followed by the main quantitative study with 200 individuals. We focus on the application domain of password managers since it has been documented that the lack of trust in password managers might lead to lower adoption. Moreover, recent efforts have focused on formally verifying (parts of) password managers. We conclude that formal verification is seen as desirable by users and identify three actional recommendations to improve formal verification communication efforts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces Kleene wands, which capture guarded iteration in restriction categories. A Kleene wand is a binary operator which takes in two maps, an endomorphism $X \to X$ and a map ${X \to A}$, which are disjoint and and produces a map $X \to A$. This map is interpreted as iterating the endomorphism until it lands in the domain of definition of the second map, which plays the role of a guard. In a setting with infinite disjoint joins, there is always a canonical Kleene wand given by realizing this intuition. We call a restriction category with a Kleene wand an itegory.
  To provide further evidence that Kleene wands capture iteration, we explain how Kleene wands are deeply connected to trace operators on coproducts, which are already well-known of categorifying iteration. We show that for an extensive restriction category, to have a Kleene wand is equivalent to having a trace operator on the coproduct. This suggests, therefore, that Kleene wands can be used to replace parametrized iteration operators or trace operators in a setting without coproducts.</description>

      <title>How Artificial Intelligence Leads to Knowledge Why: An Inquiry Inspired by Aristotle's Posterior Analytics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian networks and causal models provide frameworks for handling queries about external interventions and counterfactuals, enabling tasks that go beyond what probability distributions alone can address. While these formalisms are often informally described as capturing causal knowledge, there is a lack of a formal theory characterizing the type of knowledge required to predict the effects of external interventions. This work introduces the theoretical framework of causal systems to clarify Aristotle's distinction between knowledge that and knowledge why within artificial intelligence. By interpreting existing artificial intelligence technologies as causal systems, it investigates the corresponding types of knowledge. Furthermore, it argues that predicting the effects of external interventions is feasible only with knowledge why, providing a more precise understanding of the knowledge necessary for such tasks.</description>

      <title>Reasoning Inconsistencies and How to Mitigate Them in Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent advancements in Deep Learning models and techniques have led to significant strides in performance across diverse tasks and modalities. However, while the overall capabilities of models show promising growth, our understanding of their internal reasoning processes remains limited, particularly concerning systematic inconsistencies or errors patterns of logical or inferential flaws. These inconsistencies may manifest as contradictory outputs, failure to generalize across similar tasks, or erroneous conclusions in specific contexts. Even detecting and measuring such reasoning discrepancies is challenging, as they may arise from opaque internal procedures, biases and imbalances in training data, or the inherent complexity of the task. Without effective methods to detect, measure, and mitigate these errors, there is a risk of deploying models that are biased, exploitable, or logically unreliable. This thesis aims to address these issues by producing novel methods for deep learning models that reason over knowledge graphs, natural language, and images. The thesis contributes two techniques for detecting and quantifying predictive inconsistencies originating from opaque internal procedures in natural language and image processing models. To mitigate inconsistencies from biases in training data, this thesis presents a data efficient sampling method to improve fairness and performance and a synthetic dataset generation approach in low resource scenarios. Finally, the thesis offers two techniques to optimize the models for complex reasoning tasks. These methods enhance model performance while allowing for more faithful and interpretable exploration and exploitation during inference. Critically, this thesis provides a comprehensive framework to improve the robustness, fairness, and interpretability of deep learning models across diverse tasks and modalities.</description>

      <title>SymDQN: Symbolic Knowledge and Reasoning in Neural Network-based Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a learning architecture that allows symbolic control and guidance in reinforcement learning with deep neural networks. We introduce SymDQN, a novel modular approach that augments the existing Dueling Deep Q-Networks (DuelDQN) architecture with modules based on the neuro-symbolic framework of Logic Tensor Networks (LTNs). The modules guide action policy learning and allow reinforcement learning agents to display behaviour consistent with reasoning about the environment. Our experiment is an ablation study performed on the modules. It is conducted in a reinforcement learning environment of a 5x5 grid navigated by an agent that encounters various shapes, each associated with a given reward. The underlying DuelDQN attempts to learn the optimal behaviour of the agent in this environment, while the modules facilitate shape recognition and reward prediction. We show that our architecture significantly improves learning, both in terms of performance and the precision of the agent. The modularity of SymDQN allows reflecting on the intricacies and complexities of combining neural and symbolic approaches in reinforcement learning.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Spell: A Dynamic Logic Analysis of Misdirection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14516v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Misdirection can be defined as the intentional action of causing some misrepresentation in an agent, or in a group of agents. Such misrepresentations may result from verbal actions, as in linguistic deception, or from visual actions, as in visual misdirection. Examples of visual misdirection abound (e.g. in nature, in the military), with magic tricks providing a vivid illustration. So far, various types of verbal misdirection have been investigated from a formal perspective (e.g. lying, bluffing) but little attention has been paid to the particular case of visual misdirection. In this paper, we introduce a dynamic epistemic logic to represent not only verbal misdirection on agents' beliefs but also visual misdirection on agents' observations. We illustrate the dynamics of the logic by modelling a classic magic trick known as the French Drop. We also provide a sound and complete axiom system for the logic, and discuss the expressivity and scope of the setting.</description>

      <title>Confluence of Conditional Rewriting Modulo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sets of equations E play an important computational role in rewriting-based systems R by defining an equivalence relation =E inducing a partition of terms into E-equivalence classes on which rewriting computations, denoted -&gt;R/E and called *rewriting modulo E*, are issued. This paper investigates *confluence of -&gt;R/E*, usually called *E-confluence*, for *conditional* rewriting-based systems, where rewriting steps are determined by conditional rules. We rely on Jouannaud and Kirchner's framework to investigate confluence of an abstract relation R modulo an abstract equivalence relation E on a set A. We show how to particularize the framework to be used with conditional systems. Then, we show how to define appropriate finite sets of *conditional pairs* to prove and disprove E-confluence. In particular, we introduce *Logic-based Conditional Critical Pairs* which do not require the use of (often infinitely many) E-unifiers to provide a finite representation of the *local peaks* considered in the abstract framework. We also introduce *parametric Conditional Variable Pairs* which are essential to deal with conditional rules in the analysis of E-confluence. Our results apply to well-known classes of rewriting-based systems. In particular, to *Equational (Conditional) Term Rewriting Systems*.</description>

      <title>Central H-spaces and banded types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.02636v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study central types, which are generalizations of Eilenberg-Mac Lane spaces. A type is central when it is equivalent to the component of the identity among its own self-equivalences. From centrality alone we construct an infinite delooping in terms of a tensor product of banded types, which are the appropriate notion of torsor for a central type. Our constructions are carried out in homotopy type theory, and therefore hold in any $\infty$-topos. Even when interpreted into the $\infty$-topos of spaces, our approach to constructing these deloopings is new.
  Along the way, we further develop the theory of H-spaces in homotopy type theory, including their relation to evaluation fibrations and Whitehead products. These considerations let us, for example, rule out the existence of H-space structures on the $2n$-sphere for $n &gt; 0$. We also give a novel description of the moduli space of H-space structures on an H-space. Using this description, we generalize a formula of Arkowitz-Curjel and Copeland for counting the number of path components of this moduli space. As an application, we deduce that the moduli space of H-space structures on the $3$-sphere is $\Omega^6 \mathbb{S}^3$.</description>

      <title>Rewriting Consistent Answers on Annotated Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11661v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We embark on a study of the consistent answers of queries over databases annotated with values from a naturally ordered positive semiring. In this setting, the consistent answers of a query are defined as the minimum of the semiring values that the query takes over all repairs of an inconsistent database. The main focus is on self-join free conjunctive queries and key constraints, which is the most extensively studied case of consistent query answering over standard databases. We introduce a variant of first-order logic with a limited form of negation, define suitable semiring semantics, and then establish the main result of the paper: the consistent query answers of a self-join free conjunctive query under key constraints are rewritable in this logic if and only if the attack graph of the query contains no cycles. This result generalizes an analogous result of Koutris and Wijsen for ordinary databases, but also yields new results for a multitude of semirings, including the bag semiring, the tropical semiring, and the fuzzy semiring. Further, for the bag semiring, we show that computing the consistent answers of any self-join free conjunctive query whose attack graph has a strong cycle is not only NP-hard but also it is NP-hard to even approximate the consistent answers with a constant relative approximation guarantee.</description>
