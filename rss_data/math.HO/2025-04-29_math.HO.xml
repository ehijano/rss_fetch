      <title>From the Notebooks to the Investigations and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of the open and searchable Wittgenstein's Nachlass (The Wittgenstein Archives at the University of Bergen (WAB)) has proved instrumental in the quest for a common thread of Wittgenstein's view on the connections between meaning, use and consequences, going from the Notebooks to later writings (including the Philosophical Investigations) and beyond. Here we take this as the basis for a proposal for a formal counterpart of a 'meaning-as-use' (dialogical/game-theoretical) semantics for the language of predicate logic. In order to further consolidate this perspective, we shall need to bring in key excerpts from Wittgenstein oeuvre (including the Nachlass) and from those formal semanticists who advocate a different perspective on the connections between proofs and meaning. With this in mind we consider several passages from Wittgenstein's published as well as unpublished writings to build a whole picture of a formal counterpart to 'meaning is use' based on the idea that explanations of consequences via 'movements within language' ought to be taken as a central aspect to Wittgenstein's shift from 'interpretation of symbols in a state of affairs' to 'use of symbols' which underpins his 'meaning is use' paradigm. As in the Investigations "every interpretation hangs in the air together with what it interprets, and cannot give it any support. Interpretations by themselves do not determine meaning", as well as in a remark from his transitional period (1929-30): "Perhaps one should say that the expression 'interpretation of symbols' is misleading and one should instead say 'the use of symbols'." Significantly, we wish the present examination of the searchable Nachlass can make a relevant step towards a formal counterpart to the 'meaning is use' dictum, while highlighting an important common thread from Wittgenstein's very early to very late writings.</description>

      <title>Further examples of apodictic discourse, I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analysis of problematic mathematical texts, particularly from India, has required the introduction of a new category of rigorous discourse, apodictic discourse. We briefly recall why this introduction was necessary. We then show that this form of discourse is widespread among scholars, even in contemporary Mathematics, in India and elsewhere. It is in India a natural outgrowth of the emphasis on non-written communication, combined with the need for freedom of thought. New results in this first part include the following: (i) {\=A}ryabha___a proposed a geometric derivation of a basic algebraic identity; (ii) Brahmagupta proposed an original argument for the irrationality of quadratic surds on the basis of his results on the varga-prak___ti problem, thereby justifying his change in the definition of the word kara___{\=i}.</description>

      <title>Apodictic discourse and the Cauchy-Bunyakovsky-Schwarz inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bunyakovsky's integral inequality (1859) is one of the familiar tools of modern Analysis. We try and understand what Bunyakovsky did, why he did it, why others did not follow the same path, and explore some of the mathematical (re)interpretations of his inequalities. This is achieved by treating the texts as discourses that provide motivation and proofs by their very discursive structure, in addition to what meets the eye at first reading. Bunyakovsky paper is an outgrowth of the mathematical theory of mean-values in Cauchy's work (1821), but viewed from the point of view of Probability and Statistics. Liouville (1836) gave a result that implies Bunyakovsky's inequality, but did not identify it as significant because his interests lay elsewhere. Grassmann (1862) stated the inequality in abstract form but did not prove it for reasons that can be identified. Finally, by relating the result to quadratic binary forms, Schwarz (1885) opened the way to a geometric interpretation of the inequality that became important in the theory of integral equations. His argument is the source of one of the proofs most commonly taught nowadays. At about the same time, the Rogers-H{\"o}lder inequality suggested generalizations of Cauchy's and Bunyakovsky's results in an entirely different direction. Later extensions and reinterpretations show that no single result, even now, subsumes all known generalizations.</description>

      <title>The Math Teaching Atlas: Trails, Anchors, and Compass in Action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04313v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper advocates a shift grounded in mathematical reasoning: teach and write math through explicit routeways rather than narratives, anchor new ideas to familiar concepts on a roadmap, and use motivation and concrete examples as a compass and simulation for discovery.</description>
