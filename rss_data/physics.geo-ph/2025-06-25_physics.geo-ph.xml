      <title>Did lunar tides sustain the early Earth's geodynamo?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geological data show that, early in its history, the Earth had a large-scale magnetic field with an amplitude comparable to that of the present geomagnetic field. However, its origin remains enigmatic and various mechanisms have been proposed to explain the Earth's field over geological time scales. Here, we critically evaluate whether tidal forcing could explain the early Earth's geodynamo, by combining constraints from geophysical models of the Earth-Moon system and predictions from rotating turbulence studies. We show that the Moon's tides could be strong enough before $-3.25$ Gy to trigger turbulence in the Earth's core, and possibly dynamo action in the mean time. Then, we propose new scaling laws for the magnetic field amplitude $B$. We show that $B \propto \beta^{4/3}$, where $\beta$ is the typical equatorial ellipticity of the liquid core, if the turbulence involves weak interactions of three-dimensional inertial waves. Otherwise, we would expect $B \propto \beta$ if the amplitude of tidal forcing were strong enough. When extrapolated to the Earth's core, it suggests that tidal forcing alone was too weak to possibly explain the ancient paleomagnetic field. Therefore, our study indirectly favours another origin for the early Earth's geodynamo on long time scales (e.g. the exsolution of light elements atop the core, or thermal convection due to secular cooling).</description>

      <title>Video Compression for Spatiotemporal Earth System Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale Earth system datasets, from high-resolution remote sensing imagery to spatiotemporal climate model outputs, exhibit characteristics analogous to those of standard videos. Their inherent spatial, temporal, and spectral redundancies can thus be readily exploited by established video compression techniques. Here, we present xarrayvideo, a Python library for compressing multichannel spatiotemporal datasets by encoding them as videos. Our approach achieves compression ratios of up to 250x while maintaining high fidelity by leveraging standard, well-optimized video codecs through ffmpeg. We demonstrate the library's effectiveness on four real-world multichannel spatiotemporal datasets: DynamicEarthNet (very high resolution Planet images), DeepExtremeCubes (high resolution Sentinel-2 images), ERA5 (weather reanalysis data), and the SimpleS2 dataset (high resolution multichannel Sentinel-2 images), achieving Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratios (PSNRs) of 55.86, 40.60, 46.58, and 43.23 dB at 0.1 bits per pixel per band (bpppb) and 65.91, 54.28, 62.90, and 55.04 dB at 1 bpppb. We are redistributing two of these datasets, DeepExtremeCubes (2.3 Tb) and DynamicEarthNet (525 Gb), in the machine-learning-ready and cloud-ready TACO format through HuggingFace at significantly reduced sizes (270 Gb and 8.5 Gb, respectively) without compromising quality (PSNR 55.77-56.65 and 60.15). No performance loss is observed when the compressed versions of these datasets are used in their respective deep learning-based downstream tasks (next step reflectance prediction and landcover segmentation). In conclusion, xarrayvideo presents an efficient solution for handling the rapidly growing size of Earth observation datasets, making advanced compression techniques accessible and practical to the Earth science community.

      <title>When Cubic Law and Darcy Fail: Bayesian Correction of Model Misspecification in Fracture Conductivities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20788v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Structural uncertainties and unresolved features in fault zones hinder the assessment of leakage risks in subsurface CO2 storage. Understanding multi-scale uncertainties in fracture network conductivity is crucial for mitigating risks and reliably modelling upscaled fault leakage rates. Conventional models, such as the Cubic Law, which is based on mechanical aperture measurements, often neglect fracture roughness, leading to model misspecifications and inaccurate conductivity estimates. Here, we develop a physics-informed, AI-driven correction of these model misspecifications by automatically integrating roughness effects and small-scale structural uncertainties. Using Bayesian inference combined with data-driven and geometric corrections, we reconstruct local hydraulic aperture fields that reliably estimate fracture conductivities. By leveraging interactions across scales, we improve upon traditional empirical corrections and provide a framework for propagating uncertainties from individual fractures to network scales. Our approach thereby supports robust calibration of conductivity ranges for fault leakage sensitivity analyses, offering a scalable solution for subsurface risk assessment.</description>

      <title>Polar motion of Venus</title>

Abstract: Five Venus missions are under development to study the planet in the next decade, with both NASA's VERITAS and ESA's EnVision featuring a geophysical investigation among their objectives. Their radar and gravity experiments will determine Venus's orientation, enabling analyses of its spin dynamics to infer relevant geophysical and atmospheric properties. This work aims to characterize Venus's polar motion, defined as the motion of its spin axis in a body-fixed frame. We focus on signatures from its interior and atmosphere to support potential detections of polar motion by future orbiters. We developed a polar motion model for a triaxial planet accounting for solar torque, centrifugal and tidal deformations of a viscoelastic mantle, and atmospheric dynamics. Core-mantle coupling effects were analyzed separately, considering a simplified spherical core. We computed the period and damping time of the free motion (i.e., the Chandler wobble) and determined the frequencies and amplitudes of the forced motion. We revisited the Chandler frequency expression. Solar torque is the dominant phenomenon affecting Venus's Chandler frequency, increasing it by a factor of 2.75. Our model predicts a Chandler period in the range [12900 ; 18900] years. The Chandler wobble appears as a linear polar drift of about 90 meters on Venus's surface during EnVision's 4-year primary mission, at the limit of its resolution. We also predict forced polar motion oscillations with an amplitude of about 20 meters, driven by the atmosphere and the solar torque. Compared to the 240 meter spin axis precession occurring in inertial space over this duration, these results suggest that Venus's polar motion could also be detectable by future orbiters. Polar motion should be incorporated into rotation models when anticipating these missions, providing additional constraints on the interior structure of Venus.</description>
