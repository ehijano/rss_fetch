      <title>Tube Integrability in a Time-Dependent Nonlinear Oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the nonlinear oscillator z'' + omega^2 z + g(t) z^2 = 0 with a time-dependent coefficient g(t). We show that this equation admits an exact quadratic invariant I(z,p,t) provided that g(t) = alpha2(t)^(-5/2) and that alpha2(t) satisfies a nonlinear third-order differential equation. The resulting invariant constrains the dynamics to a smooth two-dimensional surface in the extended phase space (z,p,t). If alpha2(t) is periodic, this surface forms a compact invariant torus. However, we show that periodic solutions of alpha2(t) are generically obstructed by a resonance mechanism, leading instead to an aperiodic but non-chaotic evolution. In this regime the invariant surface is non-compact and extends along the time direction, forming a tube rather than a torus. We therefore propose the term "tube integrability" for integrable systems whose invariant manifolds are non-compact in time. A perturbation expansion for alpha2(t) up to third order is derived and compared with numerical integration, clarifying the parameter regimes in which the truncated series provides quantitatively accurate approximations. The breakdown of the series for small y0 reflects the asymptotic nature of the expansion rather than a loss of integrability.</description>

      <title>Statistical properties of mostly expanding fast-slow partially hyperbolic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a class of fast-slow $C^4$ partially hyperbolic systems on $\mathbb{T}^2$ given by $\epsilon$-perturbations of maps $F(x,\theta)=(f(x,\theta),\theta)$ where $f(\cdot,\theta)$ are $C^{4}$ expanding maps of the circle. For sufficiently small $\epsilon$ and an open set of perturbations we prove existence and uniqueness of a physical measure and exponential decay of correlations for sufficiently smooth observables with explicit almost optimal bounds on the decay rate. Our result complements previous work by De Simoi and Liverani, which studied the case of mostly contracting centre.</description>

      <title>Choreographies with Dihedral Symmetry in the Planar $n$-Body Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the existence of planar $D_n$--equivariant choreographies in the $n$--body problem with homogeneous potential of degree $-\alpha$, $0&lt;\alpha&lt;2$. Each body follows the same closed path, rotated and time-shifted, forming a choreography whenever the winding number $W$ is coprime with $n$. Using Mawhin's coincidence degree, we establish collision-free periodic solutions under a simple nonresonance condition. The proof relies on the spectral structure of the linearized operator, symmetry-induced separation of the bodies, and uniform energy bounds ensuring compactness of the nonlinear term. This provides a topological route to choreographies beyond variational and numerical frameworks.</description>

      <title>Bounded deviations in higher genus I: closed geodesics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the first article of a series of two where we study the problem of bounded deviations for homeomorphisms of closed surfaces of genus $\ge 2$. This first part studies bounded deviations with respect to closed geodesics. As a byproduct of our proofs, we also get a criterion of existence of periodic orbits in terms of big deviation with respect to some closed geodesic. The combination with the second part [GT25] generalises to the higher genus case most of the bounded deviations results already known for the torus.</description>

Abstract: This article follows and completes [GT25], where we study the problem of bounded deviations for homeomorphisms of closed surfaces of genus $\ge 2$. This second part deals with bounded deviations relative to geodesic minimal laminations that are not reduced to a closed geodesic. The combination of both articles generalises to the higher genus case most of the bounded deviations results already known for the torus.</description>

      <title>A rotational hyperbolic theory for surface homeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a rotational hyperbolic theory for surface homeomorphisms. We use the equivalence relation on ergodic measures that have nontrivial rotational behaviour defined in arXiv:2312.06249 to define a rotational counterpart of homoclinic classes. These allows to produce a network of horseshoes representing the whole rotational behaviour f the homeomorphism. We also study the counterpart of heteroclinic connections and give 5 different characterizations of such connections.
  The main technical tool is the forcing theory of Le Calvez and Tal arXiv:1503.09127, arXiv:1803.04557, and in particular a result of creation of periodic points that can also be seen as a statement of homotopically bounded deviations [GT25a].
  This theoretical article is followed by a paper focused of some applications of it to the case of homeomorphisms with big rotation set [Gui25].</description>

      <title>On dissonance of self-conformal measures in $\mathbb{R}^d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mu$ be a self-conformal measure on $\mathbb{R}^d$. In this note we establish conditions for $\mu$ under which $\dim(\mu*\nu) = \min\lbrace d,\dim\mu+\dim\nu\rbrace$ holds when $\nu$ is any Ahlfors-regular or self-conformal measure on $\mathbb{R}^d$. Our main result states the following sufficient condition: $\mu$ is totally non-linear and not supported on a smooth hypersurface. We also establish sufficient (likely non-sharp) algebraic conditions for self-conformal measures which are not totally non-linear. The proofs combine recent results on scaling sceneries of self-conformal measures with a Marstrand-type projection theorem for product sets due to L\'opez and Moreira.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Phase Space Dynamics of Hamiltonian Systems by the Origin-Fate Map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate phase space transport in a two-dimensional stretched caldera potential using the Origin-Fate Map (OFM) framework, complemented by Lagrangian Descriptor (LD) analysis. The caldera potential, a model for reaction dynamics with multiple exit channels, is adjusted by a stretching factor lambda that controls the directional bias of the four-saddle landscape. Several OFMs are constructed for two Poincare surfaces of section using forwards and backwards symplectic integration to assign each initial condition a channel of origin and fate. Our results reproduce the highly symmetric lambda = 1.0 patterns reported in Hillebrand et al. (Phys. Rev. E 108, 024211, 2023), and reveal, for smaller lambda, pronounced channel imbalance, figure-eight transport loops, and complex mixed-channel chaotic regions. Long-time integrations show a reduction of trapped regions with boundaries that exhibit self-similarity under deep zoom, revealing fractal-like structures. High-resolution OFMs and LD gradient maps uncover lobe dynamics and manifold structures that govern transport, showing near-perfect alignment between LD ridges and OFM boundaries.</description>

      <title>Stoichiometric ontogenetic development influences population dynamics: Stage-structured model under nutrient co-limitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ecological processes depend on the flow and balance of essential elements such as carbon (C) and phosphorus (P), and changes in these elements can cause adverse effects to ecosystems. The theory of Ecological Stoichiometry offers a conceptual framework to investigate the impact of elemental imbalances on structured populations while simultaneously considering how ecological structures regulate nutrient cycling and ecosystem processes. While there have been significant advances in the development of stoichiometric food web models, these efforts often consider a homogeneous population and neglect stage-structure. The development of stage-structured population models has significantly contributed to understanding energy flow and population dynamics of ecological systems. However, stage structure models fail to consider food quality in addition to food quantity. We develop a stoichiometric stage-structure producer-grazer model that considers co-limitation of nutrients, and parameterize the model for an algae-Daphnia food chain. Our findings emphasize the impact of stoichiometric constraints on structured population dynamics. By incorporating both food quantity and quality into maturation rates, we demonstrate how stage-structured dynamics can influence outcomes in variable environments. Stage-specific parameters, such as juvenile growth and ingestion rates can drive shifts in equilibria, limit cycles, and bifurcation points. These effects are especially significant in high-light environments where nutrient limitations are most pronounced.</description>

      <title>Complex-Weighted Convolutional Networks: Provable Expressiveness via Complex Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse applications, yet they remain limited by oversmoothing and poor performance on heterophilic graphs. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework that equips graphs with a complex-weighted structure, assigning each edge a complex number to drive a diffusion process that extends random walks into the complex domain. We prove that this diffusion is highly expressive: with appropriately chosen complex weights, any node-classification task can be solved in the steady state of a complex random walk. Building on this insight, we propose the Complex-Weighted Convolutional Network (CWCN), which learns suitable complex-weighted structures directly from data while enriching diffusion with learnable matrices and nonlinear activations. CWCN is simple to implement, requires no additional hyperparameters beyond those of standard GNNs, and achieves competitive performance on benchmark datasets. Our results demonstrate that complex-weighted diffusion provides a principled and general mechanism for enhancing GNN expressiveness, opening new avenues for models that are both theoretically grounded and practically effective.</description>

Abstract: Hamiltonian Poisson integrators are Poisson integrators that admit a modified Hamiltonian. In this article, we illustrate the importance of the existence of a modified Hamiltonian for Poisson integrators in the context of integrable and non-integrable systems. Examples of Hamiltonian systems are provided by Lotka-Volterra dynamics; in order to investigate stability properties of Hamiltonian Poisson integrators on non-integrable systems, we exhibit a non-integrable $5$-dimensional Lotka-Volterra system and pursue numerical investigations of it.</description>

      <title>Integral Bayesian symbolic regression for optimal discovery of governing equations from scarce and noisy data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how systems evolve over time often requires discovering the differential equations that govern their behavior. Automatically learning these equations from experimental data is challenging when the data are noisy or limited, and existing approaches struggle, in particular, with the estimation of unobserved derivatives. Here, we introduce an integral Bayesian symbolic regression method that learns governing equations directly from raw time-series data, without requiring manual assumptions or error-prone derivative estimation. By sampling the space of symbolic differential equations and evaluating them via numerical integration, our method robustly identifies governing equations even from noisy or scarce data. We show that this approach accurately recovers ground-truth models in synthetic benchmarks, and that it makes quasi-optimal predictions of system dynamics for all noise regimes. Applying this method to bacterial growth experiments across multiple species and substrates, we discover novel growth equations that outperform classical models in accurately capturing all phases of microbial proliferation, including lag, exponential, and saturation. Unlike standard approaches, our method reveals subtle shifts in growth dynamics, such as double ramp-ups or non-canonical transitions, offering a deeper, data-driven understanding of microbial physiology.</description>

      <title>BiRNe: Symbolic bifurcation analysis of reaction networks with Python</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computer algebra methods for analyzing reaction networks often rely on the assumption of mass-action kinetics, which transform the governing ODEs into polynomial systems amenable to techniques such as Gr\"obner basis computation and related algebraic tools. However, these methods face significant computational complexity, limiting their applicability to relatively small networks involving only a handful of species. In contrast, building on recent theoretical advances, we introduce here \textsc{BiRNe} (BIfurcations in Reaction NEtworks) Python module, which relies on a symbolic approach designed to detect bifurcations in larger reaction networks (up to 10-20 species, depending on the network's connectivity) equipped with parameter-rich kinetics. This class includes enzymatic kinetics such as Michaelis--Menten, ligand-binding kinetics like Hill functions, and generalized mass-action kinetics. For a given network, the current algorithm identifies all minimal autocatalytic subnetworks and fully characterizes the presence of bifurcations associated with zero eigenvalues, thus determining whether the network admits multistationarity. It also detects oscillatory bifurcations arising from positive-feedback structures, capturing a significant class of possible oscillations.</description>

      <title>Fej\'er property and Galois correspondence for groupoid $C^*$-algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a notion of the Fej\'er property for topological \'etale groupoids. As a consequence, we show that when $\mathcal{G}$ is a principal \'etale second countable groupoid satisfying the Fej\'er property, every closed $C_0(\mathcal{G}^0)$-bimodule $M\subset C_r^*(\mathcal{G})$ is of the form $\overline{C_c(U)}^r$ for some open set $U$. Moreover, we get a Galois correspondence in the sense that every intermediate $C^*$-algebra $\mathcal{B}$ with $C_0(\mathcal{G}^0)\subseteq \mathcal{B}\subseteq C_r^*(\mathcal{G})$ is of the form $C_r^*(\mathcal{H})$ for some open subgroupoid $\mathcal{H}\leq \mathcal{G}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this review paper, we describe the use of couplings in several different mathematical problems. We consider the total variation norm, maximal coupling, and the $\bar{d}$-distance. We present a detailed proof of a result recently proved: the dual of the Ruelle operator is a contraction with respect to $1$-Wasserstein distance. We also show exponential convergence to equilibrium in the state space for finite-state Markov chains when the transition matrix $\mathcal{P}$ has all entries positive.}
  In this new version, we describe in more detail the line of reasoning followed in the work previously published as a chapter in ``Modeling, Dynamics, Optimization and Bioeconomics II'', Springer Verlag (2017).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this short note, we prove a global Pestov identity on the (orthonormal) frame bundle of a Riemannian manifold and deduce similar identities on associated homogeneous fibrations. As a particular example, this provides a concise proof of the Pestov identity on the unit tangent bundle of the manifold.</description>

      <title>Weighted multiple ergodic averages via analytic observables over $ \mathbb{T}^\infty $: Is exponential pointwise convergence universal?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02866v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By employing an accelerated weighting method, we establish arbitrary polynomial and exponential pointwise convergence for multiple ergodic averages under general balancing conditions in both discrete and continuous settings, including quasi-periodic and almost periodic cases. This work breaks the well-known slow convergence rate observed in classical ergodic theory. We also present joint Diophantine rotations as explicit applications. Specifically, for the first time, by excluding nearly rational rotations with zero measure, we address the fundamental question of whether exponential pointwise convergence via analytic observables is universal, even when multiplicatively averaging over the infinite-dimensional torus $ \mathbb{T}^\infty $. We achieve this by introducing an innovative approach that effectively overcomes the previous difficulties. Moreover, by constructing counterexamples concerning multiple ergodicity, we highlight the indispensability of the joint nonresonance and establish the optimality of our weighting method in preserving rapid convergence. We also provide numerical simulations and analysis to further illustrate and validate our results.</description>

      <title>Rapid mixing and superpolynomial equidistribution for torus extensions of hyperbolic flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11367v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study mixing rates for $\mathbb{T}^{d}$-extensions of hyperbolic flows. Given three closed orbits with their holonomies, we can relate them to a point in $\mathbb{R}^{d+1}$. We prove that the extension flow enjoys rapid mixing, if the associated point is an inhomogeneously Diophantine number. Under the same assumption, we also obtain the superpolynomial equidistribution, namely, a superpolynomial error term in the equidistribution of the holonomy around closed orbits. Lastly, we apply these results to a class of three-dimensional frame flows.</description>

      <title>The multilinear circle method and a question of Bergelson</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09478v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $k\in \mathbb Z_+$ and $(X, \mathcal B(X), \mu)$ be a probability space equipped with a family of commuting invertible measure-preserving transformations $T_1,\ldots, T_k \colon X\to X$. Let $P_1,\ldots, P_k\in\mathbb Z[\rm n]$ be polynomials with integer coefficients and distinct degrees. We establish pointwise almost everywhere convergence of the multilinear polynomial ergodic averages \[A_{N; X, T_1,\ldots, T_k}^{P_1,\ldots, P_k}(f_1,\ldots, f_k)(x) = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^Nf_1\big(T_1^{P_1(n)}x\big)\cdots f_k\big(T_k^{P_k(n)}x\big), \qquad x\in X, \]cas $N\to\infty$ for any functions $f_1, \ldots, f_k\in L^{\infty}(X)$. Besides a couple of results in the bilinear setting (when $k=2$ and then only for single transformations), this is the first pointwise result for general polynomial multilinear ergodic averages in arbitrary measure-preserving systems. This answers a question of Bergelson from 1996 in the affirmative for any polynomials with distinct degrees, and makes progress on the Furstenberg-Bergelson-Leibman conjecture.
  In this paper, we build a versatile multilinear circle method by developing the Ionescu-Wainger multiplier theorem for the set of canonical fractions, which gives a positive answer to a question of Ionescu and Wainger from 2005. We also establish sharp multilinear $L^p$-improving bounds and an inverse theorem in higher order Fourier analysis for averages over polynomial corner configurations, which we use to establish a multilinear analogue of Weyl's inequality and its real counterpart, a Sobolev smoothing inequality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04475v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Omega$ and $M$ be compact smooth manifolds and let $\Theta:\Omega\times M\to\Omega\times M$ be a $\mathcal C^{1+\alpha}$ skew-product diffeomorphism over a transitive Anosov base. We show that $\Theta$ has at most countably many ergodic hyperbolic measures of maximal relative entropy. When $\dim M=2$, if $\Theta$ has positive relative topological entropy, then $\Theta$ has at most countably many ergodic measures of maximal relative entropy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04948v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show ergodicity of (asymmetric) lemon billiards, billiard tables that are the intersection of two circles of which one contains the centers of both. These do not satisfy the Wojtkowski criteria for hyperbolicity, but we establish \emph{uniform} expansion of vectors in an invariant cone family and alignment of singularity curves. Both of these are difficult, and the approach to the latter seems new. Together, these properties imply ergodicity.</description>

      <title>Ergodic averages for sparse corners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27627v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a framework for the study of the limiting behavior of multiple ergodic averages with commuting transformations when all iterates are given by the same sparse sequence; this enables us to partially resolve several longstanding problems. First, we address a special case of the joint intersectivity question of Bergelson, Leibman, and Lesigne by giving necessary and sufficient conditions under which the multidimensional polynomial Szemer\'edi theorem holds for length-three patterns. Second, we show that for two commuting transformations, the Furstenberg averages remain unchanged when the iterates are taken along sparse sequences such as $[n^c]$ for a positive noninteger $c$, advancing a conjecture of the first author. Third, we extend a result of Chu on popular common differences in linear corners to polynomial and Hardy corners. Lastly, we answer open problems of Le, Moreira, and Richter concerning decomposition results for double correlation sequences. Our toolbox includes recent degree lowering and seminorm smoothing techniques, the machinery of magic extensions of Host, and novel structured extensions motivated by works of Tao and Leng. Combined, these techniques reduce the analysis to settings where the Host-Kra theory of characteristic factors and equidistribution on nilmanifolds yield a family of striking identities from which our main results follow.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07642v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the dynamics of set-valued maps whose graphs are open and such that the image of each point is an open and connected set. Building upon the work of P. Duarte and M. Torres, who introduced and analyzed the combinatorial structure of the final recurrent set, we incorporate the notions of transitivity and mixing, thereby bringing their framework into the spirit of Smale's spectral decomposition theorem. We also demonstrate that such maps exhibit infinite topological entropy, and we establish a connection between transitive open set-valued maps and transitive Anosov diffeomorphisms.</description>

      <title>On topological properties of closed attractors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The notion of an attractor has various definitions in the theory of dynamical systems. Under compactness assumptions, several of those definitions coincide and the theory is rather complete. However, without compactness, the picture becomes blurry. To improve our understanding, we characterize in this work when a closed, not necessarily compact, asymptotically stable attractor on a locally compact metric space is homotopy equivalent to its domain of attraction. This enables a further structural study of the corresponding feedback stabilization problem.</description>

      <title>Linear dynamics of random products of operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00186v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the linear dynamics of the random sequence $(T_n(.))_{n \geq 1}$ of the operators $T_n(\omega) = T(\tau^{n-1}\omega) \dotsm T(\tau \omega) T(\omega), n \geq 1$. These products depend on an ergodic measure-preserving transformation $\tau : \mathbb{T} \to \mathbb{T}$ on the probability space $(\mathbb{T}, m)$ and on a strongly measurable map $T : \mathbb{T} \to \mathcal{B}(X)$, where $X$ is a separable Fr\'echet space. We will be focusing on the case where $T(\omega)$ is equal to an operator $T_1$ on $X$ for every $\omega \in A_1$ and equal to an operator $T_2$ on $X$ for every $\omega \in A_2$, where $A_1, A_2$ are two disjoint Borel subsets of $[0,1)$ such that $A_1 \cup A_2 = [0,1)$ and $m(A_k) &gt; 0$ for $k = 1,2$. More precisely, we will be focusing on the case where the operators $T_1$ and $T_2$ are adjoints of multiplication operators on the Hardy space $H^2(\mathbb{D})$, as well as the case where $T_1$ and $T_2$ are entire functions of exponential type of the derivation operator on the space of entire functions. Finally, we will study the linear dynamics of a case of a random product $T_n(\omega)$ for which the operators $T(\tau^i \omega), i \geq 0$, do not commute. We will give particular importance to the case where the ergodic transformation is an irrational rotation or the doubling map on $\mathbb{T}$.</description>

      <title>On $q$-Analogs of the $3x+1$ Dynamical System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10153v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $3x+1$ Conjecture asserts that the $T$-orbit of every positive integer $x$ contains $1$, where $T$ maps $x$ to $x/2$ for $x$ even and to $(3x+1)/2$ for $x$ odd. Several authors have studied the analogous map, $T_q$, which maps $x\in F_2[q]$ to $x/q$ if $q$ divides $x$ and $((1+q)x+1)/q$ otherwise. In particular, they showed that the $T_q$-orbit of every polynomial contains $1$. This seems analogous to the $3x+1$ conjecture, but does not prove the conjecture itself, as the dynamical systems involved are not conjugate via any correspondence between polynomials and positive integers.
  In this paper, we show that $T_q$ actually is conjugate to $T$ if we extend their domains to the ring of formal power series $F_2[[q]]$ and the 2-adic integers $\mathbb{Z}_2$, respectively. Thus, it is not polynomials that correspond to positive integers via conjugacy, but rather certain formal power series.
  We then generalize this result to the family of functions $T_{A,B}\colon F_2[[q]]\to F_2[[q]]$ mapping $x$ to $x/q$ if $q$ divides $x$ and $(Ax+B)/q$ otherwise, where $A,B\in F_2[[q]]$ are not divisible by $q$. Unlike $T_q$, some of these maps do have the property that polynomials correspond to the positive integers whose $T$-orbit contains $1$ via a conjugacy with $T$. We show that $T_{1,1+q^2}$ is one such map, and has the additional nice property that the orbit of every polynomial enters either the unique $2$-cycle or one of the two fixed points.
  Finally, the power series that correspond to the natural numbers via these conjugacies can be represented as rational numbers with odd denominators by replacing $q$ with $2$ and interpreting the resulting formal series as a 2-adic integer. Finding a simple closed form for even one such correspondence could settle the conjecture itself, and we provide some data along these lines for both $T_{1,1+q^2}$ and $T_q$.</description>

      <title>Properness and finiteness of totally geodesic submanifolds in the convex core</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09377v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study totally geodesic submanifolds in the convex core of geometrically finite rank-one locally symmetric manifolds. Although the infinite-volume setting can exhibit highly complicated behavior, including geodesic planes with fractal closures, we show that a strong rigidity persists inside the convex core. This rigidity has striking consequences in the infinite volume setting: every maximal totally geodesic submanifold of dimension at least two contained in the convex core is properly immersed and has finite volume, and only finitely many such submanifolds can occur. These results stand in sharp contrast to the behavior in the finite-volume setting. Moreover, combining this finiteness result with the work of Bader-Fisher-Miller-Stover and of Gromov-Schoen, we deduce that any geometrically finite rank-one manifold with infinitely many maximal totally geodesic submanifolds of dimension at least two and of finite volume must be arithmetic.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Sampling: A Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamical sampling refers to a class of problems in which space-time samples are taken from a signal evolving under an underlying dynamical system. The goal is to use these samples to recover relevant information about the system, such as the initial state, the evolution operator, or the sources and sinks driving the dynamics. These problems are tightly connected to frame theory, operator theory, functional analysis, and other foundational areas of mathematics; they also give rise to new theoretical questions and have applications across engineering and the sciences. This survey provides an overview of the theoretical underpinnings of dynamical sampling, summarizes recent results, and outlines directions for future work, including open problems and conjectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11246v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article explores the properties of an SEIR$^{\text{T}}$R$^{\text{P}}$D endemic model expressed through delay-differential equations with distributed delays for latency and temporary immunity. Our research delves into the variability of latent periods and immunity durations across diseases, in particular, we introduce a class of delays defined by continuous integral kernels with compact support. The main result of the paper is a kind of smoothening property which the solution function posesses under mild conditions of the system parameter functions. Also, boundedness and non-negativity is proved. Numerical simulations indicates that the continuous model can be approximated with a discrete lag endemic models. The study contributes to understanding infectious disease dynamics and provides insights into the numerical approximation of exact solution for different delay scenarios.</description>
