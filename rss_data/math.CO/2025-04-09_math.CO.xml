      <title>Homogeneous linear recurrence relations of the determinants of distance matrices of trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1971, by induction on $n$ and using a two-term linear recurrence relation, Graham and Pollak got a beautiful formula $$\det(D_n)=-(n-1)(-2)^{n-2}$$ on the determinant of distance matrix $D_n$ of a tree $T_n$ on $n$ vertices. The recurrence relations are very crucial when proving this formula by inductive method: in 2006, Yan and Yeh used two-term and three-term recurrence relations; in 2020, Du and Yeh used a homogeneous linear three-term recurrence relation. In this paper, we analyze the subtree structure of the tree and find four-term, five-term, six-term and seven-term homogeneous linear recurrence relations on $\det(D_n)$, as a corollary new proofs of Graham and Pollak's formula can be given.</description>

      <title>A Note on ID-Colorings and Symmetric Colorings of Cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A red-white coloring of a nontrivial connected graph $G$ is an assignment of red and white colors to the vertices of~$G$. Associated with each vertex $v$ of $G$ of diameter $d$ is a $d$-vector, called the code of $v$, whose $i$th coordinate is the number of red vertices at distance $i$ from $v$. A red-white coloring of $G$ for which distinct vertices have distinct codes is called an ID-coloring of $G$. In 2025, a criterion to determine whether a red-white coloring of a path is an ID-coloring or not was presented by Kono, with the aid of a result shown by Marcelo et al. in 2024. The criterion utilizes the fact that ID-colorings of paths are ``opposite'' of colorings with a certain symmetry. In this paper, we establish a similar criterion that can be applied for cycles whose order is a prime number at least 3. In order to do so, we employ an analogous approaches used for the criterion for paths, i.e., we pay attention to symmetries of given red-white colorings of cycles.</description>

      <title>Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado Theorems for Paths in Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A family of sets is $s$-intersecting if every pair of its sets has at least $s$ elements in common. It is an $s$-star if all its members have some $s$ elements in common. A family of sets is called $s$-EKR
  if all its $s$-intersecting subfamilies have size at most that of some $s$-star. For example, the classic 1961 Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado theorem states essentially that the family of $r$-sized subsets of $\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$ is $s$-EKR when $n$ is a large enough function of $r$ and $s$, and the 1967 Hilton-Milner theorem provides the near-star structure of the largest non-star intersecting family of such sets. Two important conjectures along these lines followed: by Chv\'atal in 1974, that every family of sets that all subsets of its members is 1-EKR, and by Holroyd and Talbot in 2005, that, for every graph, the family of all its $r$-sized independent sets is 1-EKR when every maximal independent set has size at least $2r$.
  In this paper we present similar 1-EKR results for families of length-$r$ paths in graphs, specifically for sun graphs, which are cycles with pendant edges attached in a uniform way, and theta graphs, which are collections of pairwise internally disjoint paths sharing the same two endpoints. We also prove $s$-EKR results for such paths in suns, and give a Hilton-Milner type result for them as well. A set is a transversal of a family of sets if it intersects each member of the family, and the transversal number of the family is the size of its smallest transversal. For example, stars have transversal number 1, and the Hilton-Milner family has transversal number 2. We conclude the paper with some transversal results involving what we call triangular families, including a few results for projective planes.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Type $A$ Root Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a type $A$ root system $\Phi$ of rank $n$, we introduce the concept of a signature for each subset $S$ of $\Phi$ consisting of $n+1$ positive roots. For a subset $S$ represented by a tuple $(\beta_1, \ldots, \beta_{n+1})$, the signature of $S$ is defined as an unordered pair $\{a, b\}$, where $a$ and $b$ denote the numbers of $1$s and $-1$s, respectively, among the cofactors $(-1)^k \det(S \setminus \{\beta_k\})$ for $1 \le k \le n+1$. We prove that the number of tuples with a given signature can be expressed in terms of classical Eulerian numbers. The study of these signatures is motivated by their connections to the arithmetic and combinatorial properties of cones over deformed arrangements defined by $\Phi$, including the Shi, Catalan, Linial, and Ish arrangements. We apply our main result to compute two important invariants of these arrangements: The minimum period of the characteristic quasi-polynomial, and the evaluation of the classical and arithmetic Tutte polynomials at $(1, 1)$.</description>

      <title>On the structure of modular lattices -- Axioms for gluing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores alternative statements of the axioms for lattice gluing, focusing on lattices that are modular, locally finite, and have finite covers, but may have infinite height. We give a set of "maximal" axioms that maximize what can be immediately adduced about the structure of a valid gluing. We also give a set of "minimal" axioms that minimize what needs to be adduced to prove that a system of blocks is a valid gluing. This system appears to be novel in the literature. A distinctive feature of the minimal axioms is that they involve only relationships between elements of the skeleton which are within an interval $[x \wedge y, x \vee y]$ where either $x$ and $y$ cover $x \wedge y$ or they are covered by $x \vee y$. That is, they have a decidedly local scope, despite that the resulting sum lattice, being modular, has global structure, such as the diamond isomorphism theorem.</description>

      <title>RSK linear operators and the Vershik-Kerov-Logan-Shepp curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stelzer and Yong (2024) studied the Robinson-Schensted-Knuth (RSK) correspondence as a linear operator on the coordinate ring of matrices. They showed that this operator is block diagonal and conjectured that, in a special block, most diagonal entries vanish. We establish this conjecture by identifying these zeros with certain Schensted insertion interactions and analyzing them probabilistically using the Vershik-Kerov-Logan-Shepp Limit Shape Theorem.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions of the Erd\H{o}s-Gy\'{a}rf\'{a}s function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given positive integers $p,q$. For any integer $k\ge2$, an edge coloring of the complete $k$-graph $K_n^{(k)}$ is said to be a $(p,q)$-coloring if every copy of $K_p^{(k)}$ receives at least $q$ colors. The Erd\H{o}s-Gy\'{a}rf\'{a}s function $f_k(n,p,q)$ is the minimum number of colors that are needed for $K_n^{(k)}$ to have a $(p,q)$-coloring.
  Conlon, Fox, Lee and Sudakov (\emph{IMRN, 2015}) conjectured that for any positive integers $p, k$ and $i$ with $k\ge3$ and $1\le i&lt;k$, $f_k(n,p,{{p-i}\choose{k-i}})=(\log_{(i-1)}n)^{o(1)}$, where $\log_{(i)}n$ is an iterated $i$-fold logarithm in $n$. It has been verified to be true for $k=3, p=4, i=1$ by Conlon et. al (\emph{IMRN, 2015}), for $k=3, p=5, i=2$ by Mubayi (\emph{JGT, 2016}), and for all $k\ge 4, p=k+1,i=1$ by B. Janzer and O. Janzer (\emph{JCTB, 2024}). In this paper, we give new constructions and show that this conjecture holds for infinitely many new cases, i.e., it holds for all $k\ge4$, $p=k+2$ and $i=k-1$.</description>

      <title>Integrability of Combinatorial Riemann Boundary Value Problem and Lattice Walk Avoiding a Quadrant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a general framework of matrix-form combinatorial Riemann boundary value problem (cRBVP) to characterize the integrability of functional equations arising in lattice walk enumeration. A matrix cRBVP is defined as integrable if it can be reduced to enough polynomial equations with one catalytic variable. Our central results establish that the integrability depends on the eigenspace of some matrix associated to the problem. For lattice walks in three quadrants, we demonstrate how the obstinate kernel method transforms discrete difference equations into $3 \times 3$ matrix cRBVPs. The special doubleroots eigenvalue 1/4 yields two independent polynomial equations in the problem. The other single-root eigenvalue yields a linear equation. Crucially, our framework generalizes three-quadrant walks with Weyl symmetry to models satisfying only orbit-sum conditions. It explains many criteria about the orbit-sum proposed by various researchers and also works for walks starting outside the quadrant.</description>

      <title>Characterization of $P_3$-connected graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any pair of edges $e,f$ of a graph $G$, we say that {\em $e,f$ are $P_3$-connected in $G$} if there exists a sequence of edges $e=e_0,e_1,\ldots, e_k=f$ such that $e_i$ and $e_{i+1}$ are two edges of an induced $3$-vertex path in $G$ for every $0\leq i\leq k-1$. If every pair of edges of $G$ are $P_3$-connected in $G$, then $G$ is {\em $P_3$-connected}. $P_3$-connectivity was first defined by Chudnovsky et al. in 2024 to prove that every connected graph not containing $P_5$ as an induced subgraph has cop number at most two. In this paper, we give a characterization of $P_3$-connected graphs and prove that a simple graph is $P_3$-connected if and only if it is connected and has no homogeneous set whose induced subgraph contains an edge.</description>

      <title>Graph product and the stability of circulant graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph $\Gamma$ is said to be stable if $\mathrm{Aut}(\Gamma\times K_2)\cong\mathrm{Aut}(\Gamma)\times \mathbb{Z}_{2}$ and unstable otherwise. If an unstable graph is connected, non-bipartite and any two of its distinct vertices have different neighborhoods, then it is called nontrivially unstable. We establish conditions guaranteeing the instability of various graph products, including direct products, direct product bundles, Cartesian products, strong products, semi-strong products, and lexicographic products. Inspired by a condition for the instability of direct product bundles, we propose a new sufficient condition for circulant graphs to be unstable. This condition yields infinitely many nontrivially unstable circulant graphs that do not satisfy any previously established instability conditions for circulant graphs.</description>

      <title>New cosystolic high-dimensional expanders from KMS groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosystolic expansion is a high-dimensional generalization of the Cheeger constant for simplicial complexes. Originally, this notion was motivated by the fact that it implies the topological overlapping property, but more recently it was shown to be connected to problems in theoretical computer science such as list agreement expansion and agreement expansion in the low soundness regime.
  There are only a few constructions of high-dimensional cosystolic expanders and, in dimension larger than $2$, the only known constructions prior to our work were (co-dimension 1)-skeletons of quotients of affine buildings. In this paper, we give the first coset complex construction of cosystolic expanders for an arbitrary dimension. Our construction is more symmetric and arguably more elementary than the previous constructions relying on quotients of affine buildings.
  The coset complexes we consider arise from finite quotients of Kac--Moody--Steinberg (KMS) groups and are known as KMS complexes. KMS complexes were introduced in recent work by Grave de Peralta and Valentiner-Branth where it was shown that they are local-spectral expanders. Our result is that KMS complexes, satisfying some minor condition, give rise to infinite families of bounded degree cosystolic expanders of arbitrary dimension and for any finitely generated Abelian coefficient group.
  This result is achieved by observing that proper links of KMS complexes are joins of opposition complexes in spherical buildings. In order to show that these opposition complexes are coboundary expanders, we develop a new method for constructing cone functions by iteratively adding sets of vertices. Hence we show that the links of KMS complexes are coboundary expanders. Using the prior local-to-global results, we obtain cosystolic expansion for the (co-dimension 1)-skeletons of the KMS complexes.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper explores combinatorial properties of Fibonacci words and their generalizations within the framework of combinatorics on words. These infinite sequences, measures the diversity of subwords in Fibonacci words, showing non-decreasing growth for infinite sequences. Extends factor analysis to arithmetic progressions of symbols, highlighting generalized pattern distributions. Recent results link Sturmian sequences (including Fibonacci words) to unbounded binomial complexity and gap inequivalence, with implications for formal language theory and automata. This work underscores the interplay between substitution rules, algebraic number theory, and combinatorial complexity in infinite words, providing tools for applications in fractal geometry and theoretical computer science.</description>

      <title>Totally equimodular matrices: decomposition and triangulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Totally equimodular matrices generalize totally unimodular matrices and arise in the context of box-total dual integral polyhedra. This work further explores the parallels between these two classes and introduces foundational building blocks for constructing totally equimodular matrices. Consequently, we present a decomposition theorem for totally equimodular matrices of full row rank.
  Building on this decomposition theorem, we prove that simplicial cones whose generators form the rows of a totally equimodular matrix sa\-tisfy strong integrality decomposition properties. More precisely, we provide the Hilbert basis for these cones and construct regular unimodular Hilbert triangulations in most cases. We conjecture that cases not covered here do not exist.</description>

Abstract: In [Acta Math. 161 (3--4) (1988) 279--303], Bj\"{o}rner and Kalai extended the classic Euler-Poincar\'{e} theorem by introducing certain nonlinear relations between the $f$-vector and the Betti sequence of simplicial complexes. In this paper, we present an equivalent characterization of Bj\"{o}rner and Kalai's nonlinear relations using a number-theoretic approach. Moreover, we strengthen a result of Bj\"{o}rner and Kalai concerning the maximal element of Betti sequences with respect to a fixed $f$-vector and the minimal element of $f$-vectors with respect to a fixed Betti sequence.</description>

      <title>On walk domination: Between different types of walks and $m_3$-path</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the domination relationships among various types of walks connecting two non-adjacent vertices in a graph. In particular, we center our attention on the problem which is proposed in [S. B. Tondato, Graphs Combin. 40 (2024)]. A \textit{\( uv \)-\( m_3 \) path} is a \( uv \)-induced path of length at least three. A walk between two non-adjacent vertices in a graph $G$ is called a weakly toll walk if the first and last vertices in the walk are adjacent only to the second and second-to-last vertices, respectively, and these intermediate vertices may appear more than once in the walk. And an $l_k$-path is an induced path of length at most $k$ between two non-adjacent vertices in a graph $G$. We study the domination between weakly toll walks, $l_k$-paths ($k\in \left\{2,3\right\}$) and different types of walks connecting two non-adjacent vertices $u$ and $v$ of a graph (shortest paths, tolled walks, weakly toll walks, $l_k$-paths for $k\in \left\{2,3\right\}$, $m_3$-path), and show how these give rise to characterizations of graph classes.</description>

      <title>On the Lipschitz continuity of the Spherical Cap Discrepancy around generic point sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spherical cap discrepancy is a prominent measure of uniformity for sets on the d-dimensional sphere. It is particularly important for estimating the integration error for certain classes of functions on the sphere. Building on a recently proven explicit formula for the spherical discrepancy, we show as a main result of this paper that this discrepancy is Lipschitz continuous in a neighbourhood of so-called generic point sets (as they are typical outcomes of Monte-Carlo sampling). This property may have some impact (both algorithmically and theoretically for deriving necessary optimality conditions) on optimal quantization, i.e., on finding point sets of fixed size on the sphere having minimum spherical discrepancy.</description>

      <title>Geometries with trialities arising from linear spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A triality is a sort of super-symmetry that exchanges the types of the elements of an incidence geometry in cycles of length three. Although geometries with trialities exhibit fascinating behaviors, their construction is challenging, making them rare in the literature. To understand trialities more deeply, it is crucial to have a wide variety of examples at hand. In this article, we introduce a general method for constructing various rank-three incidence systems with trialities. Specifically, for any rank two incidence system $\Gamma$, we define its triangle complex $\Delta(\Gamma)$, a rank three incidence system whose elements consist of three copies of the flags (pairs of incident elements) of $\Gamma$. This triangle complex always admits a triality that cyclically permutes the three copies. We then explore in detail the properties of the triangle complex when $\Gamma$ is a linear space, including flag-transitivity, the existence of dualities, and connectivity properties. As a consequence of our work, this construction yields the first infinite family of thick, flag-transitive and residually connected geometries with trialities but no dualities.</description>

      <title>$K_4^-$-free triple systems without large stars in the complement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $n$-star $S_n$ is the $n$-vertex triple system with ${n-1 \choose 2}$ edges all of which contain a fixed vertex, and $K_4^-$ is the unique triple system with four vertices and three edges. We prove that the Ramsey number $r(K_4^-, S_n)$ has order of magnitude $n^2 /\log n$.
  This confirms a conjecture of Conlon, Fox, He, Suk, Verstra\"ete and the first author. It also generalizes the well-known bound of Kim for the graph Ramsey number $r(3,n)$, as the link of any vertex in a $K_4^-$-free triple system is a triangle-free graph. Our method builds on the approach of Guo and Warnke who adapted Kim's lower bound for $r(3,n)$ to the pseudorandom setting.</description>

      <title>Grassmannian Persistence Diagrams of 1-Parameter Filtrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the discriminative power of Grassmannian persistence diagrams of 1-parameter filtrations, examine their relationships with other related constructions, and study their computational aspects. Grassmannian persistence diagrams are defined through Orthogonal Inversion, a notion analogous to M\"obius inversion. We focus on the behavior of this inversion for the poset of segments of a linear poset. We demonstrate how Grassmannian persistence diagrams of 1-parameter filtrations are connected to persistent Laplacians via a variant of orthogonal inversion tailored for the reverse-inclusion order on the poset of segments. Additionally, we establish an explicit isomorphism between Grassmannian persistence diagrams and Harmonic Barcodes via a projection. Finally, we show that degree-0 Grassmannian persistence diagrams are equivalent to treegrams, a generalization of dendrograms. Consequently, we conclude that finite ultrametric spaces can be recovered from the degree-0 Grassmannian persistence diagram of their Vietoris-Rips filtrations.</description>

      <title>Totally Disjoint 3-Digit Decimal Check Digit Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1969 J. Verhoeff provided the first examples of a decimal error detecting code using a single check digit to provide protection against all single, transposition and adjacent twin errors. The three versions of such a code that he presented are length 3-digit codes with 2 information digits. Existence of a 4-digit code would imply the existence of 10 such disjoint 3-digit codes. This paper presents 3 pairwise disjoint 3-digit codes. The codes developed herein, have the property that the knowledge of the multiset of digits included in a word is sufficient to determine the entire codeword even though their positions were unknown. Thus the codes are permutation-free, and this fulfills his desire to eliminate cyclic errors. Phonetic errors, where 2 digit pairs of the forms X0 and 1X are interchanged, are also eliminated.</description>

      <title>An analogue of the Herbrand-Ribet theorem in graph theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study an analogue of the Herbrand-Ribet theorem, and its refinement by Mazur and Wiles, in graph theory. For an odd prime number $p$, we let $\mathbb{F}_{p}$ and $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ denote the finite field with $p$ elements and the ring of $p$-adic integers, respectively. We consider Galois covers $Y/X$ of finite graphs with Galois group $\Delta$ isomorphic to $\mathbb{F}_{p}^{\times}$. Given a $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$-valued character of $\Delta$, we relate the cardinality of the corresponding character component of the $p$-primary subgroup of the degree zero Picard group of $Y$ to the $p$-adic absolute value of the special value at $u=1$ of the corresponding Artin-Ihara $L$-function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel and exact algorithm for generating connected Erdos-Renyi random graphs $G(n, p)$. Our approach exploits a link between the distribution of exploration process trajectories and an inhomogeneous random walk. In contrast to existing methods, our approach guarantees the correct distribution under the connectivity condition and achieves $O(n^2)$ runtime in the sparse case $p = c/n$. Furthermore, we show that our method can be extended to uniformly generate connected graphs $G(n, m)$ via an acceptance-rejection procedure.</description>

      <title>Toric ideals of graphs minimally generated by a Gr\"obner basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Describing families of ideals that are minimally generated by at least one, or by all, of their reduced Gr\"obner bases is a central topic in commutative algebra. In this paper, we address this problem in the context of toric ideals of graphs. We say that a graph $G$ is an MG-graph if its toric ideal $I_G$ is minimally generated by some Gr\"obner basis, and a UMG-graph if every reduced Gr\"obner basis of $I_G$ forms a minimal generating set. We prove that a graph $G$ is a UMG-graph if and only if its toric ideal $I_G$ is a generalized robust ideal (that is, its universal Gr\"obner basis coincides with its universal Markov basis). Although the class of MG-graphs is not closed under taking subgraphs, we prove that it is hereditary, that is, closed under taking induced subgraphs. In addition, we describe two families of bipartite MG-graphs: ring graphs (which correspond to complete intersection toric ideals, as shown by Gitler, Reyes, and Villarreal) and graphs in which all chordless cycles have the same length. The latter extends a result of Ohsugi and Hibi, which corresponds to graphs whose chordless cycles are all of length $4$.</description>

More precisely, for every graph $H$, there exists $\epsilon &gt; 0$ such that every $n$-vertex graph with no pivot-minor isomorphic to $H$ contains two sets $A, B$ of vertices such that $|A|, |B| \ge \epsilon n$ and $A$ is complete or anticomplete to $B$.</description>

This completes the verification of the Erd\H{o}s-Hajnal property of all five-vertex graphs.

We prove that $R(K_6 - e, K_4) = 30$. Our technique is based on the recent approach of Angeltveit and McKay and on older algorithms of McKay and Radziszowski.</description>

      <title>Trail Trap: a variant of Partizan Edge Geography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05195v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a two-player game played on undirected graphs called {\sc Trail Trap}, which is a variant of a game known as {\sc Partizan Edge Geography}. One player starts by choosing any edge and moving a token from one endpoint to the other; the other player then chooses a different edge and does the same. Alternating turns, each player moves their token along an unused edge from its current vertex to an adjacent vertex, until one player cannot move and loses. We present an algorithm to determine which player has a winning strategy when the graph is a tree and partially characterize the trees on which a given player wins. Additionally, we show that it is NP-hard to determine if Player~2 has a winning strategy on {\sc Trail Trap}, even for connected bipartite planar graphs with maximum degree $4$. We determine which player has a winning strategy for certain subclasses of complete bipartite graphs and grid graphs, and we propose several open problems for further study.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05483v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fink, M\'esz\'aros and St.Dizier showed that the Schubert polynomial $\mathfrak{S}_w(x)$ is zero-one if and only if $w$ avoids twelve permutation patterns. In this paper, we prove that the Grothendieck polynomial $\mathfrak{G}_w(x)$ is zero-one, i.e., with coefficients either 0 or $\pm$1, if and only if $w$ avoids six patterns. As applications, we show that the normalized double Schubert polynomial $N(\mathfrak{S}_w(x;y))$ is Lorentzian when $\mathfrak{G}_w(x)$ is zero-one, partially confirming a conjecture of Huh, Matherne, M\'esz\'aros and St.Dizier. Moreover, we verify several conjectures on the support and coefficients of Grothendieck polynomials posed by M\'{e}sz\'{a}ros, Setiabrata and St.Dizier for the case of zero-one Grothendieck polynomials.</description>

Abstract: We devise an explicit method for computing combinatorial formulae for Hadamard products of certain rational generating functions. The latter arise naturally when studying so-called ask zeta functions of direct sums of modules of matrices or class- and orbit-counting zeta functions of direct products of nilpotent groups. Our method relies on shuffle compatibility of coloured permutation statistics and coloured quasisymmetric functions, extending recent work of Gessel and Zhuang.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09830v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the concepts of positive and negative $p$-energies of graphs and investigate their behavior under edge addition. Specifically, we generalize the classical notions of positive and negative square energies to the $p$-energy setting, denoted by $\mathcal{E}_p^{+}(G)$ and $\mathcal{E}_p^{-}(G)$, respectively. We establish improved lower bounds for these quantities under edge addition, which sharpen existing results by Abiad et al.\ in the case $p=2$. Furthermore, we address the monotonicity problem for $\mathcal{E}_p^{+}(G)$ under edge addition, and construct a family of counterexamples showing that monotonicity fails for $1 \leq p &lt; 3$. Finally, we conclude with several open problems for further investigation.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19654v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study some properties of the growth rate of $\mathcal{L}(\mathcal{A},\mathcal{F})$, that is, the language of words over the alphabet $\mathcal{A}$ avoiding the set of forbidden factors $\mathcal{F}$. We first provide a sufficient condition on $\mathcal{F}$ and $\mathcal{A}$ for the growth of $\mathcal{L}(\mathcal{A},\mathcal{F})$ to be boundedly supermultiplicative. That is, there exist constants $C&gt;0$ and $\alpha\ge0$, such that for all $n$, the number of words of length $n$ in $\mathcal{L}(\mathcal{A},\mathcal{F})$ is between $\alpha^n$ and $C\alpha^n$. In some settings, our condition provides a way to compute $C$, which implies that $\alpha$, the growth rate of the language, is also computable whenever our condition holds.
  We also apply our technique to the specific setting of power-free words where the argument can be slightly refined to provide better bounds. Finally, we apply a similar idea to $\mathcal{F}$-free circular words and in particular we make progress toward a conjecture of Shur about the number of square-free circular words.</description>

      <title>Hypercurveball algorithm for sampling hypergraphs with fixed degrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Comparative analysis between a network and a random graph model can uncover network properties that significantly deviate from those in random networks. The standard random graph model used for comparison uniformly samples random graphs with the same degrees as the network data, often achieved through edge-swap algorithms. However, for hypergraphs, fewer such methodologies are available. This study introduces the Hypercurveball algorithm, designed to sample random, potentially directed, hypergraphs with fixed degrees. Minor adjustments enable the sampling of hypergraphs without degenerate hyperedges, self-loops, or multi-hyperedges. For most of these algorithms, we prove whether they sample uniformly or with bias. We experimentally show that the Hypercurveball algorithm can be significantly faster or slower than the standard hyperedge-shuffling algorithm, which is the hyperedge-equivalent of the edge-swap algorithm. We present criteria on the hypergraph degree sequence that indicate when the Hypercurveball algorithm is more efficient than the standard hyperedge-shuffling method. Finally, our experimental results suggest polynomial scaling of the mixing time for both the Hypercurveball and hyperedge-shuffling algorithms.</description>

      <title>Graphs with Independent Exact $r$-covers for all $r$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For every natural number $d$, we construct finite $d$-regular simple graphs that, for every $r \le d$, contain an independent exact $r$-cover. This answers a question of Gray and Johnson that arose in their study of 2-step transit probabilities.
  We obtain some divisibility conditions on the order $n$ of graphs that for every $r \le d$ contain an independent exact $r$-cover, and give constructions for $d=3, 4, 5, 6$ where the order of the graph is minimal (we deduce this minimality from our divisibility conditions). We construct these graphs as common coverings of smaller graphs. We revisit a result of Angluin and Gardiner on finite common coverings of two regular graphs of the same degree, and the result of Gross that regular graphs of even degree are Schreier coset graphs. We combine both results to provide a finite common covering of two regular graphs of the same degree, that uses fewer vertices than the construction of Angluin and Gardiner in some cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$, a set is $\Delta$-convex if there is no vertex $u\in V(G)\setminus S$ forming a triangle with two vertices of $S$. The $\Delta$-convex hull of $S$ is the minimum $\Delta$-convex set containing $S$. This article is an attempt to discuss the Carath\'eodory number and exchange number on various graph families and standard graph products namely Cartesian, strong and, lexicographic products of graphs.</description>

      <title>Cointeraction on noncrossing partitions and related polynomial invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the structure of two cointeracting bialgebras on noncrossing partitions appearing in the theory of free probability. The first coproduct is given by separation of the blocks of the partitions into two parts, with respect to the nestings, while the second one is given by fusion of blocks. This structure implies the existence of a unique polynomial invariant respecting the product and both coproducts. We give a combinatorial interpretation of this invariant, study its values at -1 and use it for the computation of the antipode. We also give several results on its coefficients when applied to noncrossing partitions with no nesting. This leads to unexpected links with harmonic nested sums, Riordan arrays, composition of formal series and generalized Stirling numbers. This polynomial invariant is shown to be related to other ones, counting increasing or strictly increasing maps for the nesting order on noncrossing partitions, through the action of several characters.</description>

Abstract: A word $w_1w_2\cdots w_n$ is said to be up-down if $w_1 &lt; w_2 &gt;w_3 \cdots$. Carlitz and Scoville found the generating function for the number of up-down words over an alphabet of size $k$. Using properties of the Chebyshev polynomials we derive a closed-form formula for these numbers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rational Dyck paths are the rational generalization of classical Dyck paths. They play an important role in Catalan combinatorics, and have multiple applications in algebra and geometry. Two statistics over rational Dyck paths called run and ratio-run are introduced. They both have symmetric joint distributions with the return statistic. We give combinatorial proofs and algebraic proofs of the symmetries, generalizing a result of Li and Lin.</description>

      <title>Graph Laplacians with Higher Accuracy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04461v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by discrete Laplacian differential operators with various accuracy orders in numerical analysis, we introduce new matrices attached to a simple graph that can be considered graph Laplacians with higher accuracy. In particular, we show that the number of graphs having cospectral mates with these matrices is significantly less than the ones with other known matrices. We also investigate their spectral properties and explicitly compute their eigenvalues and eigenvectors for some graphs. Along the line, we also prove the existence of a weighted signed graph with given Laplacian eigenvalues.</description>

Abstract: We show that the generalized Ricci tensor of a weighted complete Riemannian manifold can be retrieved asymptotically from a scaled metric derivative of Wasserstein 1-distances between normalized weighted local volume measures. As an application, we demonstrate that the limiting coarse curvature of random geometric graphs sampled from Poisson point process with non-uniform intensity converges to the generalized Ricci tensor.</description>

      <title>Unbounded Error Correcting Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional error-correcting codes (ECCs) assume a fixed message length, but many scenarios involve ongoing or indefinite transmissions where the message length is not known in advance. For example, when streaming a video, the user should be able to fix a fraction of errors that occurred before any point in time. We introduce unbounded error-correcting codes (unbounded codes), a natural generalization of ECCs that supports arbitrarily long messages without a predetermined length. An unbounded code with rate $R$ and distance $\varepsilon$ ensures that for every sufficiently large $k$, the message prefix of length $Rk$ can be recovered from the code prefix of length $k$ even if an adversary corrupts up to an $\varepsilon$ fraction of the symbols in this code prefix.
  We study unbounded codes over binary alphabets in the regime of small error fraction $\varepsilon$, establishing nearly tight upper and lower bounds on their optimal rate. Our main results show that: (1) The optimal rate of unbounded codes satisfies $R&lt;1-\Omega(\sqrt{\varepsilon})$ and $R&gt;1-O(\sqrt{\varepsilon \log \log(1/\varepsilon)})$. (2) Surprisingly, our construction is inherently non-linear, as we prove that linear unbounded codes achieve a strictly worse rate of $R=1-\Theta(\sqrt{\varepsilon \log(1/\varepsilon)})$. (3) In the setting of random noise, unbounded codes achieve the same optimal rate as standard ECCs, $R=1-\Theta(\varepsilon \log(1/\varepsilon))$.
  These results demonstrate fundamental differences between standard and unbounded codes.</description>

      <title>Central limit theorems for linear spectral statistics of inhomogeneous random graphs with graphon limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19352v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish central limit theorems (CLTs) for the linear spectral statistics of the adjacency matrix of inhomogeneous random graphs across all sparsity regimes, providing explicit covariance formulas under the assumption that the variance profile of the random graphs converges to a graphon limit. Two types of CLTs are derived for the (non-centered) adjacency matrix and the centered adjacency matrix, with different scaling factors when the sparsity parameter $p$ satisfies $np = n^{\Omega(1)}$, and with the same scaling factor when $np = n^{o(1)}$. In both cases, the limiting covariance is expressed in terms of homomorphism densities from certain types of finite graphs to a graphon. These results highlight a phase transition in the centering effect for global eigenvalue fluctuations. For the non-centered adjacency matrix, we also identify new phase transitions for the CLTs in the sparse regime when $n^{1/m} \ll np \ll n^{1/(m-1)}$ for $m \geq 2$. Furthermore, weaker conditions for the graphon convergence of the variance profile are sufficient as $p$ decreases from being constant to $np \to c\in (0,\infty)$. These findings reveal a novel connection between graphon limits and linear spectral statistics in random matrix theory.</description>
