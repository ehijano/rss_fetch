      <title>Eye2Heart : a validated lumped-parameter model bridging cardiovascular and ocular dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cardiovascular and ocular systems are intricately connected, with hemodynamic interactions playing a crucial role in both physiological regulation and pathological conditions. However, existing models often treat these systems separately, limiting the understanding of their interdependence. In this study, we present the Eye2Heart model, a novel closed-loop mathematical framework that integrates cardiovascular and ocular dynamics. Using an electricalhydraulic analogy, the model describes the interactions between the heart and retinal circulation through a system of ordinary differential equations. The model is validated against clinical and experimental data, demonstrating its ability to reproduce key cardiovascular parameters (e.g., stroke volume, cardiac output) and ocular hemodynamics (e.g., retinal blood flow). Additionally, we explore in silico the effects of intraocular pressure (IOP) and left ventricular compliance on both local ocular and global systemic circulation, revealing critical dependencies between cardiovascular and ocular health. The results highlight the model's potential for studying cardiovascular diseases with ocular manifestations, paving the way for patient-specific data integration and expanding applications in personalized medicine.</description>

      <title>Multi-Frequency Reverberant Shear Waves for Assessing Tissue Dispersion in Optical Coherence Elastography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical coherence elastography (OCE) is a powerful non-invasive imaging technique for high-resolution assessment of tissue elasticity and viscoelasticity. Accurate characterization of viscoelastic properties requires estimating shear wave speed (SWS) across multiple frequencies, as dispersion induces frequency-dependent variations in wave speed. This study introduces a novel multi-frequency reverberant OCE (MFR-OCE) approach to enhance viscoelastic tissue characterization by simultaneously capturing shear wave dynamics over multiple frequencies. We present the theoretical framework, experimental setup, and validation of MFR-OCE through simulations and experiments on gelatin phantoms, ex vivo porcine cornea, and ex vivo bovine liver. Simulation results demonstrate that MFR-OCE estimates SWS with errors below 4% relative to ground truth, and phantom experimental results show that MFR-OCE and single-frequency OCE also yield closely matching SWS estimates, with differences below 3%. Furthermore, the frequency-dependent dispersion coefficients extracted from biological tissues and phantoms align with the theoretical viscoelastic power law model. The gelatin phantoms exhibit a low viscoelastic behavior with an exponent of 0.13 for the power law fit of SWS, while the ex vivo porcine cornea demonstrates intermediate viscoelastic behavior, with a power law exponent of 0.33. The liver tissue shows significant frequency dependence, with a power law exponent of 0.51. These findings demonstrate that MFR-OCE enables a more comprehensive understanding of tissue mechanics and holds the potential for improving diagnostic accuracy in clinical applications.</description>

      <title>Cerebral blood flow monitoring using a deep learning implementation of the two-layer DCS analytical model with a 512 512 SPAD array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) analyzes the autocorrelation function of photons scattered by red blood cells, enabling non-invasive, continuous measurement of deep tissue blood flow at the bedside. Multi-layer DCS models (two- and three-layer) enhance cerebral blood flow index (CBFi) sensitivity and mitigate interference from extracerebral tissues. However, these models require multiple predefined parameters and are computationally intensive, making them impractical for real-time bedside monitoring. To address this challenge, we integrate a single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) array with a deep learning (DL)-based approach trained on data generated by the two-layer analytical model. This method bypasses traditional model fitting, enabling real-time CBFi monitoring while minimizing superficial tissue contamination. We first validate our approach using Monte Carlo-simulated test datasets, demonstrating superior accuracy in relative CBFi estimation (5.8% error vs. 19.1% for conventional fitting) and enhanced CBFi sensitivity (87.1% vs. 55.4%). Additionally, our method effectively isolates shallow blood flow changes and 750-fold faster than single-exponential fitting in a realistic scenario. We further evaluate the system in a healthy adult, achieving real-time CBFi monitoring and pulsatile waveform recovery during a brain activity test using a 512 512 SPAD array sensor. These results highlight the potential of our approach for real-time brain activity monitoring.</description>

      <title>Direct3{\gamma}: A Pipeline for Direct Three-gamma PET Image Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18337v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel image reconstruction pipeline for three-gamma (3-{\gamma}) positron emission tomography (PET) aimed at improving spatial resolution and reducing noise in nuclear medicine. The proposed Direct3{\gamma} pipeline addresses the inherent challenges in 3-{\gamma} PET systems, such as detector imperfections and uncertainty in photon interaction points. A key feature of the pipeline is its ability to determine the order of interactions through a model trained on Monte Carlo (MC) simulations using the Geant4 Application for Tomography Emission (GATE) toolkit, thus providing the necessary information to construct Compton cones which intersect with the line of response (LOR) to provide an estimate of the emission point. The pipeline processes 3-{\gamma} PET raw data, reconstructs histoimages by propagating energy and spatial uncertainties along the LOR, and applies a 3-D convolutional neural network (CNN) to refine these intermediate images into high-quality reconstructions. To further enhance image quality, the pipeline leverages both supervised learning and adversarial losses, with the latter preserving fine structural details. Experimental results demonstrate that Direct3{\gamma} consistently outperforms conventional 200-ps time-of-flight (TOF) PET in terms of SSIM and PSNR.</description>
