      <title>Inelastic Scattering, Emergent Interactions of Solitons in the Zakharov-Kuznetsov Equation through Conservative and non-Conservative Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are used to study collision process of soliton solutions in the 2+1 dimensional Zakharov-Kuznetsov equation. The Zakharov-Kuznetsov equation originally was the model in three dimensions of plasma with a uniform magnetic field and it is a direct extension of the KdV equation into higher dimensions and is a typical quasi-integrable system. PINNs successfully solve the equations in the forward process and the solutions are obtained using the mesh-free approach and automatic differentiation while accounting for conservation laws. In the inverse process, the proper form of the equation can be successfully derived from a given training data. On the other hand, the situation becomes weird in the collision process. The result in the forward analysis no longer possesses the conservation laws, which is ought to be referred to as a dynamically incompatible field configuration (DIFC) instead of the solutions of the system. Conservative PINNs are thus introduced and we succeed to obtain the solutions that satisfy the conservation laws. The inverse analysis suggests a different equation where the coefficients exhibit the significant changes, which implies an emergent temporal interaction. With these modulated coefficients, we recalculate the equation and confirm that the conservation law has unquestionably improved.</description>

      <title>Multi-component Toda lattice hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a detailed account of the N -component Toda lattice hierarchy. This hierarchy is an extended version of the one introduced by Ueno and Takasaki. Our version contains N discrete variables rather than one. We start from the Lax formalism, deduce the bilinear relation for the wave functions from it and then, based on the latter, prove existence of the tau-function. We also show how the multi-component Toda lattice hierarchy is embedded into the universal hierarchy which is basically the multi-component KP hierarchy. At last, we show how the bilinear integral equation for the tau-function can be obtained using the free fermion technique. An example of exact solutions (a multi-component analogue of one-soliton solutions) is given.</description>

      <title>All meromorphic solutions of a 3D Lotka-Volterra system: detecting partial integrability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an autonomous system of ordinary differential equations, the existence of a meromorphic general solution is equivalent to the Painlev\'e property, which is widely used to detect integrability. We find all meromorphic solutions of a multi-parameter three-dimensional Lotka-Volterra system. Some cases correspond to particular choices of the parameters for which only some solutions are meromorphic, while the general solution is branched. The main difficulty is to prove that all meromorphic solutions have been found. The proof relies on a detailed study of local series expansions combined with value distribution results from Nevanlinna theory.</description>

      <title>Unified structures for solutions of Painlev\'e equation II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present certain general structures related to the solutions of Painlev\'e equation II and to the solutions of the differential equation satisfied by the corresponding Hamiltonian equations, together with the tau functions. By taking advantage of the B\"acklund transformations we find a linear differential equation satisfied by the tau functions and explicit rational expressions linking the solutions of Painlev\'e equation II, Painlev\'e equation XXXIV and the Hamiltonians with the tau functions. Also, recursions for the tau functions and the Hamiltonians will be given. Through the use of suitable parameters inserted into the equations, we consider a degenerate case solvable in terms of Weierstrass elliptic functions. The Yablonskii-Vorob'ev polynomials, the Airy-type solutions and the more general transcendental case are all described in separated Sections. Finally, certain integral relations are given.</description>

      <title>Combinatorics and large genus asymptotics of the Br\'ezin--Gross--Witten numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study combinatorial and asymptotic properties of some interesting rational numbers called the Br\'ezin--Gross--Witten (BGW) numbers, which can be represented as the intersection numbers of psi and Theta classes on the moduli space of stable algebraic curves. In particular, we discover and prove the uniform large genus asymptotics of certain normalized BGW numbers, and give a new proof of the polynomiality phenomenon for the large genus. We also propose several new conjectures including monotonicity and integrality on the BGW numbers. Applications to the Painlev\'e II hierarchy and to the BGW-kappa numbers are given.</description>

      <title>Quasi-classical expansion of a hyperbolic solution to the star-star relation and multicomponent 5-point difference equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quasi-classical expansion of a multicomponent spin solution of the star-star relation with hyperbolic Boltzmann weights is investigated. The equations obtained in a quasi-classical limit provide n-1-component extensions of certain scalar 5-point equations (corresponding to n=2) that were previously investigated by the author in the context of integrability and consistency of equations on face-centered cubics.</description>

      <title>From Painlev\'e equations to ${\cal N}=2$ susy gauge theories: prolegomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the linear problems in $z,t$ (time) associated to the Painlev\'e III$_3$ and III$_1$ equations when the Painlev\'e solution $q(t)$ approaches a pole or a zero. In this limit the problem in $z$ for the Painlev\'e III$_3$ reduces to the modified Mathieu equation, while that for the Painlev\'e III$_1$ to the Doubly Confluent Heun Equation. These equations appear as Nekrasov-Shatashvili quantisations/deformations of Seiberg-Witten differentials for $SU(2)$ ${\cal N}=2$ super Yang-Mills gauge theory with number of flavours $N_f=0$ and $N_f=2$, respectively. These results allow us to conjecture that this link holds for any Painlev\'e equation relating each of them to a different matter theory, which is actually the same as in the well-established Painlev\'e gauge correspondence, but {\it with another deformation ($\Omega$-background)}. An explicit expression for the dual gauge period (and then prepotential) is also found. As a by-product, a new solution to the connexion problem is illustrated.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic properties of special function solutions of Painlev\'e III equation for fixed parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04852v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we compute the small and large $x$ asymptotics of the special function solutions of Painlev\'e-III equation in the complex plane. We use the representation in terms of Toeplitz determinants of Bessel functions obtained in arXiv:nlin/0302026. Toeplitz determinants are rewritten as multiple contour integrals using Andr\`eief's identity. The small and large $x$ asymptotics are obtained using elementary asymptotic methods applied to the multiple contour integral. The asymptotics is extended to the whole complex plane using analytic continuation formulas for Bessel functions. The claimed result has not appeared in the literature before. We note that Toeplitz determinant representation is useful for numerical computations of corresponding solutions of the Painlev\'e-III equation.</description>
