      <title>Inverse Kinetic Effects: localization and re-entrant transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Typically, metallic systems localized under strong disorder exhibit a transition to finite conduction as kinetic terms increase. In this work, we reveal the opposite effect--increasing kinetic terms leads to an unexpected suppression of conductivity, enhancing localization of the system, and even lead to re-entrant delocalization transitions. Specifically, we add a nearest-neighbor hopping with amplitude $\kappa$ to the Rosenzweig-Porter (RP) model with fractal on-site disorder and surprisingly see that, as $\kappa$ grows, the system initially tends to localization from the fractal phase, but then re-enters the ergodic phase. We build an analytical framework to explain this re-entrant behavior, supported by exact diagonalization results. The interplay between the spatially local $\kappa$ term, insensitive to fractal disorder, and the energy-local RP coupling, sensitive to fine-level spacing structure, drives the observed re-entrant behavior. This mechanism offers a novel pathway to re-entrant localization phenomena in many-body quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Energy landscape analysis based on the Ising model: Tutorial review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review a class of energy landscape analysis method that uses the Ising model and takes multivariate time series data as input. The method allows one to capture dynamics of the data as trajectories of a ball from one basin to a different basin to yet another, constrained on the energy landscape specified by the estimated Ising model. While this energy landscape analysis has mostly been applied to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from the brain for historical reasons, there are emerging applications outside fMRI data and neuroscience. To inform such applications in various research fields, this review paper provides a detailed tutorial on each step of the analysis, terminologies, concepts underlying the method, and validation, as well as recent developments of extended and related methods.</description>

      <title>Collapsing dynamics of attractive Bose-Einstein condensates in random potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the stationary and dynamical properties of three-dimensional trapped Bose-Einstein condensates with attractive interactions subjected to a random potential. To this end, a variational method is applied to solve the underlying Gross-Pitaevskii equation. We derive analytical predictions for the energy, the equilibrium width, and evolution laws of the condensate parameter. The breathing mode oscillations frequency of the condensate has been also calculated in terms of the gas and disorder parameters. We analyze in addition the dynamics of collapse from the Gaussian approximation. Surprisingly, we find that the intriguing interplay of the attractive interaction and disorder effects leads to prevent collapse of the condensate.</description>

      <title>Continual Evolution in Nonreciprocal Ecological Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Feedbacks between evolution and ecology are ubiquitous, with ecological interactions determining which mutants are successful, and these mutants in turn modifying community structure. We study the evolutionary dynamics of several ecological models with overlapping niches, including consumer resource and Lotka-Volterra models. Evolution is assumed slow and extinctions are permanent, with ecological dynamics reaching a stable fixed point between introductions of invaders or mutants. When new strains are slowly added to the community, the ecosystem converges, after an initial evolutionary transient, to a diverse eco-evolutionary steady state. In this "Red Queen" phase of continual evolution, the biodiversity continues to turn over without the invasion probability of new variants getting any smaller. For resource-mediated interactions, the Red Queen phase obtains for any amount of asymmetry in the interactions between strains, and is robust to "general fitness" differences in the intrinsic growth rates of strains. Via a dynamical mean field theory framework valid for high-dimensional phenotype space, we analytically characterize the Red Queen eco-evolutionary steady state in a particular limit of model parameters. Scaling arguments enable a more general understanding of the steady state and evolutionary transients toward it. This work therefore establishes simple models of continual evolution in an ecological context without host-pathogen arms races, and points to the generality of Red Queen evolution. However, we also find other eco-evolutionary phases in simple models: For generalized Lotka-Volterra models with weakly asymmetric interactions an "oligarch" phase emerges in which the evolutionary dynamics continually slow down and a substantial fraction of the community's abundance condenses into a handful of slowly turning-over strains.</description>

      <title>Initial Stages of Rejuvenation of Vapor-Deposited Glasses during Isothermal Annealing: Contrast Between Experiment and Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physical vapor deposition can prepare organic glasses with high kinetic stability. When heated, these glassy solids slowly transform into the supercooled liquid in a process known as rejuvenation. In this study, we anneal vapor-deposited glasses of methyl-m-toluate (MMT) for six hours at 0.98Tg to observe rejuvenation using dielectric spectroscopy. Glasses of moderate stability exhibited partial or full rejuvenation in six hours. For highly stable glasses, prepared at substrate temperatures of 0.85Tg and 0.80Tg, the six-hour annealing time is ~2% of the estimated transformation time, and no change in the onset temperature for the {\alpha} relaxation process was observed, as expected. Surprisingly, for these highly stable glasses, annealing resulted in significant increases in the storage component of the dielectric susceptibility, without corresponding increases in the loss component. These changes are interpreted to indicate that short-term annealing rejuvenates a high frequency relaxation (e.g., the boson peak) within the stable glass. We compare these results to computer simulations of the rejuvenation of highly stable glasses generated by the swap Monte Carlo algorithm. The in silico glasses, in contrast to the experiment, show no evidence of rejuvenation within the stable glass at times shorter than the alpha relaxation process.</description>

      <title>Experimental evidence for the $\omega^4$ tail of the nonphononic spectra of glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16996v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is now established that glasses feature low-frequency, nonphononic excitations, in addition to phonons that follow Debye's vibrational density of state (VDoS). Extensive computer studies demonstrated that these nonphononic, glassy excitations follow a universal non-Debye VDoS ${\cal D}_{\rm G}(\omega)\!\sim\!\omega^4$, at low frequencies $\omega$. Yet, due to intrinsic difficulties in disentangling ${\cal D}_{\rm G}(\omega)$ from the total VDoS ${\cal D}(\omega)$, which is experimentally accessible through various scattering techniques, the $\omega^4$ tail of ${\cal D}_{\rm G}(\omega)$ lacked direct experimental support. We develop a procedure to extract ${\cal D}_{\rm G}(\omega)$ from the measured ${\cal D}(\omega)$, based on recent advances in understanding low-frequency excitations in glasses, and apply it to available datasets for diverse glasses. The resulting analysis shows that the $\omega^4$ tail of the nonphononic vibrational spectra of glasses is nontrivially consistent with a broad range of experimental observations. It also further supports that ${\cal D}_{\rm G}(\omega)$ makes an additive contribution to ${\cal D}(\omega)$.</description>

      <title>On the breakdown of dimensional reduction and supersymmetry in random-field models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the breakdown of the Parisi-Sourlas supersymmetry (SUSY) and of the dimensional-reduction (DR) property in the random field Ising and O($N$) models as a function of space dimension $d$ and/or number of components $N$. The functional renormalization group (FRG) predicts that this takes place below a critical line $d_{\rm DR}(N)$. We revisit the perturbative FRG results for the RFO($N$)M in $d=4+\epsilon$ and carry out a more comprehensive investigation of the nonperturbative FRG approximation for the RFIM. In light of this FRG description, we discuss the perturbative results in $\epsilon=6-d$ recently derived for the RFIM by Kaviraj, Rychkov, and Trevisani. We stress in particular that the disappearance of the SUSY/DR fixed point below $d_{\rm DR}$ arises as a consequence of the nonlinearity of the FRG equations and cannot be found via the perturbative expansion in $\epsilon=6-d$ (nor in $1/N$). We also provide an error bar on the value of the critical dimension $d_{\rm DR}$ for the RFIM, which we find around $5.11\pm0.09$, by studying several successive orders of the nonperturbative FRG approximation scheme.</description>

      <title>Compression theory for inhomogeneous systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.11934v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The physics of complex systems stands to greatly benefit from the qualitative changes in data availability and advances in data-driven computational methods. Many of these systems can be represented by interacting degrees of freedom on inhomogeneous graphs. However, the lack of translational invariance presents a fundamental challenge to theoretical tools, such as the renormalization group, which were so successful in characterizing the universal physical behaviour in critical phenomena. Here we show that compression theory allows the extraction of relevant degrees of freedom in arbitrary geometries, and the development of efficient numerical tools to build an effective theory from data. We demonstrate our method by applying it to a strongly correlated system on an Ammann-Beenker quasicrystal, where it discovers an exotic critical point with broken conformal symmetry. We also apply it to an antiferromagnetic system on non-bipartite random graphs, where any periodicity is absent.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the Dirac spectrum from chiral symmetry restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03546v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I derive constraints on the Dirac spectrum in the chirally symmetric phase of a gauge theory with two massless fermion flavors. Using only general properties of correlation functions of scalar and pseudoscalar bilinears, I prove that in the chiral limit of vanishing fermion mass $m$ the corresponding susceptibilities and all their derivatives with respect to $m^2$ must be finite. I then use the resulting spectral constraints to show that effective breaking of the anomalous $\mathrm{U}(1)_A$ symmetry is allowed in the $\mathrm{SU}(2)_A$ symmetric phase in the chiral limit, and leads to distinctive spectral features: (i) the spectral density must develop a singular $O(m^4)/\lambda$ peak as $m\to 0$, (ii) the two-point eigenvalue correlator of near-zero modes must be singular, and (iii) near-zero modes cannot be localized. Moreover, in the symmetric phase the topological charge distribution must be indistinguishable from that of an ideal gas of instantons and anti-instantons of vanishing density, to leading order in $m$.</description>

      <title>Avalanche Dynamics and the Effect of Straining in Dislocation Systems with Quenched Disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18871v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The plastic deformation of crystalline and other heterogeneous materials often manifests in stochastic intermittent events indicating the criticality of plastic behavior. Previous studies demonstrated that the presence of short-ranged quenched disorder modifies this behavior disrupting long-range static and dynamic correlations consequently localizing dislocation avalanches. However, these observations were mostly confined to relaxed materials devoid of deformation history. In this work our focus is on how straining affects static and dynamic correlations, avalanche dynamics and local yield stresses. We demonstrate that the interplay between severe straining and confining quenched disorder induces critical behavior characterized by dislocation avalanches distinct from those at lower stresses. Namely, near the flow stress many avalanches, even if triggered locally, evolve into events affecting a larger region by exciting small clusters of dislocations all around the sample. This type of avalanches differ from the ones at low strains where plastic events typically consist of one compact cluster of dislocations which is either local or it is already quite extended at the onset of the avalanche. Furthermore, we examine the impact of avalanches on local yield stresses. It is shown in detail in this work that while some statistical features of the local yield thresholds are robust to straining, others are significantly affected by the deformation history.</description>
