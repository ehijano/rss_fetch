      <title>From Controllability to Information: A Unified Analysis via Gramian, Minimum Energy, Fisher Information Matrix and Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article explores the connections between controllability, control energy, information, and entropy in the context of linear dynamical systems, using the damped harmonic oscillator as a case study. We analytically derive the Controllability Gramian Matrix (Wc) and its determinant (det(Wc)) for different damping regimes. We analyze the physical interpretation of det(Wc) in terms of minimum control energy, highlighting the influence of system parameters (damping {\zeta} and natural frequency {\omega}n). We investigate the conceptual and formal relationships between the Gramian, the Fisher Information Matrix (I), and Shannon (H) and thermodynamic (S) entropies, suggesting a duality between energetic control and estimation precision, as well as a link between ease of control and informational/thermodynamic entropy. The unified analysis offers insights into the fundamental principles governing the control of dynamical systems, integrating energy and information perspectives.</description>

      <title>Mathematical Modeling of a pH Swing Precipitation Process and its Optimal Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we consider the semi-batch process of precipitation of calcium carbonate solids from a solution containing calcium ions by adjusting the pH of the solution. The change in pH is induced either by the addition of alkaline solution such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH) or by the addition of a carbon dioxide gas (CO$_2$) to the given ionic solution. Under this setup we propose a system of degenerate stochastic partial differential equations that is able to explain the dynamical behavior of the key components of precipitation process. In particular, we propose a semi-linear advection equation for the dynamics of particle size distribution (PSD) of the precipitated particles. This is in turn coupled with a system of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) that is able to explain the chemical kinetics between calcium ions (Ca$^{+2}$), calcium carbonate (CaCO$_3$) in aqueous state and pH of the solution. The resulting coupled system is first mathematically studied, in particular conditions for the existence of a mild-solution is established and also the long time behavior of the system is established. Following this we consider the validation of the model for which we consider experimentally obtained lab-scale data. Using this data we propose three methods to fit the model with the data which then also validates the suitability of the proposed model. The three methods include manual intuitive tuning, classical forward backward SDE (FBSDE) method and finally a DNN based method. The FBSDE method is based on the stochastic optimal control formulation for which we provide the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of an optimal solution. Lastly, we compare the three methods and show that DNN method is the best in terms of lowest error and as the most economical in terms of the compute resources necessary during online use.</description>

      <title>A Mathematical and Optimal Control Model for Rabies Transmission Dynamics Among Humans and Dogs with Environmental Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a deterministic model to investigate rabies transmission dynamics, incorporating environmental effects and control strategies using optimal control theory. Qualitative and quantitative analyses reveal that the disease-free equilibrium is stable when the effective reproduction number $\mathcal{R}_e &lt; 1$, and unstable when $\mathcal{R}_e &gt; 1$. Mesh and contour plots illustrate an inverse relationship between $\mathcal{R}_e$ and control strategies, including dog vaccination, health promotion, and post-exposure treatment. Increased intervention reduces transmission, while higher contact rates among dogs raise $\mathcal{R}_e$. Numerical simulations with optimal control confirm the effectiveness of integrated strategies. Vaccination and treatment are identified as key interventions for achieving rabies elimination within five years.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Approximation with Block Coordinate Optimal Stepsizes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider stochastic approximation with block-coordinate stepsizes and propose adaptive stepsize rules that aim to minimize the expected distance from the next iterate to an optimal point. These stepsize rules employ online estimates of the second moment of the search direction along each block coordinate. The popular Adam algorithm can be interpreted as a particular heuristic for such estimation. By leveraging a simple conditional estimator, we derive a new method that obtains comparable performance as Adam but requires less memory and fewer hyper-parameters. We prove that this family of methods converges almost surely to a small neighborhood of the optimal point, and the radius of the neighborhood depends on the bias and variance of the second-moment estimator. Our analysis relies on a simple aiming condition that assumes neither convexity nor smoothness, thus has broad applicability.</description>

      <title>On the Gradient Domination of the LQG Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider solutions to the linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) regulator problem via policy gradient (PG) methods. Although PG methods have demonstrated strong theoretical guarantees in solving the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problem, despite its nonconvex landscape, their theoretical understanding in the LQG setting remains limited. Notably, the LQG problem lacks gradient dominance in the classical parameterization, i.e., with a dynamic controller, which hinders global convergence guarantees. In this work, we study PG for the LQG problem by adopting an alternative parameterization of the set of stabilizing controllers and employing a lifting argument. We refer to this parameterization as a history representation of the control input as it is parameterized by past input and output data from the previous p time-steps. This representation enables us to establish gradient dominance and approximate smoothness for the LQG cost. We prove global convergence and per-iteration stability guarantees for policy gradient LQG in model-based and model-free settings. Numerical experiments on an open-loop unstable system are provided to support the global convergence guarantees and to illustrate convergence under different history lengths of the history representation.</description>

      <title>A Method for Learning to Solve Parametric Bilevel Optimization with Coupling Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning to Optimize (L2O) is a subfield of machine learning (ML) in which ML models are trained to solve parametric optimization problems. The general goal is to learn a fast approximator of solutions to constrained optimization problems, as a function of their defining parameters. Prior L2O methods focus almost entirely on single-level programs, in contrast to the bilevel programs, whose constraints are themselves expressed in terms of optimization subproblems. Bilevel programs have numerous important use cases but are notoriously difficult to solve, particularly under stringent time demands. This paper proposes a framework for learning to solve a broad class of challenging bilevel optimization problems, by leveraging modern techniques for differentiation through optimization problems. The framework is illustrated on an array of synthetic bilevel programs, as well as challenging control system co-design problems, showing how neural networks can be trained as efficient approximators of parametric bilevel optimization.</description>

      <title>Factorization-free Orthogonal Projection onto the Positive Semidefinite Cone with Composite Polynomial Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a factorization-free method for orthogonal projection onto the positive semidefinite (PSD) cone, leveraging composite polynomial filtering. Inspired by recent advances in homomorphic encryption, our approach approximates the PSD cone projection operator using a carefully optimized composite polynomial evaluated exclusively via matrix-matrix multiplications. This approach enables efficient GPU implementations with low-precision arithmetic, significantly outperforming the classical PSD cone projection using state-of-the-art GPU-based eigenvalue decomposition solvers. Specifically, our method achieves a consistent relative error of $10^{-3}$ in half-precision arithmetic with only 22 matrix-matrix multiplications, providing roughly a $10\times$ speed-up over NVIDIA's cuSOLVER routines on various large-scale matrices. In single-precision arithmetic with emulation on B200 GPUs, our approach maintains competitive accuracy while achieving up to a $2\times$ speed-up. Consequently, for a $10,000 \times 10,000$ dense symmetric matrix, our method requires approximately $55$ ms in half-precision and $400$ ms in single-precision arithmetic on B200 GPUs. Integration into a first-order semidefinite programming solver confirms that our low-precision projections reliably yield solutions of moderate accuracy.</description>

      <title>A deep learning approach to multi-marginal optimal transport via Hilbert space embeddings of probability measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a numerical method for solving the multi-marginal Monge problem, which extends the classical Monge formulation to settings involving multiple target distributions. Our approach is based on the Hilbert space embedding of probability measures and employs a penalization technique using the maximum mean discrepancy to enforce marginal constraints. The method is designed to be computationally efficient, enabling GPU-based implementation suitable for large-scale problems. We confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method through numerical experiments using synthetic data.</description>

      <title>Coordinated Communication and Inventory Optimization in Multi-Retailer Supply Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a multi-retailer supply chain where each retailer can dynamically choose when to share information (e.g., local inventory levels or demand observations) with other retailers, incurring a communication cost for each sharing event. This flexible information exchange mechanism contrasts with fixed protocols such as always sharing or never sharing. We formulate a joint optimization of inventory control and communication strategies, aiming to balance the trade-off between communication overhead and operational performance (service levels, holding, and stockout costs). We adopt a common information framework and derive a centralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) model for a supply chain coordinator. Solving this coordinator's POMDP via dynamic programming characterizes the structure of optimal policies, determining when retailers should communicate and how they should adjust orders based on available information. We show that, in this setting, retailers can often act optimally by sharing only limited summaries of their private data, reducing communication frequency without compromising performance. We also incorporate practical constraints on communication frequency and propose an approximate point-based POMDP solution method (PBVI/SARSOP) to address computational complexity. Numerical experiments on multi-retailer inventory scenarios demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the cost-service trade-off compared to static information sharing policies, effectively optimizing the schedule of information exchange for cooperative inventory control.</description>

      <title>A Rockafellar Theorem for cyclically quasi-monotone maps: the regular non-vanishing case</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the connection between cyclic quasi-monotonicity and quasi-convexity, focusing on whether every cyclically quasi-monotone (possibly multivalued) map is included in the normal cone operator of a quasi-convex function, in analogy with Rockafellar's theorem for convex functions. We provide a positive answer for $\mathscr{C}^1$-regular, non-vanishing maps in any dimension, as well as for general multi-maps in dimension $1$. We further discuss connections to revealed preference theory in economics and to $L^\infty$ optimal transport. Finally, we present explicit constructions and examples, highlighting the main challenges that arise in the general case.</description>

      <title>Improving Full Strong Branching Decisions by Incorporating Additional Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The full strong branching (FSB) rule is well known to produce extremely small branch-and-bound trees. This rule guides branching decisions based exclusively on the information regarding local gains in the linear programming (LP) bounds. We identify and correct two key shortcomings in FSB. First, the LP gains may be overestimations of the improvement in global dual bounds whenever pruning is possible. We propose a modification to address this issue, that incorporates primal bounds and readjusts the relative importance of the larger and smaller LP gains. Second, FSB decisions may be myopic as they consider only local LP gains and cannot foresee the impact of branching decisions on feasibility or integrality beyond immediate children. To address this weakness, we present an approach that detects global asymmetry trends in infeasibility and integrality due to 0 and 1 assignments and incorporates them into the FSB score function. We further extend this approach to achieve more balanced trees even when the branch-and-bound tree prunes primarily by bounds.
  Using randomly generated problem instances with known structures, we derive insights and fine-tune our modified scores. Evaluation on MIPLIB 2017 Benchmark instances shows a 22-35\% reduction in mean tree sizes for solved cases and a 3.6-5.6\% decrease in the remaining gap for unsolved ones. Our approach extends to reliability branching (RB), where improved scores reduce mean tree sizes by 5-13\% on solved instances and lower the mean gap by 2.6-4.3\% on unsolved instances, depending on primal bound quality.</description>

      <title>A Mixed-Integer Bi-level Model for Joint Optimal Edge Resource Pricing and Provisioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the joint optimization of edge node activation and resource pricing in edge computing, where an edge computing platform provides heterogeneous resources to accommodate multiple services with diverse preferences. We cast this problem as a bi-level program, with the platform acting as the leader and the services as the followers. The platform aims to maximize net profit by optimizing edge resource prices and edge node activation, with the services' optimization problems acting as constraints. Based on the platform's decisions, each service aims to minimize its costs and enhance user experience through optimal service placement and resource procurement decisions. The presence of integer variables in both the upper and lower-level problems renders this problem particularly challenging. Traditional techniques for transforming bi-level problems into single-level formulations are inappropriate owing to the non-convex nature of the follower problems. Drawing inspiration from the column-and-constraint generation method in robust optimization, we develop an efficient decomposition-based iterative algorithm to compute an exact optimal solution to the formulated bi-level problem. Extensive numerical results are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed model and technique.</description>

      <title>Characterizations of Strong Variational Sufficiency in General Models of Composite Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a recently introduced notion of strong variational sufficiency in optimization problems whose importance has been highly recognized in optimization theory, numerical methods, and applications. We address a general class of composite optimization problems and establish complete characterizations of strong variational sufficiency for their local minimizers in terms of a generalized version of the strong second-order sufficient condition (SSOSC) and the positive-definiteness of an appropriate generalized Hessian of the augmented Lagrangian calculated at the point in question. The generalized SSOSC is expressed via a novel second-order variational function, which reflects specific features of nonconvex composite models. The imposed assumptions describe the spectrum of composite optimization problems covered by our approach while being constructively implemented for nonpolyhedral problems that involve the nuclear norm function and the indicator function of the positive-semidefinite cone without any constraint qualifications.</description>

      <title>Frank-Wolfe Recursions for the Emergency Response Problem on Measure Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an optimization problem over measures for emergency response to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), where the goal is to allocate volunteer resources across a spatial region to minimize the probability of death. The problem is infinite-dimensional and poses challenges for analysis and computation. We first establish structural properties, including convexity of the objective functional, compactness of the feasible set, and existence of optimal solutions. We also derive the influence function, which serves as the first-order variational object in our optimization framework. We then adapt and analyze a fully-corrective Frank-Wolfe (fc-FW) algorithm that operates directly on the infinite-dimensional problem without discretization or parametric approximation. We show a form of convergence even when subproblems are not solved to global optimality. Our full implementation of fc-FW demonstrates complex solution structure even in simple discrete cases, reveals nontrivial volunteer allocations in continuous cases, and scales to realistic urban scenarios using OHCA data from the city of Auckland, New Zealand. Finally, we show that when volunteer travel is modeled through the $L_1$ norm, the influence function is piecewise strictly concave, enabling fast computation via support reduction. The proposed framework and analysis extend naturally to a broad class of $P$-means problems.</description>

      <title>Nesterov Finds GRAAL: Optimal and Adaptive Gradient Method for Convex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on the problem of minimizing a continuously differentiable convex objective function $\min_x f(x)$. Recently, several adaptive gradient methods, including GRAAL (Malitsky, 2020), have been developed. These methods estimate the local curvature of the objective function to compute stepsizes, attain the standard convergence rate $\mathcal{O}(1/k)$ of fixed-stepsize gradient descent for Lipschitz-smooth functions, and do not require any line search procedures or hyperparameter tuning. However, a natural question arises: is it possible to accelerate the convergence of these algorithms to match the optimal rate $\mathcal{O}(1/k^2)$ of the accelerated gradient descent of Nesterov (1983)? Although some attempts have been made (Li and Lan, 2023), the capabilities of the existing accelerated algorithms to adapt to the curvature of the objective function are highly limited. Consequently, we provide a positive answer to this question and develop GRAAL with Nesterov acceleration. We prove that our algorithm achieves the desired optimal convergence rate for Lipschitz smooth functions. Moreover, in contrast to existing methods, it does so with an arbitrary, even excessively small, initial stepsize at the cost of a logarithmic additive term in the iteration complexity.</description>

      <title>Optimal Design of Satellite Constellation Configurations with Mixed Integer Linear Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing satellite constellation systems involves complex multidisciplinary optimization in which coverage serves as a primary driver of overall system cost and performance. Among the various design considerations, constellation configuration -- how satellites are placed and distributed in space relative to each other -- predominantly determines the resulting coverage. In constellation configuration design, coverage can be considered either as an objective or a constraint, driven by mission objectives. State-of-the-art literature addresses each situation on a case-by-case basis, applying a unique set of assumptions, modeling, and solution methods. Although such a problem-based methodology is valuable, users often face implementation challenges when performing trade-off studies across different mission scenarios, as each scenario must be handled distinctly. In response, we propose a unifying framework consisting of five mixed-integer linear program formulations that are of practical significance, extensible to more complex mission narratives using additional constraints, and capable of obtaining provably optimal constellation configurations. It can handle various metrics and mission scenarios, such as percent coverage, average or maximum revisit times, fixed number of satellites, spatiotemporally varying coverage requirements, and ground-, aerial-, or space-based, static or mobile targets. The paper presents several add-ons, case studies, and comparative analyses to demonstrate the versatility of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Gromov-Wasserstein Barycenters: The Analysis Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of estimating a matrix that encodes pairwise distances in a finite metric space (or, more generally, the edge weight matrix of a network) under the barycentric coding model (BCM) with respect to the Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distance function. We frame this task as estimating the unknown barycentric coordinates with respect to the GW distance, assuming that the target matrix (or kernel) belongs to the set of GW barycenters of a finite collection of known templates. In the language of harmonic analysis, if computing GW barycenters can be viewed as a synthesis problem, this paper aims to solve the corresponding analysis problem. We propose two methods: one utilizing fixed-point iteration for computing GW barycenters, and another employing a differentiation-based approach to the GW structure using a blow-up technique. Finally, we demonstrate the application of the proposed GW analysis approach in a series of numerical experiments and applications to machine learning.</description>

      <title>On the Convergence of the Policy Iteration for Infinite-Horizon Nonlinear Optimal Control Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Policy iteration (PI) is a widely used algorithm for synthesizing optimal feedback control policies across many engineering and scientific applications. When PI is deployed on infinite-horizon, nonlinear, autonomous optimal-control problems, however, a number of significant theoretical challenges emerge - particularly when the computational state space is restricted to a bounded domain. In this paper, we investigate these challenges and show that the viability of PI in this setting hinges on the existence, uniqueness, and regularity of solutions to the Generalized Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (GHJB) equation solved at each iteration. To ensure a well-posed iterative scheme, the GHJB solution must possess sufficient smoothness, and the domain on which the GHJB equation is solved must remain forward-invariant under the closed-loop dynamics induced by the current policy. Although fundamental to the method's convergence, previous studies have largely overlooked these aspects. This paper closes that gap by introducing a constructive procedure that guarantees forward invariance of the computational domain throughout the entire PI sequence and by establishing sufficient conditions under which a suitably regular GHJB solution exists at every iteration. Numerical results are presented for a grid-based implementation of PI to support the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>On the structure of optimal solutions of conservation laws at a junction with one incoming and one outgoing arc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a min-max problem for strictly concave conservation laws on a 1-1 network, with inflow controls acting at the junction. We investigate the minimization problem for a functional measuring the total variation of the flow of the solutions at the node, among those solutions that maximize the time integral of the flux. To formulate this problem we establish a regularity result showing that the total variation of the boundary-flux of the solution of an initial-boundary value problem is controlled by the total variation of the initial datum and of the flux of the boundary datum. In the case the initial datum is monotone, we show that the flux of the entropy weak solution at the node provides an optimal inflow control for this min-max problem. We also exhibit two prototype examples showing that, in the case where the initial datum is not monotone, the flux of the entropy weak solution is no more optimal.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Design of Microbe and Bioreactor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When developing a biotechnological process, the microorganism is first designed, e.g., using metabolic engineering. Then, the optimum fermentation parameters are determined on a laboratory scale, and lastly, they are transferred to the bioreactor scale. However, this step-by-step approach is costly and time-consuming and may result in suboptimal configurations. Herein, we present the bilevel optimization formulation SimulKnockReactor, which connects bioreactor design with microbial strain design, an extension of our previous formulation, SimulKnock (Ziegler et al., 2024, AIChE J.). At the upper (bioreactor) level, we minimize investment and operation costs for agitation, aeration, and pH control by determining the size and operating conditions of a continuous stirred-tank reactor - without selecting specific devices like the stirrer type. The lower (cellular) level is based on flux balance analysis and implements optimal reaction knockouts predicted by the upper level. Our results with a core and a genome-scale metabolic model of Escherichia coli show that the substrate is the largest cost factor. Our simultaneous approach outperforms a sequential approach using OptKnock. Namely, the knockouts proposed by OptKnock cannot guarantee the required production capacity in all cases considered. In the case that both approaches deliver feasible results, the total annual costs are the same or lower with SimulKnockReactor, highlighting the advantage of combining cellular and bioreactor levels. This work is a further step towards a fully integrated bioprocess design.</description>

      <title>System Realizations by Mammillary Models with an Application to Propofol Pharmacokinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work addresses the problem of linear system realizations by mammillary models, offering necessary and sufficient conditions under which a given transfer function can be represented in this form. While standard identifi cation techniques may yield transfer functions without an explicit connection to underlying physiological processes, com partmental models, particularly mammillary ones, reflect the physiological dynamics of distribution and elimination. This feature is especially relevant in clinical pharmacology, where model parameters must correspond to meaningful biological processes to support interpretability, personalization, and safe drug delivery, such as in total intravenous anesthesia. To conclude, an application to a propofol infusion model illustrates how mammillary realizations can support physiologically inter pretable system representations.</description>

      <title>Recursive Feasibility without Terminal Constraints via Parent-Child MPC Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel hierarchical model predictive control (MPC) framework, called the Parent-Child MPC architecture, to steer nonlinear systems under uncertainty towards a target set, balancing computational complexity and guaranteeing recursive feasibility and stability without relying on conservative terminal constraints in online decision-making. By coupling a small-horizon Child MPC layer with one or more large-horizon Parent MPC layers, the architecture ensures recursive feasibility and stability through adjustable stage-wise constraints derived from tube-based control. As is demonstrated in our case studies, compared to traditional MPC methods, the proposed Parent-Child MPC architecture enhances performance and computational efficiency, reduces conservativeness, and enables scalable planning for certain nonlinear systems.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of an optical flow based optimal control formulation for image registration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider image registration as an optimal control problem using an optical flow formulation, i.e., we discuss an optimization problem that is governed by a linear hyperbolic transport equation. Requiring Lipschitz continuity of the vector fields that parametrize the transformation leads to an optimization problem in a non-reflexive Banach space. We introduce relaxations of the optimization problem involving smoothed maximum and minimum functions and appropriate Orlicz spaces. To derive well-posedness results for the relaxed optimization problem, we revisit and establish new existence and uniqueness results for the linear hyperbolic transport equations. We further discuss limit considerations with respect to the relaxation parameter and discretizations.</description>

      <title>The Reconfigurable Earth Observation Satellite Scheduling Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Earth observation satellites (EOS) play a pivotal role in capturing and analyzing planetary phenomena, ranging from natural disasters to societal development. The EOS scheduling problem (EOSSP), which optimizes the schedule of EOS, is often solved with respect to nadir-directional EOS systems, thus restricting the observation time of targets and, consequently, the effectiveness of each EOS. This paper leverages state-of-the-art constellation reconfigurability to develop the reconfigurable EOS scheduling problem (REOSSP), wherein EOS are assumed to be maneuverable, forming a more optimal constellation configuration at multiple opportunities during a schedule. This paper develops a novel mixed-integer linear programming formulation for the REOSSP to optimally solve the scheduling problem for given parameters. Additionally, since the REOSSP can be computationally expensive for large-scale problems, a rolling horizon procedure (RHP) solution method is developed. The performance of the REOSSP is benchmarked against the EOSSP, which serves as a baseline, through a set of random instances where problem characteristics are varied and a case study in which Hurricane Sandy is used to demonstrate realistic performance. These experiments demonstrate the value of constellation reconfigurability in its application to the EOSSP, yielding solutions that improve performance, while the RHP enhances computational runtime for large-scale REOSSP instances.</description>

      <title>Multiobjective Aerodynamic Design Optimization of the NASA Common Research Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aircraft aerodynamic design optimization must account for the varying operating conditions along the cruise segment as opposed to designing at one fixed operating condition, to arrive at more realistic designs. Conventional approaches address this by performing a ``multi-point'' optimization that assumes a weighted average of the objectives at a set of sub-segments along the cruise segment. We argue that since such multi-point approaches are, inevitably, biased by the specification of the weights, they can lead to sub-optimal designs. Instead, we propose to optimize the aircraft design at multiple sub-segments simultaneously -- that is, via multiobjective optimization that leads to a set of Pareto optimal solutions. However, existing work in multiobjective optimization suffers from (i) lack of sample efficiency (that is, keeping the number of function evaluations to convergence minimal), (ii) scalability with input dimensions and number of objectives, and (iii) the ability to generate a batch of iterates for synchronous parallel evaluations. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel multiobjective Bayesian optimization methodology that demonstrates improved sample efficiency and accuracy compared to the state of the art. Inspired by Thompson sampling, our approach leverages Gaussian process surrogates and Bayesian decision theory to generate a sequence of iterates according to the probability that they are Pareto optimal. Our approach, named batch Pareto optimal Thompson sampling ($q\texttt{POTS}$), demonstrates superior empirical performance on a variety of synthetic experiments as well as a $24$ dimensional two-objective aerodynamic design optimization of the NASA common research model. We also provide open-source software of our methodology.</description>

      <title>Counterfactual optimization for fault prevention in complex wind energy systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine Learning models are increasingly used in businesses to detect faults and anomalies in complex systems. In this work, we take this approach a step further: beyond merely detecting anomalies, we aim to identify the optimal control strategy that restores the system to a safe state with minimal disruption. We frame this challenge as a counterfactual problem: given a Machine Learning model that classifies system states as either good or anomalous, our goal is to determine the minimal adjustment to the system's control variables (i.e., its current status) that is necessary to return it to the good state. To achieve this, we leverage a mathematical model that finds the optimal counterfactual solution while respecting system specific constraints. Notably, most counterfactual analysis in the literature focuses on individual cases where a person seeks to alter their status relative to a decision made by a classifier, such as for loan approval or medical diagnosis. Our work addresses a fundamentally different challenge: optimizing counterfactuals for a complex energy system, specifically an offshore wind turbine oil type transformer. This application not only advances counterfactual optimization in a new domain but also opens avenues for broader research in this area. Our tests on real world data provided by our industrial partner show that our methodology easily adapts to user preferences and brings savings in the order of 3 million euros per year in a typical farm.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Convergence: Shuffling Complexity Beyond Lipschitz Smoothness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shuffling-type gradient methods are favored in practice for their simplicity and rapid empirical performance. Despite extensive development of convergence guarantees under various assumptions in recent years, most require the Lipschitz smoothness condition, which is often not met in common machine learning models. We highlight this issue with specific counterexamples. To address this gap, we revisit the convergence rates of shuffling-type gradient methods without assuming Lipschitz smoothness. Using our stepsize strategy, the shuffling-type gradient algorithm not only converges under weaker assumptions but also match the current best-known convergence rates, thereby broadening its applicability. We prove the convergence rates for nonconvex, strongly convex, and non-strongly convex cases, each under both random reshuffling and arbitrary shuffling schemes, under a general bounded variance condition. Numerical experiments further validate the performance of our shuffling-type gradient algorithm, underscoring its practical efficacy.</description>

      <title>Optimal High-probability Convergence of Nonlinear SGD under Heavy-tailed Noise via Symmetrization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study convergence in high-probability of SGD-type methods in non-convex optimization and the presence of heavy-tailed noise. To combat the heavy-tailed noise, a general black-box nonlinear framework is considered, subsuming nonlinearities like sign, clipping, normalization and their smooth counterparts. Our first result shows that nonlinear SGD (N-SGD) achieves the rate $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(t^{-1/2})$, for any noise with unbounded moments and a symmetric probability density function (PDF). Crucially, N-SGD has exponentially decaying tails, matching the performance of linear SGD under light-tailed noise. To handle non-symmetric noise, we propose two novel estimators, based on the idea of noise symmetrization. The first, dubbed Symmetrized Gradient Estimator (SGE), assumes a noiseless gradient at any reference point is available at the start of training, while the second, dubbed Mini-batch SGE (MSGE), uses mini-batches to estimate the noiseless gradient. Combined with the nonlinear framework, we get N-SGE and N-MSGE methods, respectively, both achieving the same convergence rate and exponentially decaying tails as N-SGD, while allowing for non-symmetric noise with unbounded moments and PDF satisfying a mild technical condition, with N-MSGE additionally requiring bounded noise moment of order $p \in (1,2]$. Compared to works assuming noise with bounded $p$-th moment, our results: 1) are based on a novel symmetrization approach; 2) provide a unified framework and relaxed moment conditions; 3) imply optimal oracle complexity of N-SGD and N-SGE, strictly better than existing works when $p &lt; 2$, while the complexity of N-MSGE is close to existing works. Compared to works assuming symmetric noise with unbounded moments, we: 1) provide a sharper analysis and improved rates; 2) facilitate state-dependent symmetric noise; 3) extend the strong guarantees to non-symmetric noise.</description>

      <title>A Randomized Algorithm for Sparse PCA based on the Basic SDP Relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sparse Principal Component Analysis (SPCA) is a fundamental technique for dimensionality reduction, and is NP-hard. In this paper, we introduce a randomized approximation algorithm for SPCA, which is based on the basic SDP relaxation. Our algorithm has an approximation ratio of at most the sparsity constant with high probability, if called enough times. Under a technical assumption, which is consistently satisfied in our numerical tests, the average approximation ratio is also bounded by $\mathcal{O}(\log{d})$, where $d$ is the number of features. We show that this technical assumption is satisfied if the SDP solution is low-rank, or has exponentially decaying eigenvalues. We then present a broad class of instances for which this technical assumption holds. We also demonstrate that in a covariance model, which generalizes the spiked Wishart model, our proposed algorithm achieves a near-optimal approximation ratio. We demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm through numerical results on real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>A CLuP algorithm to practically achieve $\sim 0.76$ SK--model ground state free energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider algorithmic determination of the $n$-dimensional Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) spin glass model ground state free energy. It corresponds to a binary maximization of an indefinite quadratic form and under the \emph{worst case} principles of the classical NP complexity theory it is hard to approximate within a $\log(n)^{const.}$ factor. On the other hand, the SK's random nature allows (polynomial) spectral methods to \emph{typically} approach the optimum within a constant factor. Naturally one is left with the fundamental question: can the residual (constant) \emph{computational gap} be erased?
  Following the success of \emph{Controlled Loosening-up} (CLuP) algorithms in planted models, we here devise a simple practical CLuP-SK algorithmic procedure for (non-planted) SK models. To analyze the \emph{typical} success of the algorithm we associate to it (random) CLuP-SK models. Further connecting to recent random processes studies [94,97], we characterize the models and CLuP-SK algorithm via fully lifted random duality theory (fl RDT) [98]. Moreover, running the algorithm we demonstrate that its performance is in an excellent agrement with theoretical predictions. In particular, already for $n$ on the order of a few thousands CLuP-SK achieves $\sim 0.76$ ground state free energy and remarkably closely approaches theoretical $n\rightarrow\infty$ limit $\approx 0.763$. For all practical purposes, this renders computing SK model's near ground state free energy as a \emph{typically} easy problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a principal-agent model involving a large population of heterogeneously interacting agents. By extending the existing methods, we find the optimal contracts assuming a continuum of agents, and show that, when the number of agents is sufficiently large, the optimal contracts for the problem with a continuum of agents are near-optimal for the finite agents problem. We make comparative statistics and provide numerical simulations to analyze how the agents' connectivity affects the principal's value, the effort of the agents, and the optimal contracts.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Network Design with Restricted Link Usage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a digraph with two terminal vertices $s$ and $t$ as well as a conservative cost function and several not necessarily disjoint color classes on its arc set, our goal is to find a minimum-cost subset of the arcs such that its intersection with each color class contains an $s$-$t$ dipath. Problems of this type arise naturally in multi-commodity network design settings where each commodity is restricted to use links of its own color only.
  We study several variants of the problem, deriving strong hardness results even for restricted cases, but we also identify cases that can be solved in polynomial time. The latter ones include the cases where the color classes form a laminar family, or where the underlying digraph is acyclic and the number of color classes is constant. We also present an FPT algorithm for the general case parameterized by the number of multi-colored arcs.</description>

      <title>On Information Geometry and Iterative Optimization in Model Compression: Operator Factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ever-increasing parameter counts of deep learning models necessitate effective compression techniques for deployment on resource-constrained devices. This paper explores the application of information geometry, the study of density-induced metrics on parameter spaces, to analyze existing methods within the space of model compression, primarily focusing on operator factorization. Adopting this perspective highlights the core challenge: defining an optimal low-compute submanifold (or subset) and projecting onto it. We argue that many successful model compression approaches can be understood as implicitly approximating information divergences for this projection. We highlight that when compressing a pre-trained model, using information divergences is paramount for achieving improved zero-shot accuracy, yet this may no longer be the case when the model is fine-tuned. In such scenarios, trainability of bottlenecked models turns out to be far more important for achieving high compression ratios with minimal performance degradation, necessitating adoption of iterative methods. In this context, we prove convergence of iterative singular value thresholding for training neural networks subject to a soft rank constraint. To further illustrate the utility of this perspective, we showcase how simple modifications to existing methods through softer rank reduction result in improved performance under fixed compression rates.</description>

      <title>Two Strings with a Dynamic Interior Mass: A Feedback Control Design with Guaranteed Exponential Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the exponential stabilization of a coupled two-string system joined by a dynamic interior mass. The combined effect of three feedback mechanisms, boundary damping from tip velocity, higher-order nodal damping from angular velocity, and lower-order nodal damping from mass velocity, is analyzed using a Lyapunov framework. Exponential stability is established unconditionally, without constraints on wave speeds or mass location, improving upon earlier results that lower-order nodal damping, as in {Hansen-Zuazua'95}, or boundary damping alone, as in {Lee-You'89}, does not ensure exponential decay without additional structural conditions. Moreover, the lower-order feedback can be removed without loss of exponential decay when combined with the other two mechanisms, via a compact perturbation argument. These results apply to hybrid systems with interior or tip mass interfaces, including overhead cranes, deep-sea cables, and fluid structure interaction. Theoretical findings are validated through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Frequency-aware Surrogate Modeling With SMT Kernels For Advanced Data Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a comprehensive open-source framework for developing correlation kernels, with a particular focus on user-defined and composition of kernels for surrogate modeling. By advancing kernel-based modeling techniques, we incorporate frequency-aware elements that effectively capture complex mechanical behaviors and timefrequency dynamics intrinsic to aircraft systems. Traditional kernel functions, often limited to exponential-based methods, are extended to include a wider range of kernels such as exponential squared sine and rational quadratic kernels, along with their respective firstand second-order derivatives. The proposed methodologies are first validated on a sinus cardinal test case and then applied to forecasting Mauna-Loa Carbon Dioxide (CO 2 ) concentrations and airline passenger traffic. All these advancements are integrated into the open-source Surrogate Modeling Toolbox (SMT 2.0), providing a versatile platform for both standard and customizable kernel configurations. Furthermore, the framework enables the combination of various kernels to leverage their unique strengths into composite models tailored to specific problems. The resulting framework offers a flexible toolset for engineers and researchers, paving the way for numerous future applications in metamodeling for complex, frequency-sensitive domains.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed neural networks for high-dimensional solutions and snaking bifurcations in nonlinear lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a framework based on physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for addressing key challenges in nonlinear lattices, including solution approximation, bifurcation diagram construction, and linear stability analysis. We first employ PINNs to approximate solutions of nonlinear systems arising from lattice models, using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm to optimize network weights for greater accuracy. To enhance computational efficiency in high-dimensional settings, we integrate a stochastic sampling strategy. We then extend the method by coupling PINNs with a continuation approach to compute snaking bifurcation diagrams, incorporating an auxiliary equation to effectively track successive solution branches. For linear stability analysis, we adapt PINNs to compute eigenvectors, introducing output constraints to enforce positivity, in line with Sturm-Liouville theory. Numerical experiments are conducted on the discrete Allen-Cahn equation with cubic and quintic nonlinearities in one to five spatial dimensions. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves accuracy comparable to, or better than, traditional numerical methods, especially in high-dimensional regimes where computational resources are a limiting factor. These findings highlight the potential of neural networks as scalable and efficient tools for the study of complex nonlinear lattice systems.</description>

      <title>Through the River: Understanding the Benefit of Schedule-Free Methods for Language Model Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As both model and dataset sizes continue to scale rapidly, conventional pretraining strategies with fixed compute budgets-such as cosine learning rate schedules-are increasingly inadequate for large-scale training. Recent alternatives, including warmup-stable-decay (WSD) schedules and weight averaging, offer greater flexibility. However, WSD relies on explicit decay phases to track progress, while weight averaging addresses this limitation at the cost of additional memory. In search of a more principled and scalable alternative, we revisit the Schedule-Free (SF) method [Defazio et al., 2024], which has shown strong empirical performance across diverse settings. We show that SF-AdamW effectively navigates the "river" structure of the loss landscape without decay phases or auxiliary averaging, making it particularly suitable for continuously scaling training workloads. To understand this behavior, we conduct a theoretical and empirical analysis of SF dynamics, revealing that it implicitly performs weight averaging without memory overhead. Guided by this analysis, we propose a refined variant of SF that improves robustness to momentum and performs better under large batch sizes, addressing key limitations of the original method. Together, these results establish SF as a practical, scalable, and theoretically grounded approach for language model training.</description>

      <title>Intersection of Reinforcement Learning and Bayesian Optimization for Intelligent Control of Industrial Processes: A Safe MPC-based DPG using Multi-Objective BO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC)-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a structured and interpretable alternative to Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based RL methods, with lower computational complexity and greater transparency. However, standard MPC-RL approaches often suffer from slow convergence, suboptimal policy learning due to limited parameterization, and safety issues during online adaptation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that integrates MPC-RL with Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization (MOBO). The proposed MPC-RL-MOBO utilizes noisy evaluations of the RL stage cost and its gradient, estimated via a Compatible Deterministic Policy Gradient (CDPG) approach, and incorporates them into a MOBO algorithm using the Expected Hypervolume Improvement (EHVI) acquisition function. This fusion enables efficient and safe tuning of the MPC parameters to achieve improved closed-loop performance, even under model imperfections. A numerical example demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach in achieving sample-efficient, stable, and high-performance learning for control systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new solution concept for bounded rational agents in finite normal-form general-sum games called Generalized Quantal Response Equilibrium (GQRE) which generalizes Quantal Response Equilibrium~\citep{mckelvey1995quantal}. In our setup, each player maximizes a smooth, regularized expected utility of the mixed profiles used, reflecting bounded rationality that subsumes stochastic choice. After establishing existence under mild conditions, we present computationally efficient no-regret independent learning via smoothened versions of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm. Our algorithm uses noisy but correlated gradient estimates generated via a simulation oracle that reports on repeated plays of the game. We analyze convergence properties of our algorithm under assumptions that ensure uniqueness of equilibrium, using a class of gap functions that generalize the Nash gap. We end by demonstrating the effectiveness of our method on a set of complex general-sum games such as high-rank two-player games, large action two-player games, and known examples of difficult multi-player games.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This letter investigates the optimal allocation of large language model (LLM) inference workloads across heterogeneous edge data centers (DCs) over time. Each DC features on-site renewable generation and faces dynamic electricity prices and spatiotemporal variability in renewable availability. The central question is: how can inference workloads be optimally distributed to the DCs to minimize energy consumption, carbon emissions, and water usage while enhancing user experience? This letter proposes a novel optimization model for LLM service providers to reduce operational costs and environmental impacts. Numerical results validate the efficacy of the proposed approach.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a trust-based predictive multi-agent consensus protocol that analyses neighbours' anticipation data and makes coordination decisions. Agents in the network share their future predicted data over a finite look-ahead horizon with their neighbours and update their predictions in a rolling-horizon fashion. The prediction data is then used by agents to learn both the trust and the commitment traits exhibited by their neighbours over time. The proposed protocol is named as the Anticipatory Distributed Coordination (ADC) protocol. Lyapunov theory-based agreement convergence between agents is provided, followed by demonstrations using numerical simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uncertainties influencing the dynamical systems pose a significant challenge in estimating the achievable performance of a controller aiming to control such uncertain systems. When the uncertainties are of stochastic nature, obtaining hard guarantees for the robustness of a controller aiming to hedge against the uncertainty is not possible. This issue set the platform for the development of probabilistic robust control approaches. In this work, we utilise the gap metric between the known nominal model and the unknown perturbed model of the uncertain system as a tool to gauge the robustness of a controller and formulate the gap as a random variable in the setting with stochastic uncertainties. Main results of this paper includes giving probabilistic bound on the gap exceeding a known threshold followed by bounds on the expected gap value and probabilistic robust stability in terms of the gap metric. Further, we also provide a probabilistic controller performance certification under gap uncertainty and probabilistic guarantee on the achievable $\mathcal{H}_{\infty}$ robustness. Numerical simulations are provided at many places to demonstrate the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Optimal Battery Placement in Power Grid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the optimal placement of an unlimited-capacity battery in power grids under a centralized market model, where the independent system operator (ISO) aims to minimize total generation costs through load shifting. The optimal battery placement is not well understood by the existing literature, especially regarding the influence of network topology on minimizing generation costs. Our work starts with decomposing the Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem into a series of Linear Programming (LP) formulations. For power grids with sufficiently large generation capacity or tree topologies, we derive analytical cost expressions demonstrating that, under reasonable assumptions, the weighted degree is the only topological factor for optimal battery placement. We also discuss the minor impact of higher-order topological conditions on tree-topology networks. To find the localized nature of a single battery's impact, we establish that the relative cost-saving benefit of a single battery decreases as the network scales. Furthermore, we design a low-complexity algorithm for weakly-cyclic networks. Numerical experiments show that our algorithm is not only approximately 100 times faster than commercial solvers but also maintains high accuracy even when some theoretical assumptions are relaxed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.01876v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper focuses on finding approximate solutions to stochastic optimal control problems with control domains being not necessarily convex, where the state trajectory is subject to controlled stochastic differential equations. The control-dependent diffusions make the traditional method of successive approximations (MSA) insufficient to reduce the value of cost functional in each iteration. Without adding extra terms over which to perform the Hamiltonian minimization, the MSA becomes sufficient by our novel error estimate involving a higher order backward adjoint equation. Under certain convexity assumptions on the coefficients (no convexity assumptions on the control domains), the value of the cost functional descends to the global minimum as the number of iterations tends to infinity. In particular, a convergence rate is available for a class of generalized linear-quadratic systems.</description>

      <title>A Novel Robust Optimization Model for Nonlinear Support Vector Machine</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.06223v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present new optimization models for Support Vector Machine (SVM), with the aim of separating data points in two or more classes. The classification task is handled by means of nonlinear classifiers induced by kernel functions and consists in two consecutive phases: first, a classical SVM model is solved, followed by a linear search procedure, aimed at minimizing the total number of misclassified data points. To address the problem of data perturbations and protect the model against uncertainty, we construct bounded-by-norm uncertainty sets around each training data and apply robust optimization techniques. We rigorously derive the robust counterpart extension of the deterministic SVM approach, providing computationally tractable reformulations. Closed-form expressions for the bounds of the uncertainty sets in the feature space have been formulated for typically used kernel functions. Finally, extensive numerical results on real-world datasets show the benefits of the proposed robust approach in comparison with various SVM alternatives in the machine learning literature.</description>

      <title>A hierarchy of eigencomputations for polynomial optimization on the sphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17827v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a convergent hierarchy of lower bounds on the minimum value of a real form over the unit sphere. The main practical advantage of our hierarchy over the real sum-of-squares (RSOS) hierarchy is that the lower bound at each level of our hierarchy is obtained by a minimum eigenvalue computation, as opposed to the full semidefinite program (SDP) required at each level of RSOS. In practice, this allows us to compute bounds on much larger forms than are computationally feasible for RSOS. Our hierarchy outperforms previous alternatives to RSOS, both asymptotically and in numerical experiments. We obtain our hierarchy by proving a reduction from real optimization on the sphere to Hermitian optimization on the sphere, and invoking the Hermitian sum-of-squares (HSOS) hierarchy. This opens the door to using other Hermitian optimization techniques for real optimization, and gives a path towards developing spectral hierarchies for more general constrained real optimization problems. To this end, we use our techniques to develop a hierarchy of eigencomputations for computing the real tensor spectral norm.</description>

      <title>Learning Free Terminal Time Optimal Closed-loop Control of Manipulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to learning free terminal time closed-loop control for robotic manipulation tasks, enabling dynamic adjustment of task duration and control inputs to enhance performance. We extend the supervised learning approach, namely solving selected optimal open-loop problems and utilizing them as training data for a policy network, to the free terminal time scenario. Three main challenges are addressed in this extension. First, we introduce a marching scheme that enhances the solution quality and increases the success rate of the open-loop solver by gradually refining time discretization. Second, we extend the QRnet in Nakamura-Zimmerer et al. (2021b) to the free terminal time setting to address discontinuity and improve stability at the terminal state. Third, we present a more automated version of the initial value problem (IVP) enhanced sampling method from previous work (Zhang et al., 2022) to adaptively update the training dataset, significantly improving its quality. By integrating these techniques, we develop a closed-loop policy that operates effectively over a broad domain with varying optimal time durations, achieving near globally optimal total costs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07862v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a dynamic information manipulation game (DIMG) to investigate the incentives of an information manipulator (IM) to influence the transition rules of a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). DIMG is a hierarchical game where the upper-level IM stealthily designs the POMDP's joint state distributions to influence the lower-level controller's actions. DIMG's fundamental feature is characterized by a stagewise constraint that ensures the consistency between the unobservable marginals of the manipulated and the original kernels. In an equilibrium of information distortion, the IM minimizes cumulative cost that depends on the controller's informationally manipulated actions generated by the optimal policy to the POMDP. We discuss ex ante and interim manipulation schemes and show their connections. The effect of manipulation on the performance of control policies is analyzed through its influence on belief distortion.</description>

      <title>Regret Analysis of Policy Optimization over Submanifolds for Linearly Constrained Online LQG</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancement in online optimization and control has provided novel tools to study online linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problems, where cost matrices are time-varying and unknown in advance. In this work, we study the online linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) problem over the manifold of stabilizing controllers that are linearly constrained to impose physical conditions such as sparsity. By adopting a Riemannian perspective, we propose the online Newton on manifold (ONM) algorithm, which generates an online controller on-the-fly based on the second-order information of the cost function sequence. To quantify the algorithm performance, we use the notion of regret, defined as the sub-optimality of the algorithm cumulative cost against a (locally) minimizing controller sequence. We establish a regret bound in terms of the path-length of the benchmark minimizer sequence, and we further verify the effectiveness of ONM via simulations.</description>

      <title>Spurious Stationarity and Hardness Results for Bregman Proximal-Type Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08073v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bregman proximal-type algorithms (BPs), such as mirror descent, have become popular tools in machine learning and data science for exploiting problem structures through non-Euclidean geometries. In this paper, we show that BPs can get trapped near a class of non-stationary points, which we term spurious stationary points. Such stagnation can persist for any finite number of iterations if the gradient of the Bregman kernel is not Lipschitz continuous, even in convex problems. The root cause lies in a fundamental contrast in descent behavior between Euclidean and Bregman geometries: While Euclidean gradient descent ensures sufficient decrease near any non-stationary point, BPs may exhibit arbitrarily slow decrease around spurious stationary points. As a result, commonly used Bregman-based stationarity measure, such as relative change in terms of Bregman divergence, can vanish near spurious stationary points. This may misleadingly suggest convergence, even when the iterates remain far from any true stationary point. Our analysis further reveals that spurious stationary points are not pathological, but rather occur generically in a broad class of nonconvex problems with polyhedral constraints. Taken together, our findings reveal a serious blind spot in Bregman-based optimization methods and calls for new theoretical tools and algorithmic safeguards to ensure reliable convergence.</description>

      <title>On the Uniform Convergence of Subdifferentials in Stochastic Optimization and Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10289v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the uniform convergence of subdifferential mappings from empirical risk to population risk in nonsmooth, nonconvex stochastic optimization. This question is key to understanding how empirical stationary points approximate population ones, yet characterizing this convergence remains a fundamental challenge due to the set-valued and nonsmooth nature of subdifferentials. This work establishes a general reduction principle: for weakly convex stochastic objectives, over any open subset of the domain, we show that a uniform bound on the convergence of selected subgradients-chosen arbitrarily from subdifferential sets-yields a corresponding uniform bound on the Hausdorff distance between the subdifferentials. This deterministic result reduces the study of set-valued subdifferential convergence to simpler vector-valued subgradient convergence. We apply this reduction to derive sharp uniform convergence rates for subdifferential mappings in stochastic convex-composite optimization, without relying on differentiability assumptions on the population risk. These guarantees clarify the landscape of nonsmooth empirical objectives and offer new insight into the geometry of optimization problems arising in robust statistics and related applications.</description>

      <title>A penalty barrier framework for nonconvex constrained optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09901v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider minimization problems with structured objective function and smooth constraints, and present a flexible framework that combines the beneficial regularization effects of (exact) penalty and interior-point methods. In the fully nonconvex setting, a pure barrier approach requires careful steps when approaching the infeasible set, thus hindering convergence. We show how a tight integration with a penalty scheme mitigates this issue and enables the construction of subproblems whose domain is independent of the explicit constraints. This decoupling allows us to leverage efficient solvers designed for unconstrained or suitably structured optimization tasks. The key behind all this is a marginalization step: closely related to a conjugacy operation, this step effectively merges (exact) penalty and barrier into a smooth, full domain functional object. When the penalty exactness takes effect, the generated subproblems do not suffer the ill-conditioning typical of barrier methods, nor do they exhibit the nonsmoothness of exact penalty terms. We provide a theoretical characterization of the algorithm and its asymptotic properties, deriving convergence results for fully nonconvex problems. Stronger conclusions are available for the convex setting, where optimality can be guaranteed. Illustrative examples and numerical simulations demonstrate the wide range of problems our theory and algorithm are able to cover.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00235v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Convex relaxation methods are powerful tools for studying the lowest energy of many-body problems. By relaxing the representability conditions for marginals to a set of local constraints, along with a global semidefinite constraint, a polynomial-time solvable semidefinite program (SDP) that provides a lower bound for the energy can be derived. In this paper, we propose accelerating the solution of such an SDP relaxation by imposing a hierarchical structure on the positive semidefinite (PSD) primal and dual variables. Furthermore, these matrices can be updated efficiently using the algebra of the compressed representations within an augmented Lagrangian method. We achieve quadratic and even near-linear time per-iteration complexity. Through experimentation on the quantum transverse field Ising model, we showcase the capability of our approach to provide a sufficiently accurate lower bound for the exact ground-state energy.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic regret in the ergodic Avellaneda-Stoikov market making model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse the regret arising from learning the price sensitivity parameter $\kappa$ of liquidity takers in the ergodic version of the Avellaneda-Stoikov market making model. We show that a learning algorithm based on a maximum-likelihood estimator for the parameter achieves the regret upper bound of order $\ln^2 T$ in expectation. To obtain the result we need two key ingredients. The first is the twice differentiability of the ergodic constant under the misspecified parameter in the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation with respect to $\kappa$, which leads to a second--order performance gap. The second is the learning rate of the regularised maximum-likelihood estimator which is obtained from concentration inequalities for Bernoulli signals. Numerical experiments confirm the convergence and the robustness of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide abstract, general and highly uniform rates of asymptotic regularity for a generalized stochastic Halpern-style iteration, which incorporates a second mapping in the style of a Krasnoselskii-Mann iteration. This iteration is general in two ways: First, it incorporates stochasticity in a completely abstract way rather than fixing a sampling method; secondly, it includes as special cases stochastic versions of various schemes from the optimization literature, including Halpern's iteration as well as a Krasnoselskii-Mann iteration with Tikhonov regularization terms in the sense of Bo\c{t}, Csetnek and Meier. For these specific cases, we in particular obtain linear rates of asymptotic regularity, matching (or improving) the currently best known rates for these iterations in stochastic optimization, and quadratic rates of asymptotic regularity are obtained in the context of inner product spaces for the general iteration. At the end, we briefly sketch how the schemes presented here can be instantiated in the context of reinforcement learning to yield novel methods for Q-learning.</description>

      <title>Convergence Analysis and Acceleration of Fictitious Play for General Mean-Field Games via the Best Response</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A mean-field game (MFG) seeks the Nash Equilibrium of a game involving a continuum of players, where the Nash Equilibrium corresponds to a fixed point of the best-response mapping. However, simple fixed-point iterations do not always guarantee convergence. Fictitious play is an iterative algorithm that leverages a best-response mapping combined with a weighted average. Through a thorough study of the best-response mapping, this paper develops a simple and unified convergence analysis, providing the first explicit convergence rate for the fictitious play algorithm in MFGs of general types, especially non-potential MFGs. We demonstrate that the convergence and rate can be controlled through the weighting parameter in the algorithm, with linear convergence achievable under a general assumption. Building on this analysis, we propose two strategies to accelerate fictitious play. The first uses a backtracking line search to optimize the weighting parameter, while the second employs a hierarchical grid strategy to enhance stability and computational efficiency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these acceleration techniques and validate our convergence rate analysis with various numerical examples.</description>

Abstract: Data-driven techniques for analysis, modeling, and control of complex dynamical systems are on the uptake. Koopman theory provides the theoretical foundation for the popular kernel extended dynamic mode decomposition (kEDMD). In this work, we propose a novel kEDMD scheme to approximate nonlinear control systems accompanied by an in-depth error analysis. Key features are regularization-based robustness and an adroit decomposition into micro and macro grids enabling flexible sampling. But foremost, we prove proportionality, i.e., explicit dependence on the distance to the (controlled) equilibrium, of the derived bound on the full approximation error. Leveraging this key property, we rigorously show that asymptotic stability of the data-driven surrogate (control) system implies asymptotic stability of the original (control) system and vice versa.</description>

      <title>Classical Combinatorial Optimization Scaling for Random Ising Models on 2D Heavy-Hex Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by near term quantum computing hardware limitations, combinatorial optimization problems that can be addressed by current quantum algorithms and noisy hardware with little or no overhead are used to probe capabilities of quantum algorithms such as the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). In this study, a specific class of near term quantum computing hardware defined combinatorial optimization problems, Ising models on heavy-hex graphs both with and without geometrically local cubic terms, are examined for their classical computational hardness via empirical computation time scaling quantification. Specifically the Time-to-Solution metric using the classical heuristic simulated annealing is measured for finding optimal variable assignments (ground states), as well as the time required for the optimization software Gurobi to find an optimal variable assignment. Because of the sparsity of these Ising models, the classical algorithms are able to find optimal solutions efficiently even for large instances (i.e. $100,000$ variables). The Ising models both with and without geometrically local cubic terms exhibit average-case linear-time or weakly quadratic scaling when solved exactly using Gurobi, and the Ising models with no cubic terms show evidence of exponential-time Time-to-Solution scaling when sampled using simulated annealing. These findings point to the necessity of developing and testing more complex, namely more densely connected, optimization problems in order for quantum computing to ever have a practical advantage over classical computing. Our results are another illustration that different classical algorithms can indeed have exponentially different running times, thus making the identification of the best practical classical technique important in any quantum computing vs. classical computing comparison.</description>

      <title>An Alternating Approach to Approximate Dynamic Programming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06983v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we give a new approximate dynamic programming (ADP) method to solve large-scale Markov decision programming (MDP) problem. In comparison with many classic ADP methods which have large number of constraints, we formulate an alternating ADP (AADP) which have both small number of constraints and small number of variables by approximating the decision variables (instead of the objective functions in classic ADP) and write the dual of the exact LP. Also, to get the basis functions, we use kernel approximation instead of empirical choice of basis functions, which can efficiently learn nonlinear functions while retaining the expressive power. By treating option pricing as an large-scale MDP problem, we apply the AADP method to give an empirical proof that American call option will not be exercised earlier if the underlying stock has no dividend payment, which is a classic result proved by Black-Scholes model. We also make comparison of pricing options in high-dimensional with some benchmark option pricing papers which use the classic ADP to give upper and lower bound of the option price.</description>

      <title>First-ish Order Methods: Hessian-aware Scalings of Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03701v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gradient descent is the primary workhorse for optimizing large-scale problems in machine learning. However, its performance is highly sensitive to the choice of the learning rate. A key limitation of gradient descent is its lack of natural scaling, which often necessitates expensive line searches or heuristic tuning to determine an appropriate step size. In this paper, we address this limitation by incorporating Hessian information to scale the gradient direction. By accounting for the curvature of the function along the gradient, our adaptive, Hessian-aware scaling method ensures a local unit step size guarantee, even in nonconvex settings. Near a local minimum that satisfies the second-order sufficient conditions, our approach achieves linear convergence with a unit step size. We show that our method converges globally under a significantly weaker version of the standard Lipschitz gradient smoothness assumption. Even when Hessian information is inexact, the local unit step size guarantee and global convergence properties remain valid under mild conditions. Finally, we validate our theoretical results empirically on a range of convex and nonconvex machine learning tasks, showcasing the effectiveness of the approach.</description>

      <title>Properties of Turnpike Functions for Discounted Finite MDPs</title>

Abstract: This paper studies discounted Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with finite sets of states and actions. Value iteration is one of the major methods for finding optimal policies. For each discount factor, starting from a finite number of iterations, which is called the turnpike integer, value iteration algorithms always generate decision rules, which are deterministic optimal policies for the infinite-horizon problems. This fact justifies the rolling horizon approach for computing infinite-horizon optimal policies by conducting a finite number of value iterations. This paper describes properties of turnpike integers and provides their upper bounds.</description>

      <title>Tractable downfall of basis pursuit in structured sparse optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19126v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of finding the sparsest solution to a linear underdetermined system of equations, often appearing, e.g., in data analysis, optimal control, system identification or sensor selection problems, is considered. This non-convex problem is commonly solved by convexification via $\ell_1$-norm minimization, known as basis pursuit (BP). In this work, a class of structured matrices, representing the system of equations, is introduced for which (BP) tractably fails to recover the sparsest solution. In particular, this enables efficient identification of matrix columns corresponding to unrecoverable non-zero entries of the sparsest solution and determination of the uniqueness of such a solution. These deterministic guarantees contrast with popular probabilistic ones and provide insights into the a priori design of sparse optimization problems. As our matrix structures appear naturally in optimal control problems, we exemplify our findings based on a fuel-optimal control problem for a class of discrete-time linear time-invariant systems.</description>

      <title>On the asymptotic behaviour of stochastic processes, with applications to supermartingale convergence, Dvoretzky's approximation theorem, and stochastic quasi-Fej\'er monotonicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12922v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a novel and general result on the asymptotic behavior of stochastic processes which conform to a certain relaxed supermartingale condition. Our result provides quantitative information in the form of an explicit and effective construction of a rate of convergence for this process, both in mean and almost surely, that is moreover highly uniform in that it only depends on very few data of the surrounding objects involved in the iteration. We then apply this result to derive new quantitative versions of well-known concepts and theorems from stochastic approximation, in particular providing effective rates for a variant of the Robbins-Siegmund theorem, Dvoretzky's convergence theorem, as well as the convergence of stochastic quasi-Fej\'er monotone sequences, the latter of which formulated in a novel and highly general metric context. We utilize the classic and widely studied Robbins-Monro procedure as a template to evaluate our quantitative results and their applicability in greater detail. We conclude by illustrating the breadth of potential further applications with a brief discussion on a variety of other well-known iterative procedures from stochastic approximation. Throughout, we isolate and discuss special cases of our results which allow for the construction of fast, and in particular linear, rates.</description>

      <title>Phase retrieval and matrix sensing via benign and overparametrized nonconvex optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a nonconvex optimization algorithmic approach to phase retrieval and the more general problem of semidefinite low-rank matrix sensing. Specifically, we analyze the nonconvex landscape of a quartic Burer-Monteiro factored least-squares optimization problem. We develop a new analysis framework, taking advantage of the semidefinite problem structure, to understand the properties of second-order critical points -- specifically, whether they (approximately) recover the ground truth matrix. We show that it can be helpful to (mildly) overparametrize the problem, that is, to optimize over matrices of higher rank than the ground truth. We then apply this framework to several well-studied problem instances: in addition to recovering existing state-of-the-art phase retrieval landscape guarantees (without overparametrization), we show that overparametrizing by a factor at most logarithmic in the dimension allows recovery with optimal statistical sample complexity and error for the problems of (1) phase retrieval with sub-Gaussian measurements and (2) more general semidefinite matrix sensing with rank-1 Gaussian measurements. Previously, such statistical results had been shown only for estimators based on semidefinite programming. More generally, our analysis is partially based on the powerful method of convex dual certificates, suggesting that it could be applied to a much wider class of problems.</description>

      <title>Agency Problems and Adversarial Bilevel Optimization under Uncertainty and Cyber Threats</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08989v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study an agency problem between a holding company and its subsidiary, exposed to cyber threats that affect the overall value of the subsidiary. The holding company seeks to design an optimal incentive scheme to mitigate these losses. In response, the subsidiary selects an optimal cybersecurity investment strategy, modeled through a stochastic epidemiological SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) framework. The cyber threat landscape is captured through an L-hop risk framework with two primary sources of risk: (i) internal risk propagation via the contagion parameters in the SIR model, and (ii) external cyberattacks from a malicious external hacker. The uncertainty and adversarial nature of the hacking lead to consider a robust stochastic control approach that allows for increased volatility and ambiguity induced by cyber incidents. The agency problem is formulated as a max-min bilevel stochastic control problem with accidents. First, we derive the incentive compatibility condition by reducing the subsidiary's optimal response to the solution of a second-order backward stochastic differential equation with jumps. Next, we demonstrate that the principal's problem can be equivalently reformulated as an integro-partial Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman-Isaacs (HJBI) equation. By extending the stochastic Perron's method to our setting, we show that the value function of the problem is the unique viscosity solution to the resulting integro-partial HJBI equation.</description>

      <title>A Complete Loss Landscape Analysis of Regularized Deep Matrix Factorization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite its wide range of applications across various domains, the optimization foundations of deep matrix factorization (DMF) remain largely open. In this work, we aim to fill this gap by conducting a comprehensive study of the loss landscape of the regularized DMF problem. Toward this goal, we first provide a closed-form characterization of all critical points of the problem. Building on this, we establish precise conditions under which a critical point is a local minimizer, a global minimizer, a strict saddle point, or a non-strict saddle point. Leveraging these results, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition under which every critical point is either a local minimizer or a strict saddle point. This provides insights into why gradient-based methods almost always converge to a local minimizer of the regularized DMF problem. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments to visualize its loss landscape to support our theory.</description>

      <title>Computer-aided analyses of stochastic first-order methods, via interpolation conditions for stochastic optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05466v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work proposes a framework, embedded within the Performance Estimation framework (PEP), for obtaining worst-case performance guarantees on stochastic first-order methods. Given a first-order method, a function class, and a noise model with prescribed expectation and variance properties, we present a range of semidefinite programs (SDPs) of increasingly large size, whose solutions yield increasingly strong convergence guarantees on the problem. Eventually, we propose SDPs whose size depends on $2^N$, with $N$ the number of iterations analyzed, that yield tight guarantees, attained by specific functions and noise distributions within these classes. On the other side of the spectrum, we propose SDPs whose size depends linearly on $N$, and numerically show that, on many problems, they already provide tight guarantees.
  The framework accommodates a wide range of stochastic settings, with finite or infinite support, including the unstructured noise model with bounded variance, finite-sum optimization, and block-coordinate methods, in a unified manner, as guarantees apply to any setting consistent with the noise model, i.e., its expectation and variance. It covers both non-variance-reduced and variance-reduced methods. Using the framework, we analyze the stochastic gradient method under several noise models, and illustrate how the resulting numerical and analytical convergence rates connect with existing results. In particular, we provide improved convergence rates on the unstructured noise model with bounded variance and in the block-coordinate setting.</description>

      <title>Globally Optimal Quantum Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.05790v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimization of constrained quantum control problems powers quantum technologies. This task becomes very difficult when these control problems are non-convex and plagued with dense local extrema. For such problems current optimization methods must be repeated many times to find good solutions, each time requiring many simulations of the system. Here, we present Quantum Control via Polynomial Optimization (QCPOP), a method that eliminates this problem by directly finding globally optimal solutions. The resulting increase in speed, which can be a thousandfold or more, makes it possible to solve problems that were previously intractable. This remarkable advance is due to global optimization methods recently developed for polynomial functions. We demonstrate the power of this method by showing that it obtains an optimal solution in a single run for a problem in which local extrema are so dense that gradient methods require thousands of runs to reach a similar fidelity. Since QCPOP is able to find the global optimum for quantum control, we expect that it will not only enhance the utility of quantum control by making it much easier to find the necessary protocols, but provide a key tool for understanding the precise limits of quantum technologies. Finally, we note that the ability to cast quantum control as polynomial optimization resolves an open question regarding the computability of exact solutions to quantum control problems.</description>

      <title>Faster Reinforcement Learning by Freezing Slow States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.00922v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study infinite horizon Markov decision processes (MDPs) with "fast-slow" structure, where some state variables evolve rapidly ("fast states") while others change more gradually ("slow states"). This structure commonly arises in practice when decisions must be made at high frequencies over long horizons, and where slowly changing information still plays a critical role in determining optimal actions. Examples include inventory control under slowly changing demand indicators or dynamic pricing with gradually shifting consumer behavior. Modeling the problem at the natural decision frequency leads to MDPs with discount factors close to one, making them computationally challenging. We propose a novel approximation strategy that "freezes" slow states during phases of lower-level planning and subsequently applies value iteration to an auxiliary upper-level MDP that evolves on a slower timescale. Freezing states for short periods of time leads to easier-to-solve lower-level problems, while a slower upper-level timescale allows for a more favorable discount factor. On the theoretical side, we analyze the regret incurred by our frozen-state approach, which leads to simple insights on how to trade off regret versus computational cost. Empirically, we benchmark our new frozen-state methods on three domains, (i) inventory control with fixed order costs, (ii) a gridworld problem with spatial tasks, and (iii) dynamic pricing with reference-price effects. We demonstrate that the new methods produce high-quality policies with significantly less computation, and we show that simply omitting slow states is often a poor heuristic.</description>

      <title>Large Deviations for Empirical Measures of Self-Interacting Markov Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.01384v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Delta^o$ be a finite set and, for each probability measure $m$ on $\Delta^o$, let $G(m)$ be a transition probability kernel on $\Delta^o$. Fix $x_0 \in \Delta^o$ and consider the chain $\{X_n, \; n \in \mathbb{N}_0\}$ of $\Delta^o$-valued random variables such that $X_0=x$, and given $X_0, \ldots , X_n$, the conditional distribution of $X_{n+1}$ is $G(L^{n+1})(X_n, \cdot)$, where $L^{n+1} = \frac{1}{n+1} \sum_{i=0}^{n} \delta_{X_i}$ is the empirical measure at instant $n$. Under conditions on $G$ we establish a large deviation principle for the empirical measure sequence $\{L^n, \; n \in \mathbb{N}\}$. As one application of this result we obtain large deviation asymptotics for the Aldous-Flannery-Palacios (1988) approximation scheme for quasistationary distributions of irreducible finite state Markov chains. The conditions on $G$ cover various other models of reinforced stochastic evolutions as well, including certain vertex reinforced and edge reinforced random walks and a variant of the PageRank algorithm. The particular case where $G(m)$ does not depend on $m$ corresponds to the classical results of Donsker and Varadhan (1975) on large deviations of empirical measures of Markov processes. However, unlike this classical setting, for the general self-interacting models considered here, the rate function takes a very different form; it is typically non-convex and is given through a dynamical variational formula with an infinite horizon discounted objective function.</description>

      <title>Two Pareto Optimum-based Heuristic Algorithms for Minimizing Tardiness and Late Jobs in the Single Machine Flowshop Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03778v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flowshop problems play a prominent role in operations research, and have considerable practical significance. The single-machine flowshop problem is of particular theoretical interest. Until now the problem of minimizing late jobs or job tardiness can only be solved exactly by computationally-intensive methods such as dynamic programming or linear programming. In this paper we introduce, test, and optimize two new heuristic algorithms for mixed tardiness and late job minimization in single-machine flowshops. The two algorithms both build partial schedules iteratively. Both also retain Pareto optimal solutions at intermediate stages, to take into account both tardiness and late jobs within the partial schedule, as well as the effect of partial completion time on not-yet scheduled jobs. Both algorithms can be applied to scenarios with hundreds of jobs, with execution times running from less than a second to a few minutes. Although they are slower than dispatch rule-based heuristics, the solutions obtained are far better. We also compare a neural-network solution, which performs poorly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13407v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive novel deterministic bounds on the approximation error of data-based bilinear surrogate models for unknown nonlinear systems. The surrogate models are constructed using kernel-based extended dynamic mode decomposition to approximate the Koopman operator in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Unlike previous methods that require restrictive assumptions on the invariance of the dictionary, our approach leverages kernel-based dictionaries that allow us to control the projection error via pointwise error bounds, overcoming a significant limitation of existing theoretical guarantees. The derived state- and input-dependent error bounds allow for direct integration into Koopman-based robust controller designs with closed-loop guarantees for the unknown nonlinear system. Numerical examples illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07209v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Implied-integer detection is a well-known presolving technique that is used by many Mixed-Integer Linear Programming solvers. Informally, a variable is said to be implied integer if its integrality is enforced implicitly by integrality of other variables and the constraints of a problem. In this work we formalize the definition of implied integrality by taking a polyhedral perspective. Our main result characterizes implied integrality as occurring when a subset of integer variables is fixed to integer values and the polyhedron on the remaining variables is integral. While integral polyhedra are well-understood theoretically, existing detection methods infer implied integrality only for one variable at a time. We introduce new detection methods based on the detection of integral polyhedra, extending existing techniques to multiple variables. Additionally, we discuss the computational complexity of recognizing implied integers. We conduct experiments using a new detection method that uses totally unimodular submatrices to identify implied integrality. For the MIPLIB 2017 collection dataset our results indicate that, on average, 18.8% of the variables are classified as implied integer after presolving, compared to just 3.3% identified by state-of-the-art techniques. Moreover, we are able to reduce the average percentage of variables whose integrality needs to be enforced after presolving from 70.2% to 59.0%.</description>

      <title>A stabilized march approach to adjoint-based sensitivity analysis of chaotic flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adjoint-based sensitivity analysis is of interest in computational science due to its ability to compute sensitivities at a lower cost with respect to several design parameters. However, conventional sensitivity analysis methods fail in the presence of chaotic flows. Popular approaches to chaotic sensitivity analysis of flows involve the use of the shadowing trajectory. The state-of-the-art approach computes the shadowing trajectory by solving a least squares minimization problem, resulting in a space-time linear system of equations. The current paper computes the adjoint shadowing trajectory using the stabilized march, by specifying the adjoint boundary conditions instead of solving a minimization problem. This approach results in a space-time linear system that can be solved through a single backward substitution of order $\mathcal{O}(n_u^2)$ with $n_u$ being the dimension of the unstable subspace. It is proven to compute sensitivities that converge to the true sensitivity for large integration times and that the error in the sensitivity due to the discretization is of the order of the local truncation error of the scheme. The approach is numerically verified on the Lorentz 63 and Kuramoto-Sivasinsky equations.</description>

Abstract: Computing channel capacity is in general intractable because it is given by the limit of a sequence of optimization problems whose dimensionality grows to infinity. As a result, constant-sized characterizations of feedback or non-feedback capacity are known for only a few classes of channels with memory. This paper introduces poset-causal channels$\unicode{x2014}$a new formalism of a communication channel in which channel inputs and outputs are indexed by the elements of a partially ordered set (poset). We develop a novel methodology that allows us to establish a single-letter upper bound on the feedback capacity of a subclass of poset-causal channels whose memory structure exhibits a Markov property and symmetry. The methodology is based on symmetry reduction in optimization. We instantiate our method on two channel models: the Noisy Output is The STate (NOST) channel$\unicode{x2014}$for which the bound is tight$\unicode{x2014}$and a new two-dimensional extension of it.</description>
