      <title>Helical Phononic Modes Induced by a Screw Dislocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate a one-dimensional (1D) unidirectional phononic waveguide embedded within a three-dimensional (3D) hexagonal close-packed phononic crystal, achieved by the introduction of a screw dislocation. This approach does not rely on the non-trivial topological characteristics of the 3D crystal. We discover that this dislocation induces a pair of helical modes, characterized by their orthogonal $x$- and $y$-directional displacements being out of phase by 90 degrees, which results in a distinctive rotational motion. These helical modes demonstrate directional propagation, tightly linked to the helicity of the screw dislocation. Through considerations of symmetry, we reveal that the emergence of these helical modes is governed by the symmetry of the screw dislocation itself. Our findings not only provide insights into the interplay between dislocation-induced symmetry and wave propagation in phononic systems but also open new avenues for designing directionally selective waveguides without relying on the crystal's topological properties.</description>

      <title>Design of Tunable Perfect Absorbers in the Mid-IR Spectrum Using Graphene-Based Multilayer Structures: Emerging Applications in Atmospheric Window Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces tunable and switchable Perfect Absorbers (PAs) operating within the mid-infrared spectrum, specifically targeting the 3 to 5 um range at 0.25 um intervals. This spectrum is engineered for minimal atmospheric absorption and unique transmission characteristics. Our approach uses graphene-based nanophotonic aperiodic multilayer structures, optimized through micro-genetic algorithms within an inverse design framework. This combination broadens the design space, enabling highly accurate absorption control. Using the Transfer-Matrix-Method for simulations, we tailor absorption characteristics while keeping the structures under 2 um thick. Our results demonstrate PA tunability and switchability by adjusting graphene layers' chemical potentials. For instance, a 4 um peak can shift to 4.22 um by changing the graphene potential from 0 eV to 1 eV, without reducing efficiency. Our research also reveals PA adaptability to incident angles, maintaining 90% absorption up to 52 degrees, demonstrating versatility for applications like thermal photovoltaics, sensors, and stealth technology. This research deepens our understanding of nanophotonic materials and advances optical devices for the mid-IR range.</description>

      <title>Realization of a Two-Dimensional Lieb Lattice in a Metal-Inorganic Framework with Flat Bands and Topological Edge States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flat bands and Dirac cones in materials are at the source of the exotic electronic and topological properties. The Lieb lattice is expected to host these electronic structures, arising from quantum destructive interference. Nevertheless, the experimental realization of a two-dimensional Lieb lattice remained challenging to date due to its intrinsic structural instability. After computationally designing a Platinum-Phosphorus (Pt-P) Lieb lattice, we have successfully overcome its structural instability and synthesized it on a gold substrate via molecular beam epitaxy. Low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy verified the Lieb lattice's morphology and electronic flat bands. Furthermore, topological Dirac edge states stemming from pronounced spin-orbit coupling induced by heavy Pt atoms have been predicted. These findings convincingly open perspectives for creating metal-inorganic framework-based atomic lattices, offering prospects for strongly correlated phases interplayed with topology.</description>

      <title>Real-fluid Transport Property Computations Based on the Boltzmann-weighted Full-dimensional Potential Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intermolecular potential plays crucial roles in real-fluid interactions away from the ideal-gas equilibrium, such as supercritical fluid, high-enthalpy fluid, plasma interactions, etc. We propose a Boltzmann-weighted Full-dimensional (BWF) potential model for real-fluid computations. It includes diverse intermolecular interactions so as to determine the potential well, molecular diameter, dipole moment, polarizability of species without introducing bath gases, allowing more accurate descriptions of potential surfaces with more potential parameters. The anisotropy and temperature dependence of potential parameters are also considered by applying the Boltzmann weighting on all orientations. Through the high-level Symmetry-Adapted Perturbation Theory calculations, full-dimensional potential energy surface datasets are obtained in 432 orientations for each species. Subsequently, the Boltzmann-weighted Full-dimensional potential parameters are derived by training the dataset exceeding 5*106 data, including nonpolar and polar molecules, radicals, long-chain molecules, and ions. These BWF transport properties calculated by the BWF potential have been compared against the Lennard-Jones transport properties as well as experimental viscosity, mass diffusivity, and thermal conductivity coefficients. It shows discrepancies of viscosity coefficients within 1% and 5% for nonpolar and polar molecules, respectively. Furthermore, this potential model is applied to study radicals, long-chain molecules, and ions, for which the experimental data is rarely accessed in high accuracy. It indicates significant prediction improvements of complex interactions between various particles. The new transport properties are also embedded to predict the laminar flame speeds and the flame extinction limits of methane, dimethyl ether, and n-heptane at elevated pressures, confirming its predictivity and effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Walking on Spheres and Talking to Neighbors: Variance Reduction for Laplace's Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Walk on Spheres algorithms leverage properties of Brownian Motion to create Monte Carlo estimates of solutions to a class of elliptic partial differential equations. Until recently, estimates were constructed pointwise and did not utilize the relationship between solutions at nearby points within a domain. We propose a new caching strategy which leverages the continuity of paths of Brownian Motion. In the case of Laplace's equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions, our novel algorithm has improved asymptotic runtime compared to previous approaches. This is achieved by passing information from a cache of constant size. We also provide bounds on the performance of our algorithm and demonstrate its performance on an example problem.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable collective resonances induced by liquid crystals in dielectric metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dielectric metasurfaces can show multi-resonant response with high Q-factors in the visible range due to multipole coupling. This work suggests that these collective resonances in all-dielectric metasurfaces can be modified if adjacent to an anisotropic liquid crystal medium, opening a new path toward the dynamic metasurface effects. Using numerical full-wave simulations and the multipole decomposition technique for reflection and transmission coefficients we study the influence of the surrounding anisotropic medium on the resonant response of metasurfaces composed of disk-shaped dielectric nanoparticles. First, we consider tuning and switching the resonances induced by the polarization of the incident beam in metasurfaces placed in a medium with different orientations of LC molecules. Secondly, we study the case when the tuning of resonances is carried out by applying an external voltage that changes the orientation of LC molecules and thereby changes the refractive index of the surrounding medium. The results obtained demonstrate the possibility of directly tuning the resonant response of dielectric metasurfaces in an anisotropic environment, which is important for the development of optical nanodevices with dynamic switching of functional modes in the visible range.</description>

      <title>Tunable quasi-discrete spectrum of spin waves excited by periodic laser patterns</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a concept for selective excitation of magnetostatic surface waves with quasi-discrete spectrum using spatially patterned femtosecond laser pulses inducing either ultrafast change of magnetic anisotropy or inverse Faraday effect. We micromagnetically simulate excitation of the waves with periodically patterned uni- or bipolar laser impact. Such excitation yields multiple wavepackets propagating with different group velocities, whose dispersion corresponds to the set of quasi-discrete points. In addition, we show that the frequency of the spectral peaks can be controlled by the polarity of the periodic impact and its spatial period. Presented consideration of multiple spatially periodic SW sources as a whole enables implementation of a comprehensive toolkit of spatio-temporal optical methods for tunable SW excitation and control of its parameters.</description>

Abstract: Efficient energy harvesting, conversion, and recycling technologies are crucial for addressing the challenges faced by modern societies and the global economy. The potential of harnessing mid-infrared (mid-IR) thermal radiation as a pervasive and readily available energy source has so far no been fully exploited, particularly through bioinspiration. In this article, by reviewing existing photon-based strategies and the efficiency of natural systems in harnessing light and thermal radiation, I highlight the promising role of bioinspiration in enhancing energy capture, conversion, and recycling. Natural photonic structures found in various organisms, including insects, birds, and plants, exhibit sophisticated optical properties that can be leveraged for energy-efficient applications. These developments pave the way for future research and innovation in bioinspired energy solutions. Ultimately, they contribute to the pursuit of a sustainable and environmentally conscious future by harnessing the beauty of nature's designs to meet humankind's energy needs.</description>

      <title>On the suitability of single-edge notch tension (SENT) testing for assessing hydrogen-assisted cracking susceptibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Combined experiments and computational modelling are used to increase understanding of the suitability of the Single-Edge Notch Tension (SENT) test for assessing hydrogen embrittlement susceptibility. The SENT tests were designed to provide the mode I threshold stress intensity factor ($K_{\text{th}}$) for hydrogen-assisted cracking of a C110 steel in two corrosive environments. These were accompanied by hydrogen permeation experiments to relate the environments to the absorbed hydrogen concentrations. A coupled phase-field-based deformation-diffusion-fracture model is then employed to simulate the SENT tests, predicting $K_{\text{th}}$ in good agreement with the experimental results and providing insights into the hydrogen absorption-diffusion-cracking interactions. The suitability of SENT testing and its optimal characteristics (e.g., test duration) are discussed in terms of the various simultaneous active time-dependent phenomena, triaxiality dependencies, and regimes of hydrogen embrittlement susceptibility.</description>

      <title>Fast \textit{ab initio} design of high-entropy magnetic thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the magnetic properties of high-entropy alloys (HEAs) can be captured by \textit{ab initio} calculations within the coherent potential approximation, where the atomic details of the high-entropy mixing are considered as an effective medium that possesses the translational symmetry of the lattice. This is demonstrated using the face-centered cubic (FCC) phase of $\textrm{FeCoNiMnCu}$ and the $L1_0$ phase of $\textrm{(FeCoNiMnCu)Pt}$ by comparing the density functional theory (DFT) results with the experimental values. Working within the first Brillouin zone and the primitive unit cell, we show that DFT can capture the smooth profile of magnetic properties such as the saturation magnetization, the Curie temperature and the magnetic anisotropy, using only a sparse set of sampling points in the vast compositional space. The smooth profiles given by DFT indeed follow the experimental trend, demonstrating the promising potential of using machine learning to explore the magnetic properties of HEAs, by establishing reasonably large datasets with high-throughput calculations using density-functional theory.</description>

      <title>Analytical approach to the design of RF photoinjector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The objective of this thesis is to ascertain the dimensions of an RF 2.856GHz photoinjector through a combination of analytical and computational approaches. The phase velocity within a single cavity exceeds 'c', rendering it inadequate for storing the requisite energy for beam acceleration. To surmount this limitation, we aim to devise a multi-celled cavity design. However, the alterations in electromagnetic fields and resonant frequency within the multi-celled cavity are intricate and sensitive, presenting challenges in obtaining precise dimensions solely via computer simulations. Prior to numerical methods, it is essential to analyze the photoinjector using theoretical frameworks. We employ perturbation theory and the construction of an equivalent circuit to elucidate the underlying physics of the photoinjector and the electrical oscillations within the cell structure. Detailed analytical methods for the equivalent circuit are explored. Through theoretical analysis, the dimensions and simulation outcomes can be determined quantitatively.</description>

      <title>Enhanced second harmonic generation in high-$Q$ all-dielectric metasurfaces with backward coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here we employ the quasi-bound state in the continuum (quasi-BIC) resonance in all-dielectric metasurfaces for efficient nonlinear processes in consideration of backward coupling. We theoretically study the second-harmonic generation (SHG) from symmetry-broken AlGaAs metasurfaces and reveal the efficiency enhancement empowered by high-$Q$ quasi-BIC resonances. By introducing the correction term of nonlinear polarization at the fundamental wave field to the conventional undepleted approximation, we uncover the effect of backward coupling on the nonlinear conversation efficiency. The SHG efficiency as $3.94\times10^{-3}$ with the developed depleted approximation, shows a 9$\%$ decrease compared with $4.33\times10^{-3}$ in conventional undepleted approximation, under the incident intensity of 10 GW/cm$^{2}$. Our results are of significant importance for designing efficient nonlinear metasurfaces supporting high-$Q$ resonances.</description>

      <title>Spectral measures and iterative bounds for effective diffusivity of steady and space-time periodic flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over three decades ago the advection-diffusion equation for a steady fluid velocity field was homogenized, leading to a Stieltjes integral representation for the effective diffusivity, which is given in terms of a spectral measure of a compact self-adjoint operator and the P\'eclet number of the fluid flow. This result was recently extended to space-time periodic flows, instead involving an unbounded self-adjoint operator. Pad\'e approximants provide rigorous upper and lower bounds for Stieltjes functions in terms of the moments of the spectral measure. However, with the lack of a method for calculating the moments of the spectral measure for general fluid velocity fields, the utility of this powerful mathematical framework for calculating bounds for the effective diffusivity has not been fully realized. Here we significantly expand the applicability of this framework by providing an iterative method that enables an arbitrary number of moments, hence bounds, to be calculated analytically in closed form for both spatially and space-time periodic flows. The method is demonstrated for periodic flows in two spatial dimensions. The known asymptotic behavior of the effective diffusivity for a steady flow is accurately captured by high order upper and lower bounds, demonstrating the ability of the method to provide accurate estimates for the effective diffusivity for a broad range of parameter values.</description>

Abstract: The combination of high-throughput experimentation techniques and machine learning (ML) has recently ushered in a new era of accelerated material discovery, enabling the identification of materials with cutting-edge properties. However, the measurement of certain physical quantities remains challenging to automate. Specifically, meticulous process control, experimentation and laborious measurements are required to achieve optimal electrical conductivity in doped polymer materials. We propose a ML approach, which relies on readily measured absorbance spectra, to accelerate the workflow associated with measuring electrical conductivity. The classification model accurately classifies samples with a conductivity &gt; 25 to 100 S/cm, achieving a maximum of 100 % accuracy rate. For the subset of highly conductive samples, we employed a regression model to predict their conductivities, yielding an impressive test R2 value of 0.984. We tested the models with samples of the two highest conductivities (498 and 506 S/cm) and showed that they were able to correctly classify and predict the two extrapolative conductivities at satisfactory levels of errors. The proposed ML-assisted workflow results in an improvement in the efficiency of the conductivity measurements by 89 % of the maximum achievable using our experimental techniques. Furthermore, our approach addressed the common challenge of the lack of explainability in ML models by exploiting bespoke mathematical properties of the descriptors and ML model, allowing us to gain corroborated insights into the spectral influences on conductivity. Through this study, we offer an accelerated pathway for optimizing the properties of doped polymer materials while showcasing the valuable insights that can be derived from purposeful utilization of ML in experimental science.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Machine Learning for Seismic Response Prediction OF Nonlinear Steel Moment Resisting Frame Structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17992v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is growing interest in using machine learning (ML) methods for structural metamodeling due to the substantial computational cost of traditional simulations. Purely data-driven strategies often face limitations in model robustness, interpretability, and dependency on extensive data. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel physics-informed machine learning (PiML) method that integrates scientific principles and physical laws into deep neural networks to model seismic responses of nonlinear structures. The approach constrains the ML model's solution space within known physical bounds through three main features: dimensionality reduction via combined model order reduction and wavelet analysis, long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, and Newton's second law. Dimensionality reduction addresses structural systems' redundancy and boosts efficiency while extracting essential features through wavelet analysis. LSTM networks capture temporal dependencies for accurate time-series predictions. Manipulating the equation of motion helps learn system nonlinearities and confines solutions within physically interpretable results. These attributes allow for model training with sparse data, enhancing accuracy, interpretability, and robustness. Furthermore, a dataset of archetype steel moment resistant frames under seismic loading, available in the DesignSafe-CI Database [1], is considered for evaluation. The resulting metamodel handles complex data better than existing physics-guided LSTM models and outperforms other non-physics data-driven networks.</description>

Abstract: This study investigates failure mechanisms in a typical thermal barrier coating (TBC) system comprising an EB-PVD columnar top coat, an aluminide bond coat, and a Ni-based single crystal superalloy substrate, simulating gas turbine operating conditions using a burner rig. TBC degradation, initiated by interfacial defects from the LASAT method, was studied during thermal gradient cycling under fast and slow cooling. In-situ optical and infrared imaging, along with ex-situ SEM cross-sectional analysis, monitored failure mechanisms. The Laser Shock for Damage Monitoring (LASDAM) technique provided insights into gradient and cooling rate impacts on columnar TBC damage. Results showed significant effects of cooling rate on delamination and localized failure at blister sites, with LASDAM revealing significant overheating at damage sites. Analysis included full-field temperature and damage assessment, emphasizing blister-driven delamination under severe thermal gradients. Discussion focused on elastic stored energy effects, noting that fast cooling induced transient conditions where reversed temperature gradients increased damage, limiting TBC lifespan</description>
