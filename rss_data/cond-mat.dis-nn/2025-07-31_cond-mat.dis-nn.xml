      <title>Better Together: Cross and Joint Covariances Enhance Signal Detectability in Undersampled Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many data-science applications involve detecting a shared signal between two high-dimensional variables. Using random matrix theory methods, we determine when such signal can be detected and reconstructed from sample correlations, despite the background of sampling noise induced correlations. We consider three different covariance matrices constructed from two high-dimensional variables: their individual self covariance, their cross covariance, and the self covariance of the concatenated (joint) variable, which incorporates the self and the cross correlation blocks. We observe the expected Baik, Ben Arous, and P\'ech\'e detectability phase transition in all these covariance matrices, and we show that joint and cross covariance matrices always reconstruct the shared signal earlier than the self covariances. Whether the joint or the cross approach is better depends on the mismatch of dimensionalities between the variables. We discuss what these observations mean for choosing the right method for detecting linear correlations in data and how these findings may generalize to nonlinear statistical dependencies.</description>

      <title>Transparency versus Anderson localization in one-dimensional disordered stealthy hyperuniform layered media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present numerical simulations of disordered stealthy hyperuniform layered media ranging up to 10,000 thin slabs of high-dielectric constant separated by intervals of low dielectric constant that show no apparent evidence of Anderson localization of electromagnetic waves or deviations from transparency for a continuous band of frequencies ranging from zero up to some value $\omega_T$. The results are consistent with the strong-contrast formula including its tight upper bound on $\omega_T$ and with previous simulations on much smaller systems. We utilize a transfer matrix method to compute the Lyaponov exponents, which we show is a more reliable method for detecting Anderson localization by applying it to a range of systems with common types of disorder known to exhibit localization, such as perturbed periodic lattices. The Lyaponov exponents for these systems with ordinary disorder show clear evidence of localization, in contrast to the cases of perfectly periodically spaced slabs and disordered stealthy hyperuniform layered systems. As with any numerical study, one should be cautious about drawing definitive conclusions. There remains the challenge of determining whether one-dimensional disordered stealthy hyperuniform layered media possess a finite localization length on some scale much larger than our already large system size or, alternatively, are exceptions to the standard Anderson localization theorems.</description>

      <title>CLuP practically achieves $\sim 1.77$ positive and $\sim 0.33$ negative Hopfield model ground state free energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study algorithmic aspects of finding $n$-dimensional \emph{positive} and \emph{negative} Hopfield ($\pm$Hop) model ground state free energies. This corresponds to classical maximization of random positive/negative semi-definite quadratic forms over binary $\left \{\pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} \right \}^n$ vectors. The key algorithmic question is whether these problems can be computationally efficiently approximated within a factor $\approx 1$. Following the introduction and success of \emph{Controlled Loosening-up} (CLuP-SK) algorithms in finding near ground state energies of closely related Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) models [82], we here propose a CLuP$\pm$Hop counterparts for $\pm$Hop models. Fully lifted random duality theory (fl RDT) [78] is utilized to characterize CLuP$\pm$Hop \emph{typical} dynamics. An excellent agreement between practical performance and theoretical predictions is observed. In particular, for $n$ as small as few thousands CLuP$\pm$Hop achieve $\sim 1.77$ and $\sim 0.33$ as the ground state free energies of the positive and negative Hopfield models. At the same time we obtain on the 6th level of lifting (6-spl RDT) corresponding theoretical thermodynamic ($n\rightarrow\infty$) limits $\approx 1.7784$ and $\approx 0.3281$. This positions determining Hopfield models near ground state energies as \emph{typically} easy problems. Moreover, the very same 6th lifting level evaluations allow to uncover a fundamental intrinsic difference between two models: $+$Hop's near optimal configurations are \emph{typically close} to each other whereas the $-$Hop's are \emph{typically far away}.</description>

      <title>Amorphous Solid Model of Vectorial Hopfield Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a vectorial extension of the Hopfield associative memory model inspired by the theory of amorphous solids, where binary neural states are replaced by unit vectors $\mathbf{s}_i \in \mathbb{R}^3$ on the sphere $S^2$. The generalized Hebbian learning rule creates a block-structured weight matrix through outer products of stored pattern vectors, analogous to the Hessian matrix structure in amorphous solids. We demonstrate that this model exhibits quantifiable structural properties characteristic of disordered materials: energy landscapes with deep minima for stored patterns versus random configurations (energy gaps $\sim 7$ units), strongly anisotropic correlations encoded in the weight matrix (anisotropy ratios $\sim 10^2$), and order-disorder transitions controlled by the pattern density $\gamma = P/(N \cdot d)$. The enhanced memory capacity ($\gamma_c \approx 0.55$ for a fully-connected network) compared to binary networks ($\gamma_c \approx 0.138$) and the emergence of orientational correlations establish connections between associative memory mechanisms and amorphous solid physics, particularly in systems with continuous orientational degrees of freedom. We also unveil the scaling with the coordination number $Z$ of the memory capacity: $\gamma_c \sim (Z-6)$ from the isostatic point $Z_c =6$ of the 3D elastic network, which closely mirrors the scaling of the shear modulus $G \sim (Z-6)$ in 3D central-force spring networks.</description>

      <title>Quantum generative modeling for financial time series with temporal correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum generative adversarial networks (QGANs) have been investigated as a method for generating synthetic data with the goal of augmenting training data sets for neural networks. This is especially relevant for financial time series, since we only ever observe one realization of the process, namely the historical evolution of the market, which is further limited by data availability and the age of the market. However, for classical generative adversarial networks it has been shown that generated data may (often) not exhibit desired properties (also called stylized facts), such as matching a certain distribution or showing specific temporal correlations. Here, we investigate whether quantum correlations in quantum inspired models of QGANs can help in the generation of financial time series. We train QGANs, composed of a quantum generator and a classical discriminator, and investigate two approaches for simulating the quantum generator: a full simulation of the quantum circuits, and an approximate simulation using tensor network methods. We tested how the choice of hyperparameters, such as the circuit depth and bond dimensions, influenced the quality of the generated time series. The QGAN that we trained generate synthetic financial time series that not only match the target distribution but also exhibit the desired temporal correlations, with the quality of each property depending on the hyperparameters and simulation method.</description>

      <title>Quantum complexity phase transition in fermionic quantum circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the complexity of quantum many-body systems has been attracting much attention recently for its fundamental importance in characterizing complex quantum phases beyond the scope of quantum entanglement. Here, we investigate Krylov complexity in quantum percolation models (QPM) and establish unconventional phase transitions emergent from the interplay of exponential scaling of the Krylov complexity and the number of spanning clusters in QPM. We develop a general scaling theory for Krylov complexity phase transitions (KCPT) on QPM, and obtain exact results for the critical probabilities and exponents. For non-interacting systems across diverse lattices (1D/2D/3D regular, Bethe, and quasicrystals), our scaling theory reveals that the KCPT coincides with the classical percolation transition. In contrast, for interacting systems, we find the KCPT develops a generic separation from the percolation transition due to the highly complex quantum many-body effects, which is analogous to the Griffiths effect in the critical disorder phase transition. To test our theoretical predictions, we provide a concrete protocol for measuring the Krylov complexity, which is accessible to present experiments.</description>

      <title>Complexity in multiqubit and many-body systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The complexity of $n$-qubit and many body systems is investigated. In case of an $n$-qubit system the disturbance due to depolarization and dephasing is identified based on a certain complexity quantity defined as the difference of the Shannon-entropy and the R\'enyi entropy of order two. In case of the effect of the depolarization the quantum system is replaced by a fully separable, i.e. classical state with probability $p$ while it remains unchanged with probability $1-p$. Whereas dephasing is modelled by destructing the appropriate off-diagonal elements of the density matrix also with probability $p$. For both cases the state with maximal complexity marks the border between the most quantum and most classical limits. Furthermore we also show that many body systems modelled using deformed random matrix ensembles, deformed two-body random interaction ensembles and also the system of one-dimensional Heisenberg-model of spins subject to a random, local magnetic field exhibiting many body localization transition, the states with maximal complexity mark the cross-over or the transition point between integrability and full quantum chaos. Finally we address the question of identifying the cross-over in the thermalization properties within large sets of quantum chaotic states using the survival probability of an excitation of a many body system. All these results show that the complexity parameter defined on a combination of the von Neumann entropy and the R\'enyi entropy of 2nd order is a meaningful and informative parameter to detect whenever a system is in a cross-over state between the otherwise trivial extremal cases of integrability or localization and quantum chaos or ergodic behavior.</description>

      <title>Random matrix theory of charge distribution in disordered quantum impurity models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a bare-bone random matrix quantum impurity model, by hybridizing a localized spinless electronic level with a bath of random fermions in the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE). While stripped out of correlations effects, this model reproduces some salient features of the impurity charge distribution obtained in previous works on interacting disordered impurity models. Computing by numerical sampling the impurity charge distribution in our model, we find a crossover from a Gaussian distribution (centered on half a charge unit) at large hybridization, to a bimodal distribution (centered both on zero and full occupations of the charge) at small hybridization. In the bimodal regime, a universal $(-3/2)$ power-law is also observed. All these findings are very well accounted for by an analytic surmise computed with a single random electron level in the bath. We also derive an exact functional integral for the general probability distribution function of eigenvalues and eigenstates, that formally captures the statistical behavior of our model for any number $N$ of fermionic orbitals in the bath. In the Gaussian regime and in the limit $N\to\infty$, we are able to solve exactly the random matrix theory (RMT) for the charge distribution, obtaining perfect agreement with the numerics. Our results could be tested experimentally in mesoscopic devices, for instance by coupling a small quantum dot to a chaotic electronic reservoir, and using a quantum point contact as local charge sensor for the quantum dot occupation.</description>

      <title>Decorated Clusters and Geometrical Frustration in Cluster Spin Glass: A Random Graph Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a theory to investigate how geometrically frustrated clusters that become decorated affect the Cluster Spin Glass phase. The cluster structure is assumed to be a tetrahedron composed of Ising spins with z-anisotropy placed at its vertices that interact antiferromagnetically. We consider the probability $1-p_J$ of finding an impurity at a vertex of the tetrahedron that interacts ferromagnetically with the remaining elements inside the tetrahedron. An intercluster disorder is added as a random Gaussian interaction. The order parameters are obtained using the sparse random graph technique, which introduces the connectivity of the network of clusters as a controllable parameter in the theory. We examine changes that occur in the Cluster Spin Glass phase as a function of $p_J$ and $c$, in addition to the antiferromagnetic intracluster couplings $J_1$. For intermediate values of $p_J$, unexpected results appear. Even when some clusters contain a ferromagnetic impurity, there will still be robust geometric frustration effects in the cluster network. However, the $p_J$ threshold for this to occur depends on connectivity. Conversely, below this threshold, reduced GF effects favor the reappearance of the CSG phase. Furthermore, the Curie-Weiss temperature $\Theta_W$ has a gradual change of signal, indicating that the effects of the impurities extend to the paramagnetic phase.</description>

      <title>Genuine multipartite entanglement as a probe of many-body localization in disordered spin chains with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the quenched average genuine multipartite entanglement (GME) can approach its maximum value in the ergodic phase of a disordered quantum spin model. In contrast, GME vanishes in the many-body localized (MBL) phase, both in equilibrium and in the long-time dynamical steady state, indicating a lack of useful entanglement in the localized regime. To establish this, we analyze the disordered Heisenberg spin chain subjected to a random magnetic field and incorporating two- and three-body Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions. We exhibit that the behavior of GME, in both static eigenstates and in dynamically evolved states from an initial Neel configuration, serves as a reliable indicator of the critical disorder strength required for the ergodic-to-MBL transition. The identified transition point aligns well with standard indicators such as the gap ratio and correlation length. Moreover, we find that the presence of DM interactions, particularly the three-body one, significantly stabilizes the thermal phase and delays the onset of localization. This shift in the transition point is consistently reflected in both static and dynamical analyses, reinforcing GME as a robust probe for MBL transitions.</description>

Abstract: We study the spreading dynamics of an initially localized wave packet in 1D nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger lattices with random potential. It is shown that adding small dielectric coupling to surrounding random medium results in asymptotic localization of the nonlinear field. The nonlinear localization length depends on dielectric loss of the medium at low temperatures and the value of nonlinearity parameter. The model predicts a possibility of self-induced localization when the ``medium" to which the wave field is dielectrically coupled is the nonlinear wave itself.</description>

      <title>False signatures of non-ergodic behavior in disordered quantum many-body systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16567v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ergodic isolated quantum many-body systems satisfy the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), i.e., the expectation values of local observables in the system's eigenstates approach the predictions of the microcanonical ensemble. However, the ETH does not specify what happens to expectation values of local observables within an energy window when the average over disorder realizations is taken. As a result, the expectation values of local observables can be distributed over a relatively wide interval and may exhibit nontrivial structure, as shown in [Phys. Rev. B \textbf{104}, 214201 (2021)] for a quasiperiodic disordered system for site-resolved magnetization. We argue that the non-Gaussian form of this distribution may \textit{falsely} suggest non-ergodicity and a breakdown of ETH. By considering various types of disorder, we find that the functional forms of the distributions of matrix elements of the site-resolved magnetization operator mirror the distribution of the onsite disorder. We argue that this distribution is a direct consequence of the local observable having a finite overlap with moments of the Hamiltonian. We then demonstrate how to adjust the energy window when analyzing expectation values of local observables in disordered quantum many-body systems to correctly assess the system's adherence to ETH, and provide a link between the distribution of expectation values in eigenstates and the outcomes of quench experiments.</description>

      <title>Beyond Fragmented Dopant Dynamics in Quantum Spin Lattices: Robust Localization and Sub-diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The motion of dopants in magnetic spin lattices has received tremendous attention for at least four decades due to its connection to high-temperature superconductivity. Despite these efforts, we lack a complete understanding of their behavior, especially out-of-equilibrium and at nonzero temperatures. In this Article, we take a significant step towards a much deeper understanding based on state-of-the-art matrix-product-state calculations. In particular, we investigate the non-equilibrium dynamics of a dopant in two-leg $t$-$J$ ladders with antiferromagnetic XXZ spin interactions. In the Ising limit, we find that the dopant is localized for all investigated nonzero temperatures due to an emergent disordered potential, with a localization length controlled by the underlying correlation length of the spin lattice, whereby it only delocalizes asymptotically in the zero temperature limit. This greatly generalizes the localization effect discovered recently in Hilbert space fragmented models. In the presence of spin-exchange processes, the dopant delocalizes according to a power-law behavior, which is strongly sub-diffusive for weak spin-exchange but which eventually becomes diffusive for strong enough exchange. Moreover, we show that the underlying spin dynamics at infinite temperature behaves qualitatively the same, albeit with important quantitative differences. We substantiate these findings by showing that the dynamics shows self-similar scaling behavior, which strongly deviates from the Gaussian behavior of regular diffusion. Finally, we show that the diffusion coefficient follows an Arrhenius relation at high temperatures, whereby it exponentially decreases for decreasing temperatures.</description>
