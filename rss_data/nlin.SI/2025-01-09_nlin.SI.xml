      <title>Multidimensional integrable systems from contact geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04474v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Upon having presented a bird's eye view of history of integrable systems, we give a brief review of certain earlier advances (arXiv:1401.2122 &amp; arXiv:1812.02263) in the longstanding problem of search for partial differential systems in four independent variables, often referred to as (3+1)-dimensional or 4D systems, that are integrable in the sense of soliton theory. Namely, we review a recent construction for a large new class of (3+1)-dimensional integrable systems with Lax pairs involving contact vector fields. This class contains inter alia two infinite families of such systems, thus establishing that there is significantly more integrable (3+1)-dimensional systems than it was believed for a long time.
  In fact, the construction under study yields (3+1)-dimensional integrable generalizations of many well-known dispersionless integrable (2+1)-dimensional systems like the dispersionless KP equation, as well as a first example of a (3+1)-dimensional integrable system with an algebraic, rather than rational, nonisospectral Lax pair.
  To demonstrate the versatility of the construction in question, we employ it here to produce novel integrable (3+1)-dimensional generalizations for the following (2+1)-dimensional integrable systems: dispersionless BKP, dispersionless asymmetric Nizhnik--Veselov--Novikov, dispersionless Gardner, and dispersionless modified KP equations, and the generalized Benney system.</description>

      <title>The Method of ${\cal M}_{n}$-Extension: The KdV Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we generalize ${\cal M}_{2}$-extension that has been introduced recently. For illustration we use the KdV equation. We present five different ${\cal M}_{3}$-extensions of the KdV equation and their recursion operators. We give a compact form of ${\cal M}_{n}$-extension of the KdV equation and recursion operator of the coupled KdV system. The method of ${\cal M}_{n}$-extension can be applied to any integrable scalar equation to obtain integrable multi-field system of equations. We also present unshifted and shifted nonlocal reductions of an example of ${\cal M}_{3}$-extension of KdV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12873v8 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain the exact analytical traveling wave solutions of the Kolmogorov-Petrovskii-Piskunov equation with the reaction term belonging to the class of functions, which includes that of the (generalized) Fisher equation, for the particular values of the waves speed. Additionally we obtain the the exact analytical traveling wave solutions of the generalized Burgers-Huxley equation.</description>

      <title>A novel BPS bound with a first order BPS system in the $2D$ Gross-Pitaevskii equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel BPS bound for the Gross-Pitaevskii equations in two spatial dimensions is presented. The energy can be bound from below in terms of the combination of two boundary terms, one related to the vorticity (but ``dressed'' by the condensate profile) and the second to the ``skewness'' of the configurations. The bound is saturated by configurations which satisfy a system of two first-order PDE: when such BPS system is satisfied, the Gross-Pitaevskii equations are satisfied as well. The analytic solutions of this BPS system constructed in the present manuscript represent configurations with fractional vorticity living in an annulus. Using these techniques, we present the first analytic examples of this kind. The hydrodynamical interpretation of the BPS system is discussed. The implications of these results are outlined.</description>

      <title>Gravitational lensing and shadows in the toron solution of Einstein's equations using ray tracing methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a numerical and analytical study of the so-called `toron' solution of the stationary axisymmetric Einstein equations in vacuum expressed in terms of elliptic functions. The asymptotic behavior of this solution coincides with the one of the NUT solution, i.e., it has a `gravimagnetic' mass known as the NUT parameter while the ordinary mass vanishes. The physical properties of this spacetime are studied via ray tracing. The results are compared to known geodesic flows in Schwarzschild, Kerr and NUT spacetimes to discuss similarities and differences, with a particular emphasis on the comparison of NUT and toron spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Exact solutions and reductions of nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the first time, Schr\"odinger equations with cubic and more complex nonlinearities containing the unknown function with constant delay are analyzed. The physical considerations that can lead to the appearance of a delay in such nonlinear equations and mathematical models are expressed. One-dimensional non-symmetry reductions are described, which lead the studied partial differential equations with delay to simpler ordinary differential equations and ordinary differential equations with delay. New exact solutions of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation of the general form with delay, which are expressed in quadratures, are found. To construct exact solutions, a combination of methods of generalized separation of variables and the method of functional constraints are used. Special attention is paid to three equations with cubic nonlinearity, which allow simple solutions in elementary functions, as well as more complex exact solutions with generalized separation of variables. Solutions representing a nonlinear superposition of two traveling waves, the amplitude of which varies periodically in time and space, are constructed. Some more complex nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations of a general form with variable delay are also studied. The results of this work can be useful for the development and improvement of mathematical models described by nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with delay and related functional PDEs, and the obtained exact solutions can be used as test problems intended to assess the accuracy of numerical methods for integrating nonlinear equations of mathematical physics with delay.</description>

      <title>The massless S-matrix of integrable $\sigma$-models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03673v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In contradistinction to the case of massive excitations, the connection between integrability and the tree-level massless scattering matrix of integrable $\sigma$-models is lost. Namely, in well-known 2-d integrable models the tree-level massless S-matrix exhibits particle production and fails to factorise. This is conjectured to happen due to IR ambiguities in the massless tree-level amplitudes. We present a definition of the massless S-matrix which has all the nice properties of integrable theories, there is no particle production and the S-matrix factorises. As an example, we present in detail the case of the $SU(2)$ principal chiral model (PCM).</description>

      <title>Noise-induced synchronization in coupled quantum oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22495v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the quantum dynamics of a pair of coupled quantum oscillators coupled to a common correlated dissipative environment. The resulting equations of motion for both the operator moments and covariances can be integrated analytically using the Lyapunov equations. We find that for fully correlated and fully anti-correlated environments, the oscillators relax into a phase-synchronized state that persists for long times when the two oscillators are nearly resonant and (essentially) forever if the two oscillators are in resonance. This can be traced to the symmetry of the Lindblad dissipator, which can lead to strong damping in one region of state space and under damping in others. In the extreme cases of fully correlated or fully anti-correlated environments, specific regions of state space are fully decoupled from the environment. We also show that the environmental noise correlation leads to quantum entanglement, and all the correlations between the two oscillators are purely quantum mechanical in origin. This work provides a robust mathematical foundation for understanding how long-lived exciton coherences can be linked to vibronic correlation effects.</description>
