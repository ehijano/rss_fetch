      <title>Investigating synergies between chemical reaction networks (CRN) and mathematical epidemiology (ME), using the Mathematica package Epid-CRN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this essay, we investigate some relations between Chemical Reaction Networks (CRN) and Mathematical Epidemiology (ME) and report on several pleasant surprises which we had simply by putting these two topics together.
  Firstly, we propose a definition of ME models as a subset of CRN models.
  Secondly, we review a fundamental stability result for boundary points, known in ME as the NGM method since it replaces the investigation of the Jacobian by that of a matrix whose origins lie in probability (the theory of branching processes). This important result seems to be little known outside of ME; even in ME, it has not been made clear before that the method gets sometimes the right answer, even though the conditions of the NGM theorem are not all satisfied. Thus, beyond the theorem, there is a heuristic approach, the validity conditions for which are not sufficiently understood.
  Thirdly, we show that some simple CRN models with absolute concentration robustness (ACR), are close qualitatively to simple ME models, in the sense that they have an unique disease free equilibrium, and a unique interior fixed point, and the latter enters the positive domain and becomes stable precisely when $R_0:=s_{dfe} \mathcal{R}=\frac{s_{dfe}}{s_e}&gt;1.$
  (where $s$ denotes the "ACR species"). Thus, for these "ME type models", a "relay phenomena" takes place: precisely when the DFE loses stability, a new fixed point enters the domain, and takes over.
  Last but not least, we offer in the associated GitHub repository https://github.com/adhalanay/epidemiology_crns a Mathematica package, Epid-CRN, which is addressed to researchers of both disciplines, and provide illustrative notebooks, which in particular solve a few minor open ME and CRN problems. Our package may also be used to study easy cases of analogue continuous time Markov chain (CTMC) ME and CRN models.</description>

      <title>RatGene: Gene deletion-addition algorithms using growth to production ratio for growth-coupled production in constraint-based metabolic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In computational metabolic design, it is often necessary to modify the original constraint-based metabolic networks to lead to growth-coupled production, where cell growth forces target metabolite production. However, in genome-scale models, finding strategies to simultaneously delete and add genes to induce growth-coupled production is challenging. This is particularly true when heavy computation is necessary due to numerous gene deletions and additions. In this study, we mathematically defined related problems, proved NP-hardness and/or NP-completeness, and developed an algorithm named RatGene that (1) automatically integrates multiple constraint-based metabolic networks, (2) identifies gene deletion-addition strategies by a growth-to-production ratio-based approach, and (3) eliminates redundant gene additions and deletions. The results of computational experiments demonstrated that the RatGene-based approach can significantly improve the success ratio for identifying the strategies for growth-coupled production. RatGene can facilitate a more rational approach to computational metabolic design for the production of useful substances using microorganisms by concurrently considering both gene deletions and additions.</description>
