      <title>InstructDubber: Instruction-based Alignment for Zero-shot Movie Dubbing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Movie dubbing seeks to synthesize speech from a given script using a specific voice, while ensuring accurate lip synchronization and emotion-prosody alignment with the character's visual performance. However, existing alignment approaches based on visual features face two key limitations: (1)they rely on complex, handcrafted visual preprocessing pipelines, including facial landmark detection and feature extraction; and (2) they generalize poorly to unseen visual domains, often resulting in degraded alignment and dubbing quality. To address these issues, we propose InstructDubber, a novel instruction-based alignment dubbing method for both robust in-domain and zero-shot movie dubbing. Specifically, we first feed the video, script, and corresponding prompts into a multimodal large language model to generate natural language dubbing instructions regarding the speaking rate and emotion state depicted in the video, which is robust to visual domain variations. Second, we design an instructed duration distilling module to mine discriminative duration cues from speaking rate instructions to predict lip-aligned phoneme-level pronunciation duration. Third, for emotion-prosody alignment, we devise an instructed emotion calibrating module, which finetunes an LLM-based instruction analyzer using ground truth dubbing emotion as supervision and predicts prosody based on the calibrated emotion analysis. Finally, the predicted duration and prosody, together with the script, are fed into the audio decoder to generate video-aligned dubbing. Extensive experiments on three major benchmarks demonstrate that InstructDubber outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across both in-domain and zero-shot scenarios.</description>

      <title>Do Foundational Audio Encoders Understand Music Structure?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In music information retrieval (MIR) research, the use of pretrained foundational audio encoders (FAEs) has recently become a trend. FAEs pretrained on large amounts of music and audio data have been shown to improve performance on MIR tasks such as music tagging and automatic music transcription. However, their use for music structure analysis (MSA) remains underexplored. Although many open-source FAE models are available, only a small subset has been examined for MSA, and the impact of factors such as learning methods, training data, and model context length on MSA performance remains unclear. In this study, we conduct comprehensive experiments on 11 types of FAEs to investigate how these factors affect MSA performance. Our results demonstrate that FAEs using selfsupervised learning with masked language modeling on music data are particularly effective for MSA. These findings pave the way for future research in MSA.</description>

      <title>LibriVAD: A Scalable Open Dataset with Deep Learning Benchmarks for Voice Activity Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust Voice Activity Detection (VAD) remains a challenging task, especially under noisy, diverse, and unseen acoustic conditions. Beyond algorithmic development, a key limitation in advancing VAD research is the lack of large-scale, systematically controlled, and publicly available datasets. To address this, we introduce LibriVAD - a scalable open-source dataset derived from LibriSpeech and augmented with diverse real-world and synthetic noise sources. LibriVAD enables systematic control over speech-to-noise ratio, silence-to-speech ratio (SSR), and noise diversity, and is released in three sizes (15 GB, 150 GB, and 1.5 TB) with two variants (LibriVAD-NonConcat and LibriVAD-Concat) to support different experimental setups. We benchmark multiple feature-model combinations, including waveform, Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), and Gammatone filter bank cepstral coefficients, and introduce the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture for VAD. Our experiments show that ViT with MFCC features consistently outperforms established VAD models such as boosted deep neural network and convolutional long short-term memory deep neural network across seen, unseen, and out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions, including evaluation on the real-world VOiCES dataset. We further analyze the impact of dataset size and SSR on model generalization, experimentally showing that scaling up dataset size and balancing SSR noticeably and consistently enhance VAD performance under OOD conditions. All datasets, trained models, and code are publicly released to foster reproducibility and accelerate progress in VAD research.</description>

      <title>Robust TTS Training via Self-Purifying Flow Matching for the WildSpoof 2026 TTS Track</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a lightweight text-to-speech (TTS) system developed for the WildSpoof Challenge TTS Track. Our approach fine-tunes the recently released open-weight TTS model, \textit{Supertonic}\footnote{\url{https://github.com/supertone-inc/supertonic}}, with Self-Purifying Flow Matching (SPFM) to enable robust adaptation to in-the-wild speech. SPFM mitigates label noise by comparing conditional and unconditional flow matching losses on each sample, routing suspicious text--speech pairs to unconditional training while still leveraging their acoustic information. The resulting model achieves the lowest Word Error Rate (WER) among all participating teams, while ranking second in perceptual metrics such as UTMOS and DNSMOS. These findings demonstrate that efficient, open-weight architectures like Supertonic can be effectively adapted to diverse real-world speech conditions when combined with explicit noise-handling mechanisms such as SPFM.</description>

      <title>Training Text-to-Speech Model with Purely Synthetic Data: Feasibility, Sensitivity, and Generalization Capability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The potential of synthetic data in text-to-speech (TTS) model training has gained increasing attention, yet its rationality and effectiveness require systematic validation. In this study, we systematically investigate the feasibility of using purely synthetic data for TTS training and explore how various factors--including text richness, speaker diversity, noise levels, and speaking styles--affect model performance. Our experiments reveal that increasing speaker and text diversity significantly enhances synthesis quality and robustness. Cleaner training data with minimal noise further improves performance. Moreover, we find that standard speaking styles facilitate more effective model learning. Our experiments indicate that models trained on synthetic data have great potential to outperform those trained on real data under similar conditions, due to the absence of real-world imperfections and noise.</description>

      <title>When De-noising Hurts: A Systematic Study of Speech Enhancement Effects on Modern Medical ASR Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech enhancement methods are commonly believed to improve the performance of automatic speech recognition (ASR) in noisy environments. However, the effectiveness of these techniques cannot be taken for granted in the case of modern large-scale ASR models trained on diverse, noisy data. We present a systematic evaluation of MetricGAN-plus-voicebank denoising on four state-of-the-art ASR systems: OpenAI Whisper, NVIDIA Parakeet, Google Gemini Flash 2.0, Parrotlet-a using 500 medical speech recordings under nine noise conditions. ASR performance is measured using semantic WER (semWER), a normalized word error rate (WER) metric accounting for domain-specific normalizations. Our results reveal a counterintuitive finding: speech enhancement preprocessing degrades ASR performance across all noise conditions and models. Original noisy audio achieves lower semWER than enhanced audio in all 40 tested configurations (4 models x 10 conditions), with degradations ranging from 1.1% to 46.6% absolute semWER increase. These findings suggest that modern ASR models possess sufficient internal noise robustness and that traditional speech enhancement may remove acoustic features critical for ASR. For practitioners deploying medical scribe systems in noisy clinical environments, our results indicate that preprocessing audio with noise reduction techniques might not just be computationally wasteful but also be potentially harmful to the transcription accuracy.</description>

      <title>Speech-FT: Merging Pre-trained And Fine-Tuned Speech Representation Models For Cross-Task Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12672v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fine-tuning speech representation models can enhance performance on specific tasks but often compromises their cross-task generalization ability. This degradation is often caused by excessive changes in the representations, making it difficult to retain information learned during pre-training. Existing approaches, such as regularizing weight changes during fine-tuning, may fail to maintain sufficiently high feature similarity with the pre-trained model, and thus could possibly lose cross-task generalization. To address this issue, we propose Speech-FT, a novel two-stage fine-tuning framework designed to maintain cross-task generalization while benefiting from fine-tuning. Speech-FT first applies fine-tuning specifically designed to reduce representational drift, followed by weight-space interpolation with the pre-trained model to restore cross-task generalization. Extensive experiments on HuBERT, wav2vec 2.0, DeCoAR 2.0, and WavLM Base+ demonstrate that Speech-FT consistently improves performance across a wide range of supervised, unsupervised, and multitask fine-tuning scenarios. Moreover, Speech-FT achieves superior cross-task generalization compared to fine-tuning baselines that explicitly constrain weight changes, such as weight-space regularization and LoRA fine-tuning. Our analysis reveals that Speech-FT maintains higher feature similarity to the pre-trained model compared to alternative strategies, despite allowing larger weight-space updates. Notably, Speech-FT achieves significant improvements on the SUPERB benchmark. For example, when fine-tuning HuBERT on automatic speech recognition, Speech-FT is able to reduce phone error rate from 5.17% to 3.94%, lower word error rate from 6.38% to 5.75%, and increase speaker identification accuracy from 81.86% to 84.11%. Speech-FT provides a simple yet powerful solution for further refining speech representation models after pre-training.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot Recognition of Dysarthric Speech Using Commercial Automatic Speech Recognition and Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Voice-based human-machine interaction is a primary modality for accessing intelligent systems, yet individuals with dysarthria face systematic exclusion due to recognition performance gaps. Whilst automatic speech recognition (ASR) achieves word error rates (WER) below 5% on typical speech, performance degrades dramatically for dysarthric speakers. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offer potential for leveraging contextual reasoning to compensate for acoustic degradation, yet their zero-shot capabilities remain uncharacterised. This study evaluates eight commercial speech-to-text services on the TORGO dysarthric speech corpus: four conventional ASR systems (AssemblyAI, Whisper large-v3, Deepgram Nova-3, Nova-3 Medical) and four MLLM-based systems (GPT-4o, GPT-4o Mini, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Gemini 2.5 Flash). Evaluation encompasses lexical accuracy, semantic preservation, and cost-latency trade-offs. Results demonstrate severity-dependent degradation: mild dysarthria achieves 3-5% WER approaching typical-speech benchmarks, whilst severe dysarthria exceeds 49% WER across all systems. A verbatim-transcription prompt yields architecture-specific effects: GPT-4o achieves 7.36 percentage point WER reduction with consistent improvement across all tested speakers, whilst Gemini variants exhibit degradation. Semantic metrics indicate that communicative intent remains partially recoverable despite elevated lexical error rates. These findings establish empirical baselines enabling evidence-based technology selection for assistive voice interface deployment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) speakers are compact, scalable alternatives to traditional voice coil speakers, promising improved sound quality through precise semiconductor manufacturing. This review provides an overview of the research landscape, including ultrasound pulse-based and thermoacoustic sound generation, classifying MEMS speakers by actuation principle: electrodynamic, piezoelectric, and electrostatic. A comparative analysis of performance indicators from 1990-2025 highlights the dominance of piezoelectric MEMS with direct air displacement, focusing on miniaturization and efficiency. The review outlines upcoming research challenges and identifies potential candidates for achieving full-spectrum audio performance. A focus on innovative approaches could lead to wideband adoption of MEMS-only speakers.</description>

      <title>When Pamplona sounds different: the soundscape transformation of San Fermin through intelligent acoustic sensors and a sound repository</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a use-case of a network of low-cost acoustic smart sensors deployed in the city of Pamplona to analyse changes in the urban soundscape during the San Fermin Festival. The sensors were installed in different areas of the city before, during, and after the event, capturing continuous acoustic data. Our analysis reveals a significant transformation in the city's sonic environment during the festive period: overall sound pressure levels increase significantly, soundscape patterns change, and the acoustic landscape becomes dominated by sounds associated with human activity. These findings highlight the potential of distributed smart acoustic monitoring systems to characterize the temporal dynamics of urban soundscapes and underscore how the large-scale event of San Fermin drastically reshapes the overall acoustic dynamics of the city of Pamplona. Additionally, to complement the objective measurements, a curated collection of real San Fermin sound recordings has been created and made publicly available, preserving the festival's unique sonic heritage.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13969v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper I want to suggest a new solution to the problem of musical tuning. On one hand, I see it as a generalization of Just Intonation (JI) to inharmonic timbers, on another, as a unification of spectral interference and harmonicity contributions to consonance within a single framework. The main achievement of the work is the ability to mathematically quantify the phenomenon of musical consonance using set theory. That quantification is done by defining two measures of consonance: affinity and harmonicity. These measures naturally generate sets of intervals that can be used as dynamic tuning systems. The paper is aimed at a broad audience of people who may not be skilled in music and tuning theory or mathematics. Thus, I attempt to give as much details and explanations as I can, while keeping the number of pages as low as possible.</description>

      <title>Unified Acoustic Representations for Screening Neurological and Respiratory Pathologies from Voice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Voice-based health assessment offers unprecedented opportunities for scalable, non-invasive disease screening, yet existing approaches typically focus on single conditions and fail to leverage the rich, multi-faceted information embedded in speech. We present MARVEL (Multi-task Acoustic Representations for Voice-based Health Analysis), a privacy-conscious multitask learning framework that simultaneously detects nine distinct neurological, respiratory, and voice disorders using only derived acoustic features, eliminating the need for raw audio transmission. Our dual-branch architecture employs specialized encoders with task-specific heads sharing a common acoustic backbone, enabling effective cross-condition knowledge transfer. Evaluated on the large-scale Bridge2AI-Voice v2.0 dataset, MARVEL achieves an overall AUROC of 0.78, with exceptional performance on neurological disorders (AUROC = 0.89), particularly for Alzheimer's disease/mild cognitive impairment (AUROC = 0.97). Our framework consistently outperforms single-modal baselines by 5-19% and surpasses state-of-the-art self-supervised models on 7 of 9 tasks, while correlation analysis reveals that the learned representations exhibit meaningful similarities with established acoustic features, indicating that the model's internal representations are consistent with clinically recognized acoustic patterns. By demonstrating that a single unified model can effectively screen for diverse conditions, this work establishes a foundation for deployable voice-based diagnostics in resource-constrained and remote healthcare settings.</description>

      <title>Fun-ASR Technical Report</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12508v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, automatic speech recognition (ASR) has witnessed transformative advancements driven by three complementary paradigms: data scaling, model size scaling, and deep integration with large language models (LLMs). However, LLMs are prone to hallucination, which can significantly degrade user experience in real-world ASR applications. In this paper, we present Fun-ASR, a large-scale, LLM-based ASR system that synergistically combines massive data, large model capacity, LLM integration, and reinforcement learning to achieve state-of-the-art performance across diverse and complex speech recognition scenarios. Moreover, Fun-ASR is specifically optimized for practical deployment, with enhancements in streaming capability, noise robustness, code-switching, hotword customization, and satisfying other real-world application requirements. Experimental results show that while most LLM-based ASR systems achieve strong performance on open-source benchmarks, they often underperform on real industry evaluation sets. Thanks to production-oriented optimizations, Fun-ASR achieves state-of-the-art performance on real application datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness in practical settings. The code and models are accessible at https://github.com/FunAudioLLM/Fun-ASR .</description>
