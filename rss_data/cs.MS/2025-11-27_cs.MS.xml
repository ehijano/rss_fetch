      <title>Evaluation of complex-valued error-like functions by the exponentially-convergent trapezoidal rule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exponentially convergent trapezoidal rule is applied to a suitable integral representation of the Faddeeva function to derive a simple formula for its evaluation. I describe its properties, strategies for maximising its efficiency, and its coupling with other evaluation methods (asymptotic expansions and Maclaurin series). From knowledge of the values of the Faddeeva function, all other complex-valued error-like functions such as $\rm erf$ and $\rm erfc$ can be easily obtained. The resulting algorithm has been implemented in a publicly-available C/C++ library named $\texttt{erflike}$ in IEEE double precision arithmetic, and tested against more widespread valuation methods based on Taylor series and continued fractions, as provided by the widely used Faddeeva package. It is found that the algorithm presented here and its implementation achieve better accuracy and a more regular behaviour of the relative error over vast regions of the complex plane. In terms of speed of evaluation the $\texttt{erflike}$ library also outperforms the Faddeeva package for complex valued arguments, although not for real-valued ones.</description>

      <title>A derivative-free trust-region approach for Low Order-Value Optimization problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Low Order-Value Optimization (LOVO) problem involves minimizing the minimum among a finite number of function values within a feasible set. LOVO has several practical applications such as robust parameter estimation, protein alignment, portfolio optimization, among others. In this work, we are interested in the constrained nonlinear optimization LOVO problem of minimizing the minimum between a finite number of function values subject to a nonempty closed convex set where each function is a black-box and continuously differentiable, but the derivatives are not available. We develop the first derivative-free trust-region algorithm for constrained LOVO problems with convergence to weakly critical points. Under suitable conditions, we establish the global convergence of the algorithm and also its worst-case iteration complexity analysis. An initial open-source implementation using only linear interpolation models is developed. Extensive numerical experiments and comparison with existing alternatives show the properties and the efficiency of the proposed approach when solving LOVO problems.</description>
