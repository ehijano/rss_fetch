      <title>Time evolutions of information entropies in a one-dimensional Vlasov-Poisson system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A one-dimensional Vlasov-Poisson system is considered to elucidate how the information entropies of the probability distribution functions of the electron position and velocity variables evolve in the Landau damping process. Considering the initial condition given by the Maxwellian velocity distribution with the spatial density perturbation in the form of the cosine function of the position, we derive linear and quasilinear analytical solutions that accurately describe both early and late time behaviors of the distribution function and the electric field. The validity of these solutions is confirmed by comparison with numerical simulations based on contour dynamics. Using the quasilinear analytical solution, the time evolutions of the velocity distribution function and its kurtosis indicating deviation from the Gaussian distribution are evaluated with the accuracy of the squared perturbation amplitude. We also determine the time evolutions of the information entropies of the electron position and velocity variables and their mutual information. We further consider Coulomb collisions which relax the state in the late-time limit in the collision less process to the thermal equilibrium state. In this collisional relaxation process, the mutual information of the position and velocity variables decreases to zero while the total information entropy of the phase-space distribution function increases by the decrease in the mutual information and demonstrates the validity of Boltzmann's H-theorem.</description>

      <title>First demonstration of Super-X divertor exhaust control for transient heat load management in compact fusion reactors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear fusion could offer clean, abundant energy. However, managing the immense power exhausted from the core fusion plasma towards the divertor remains a major challenge. This is compounded in emerging compact reactor designs which promise more cost-effective pathways towards commercial fusion energy. Alternative divertor configurations (ADCs) are a potential solution to this challenge. In this work, we demonstrate exhaust control in ADCs for the first time, on MAST-U. We employ a novel diagnostic strategy for the neutral gas buffer which shields the target. Our work shows that ADCs tackle key risks and uncertainties in realising fusion energy: 1) an enlarged operating window which 2) improves exhaust control through the absorption of transients which can remove the neutral shield and damage the divertor, 3) isolation of each divertor from other reactor regions, enabling combined control. This showcases real-world benefits of alternative divertors for effective heat load management and control in reactors.</description>

      <title>A review on the Vortex and Coherent Structures in Dusty Plasma Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dusty plasma is an admixture of electrons, ions, and massive charged solid particles of sub-micron to micron-sized in the background of neutral gas. The dust grain medium exhibits fluid (liquid) as well as solid-like characteristics at different background plasma conditions. It supports various linear and non-linear dynamical structures because of the external perturbation and internal instabilities. The vortical or coherent structure in the dusty plasma medium is a kind of self-sustained dynamical structure that is formed either by instabilities or external forcing. In this review article, the author discusses the past theoretical, experimental, and computational investigations on vortical and coherent structures in unmagnetized as well as in magnetized dusty plasma. The possible mechanisms to form vortices in dust grain medium are discussed in detail. The studies on the evolution of vortices and their correlation with turbulence are also reviewed.</description>

      <title>Ion Reflection by a Rippled Perpendicular Shock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14736v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use multi-spacecraft Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) observations to investigate electric fields and ion reflection at a non-stationary collisionless perpendicular plasma shock. We identify sub-proton scale (5-10 electron inertial lengths) large-amplitude normal electric fields, balanced by the Hall term ($\mathbf{J} \times \mathbf{B}/ne$), as a transient feature of the shock ramp related to non-stationarity (rippling). The associated electrostatic potential, comparable to the energy of the incident solar wind protons, decelerates incident ions and reflects a significant fraction of protons, resulting in more efficient shock-drift acceleration than a stationary planar shock.</description>
