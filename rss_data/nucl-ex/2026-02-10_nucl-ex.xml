      <title>Photonuclear Production of $^{195m}$Pt for Medical Applications: Cross Sections and Energy Thresholds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Platinum radioisotopes are of growing interest for targeted cancer therapy and diagnostic imaging because their decay delivers highly localized radiation doses in tissue, herewith enabling precise DNA damage through Auger-electron emission. Developing production technologies that provide platinum isotopes with high specific activity is therefore essential, and photonuclear reactions on stable nuclei offer a viable accelerator-based route when supported by reliable cross-section data. We report photonuclear cross-section measurements for the $^{197}$Au($\gamma$,pn)$^{195m}$Pt reaction at incident $\gamma$-ray energies of 27, 29, and 31~MeV using the activation method. The measurements were performed by irradiating a stack of concentric-ring gold targets with a quasi-monoenergetic $\gamma$-ray beam provided by the High Intensity Gamma-ray Source (HI$\gamma$S). The induced $^{195m}$Pt activity was quantified using off-line $\gamma$-ray spectroscopy. The present results provide the first experimental information in the energy region where the $^{197}$Au($\gamma$,pn)$^{195m}$Pt reaction becomes significant and demonstrate the minimum energy requirements and feasibility of producing $^{195m}$Pt via photonuclear reactions using electron accelerator facilities. These measurements indicate that electron energies of $\ge$ 50 MeV are required to achieve practically meaningful production yields.</description>

      <title>Search for the QCD Critical Point in High Energy Nuclear Collisions: A Status Report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review recent results of net-proton multiplicity fluctuations from STAR experiment, aiming to locate the QCD critical point in high-energy nuclear collisions at RHIC. We show net-proton number cumulant and proton number factorial cumulant ratios up to fourth order using experimental data from RHIC BES-II Au+Au collisions in collider mode and fixed-target mode. The comparison is made between experimental data and non-critical model calculations from Lattice QCD, HRG, hydrodynamic simulations and transport model UrQMD. In addition, we discuss initial volume fluctuation effect, which plays significant role in fixed-target energies. Finally, an outlook on experimental research on the QCD critical point in future experiments will be presented.</description>

      <title>First Extraction of the Matter Radius of $^{132}$Sn via Proton Elastic Scattering at 200 MeV/Nucleon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The angular distribution of the differential cross sections for proton elastic scattering from $^{132}$Sn at 196-210 MeV/nucleon was successfully measured over a momentum transfer range of 0.80 to 2.1 fm$^{-1}$. Using a relativistic impulse approximation, the root-mean-square matter radius of $^{132}$Sn was extracted to be $4.758^{+0.023}_{-0.024}$ fm, which was compared with the state-of-the-art ab initio calculations. Combined with the charge radius measured at ISOLDE, there are no theoretical calculations consistent with both matter and charge radii within the experimental errors.</description>

      <title>Correlations of Feed-down Hadrons in a Thermal Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the potential impact of strong decays on the magnitude of fluctuations of net quantum numbers and integrals of balance functions based on a thermal hadron gas model. The calculations are based on a comprehensive list of known hadrons with masses up to 2.5 GeV/$c^2$ and include all decays of these hadrons with known branching fractions. The calculations are performed at vanishing baryo-chemical potential for temperatures between 140 and 200 MeV. We show that the decays feed-down substantially impact the single yield of measurable ``stable particles" as well as those of correlated densities of these species. Decays can then potentially have large and non-trivial impacts on measurements of net quantum number cumulants and balance functions. These observations are particularly important in the context of the search for the QCD critical point at the RHIC Beam Energy Scan as well as efforts to determine chemical susceptibilities near the phase transition at RHIC or LHC energies. Results obtained in this work also shed light on the importance of feed-down in measurements of balance functions in elementary p-p and nucleus-nucleus collisions.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Table of Calculated Huff Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic calculation of the Huff factor for nuclei with atomic numbers ($ Z $) in the range of $ 6 \leq Z \leq 94 $. The Huff factor quantifies the increase in the partial lifetime of the decay-in-orbit (DIO) of the muonic atom and serves as an essential correction factor for extracting the nuclear muon capture rate from the measured lifetimes of the muonic atom. However, previous calculations typically provided only the atomic number dependence and neglected isotope dependence -- an assumption whose reliability had not been examined, despite its importance for a comprehensive understanding of the nuclear muon capture rate. In this work, we calculate the Huff factor using nuclear charge distributions obtained from a fully self-consistent microscopic nuclear structure model that incorporates pairing and deformation effects. The resulting Huff factors exhibit a monotonic decrease with increasing $ Z $, while the isotope dependence is found to be small. Our results also show good agreement with previous calculations, supporting the reliability of the present framework. The comprehensive set of Huff factors presented here constitutes the first unified values currently available and will serve as a basis for future evaluations of muon nuclear data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.07682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study an exotic type of single spin asymmetry in unpolarized electron-proton scattering, in which the outgoing electron momentum exhibits a left-right asymmetry relative to the transverse spin of the leading baryon $B$ in the target fragmentation region. We lay out two theoretical frameworks for describing this effect: The twist-three fracture function at high-$Q^2$ and the spin-dependent odderon in the high energy limit.</description>

      <title>Probing $\alpha$ clustering in $^{12}\mathrm{C}$ at CSR energies using the Jet AA Microscopic Transport Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the sensitivity of low-energy nuclear collisions to intrinsic nuclear structure by studying the interplay between initial-state geometry and final-state observables in C+C and C+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.36$~GeV, relevant for experiments at the Cooling Storage Ring (CSR) facility in Lanzhou and forthcoming experiments at the High Intensity heavy-ion Accelerator Facility (HIAF) in Huizhou. Calculations are performed within the Jet AA Microscopic Transport Model (JAM) using Woods--Saxon and triangular $\alpha$-clustered configurations for the $^{12}C$ nucleus. The initial geometry is characterized in terms of transverse size, compactness, eccentricities, and their event-by-event fluctuations. We find that $\alpha$ clustering leads to a more compact participant configuration than the Woods--Saxon case, while transverse-size and eccentricity fluctuations show only weak sensitivity to clustering. At this beam energy, radial observables remain sensitive to geometric compactness, with the proton mean transverse momentum $\langle p_T \rangle$ enhanced for $\alpha$-clustered configurations, whereas pions show little sensitivity. The anisotropic response is examined using flow harmonic coefficients. We find an enhancement of the mean flow magnitudes, $\langle v_n \rangle = \sqrt{\langle v_n^2\rangle}$, for $\alpha$-clustered configurations at large $N_{part}$, while the event-by-event fluctuation strength of individual harmonics remains small. Symmetric cumulants of the initial-state eccentricities show sensitivity to clustering, whereas the corresponding correlations among final-state flow harmonics do not exhibit a comparably strong separation. These results indicate that radial observables and correlation-based flow measurements provide complementary probes of $\alpha$ clustering in low-energy nuclear collisions.</description>

      <title>Measuring spin correlation between quarks during QCD confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05499v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The vacuum is now understood to possess a rich and complex structure, characterized by fluctuating energy fields and a condensate of virtual quark-antiquark pairs. The spontaneous breaking of the approximate chiral symmetry, signaled by the nonvanishing quark condensate $\langle q\bar{q}\rangle$, is dynamically generated through topologically nontrivial gauge configurations such as instantons. The precise mechanism linking the chiral symmetry breaking to the mass generation associated with quark confinement remains a profound open question in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) - the fundamental theory of strong interaction. High energy proton-proton collisions could liberate virtual quark-antiquark pairs from the vacuum that subsequently undergo confinement to form hadrons, whose properties could serve as probes into QCD confinement and the quark condensate. Here, we report evidence of spin correlations in $\Lambda\bar{\Lambda}$ hyperon pairs inherited from spin-correlated strange quark-antiquark virtual pairs. Measurements by the STAR experiment at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory reveal a relative polarization signal of $(18 \pm 4)\%$ that links the virtual spin-correlated quark pairs from the QCD vacuum to their final-state hadron counterparts. Crucially, this correlation vanishes when the hyperon pairs are widely separated in angle, consistent with the decoherence of the quantum system. Our findings provide a new experimental paradigm for exploring the dynamics and interplay of quark confinement and entanglement.</description>

      <title>Elliptic flow of charged hadrons in d+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} =$ 200 GeV using a multi-phase transport model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22721v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive analysis of the elliptic flow coefficient, $v_2$, for charged hadrons at mid-rapidity in d+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}} = 200\mathrm{~GeV}$. Utilizing the AMPT model in both default and string melting modes, we examine the dependence of $v_2$ on transverse momentum, collision centrality, and particle type. Furthermore, we present $v_2$ scaled by participant eccentricity, which indicates a similar level of collectivity across different centrality intervals in d+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}} = 200\mathrm{~GeV}$ within the AMPT-SM model. Our results indicate that the early-stage partonic phase significantly influences $v_2$, as observed by variations in parton scattering cross-section, while the later stage hadronic rescattering shows minimal impact. Comparisons with STAR and PHENIX experimental data show that the AMPT model effectively captures the transverse momentum dependence of $v_2$, underlining the importance of parton scattering mechanisms and the need for careful interpretation of experimental results in asymmetric systems.</description>

      <title>Search for Invisible Decay Modes in Nuclear Gamma Cascades of a ${}^{46}$Sc Source Using a CsI (Tl) Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23001v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark matter remains one of the most compelling open questions in modern physics, motivating extensive searches for new light, weakly coupled particles beyond the Standard Model. Numerous experiments have probed a variety of dark matter candidates using diverse detector technologies, yet large regions of parameter space remain unexplored. In this work, we present a novel high-statistics search for invisible decay modes in nuclear $\gamma$ cascades, employing approximately 100~kg of CsI(Tl) scintillators at Texas A\&amp;M University. The key feature of this experiment is the use of a high-activity ${}^{46}$Sc radioactive source combined with a "missing gamma" technique, in which the absence of a photon in a well-identified cascade serves as a signature of new physics. Unlike appearance--disappearance experiments, this approach requires only a single photon conversion into a dark-sector particle, thereby enabling sensitivity to weaker couplings. With approximately 1000~hours of data collected using the current setup, no statistically significant excess was observed, consistent with existing constraints on dark-sector candidates such as axions and axion-like particles (ALPs), dark scalars, and dark photons in the sub-MeV mass range. This result highlights the sensitivity of the missing-gamma technique and motivates the development of a larger-scale detector with improved systematic control to extend dark-sector searches into previously unexplored regions of parameter space.</description>
