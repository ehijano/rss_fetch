      <title>Classical and quantum light-induced non-adiabaticity in molecular systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exchange of energy between electronic and nuclear motion is the origin of non-adiabaticity and plays an important role in many molecular phenomena and processes. Conical intersections (CIs) of different electronic potential energy surfaces lead to the most singular non-adiabaticity and have been intensely investigated. The coupling of light and matter induces conical intersections which are termed light-induced conical intersections (LICIs). There are two kinds of LICIs, those induced by classical (laser) light and those by quantum light like that provided by a cavity. The present work reviews the subject of LICIs, discussing the achievements made so far. Particular attention is paid to comparing classical and quantum LICIs, their similarities and differences and their relationship to naturally occurring CIs. In contrast to natural CIs, the properties of which are dictated by nature, the properties of their light-induced counterparts are controllable by choosing the frequency and intensity (or coupling to the cavity) of the external light source. This opens the door to inducing and manipulating various kinds of non-adiabatic effects. Several examples of diatomic and polyatomic molecules are presented covering both dynamics and spectroscopy. The computational methods employed are discussed as well. To our opinion, the young field of LICIs and their impact shows much future potential.</description>

      <title>Low-cost and Convenient Fabrication of Polymer Micro/Nanopores with the Needle Punching Process and Their Applications in Nanofluidic Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid-state micro/nanopores play an important role in the sensing field because of their high stability and controllable size. Aiming at problems of complex processes and high costs in pore manufacturing, we propose a convenient and low-cost micro/nanopore fabrication technique based on the needle punching method. The thin film is pierced by controlling the feed of a microscale tungsten needle, and the size variations of the micropore are monitored by the current feedback system. Based on the positive correlation between the micropore size and the current threshold, the size-controllable preparation of micropores is achieved. The preparation of nanopores is realized by the combination of needle punching and chemical etching. Firstly, a conical defect is prepared on the film with the tungsten needle. Then, nanopores are obtained by unilateral chemical etching of the film. Using the prepared conical micropores resistive-pulse detection of nanoparticles is performed. Significant ionic current rectification is also obtained with our conical nanopores. It is proved that the properties of micro/nanopores prepared by our method are comparable to those prepared by the track-etching method. The simple and controllable fabrication process proposed here will advance the development of low-cost micro/nanopore sensors.</description>

      <title>General-order open-shell coupled-cluster method with partial spin adaptation I: formulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A general-order open-shell coupled-cluster method based on spatial orbitals is formulated. The method is an extension of the partial-spin adaptation (PSA) scheme from Janssen and Schaefer (Theor. Chim. Acta, 79, 1-42, 1991). By increasing the order of excitation operator and spin adaptation, the full configuration interaction (CI) limit is expected to be achieved. In the meanwhile, the advantages of spin-free approach in closed-shell systems: fourth-order truncation of the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion and only $HT$-type connected terms are conserved.</description>

      <title>GradNav: Accelerated Exploration of Potential Energy Surfaces with Gradient-Based Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exploration of molecular systems' potential energy surface is important for comprehending their complex behaviors, particularly through identifying various metastable states. However, the transition between these states is often hindered by substantial energy barriers, demanding prolonged molecular simulations that consume considerable computational efforts. Our study introduces the GradNav algorithm, which enhances the exploration of the energy surface, accelerating the reconstruction of the potential energy surface (PES). This algorithm employs a strategy of initiating short simulation runs from updated starting points, derived from prior observations, to effectively navigate across potential barriers and explore new regions. To evaluate GradNav's performance, we introduce two metrics: the deepest well escape frame (DWEF) and the search success initialization ratio (SSIR). Through applications on Langevin dynamics within Mueller-type potential energy surfaces and molecular dynamics simulations of the Fs-Peptide protein, these metrics demonstrate GradNav's enhanced ability to escape deep energy wells, as shown by reduced DWEF values, and its reduced reliance on initial conditions, highlighted by increased SSIR values. Consequently, this improved exploration capability enables more precise energy estimations from simulation trajectories.</description>

      <title>Adapting OC20-trained EquiformerV2 Models for High-Entropy Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computational high-throughput studies, especially in research on high-entropy materials and catalysts, are hampered by high-dimensional composition spaces and myriad structural microstates. They present bottlenecks to the conventional use of density functional theory calculations, and consequently, the use of machine-learned potentials is becoming increasingly prevalent in atomic structure simulations. In this communication, we show the results of adjusting and fine-tuning the pretrained EquiformerV2 model from the Open Catalyst Project to infer adsorption energies of *OH and *O on the out-of-domain high-entropy alloy Ag-Ir-Pd-Pt-Ru. By applying an energy filter based on the local environment of the binding site the zero-shot inference is markedly improved and through few-shot fine-tuning the model yields state-of-the-art accuracy. It is also found that EquiformerV2, assuming the role of general machine learning potential, is able to inform a smaller, more focused direct inference model. This knowledge distillation setup boosts performance on complex binding sites. Collectively, this shows that foundational knowledge learned from ordered intermetallic structures, can be extrapolated to the highly disordered structures of solid-solutions. With the vastly accelerated computational throughput of these models, hitherto infeasible research in the high-entropy material space is now readily accessible.</description>

      <title>Versatile Capillary Cells for Handling Concentrated Samples in Analytical Ultracentrifugation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In concentrated macromolecular dispersions, far-from-ideal intermolecular interactions determine the dispersion behaviors including phase transition, crystallization, and liquid-liquid phase separation. Here, we present a novel versatile capillary-cell design for analytical ultracentrifugation-sedimentation equilibrium (AUC-SE), ideal for studying samples at high concentrations. Current setups for such studies are difficult and unreliable to handle, leading to a low experimental success rate. The design presented here is easy to use, robust, and reusable for samples in both aqueous and organic solvents while requiring no special tools or chemical modification of AUC cells. The key and unique feature is the fabrication of liquid reservoirs directly on the bottom window of AUC cells, which can be easily realized by laser ablation or mechanical drilling. The channel length and optical path length are therefore tunable. The success rate for assembling this new cell is close to 100%. We demonstrate the practicality of this cell by studying: 1) the equation of state and second virial coefficients of concentrated gold nanoparticle dispersions in water and bovine serum albumin (BSA) as well as lysozyme solution in aqueous buffers, 2) the gelation phase transition of DNA and BSA solutions, and 3) liquid-liquid phase separation of concentrated BSA/polyethylene glycol (PEG) droplets.</description>

Abstract: Intermolecular hydrogen transfer free radical reactions are common in the combustion process and in a number of organic chemistry reactions. Therefore, evaluating the pressure and temperature-dependent rate constants of them is of great importance. Here, we present a tutorial on how a student could construct a Master Equation model to evaluate the rate constants of reversible hydrogen transfer reactions that involve source and depletion. The teacher could also use this paper to design an upper undergraduate or graduate course in teaching Master Equation based models and RRKM theory.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Hydrogen Evolution Catalysis of Pentlandite due to the Increases in Coordination Number and Sulfur Vacancy during Cubic-Hexagonal Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.13348v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The search for new phases is an important direction in materials science. The phase transition of sulfides results in significant changes in catalytic performance, such as MoS2 and WS2. Cubic pentlandite [cPn, (Fe, Ni)9S8] can be a functional material in batteries, solar cells, and catalytic fields. However, no report about the material properties of other phases of pentlandite exists. In this study, the unit-cell parameters of a new phase of pentlandite, sulfur-vacancy enriched hexagonal pentlandite (hPn), and the phase boundary between cPn and hPn were determined for the first time. Compared to cPn, the hPn shows a high coordination number, more sulfur vacancies, and high conductivity, which result in significantly higher hydrogen evolution performance of hPn than that of cPn and make the non-nano rock catalyst hPn superior to other most known nanosulfide catalysts. The increase of sulfur vacancies during phase transition provides a new approach to designing functional materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01526v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We modify the reweighting factor of the projector used in diffusion Monte Carlo to reduce the time-step error of the total energy. Further, we present a reweighting scheme that has the desirable feature that it is exactly size-consistent, i.e, the energy of a system containing widely separated fragments is the same as the sum of the energies of the individual fragments. The practical utility of the latter improvement is that it reduces the time-step error of the binding energies of some weakly interacting systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.08006v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Water dimer $(\text{H}_2\text{O})_2$ -- a vital component of the earth's atmosphere -- is an important prototypical hydrogen-bonded system. It provides direct insight into fundamental chemical and biochemical processes, e.g., proton transfer and ionic supramolecular dynamics occurring in astro- and atmospheric chemistry. Exploiting a purified molecular beam of water dimer and multi-mass ion imaging, we report the simultaneous detection of all generated ion products of $(\text{H}_2\text{O})^{+}_2$-fragmentation following single ionization. Detailed information about ion yields and reaction energetics of 13 ion-radical pathways, 6 of which are new, of $(\text{H}_2\text{O})^{+}_2$ are presented, including strong ${}^{18}\text{O}$-isotope effects.</description>

      <title>Noise-independent Route towards the Genesis of a COMPACT Ansatz for Molecular Energetics: a Dynamic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09895v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in quantum information and quantum science have inspired the development of various compact dynamic structured ans\"{a}tze that are expected to be realizable in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. However, such ans\"{a}tze construction strategies hitherto developed involve considerable measurements, and thus they deviate significantly in NISQ platform from their ideal structures. Therefore, it is imperative that the usage of quantum resources must be minimized while retaining the expressivity and dynamical structure of the ansatz that can adapt itself depending on the degree of correlation. We propose a novel ansatz construction strategy based on the \textit{ab-initio} many-body perturbation theory that requires \textit{no} pre-circuit measurement and thus it remains structurally unaffected by any hardware noise. The accuracy and quantum complexity associated with the ansatz are solely dictated by a pre-defined perturbative order as desired and hence are tunable. Furthermore, the underlying perturbative structure of the ansatz construction pipeline enables us to decompose any high-rank excitation that appears in higher perturbative orders into the product of various low-rank operators, and it thus keeps the execution gate-depth to its minimum. With a number of challenging applications on strongly correlated systems, we demonstrate that our ansatz performs significantly better, both in terms of accuracy, parameter count and circuit depth, in comparison to the allied unitary coupled cluster based ans\"{a}tze.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed generative model for drug-like molecule conformers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07925v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a diffusion-based, generative model for conformer generation. Our model is focused on the reproduction of bonded structure and is constructed from the associated terms traditionally found in classical force fields to ensure a physically relevant representation. Techniques in deep learning are used to infer atom typing and geometric parameters from a training set. Conformer sampling is achieved by taking advantage of recent advancements in diffusion-based generation. By training on large, synthetic data sets of diverse, drug-like molecules optimized with the semiempirical GFN2-xTB method, high accuracy is achieved for bonded parameters, exceeding that of conventional, knowledge-based methods. Results are also compared to experimental structures from the Protein Databank (PDB) and Cambridge Structural Database (CSD).</description>
