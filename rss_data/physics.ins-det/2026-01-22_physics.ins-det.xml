      <title>High-Resolution Electron Paramagnetic Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) is a valuable tool for physics, chemistry, biology and medicine, providing complementary spectroscopic information to NMR. It has long been known that EPR at high magnetic fields offers greater spectral resolution, but limitations in the THz instrumentation have prevented the full realization of these opportunities. Here we describe an EPR spectrometer at the high magnetic field of 14 T using 396 GHz excitation, which adapts techniques from liquid-state NMR to obtain sharp EPR resonances with a width of 210 ppb (full-width half-maximum). We use this to measure resonance positions, and hence g-factors, with a precision that reaches $\pm$16 ppb. Our use of in-situ liquid-state NMR of our solvent within the same sample improves the accuracy of these measurements: it allows us to reference our EPR measurement back to dilute gas 3He NMR for which quantum calculations are accurate. We measure the g-factor of N@C60 in deuterated toluene as g = 2.002 099 09 (3), where the 3 in brackets means that the uncertainty on the last digit is $\pm$3.</description>

      <title>A SiPM-Based RICH Detector with Timing Capabilities for Isotope Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a novel compact particle identification (PID) detector concept based on Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs) optimized to perform combined Ring-Imaging Cherenkov (RICH) and Time-of-Flight (TOF) measurements using a common photodetector layer. The system consists of a Cherenkov radiator layer separated from a photosensitive surface equipped with SiPMs by an expansion gap. A thin glass slab, acting as a second Cherenkov radiator, is coupled to the SiPMs to perform Cherenkov-based charged particle timing measurements. We assembled a small-scale prototype instrumented with various Hamamatsu SiPM array sensors with pixel pitches ranging from 2 to 3 mm and coupled with 1 mm thick fused silica window. The RICH radiator consisted of a 2 cm thick aerogel tile with a refractive index of 1.03 at 400 nm. The prototype was successfully tested in beam test campaigns at the CERN PS T10 beam line with pions and protons. We measured a single-hit angular resolution of about 4 mrad at the Cherenkov angle saturation value and a time resolution better than 50 ps RMS for charged particles with Z = 1. The present technology makes the proposed SiPM-based PID system particularly attractive for space applications due to the limited detector volumes available. In this work, we present beam test results obtained with the detector prototype and we discuss possible configurations optimized for the identification of ions in space applications.</description>

      <title>Efficient and precise Cherenkov-based charged particle timing using SiPMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dedicated R&amp;D efforts are currently underway to couple a thin Cherenkov radiator to Silicon Photomultiplier (SiPM) arrays for precise charged particle Time-of-Flight (ToF) measurements. The prompt nature of Cherenkov radiation makes it an ideal candidate for achieving ultimate timing performance in a ToF detector. Using a thin radiator with a high refractive index, such as fused silica, enables the generation of a fast signal from charged particles that exceed the Cherenkov threshold. A crucial requirement for approaching the target time resolution is the optimization of both the radiator material and thickness, as well as the optical coupling to the SiPM arrays. In this work, we present the main factors that affect the time resolution and the expected performance achieved through a detailed Monte Carlo simulation and the comparison with beam test results.</description>

      <title>Introducing Timepix2-Lite: A Miniaturized Readout Interface Enabling Nanosecond-Scale Half-Life Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents Timepix2 Lite, a compact readout interface for the Timepix2 hybrid pixel detector, designed to provide high spatial and temporal resolution in a wide range of radiation detection applications. The Timepix2 Lite enables simultaneous energy and precise timing measurements on the nanosecond scale and supports advanced real-time data acquisition and visualization through the TrackLab software framework. Its compact and flexible architecture, enabled by the miniaturized design, allows seamless integration into diverse experimental setups, including nuclear spectroscopy, stratospheric balloon missions, and nanosecond-scale half-life measurements. As a case study, the half-life of the second excited state in 237Np was determined to be 67.5(7) ns for the 59.5 keV transition, consistent with previously reported results.</description>

      <title>Ring oscillator performance of the ATLAS inner tracker pixel readout chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents experimental and simulation data to characterize the Ring Oscillators (RO) produced in 65-nm CMOS technology for the next promising generation of readout chips for the pixel detector in the Inner Tracker (ITk) at the ATLAS experiment at CERN. To enable a better understanding of the RO block embedded in ITkPixV1.1 single chip card (SCC), tests at various temperatures, voltages, accumulated total ionizing dose (TID) with X-ray irradiation, and high-temperature annealing will be presented. The objective of this study is to examine the RO output dependency based on different variable conditions and provide simulation data using Cadence, an electronic design automation (EDA) software to validate the experimental outcomes.</description>

      <title>Lumped-Element Model of THz HEB Mixer Based on Sputtered MgB2 Thin Film</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis and experimental study of THz hot-electron bolometer (HEB) mixers made from 40-nm-thick sputtered magnesium diboride (MgB2) thin films on high-resistivity silicon substrates. Using a lumped-element bolometric model, we achieve strong quantitative agreement with measurements of conversion gain, noise temperature, and local-oscillator (LO) coupling to the HEB devices. Our analysis shows that the sensitivity of current HEB devices is primarily limited by on-chip optical losses, with both Johnson and thermal-fluctuation noise contributing significantly to the overall noise temperature. Simulations of an optimized device with near-ideal optical coupling suggest that Johnson noise remains a substantial factor even with improved coupling. Further reduction of the noise temperature may require additional suppression of Johnson noise (via improved intrinsic conversion gain) beyond optimizing optical coupling efficiency. We emphasize the importance of accurate modeling to achieve good numerical agreement with experiments, thereby enabling understanding of the causes of sensitivity loss.</description>

      <title>The development of a high granular crystal calorimeter prototype of VLAST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24851v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Very Large Area gamma-ray Space Telescope (VLAST) is the next-generation flagship space observatory for high-energy gamma-ray detection proposed by China. The observation energy range covers from MeV to TeV and beyond, with acceptance of 10 m^2sr. The calorimeter serves as a crucial subdetector of VLAST, responsible for high-precision energy measurement and electron/proton discrimination. This discrimination capability is essential for accurately identifying gamma-ray events among the background of charged particles. To accommodate such an extensive energy range, a high dynamic range readout scheme employing dual avalanche photodiodes (APDs) has been developed, achieving a remarkable dynamic range of 10^6. Furthermore, a high granular prototype based on bismuth germanate (BGO) cubic scintillation crystals has been developed. This high granularity enables detailed imaging of the particle showers, improving both energy resolution and particle identification. The prototype's performance is evaluated through cosmic ray testing, providing valuable data for optimizing the final calorimeter design for VLAST.</description>

      <title>Phase projection errors in rf-driven optically pumped magnetometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20446v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the phase relationship between the oscillating (rf) excitation field and the detected (light) power modulation in scalar rf-driven optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs), in particular in the $M_x$ configuration. While the static dependence of the demodulation phase on the direction of the external static magnetic field vector can be largely mitigated by aligning the oscillating rf field along the light propagation direction, we demonstrate that a dynamic (transient) phase response arises under magnetic field tilts. We analytically solve the corresponding modified Bloch equation and confirm agreement with experimental observations obtained using an $M_x$ magnetometer incorporating a paraffin-coated Cs vapor cell. The results reveal fundamental limitations of $M_x$ magnetometers regarding response time and accuracy, in particular when employed with active electronic feedback, such as a phase-locked loop. Therefore, this work is highly relevant to important magnetometry applications where the direction of the quasi-static magnetic field of interest is unknown \textit{a priori} or varies over time, or in measurements requiring a large detection bandwidth. Such conditions are encountered in applications such as geomagnetic surveying, particularly with mobile platforms.</description>

      <title>The use of spectral indices in environmental monitoring of smouldering coal-waste dumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11603v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study aimed to evaluate the applicability of environmental indices in the monitoring of smouldering coal-waste dumps. A dump located in the Upper Silesian Coal Basin served as the research site for a multi-method analysis combining remote sensing and field-based data. Two UAV survey campaigns were conducted, capturing RGB, infrared, and multispectral imagery. These were supplemented with direct ground measurements of subsurface temperature and detailed vegetation mapping. Additionally, publicly available satellite data from the Landsat and Sentinel missions were analysed. A range of vegetation and fire-related indices (NDVI, SAVI, EVI, BAI, among others) were calculated to identify thermally active zones and assess vegetation conditions within these degraded areas. The results revealed strong seasonal variability in vegetation indices on thermally active sites, with evidence of disrupted vegetation cycles, including winter greening in moderately heated root zones - a pattern indicative of stress and degradation processes. While satellite data proved useful in reconstructing the fire history of the dump, their spatial resolution was insufficient for detailed monitoring of small-scale thermal anomalies. The study highlights the diagnostic potential of UAV-based remote sensing in post-industrial environments undergoing land degradation but emphasises the importance of field validation for accurate environmental assessment.</description>
