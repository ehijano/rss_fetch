      <title>Excitonic correlations in the system of gated metallic wires with the applied Zeeman magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have studied the electron-electron interactions in the system composed of two metallic wires, placed in the external magnetic and electric fields. The interactions between the electrons in the wires have been taken into account within the usual Hubbard model. We have considered both half-filling and partial-filling limits for the occupation of the atomic lattice sites. We show the existence of the excitonic pairing in this low-dimensional system and calculate the excitonic order parameter in different electron-electron interaction regime, magnetic field and temperature. We demonstrate that the usual Hubbard-$U$ interaction leads to strong electron localization which enhance the local antiferromagnetic order in the system.</description>

      <title>Canted antiferromagnetism and excitonic order in gated double-layer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effects of the electron-electron interactions on the excitonic properties and charge-density modulations in the AB stacked double-layer (DL) graphene, placed in the external gate-potential $V$. The coexistence of the canted antiferromagnetic order and excitonic pairing gap has been studied with the help of the generalized Hubbard model. We calculate the chemical potential $\mu$, the average charge density difference between the layers $\delta{\bar{n}}$, the antiferromagnetic gap-function $\Delta_{\rm AFM}$ and the excitonic order parameters $\Delta_{\sigma}$ in the zero temperature limit. We found that the excitonic pairing order parameter has a larger energy scale than the canted antiferromagnetic gap-function. The charge neutrality, in the DL graphene system, occurs only in the absence of the external gate-potential $V$. Moreover, we have shown that the values of the antiferromagnetic gap-function $\Delta_{\rm AFM}$ and excitonic order parameter $\Delta_{\sigma}$ are always increasing at the large values of inter-layer Coulomb interaction, while they are decreasing for large values of the applied gate-potential $V$.</description>

      <title>Temperley-Lieb integrable models and fusion categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that every fusion category containing a non-invertible, self-dual object $a$ gives rise to an integrable anyonic chain whose Hamiltonian density satisfies the Temperley-Lieb algebra. This spin chain arises by considering the projection onto the identity channel in the fusion process $a\otimes a$. We relate these models to Pasquier's construction of ADE lattice models. We then exploit the underlying Temperley-Lieb structure to discuss the spectrum of these models and argue that these models are gapped when the quantum dimension of $a$ is greater than 2. We show that for fusion categories where the dimension is close to 2, such as the Fib$\times$Fib and Haagerup fusion categories, the finite size effects are large and they can obscure the numerical analysis of the gap.</description>

      <title>Quantum Hall to Chiral Spin Liquid transition in a Triangular Lattice Hofstadter-Hubbard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the weak interaction integer quantum Hall (IQH) phase, the intermediate interaction phase identified as a chiral spin liquid (CSL) and the transition between them in the triangular lattice Hofstadter-Hubbard model at a density of one electron per site in an orbital magnetic field corresponding to one-quarter flux per plaquette. Our primary tool is the finite system density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method with both interaction-strength scan and fixed interaction techniques for cylinders of circumference 3, 5, and 7 and lengths up to 240. For the IQH phase, we use single particle exact diagonalization to clarify finite size effects, including an excess charge on the edges of our cylinders, and the limitations of entanglement spectra degeneracies on small circumference cylinders. For both phases, we use DMRG to study the entanglement spectra, the entanglement entropy, and the effect of flux insertion on charge and spin pumping, all of which show key differences between the two phases. To study the transition, we use interaction-strength scans extending between the two phases, and apply a scaling data collapse of a bond-dimerization order parameter to extract critical exponents. We also extract critical behavior from the divergence of correlation lengths on the IQH side, measuring decay away from edges of both the dimerization order parameter and transverse edge currents. The critical behavior and exponents are consistent with an Ising transition in 1+1 dimensions. Finally, we obtain excited states in various quantum number sectors finding that the gap to a charge neutral momentum $\pi$ excitation corresponding to fluctuations of the dimerization order parameter closes in the vicinity of the critical point but gaps to other excitations remain large.</description>

      <title>Dimensionality-Changing Transition from a Non-Fermi Liquid to a Spin-Solid in a Multichannel Kondo Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A multichannel Kondo system, where a single quantum spin couples to multiple channels of an electronic bath, provides one of the simplest examples of a zero-dimensional non-Fermi liquid. It is natural to ask: what happens when an extensive number of such systems are coupled together? A simple renormalization group argument implies that in a chain of SU(N) multichannel quantum systems, where each spin is coupled to its own bath of K channels, the individual spins dynamically decouple at low energy when N&gt;K, resulting in a 'sliding' non-Fermi liquid. Using Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations, we find evidences of a continuous, 'dimensionality-changing' phase transition out of this non-Fermi liquid into a valence-bond solid phase as the intersite coupling is increased. Remarkably, at the critical point, correlations exhibit a power-law behavior even along the direction in which the spins are coupled, indicating the breakdown of dynamical decoupling at the transition. We also develop an RG scheme to understand the universal aspects of this transition.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Majorana Fermions on a Quantum Computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of quasiparticle dynamics is central to understanding non-equilibrium phenomena in quantum many-body systems. Direct simulation of such dynamics on quantum hardware has been limited by circuit depth and noise constraints. In this work, we use a recently developed constant-depth circuit algorithm to examine the real-time evolution of site-resolved magnetization in a transverse-field Ising chain on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. By representing each spin as a pair of Majorana fermions, we identify two distinct dynamical regimes governed by the relative strength of spin interaction. Furthermore, we show how local impurities can serve as probes of Majorana modes, acting as dynamical barriers in the weak coupling regime. These results demonstrate that constant-depth quantum circuits provide a viable route for studying quasiparticle propagation and for probing Majorana signatures on currently available quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Kondo breakdown induced by the non-Hermitian complex hybridization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a non-Hermitian Anderson impurity model with one-body loss has been studied in [Phys. Rev. B 111, 125157 (2025)}], and it has been demonstrated that the renormalization effect generated by strong correlations counterintuitively changes the nature of dissipation into an emergent many-body dissipation that causes a Kondo breakdown. In a closely related context, it is also known that two-body loss in a non-Hermitian Kondo model triggers the Kondo breakdown. To elucidate the essence of these phenomena, we study the Anderson impurity model with a non-Hermitian complex hybridization as an effective model that provides a simple understanding of the Kondo breakdown. Using the slave-boson mean-field theory, we show that this model can explain the Kondo breakdown with a single complex parameter. Furthermore, we provide the exact Bethe ansatz solutions that support the results obtained by the slave-boson mean-field theory. Finally, we point out that the Lehmann representation for the non-Hermitian Green function cannot be obtained by the analytic continuation to the complex energy upon the Kondo breakdown, where the analyticity of the non-Hermitian Green function in the half-complex-$\omega$ plane no longer holds.</description>

      <title>Microscopic evidence of a field-induced critical spin-liquid state in a frustrated metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A field-induced quantum spin liquid (QSL) state is an extraordinary phenomenon, hitherto unobserved in metallic frustrated compounds. Recent bulk measurements have revealed intriguing field-induced magnetic states in metallic frustrated CePdAl. However, the nature of these field-induced states, potentially including a QSL state, remains unclear due to the lack of detailed microscopic investigation. To elucidate these field-induced states, we employed the transverse-field muon spin relaxation/rotation (TF-$\mu$SR) technique, applying various magnetic fields parallel to the c-axis in single-crystalline CePdAl over a broad temperature range (100~K-100~mK). Our $\mu$SR data indicate that field-induced low-temperature states for fields B$\leq B_{c2}(=3.4~T)$ exhibit long-range magnetic order, whereas for B&gt;$B_{c2}$ they yield contrasting behavior. Notably, at 3.75 T, the transverse relaxation rate ($\lambda_T$) diverges following a power-law dependence below 800~mK along with an indication of finite frustration, whereas the Knight shift is temperature independent. These observations corroborate the signature of a critical spin-liquid (CSL) with antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations. Furthermore, at 4.3 T, a non-Fermi liquid state is observed where frustration is absent. This comprehensive microscopic study strongly suggests the existence of a CSL state in a metallic frustrated system.</description>

      <title>Critical fluctuations and conserved dynamics in a strange ferromagnetic metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of the strange metallic behavior observed in a wide range of quantum materials is an open challenge to condensed matter physics. Historically, strange metals were uniquely associated with antiferromagnetic quantum critical points (QCPs), but a new generation of materials reveals their association with uniform order parameters, such as ferromagnetism, valley or nematic order, suggesting a deeper common denominator. At a QCP, order parameter fluctuations are characterized by the dynamical critical exponent $z$, which quantifies the space-time scaling asymmetry. Here, we report the observation of a divergence in the Gr\"uneisen ratio at the QCP of the strange-metal ferromagnet CeRh$_6$Ge$_4$ with a dynamical critical exponent $z=3$, signaling that the underlying quantum singularity involves a conserved degree of freedom. Yet the magnetization of this easy-plane ferromagnet is not conserved. We argue that the $z=3$ strange criticality requires a description beyond the Landau paradigm, proposing a link with the gauge modes of the small-to-large Fermi surface transition and the associated gauge charge of the delocalizing heavy electrons.</description>

      <title>Metallic island array as synthetic quantum matter: fractionalized entropy and thermal transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The surprisingly rich physics of a single Coulomb-blockaded metallic island, when coupled to quantum Hall edge channels, is now well established -- giving rise to charge fractionalization and multi-channel quantum impurity behavior. Here, we show that qualitatively new physics emerges in arrays of such elements. We consider a 1D chain of $N$ metallic islands, focusing on thermodynamic signatures such as quantized entropy and anomalous thermal conductance. Universal and robust behavior emerges for energy scales smaller than the charging energy of the islands. In particular, we demonstrate that for the bulk filling factor of $\nu=1$, the islands could support a finite heat flow without temperature difference between them. Upon pinching the array with a quantum point contact, we predict an entropy change that scales with the number of islands as $\Delta S = \frac{1}{2}k_B \log (N+1)$, which can be measured using charge detection. This fractional entropy suggests the emergence of a novel type of excitations in the array.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo Sampling for Wave Functions Requiring (Anti)Symmetrization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many strongly correlated states, such as those arising in the fractional quantum Hall effect and spin liquids, are described by wave functions obtained by dividing particles into multiple clusters, constructing a readily evaluable wave function in each cluster, and (anti)symmetrizing across these clusters. We introduce a method to compute quantities such as energies and correlators, using Monte Carlo simulations for these states. Our framework overcomes the factorial scaling of explicit (anti)symmetrization, allowing for studies of systems beyond the reach of exact diagonalization.</description>

      <title>Systematic study of multi-magnon binding energies in the FM-AFM $J_1$-$J_2$ chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic study of multi-magnon bound states (MBSs) in the spin-$\tfrac{1}{2}$ FM-AFM $J_1$-$J_2$ chain under magnetic fields using the density-matrix renormalization group method. As a quantitative measure of stability, we compute the magnon binding energy $E_{\rm b}(M,p)$ for bound clusters of size $p$ over wide ranges of the frustration ratio $J_2/|J_1|$ and the normalized magnetization $M/M_{\rm s}$. Near saturation, we benchmark our data against the analytic two-magnon result and map out a clear hierarchy of $p$-magnon states, whose phase boundaries follow an empirical scaling $J_{2,{\rm c}}(p;p\!+\!1)/|J_1|\!\approx\!0.34\,p^{-2.3}$ for large $p$. We further quantify the relation between the most stable $p$ and the zero-field pitch angle $\theta$, verifying the conjectured inequality $1/p&gt;\theta/\pi&gt;1/(p+1)$ up to $p \lesssim 9$. The binding energy shows pronounced suppression as $J_2/|J_1|\!\to\!1/4^+$ and, for some frustration values, attains a maximum below full saturation, indicating that partial depolarization enhances bound-magnon mobility. Close to the FM instability, $E_{\rm b}(M_{\rm s},p)$ exhibits an empirical power-law vanishing consistent with a quantum-Lifshitz scenario. Our results provide a comprehensive, experimentally relevant map of MBS stability across field and frustration, offering concrete guidance for inelastic probes in quasi-one-dimensional magnets.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of Curie Temperature in Ferromagnetic Insulator-Topological Insulator Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically analyze the topological insulator (TI) surface state mediated interactions between local moments in a proximate 2D ferromagnetic insulator (FMI) motivated by recent experiments that show a significant increase in the Curie temperature Tc of FMI-TI heterostructures. Such interactions have been investigated earlier with a focus on dilute magnetic dopants in TIs. Our problem involves a dense set of moments for which we find that the short range Bloembergen-Rowland interaction, arising from virtual particle-hole transitions between the valence and conduction bands, dominates over the oscillatory Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction. We show that the Tc enhancement is proportional to the Van Vleck susceptibility and that the spin-momentum locking of surface states leads to out-of-plane ferromagnetic order in the FMI. We investigate how the hybridization between top and bottom surfaces in a thin TI film impacts Tc enhancement, and show how our results can help understand recent experiments on atomically thin Cr2Te3-(Bi,Sb)2Te3.</description>

      <title>Fokker-Planck equation governing the distribution of walkers in AFQMC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) is typically formulated as an open-ended random walk in an overcomplete space of Slater determinants, implemented through a Langevin equation. However, the explicit form of the underlying Fokker-Planck equation governing the walker population distribution has remained unknown. In this paper, we derive the Fokker-Planck equation for AFQMC and propose a novel numerical scheme to solve it. The solution of the Fokker-Planck equation reveals the wavefunction actually sampled by the AFQMC algorithm. Interestingly, we find that even when the exact ground state is used as a guiding wavefunction in constrained path AFQMC, contrary to the common assumption, the wavefunction sampled by AFQMC is not exact. Beyond clarifying several fundamental aspects of AFQMC, the availability of a Fokker-Planck equation formulation opens new avenues for systematically improving its accuracy, which we outline in this paper.</description>

      <title>Soft Phonon Charge-Density Wave Formation in the Kagome Metal KV$_3$Sb$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A range of of unusual emergent behaviors have been reported in the charge-density wave (CDW) state of the $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A=~$K, Rb, Cs) kagome metals, including a CDW formation process without soft phonons, which points to an unconventional CDW mechanism. Here, we use inelastic x-ray scattering to show that the CDW in KV$_3$Sb$_5$ forms via phonons that soften to zero energy at the CDW ordering vector ($L$-point) around $T_{\rm CDW}=78$~K. These soft phonons exhibit a remarkable in-plane anisotropy, extending over a much larger momentum range along $L$-$A$ relative to $L$-$H$, which leads to diffuse scattering common among $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$. Using first-principles calculations, we find that the momentum-dependent electron-phonon coupling (EPC) is peaked at $L$ and exhibits the same in-plane anisotropy as the phonon softening. Conversely, the electronic susceptibility is not peaked at $L$ and shows the opposite in-plane anisotropy. Our findings favor momentum-dependent EPC as the driving mechanism of the CDW in KV$_3$Sb$_5$, with a CDW formation process similar to that of transition metal dichalcogenides.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric properties of interacting double quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the thermoelectric transport properties of an interacting parallel double quantum dot in the Coulomb-blockade regime. Building on an analytical solution based on an equation-of-motion technique, we extend the formalism for the asymmetrically coupled situation and provide compact closed-form expressions for steady-state currents together with the differential conductance, Seebeck coefficient, and thermal conductance. We determine the operating points that maximize efficiency and output power of the system, clarifying their relation to standard near-equilibrium ZT expressions. We further study the thermal rectification in both the open- and closed-circuit configurations and derive an expression for the open-circuit case. Interaction-induced resonances are understood in terms of the poles of the resulting Green's function, generating gate and bias dependent regions of enhanced efficiency at finite power, negative differential thermal conductance, and finite thermal rectification.</description>

      <title>Phenomenological Noise Models and Optimal Thresholds of the 3D Toric Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) topological codes offer the advantage of supporting fault-tolerant implementations of non-Clifford gates, yet their performance against realistic noise remains largely unexplored. In this work, we focus on the paradigmatic 3D toric code and investigate its fault-tolerance thresholds in the presence of both Pauli and measurement errors. Two randomly coupled lattice gauge models that describe the code's correctability are derived, including a random 2-form $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory. By exploiting a generalized duality technique, we show that the 3D toric code exhibits optimal thresholds of $p^{X,M}_{th} \approx 11\%$ and $p^{Z,M}_{th} \approx 2\%$ against bit-flip and phase-flip errors, respectively. These threshold values show modest reductions compared to the case of perfect measurements, establishing the robustness of the 3D toric code against measurement errors. Our results constitute a substantial advance towards assessing the practical performance of 3D topological codes. This contribution is timely and in high demand, as rapid hardware advancements are bringing complex codes into experimental reach. Moreover, our work highlights the interdisciplinary nature of fault-tolerant quantum computation and holds significant interest for quantum information science, high-energy physics, and condensed matter physics.</description>

      <title>Time-braiding phase of anyons tied to the nonuniversal scaling dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use a braiding nonequilibrium fluctuation dissipation relation linking the DC noise to the response function inferred from the braiding constraint in the time-domain with a phase $\theta$ within the UNEPT (Unified Non equilibrium Perturbative Theory). By applying the Kramers-Kr\"onig relations, we obtain an integral equation connecting DC current and noise that involves $\theta$. By specifying to thermal states so that noise is Poissonian, we find an analytical solution for the DC current via the Wiener-Hopf technique. It reveals that the time-braiding phase is determined by the scaling dimension~$\delta$. This questions the universality of $\theta$ that can reflect the microscopic edge dynamics, in contrast to the topologically protected braiding phase in the space domain.</description>

      <title>Kinetics of Peierls dimerization transition: Machine learning force-field approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a machine learning (ML) force-field framework for simulating the non-equilibrium dynamics of charge-density-wave (CDW) order driven by the Peierls instability. Since the Peierls distortion arises from the coupling between lattice displacements and itinerant electrons, evaluating the adiabatic forces during time evolution is computationally intensive, particularly for large systems. To overcome this bottleneck, we develop a generalized Behler-Parrinello neural-network architecture -- originally formulated for ab initio molecular dynamics -- to accurately and efficiently predict forces from local structural environments. Using the locality of electronic responses, the resulting ML force field achieves linear scaling efficiency while maintaining quantitative accuracy. Large-scale dynamical simulations using this framework uncover a two-stage coarsening behavior of CDW domains: an early-time regime characterized by a power-law growth $L \sim t^{\alpha}$ with an effective exponent $\alpha \approx 0.7$, followed by a crossover to the Allen-Cahn scaling $L \sim \sqrt{t}$ at late times. The enhanced early-time coarsening is attributed to anisotropic domain-wall motion arising from electron-mediated directional interactions. This work demonstrates the promise of ML-based force fields for multiscale dynamical modeling of condensed-matter lattice models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a framework with reflection positivity as the first principle for constructing the boundary theory of topologically ordered quantum spin systems. Assuming reflection positivity, we prove the equivalence between the non-degeneracy of the ground state on the sphere and the local-indistinguishability of local ground states of a frustration-free Hamiltonian. We apply the Osterwalder-Schrader (OS) reconstruction to construct the local symmetric operator algebras, which characterize the emergent categorical symmetry in the ground states.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Hall effect in rhombohedral graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments on rhombohedral stacked multilayer graphene and the observation of the anomalous Hall effect in a spontaneous spin-valley polarized quarter metal state, we calculate the anomalous Hall conductivity for this system in the presence of two types of impurities: weak and dense as well as sparse and strong. Our calculation of $\sigma_{xy}$ is based on the Kubo-Streda diagrammatic approach. In a model with Gaussian disorder applicable to weak dense impurities, this involves all non-crossing diagrams (intrinsic, side-jump and Gaussian skew-scattering contributions) and additionally diagrams with two intersecting impurities, X and $\Psi$, representing diffractive skew-scattering processes. A "Mercedes star" diagram (non-Gaussian skew scattering) is furthermore included to treat in the case of strong, sparse impurities. We supplement our asymptotically exact analytical solutions for an isotropic model without warping effects by semi-numerical calculations accounting perturbatively for warping, which plays a crucial role in the low-energy band structure.</description>

      <title>Charge-density waves and stripes in quarter metals of graphene heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments, here we identify valley-coherent charge-density wave (VC-CDW) order in the non-degenerate quarter-metal for the entire family of chirally-stacked $n$ layer graphene, encompassing rhombohedral multi-layer, Bernal bilayer, and monolayer cousins. Besides the hallmark broken translational symmetry, yielding a modulated charge-density over an enlarged unit-cell with a characteristic $2{\bf K}$ periodicity, where $\pm {\bf K}$ are the valley momenta, this phase lacks the three-fold ($C_3$) rotational symmetry but only for even integer $n$. The VC-CDW then represents a stripe order, as observed in hexalayer graphene [arXiv:2504.05129], but preserves the $C_3$ symmetry for odd $n$ as observed in trilayer graphene [Nat. Phys. 20, 1413 (2024) and arXiv: 2411.11163]. From a universal Clifford algebraic argument, we establish that the VC-CDW and an anomalous Hall order can lift the residual valley degeneracy of an antiferromagnetically ordered spin-polarized half-metal, when these systems are subject to perpendicular displacement fields, with only the latter one displaying a hysteresis in off-diagonal resistivity, as observed in all the systems with $2 \leq n \leq 6$. We showcase a confluence of VC-CDW and anomalous Hall orders within the quarter-metal, generically displaying a regime of coexistence, separating the pure phases.</description>

Abstract: The detection of considerable spin frustration in honeycomb cobalt oxide compounds indicates the presence of sizable Kitaev interactions in these systems, enlarging the pool of Kitaev spin liquid candidates. Several key questions remain to be answered, such as the magnitude of Kitaev couplings in cobaltates and how to engineer those, by either chemical or physical means. Analyzing the quantum chemistry of interacting magnetic moments in Na$_3$Co$_2$SbO$_6$, a representative $LS$-coupled $t_{2g}^5e_g^2$ Co$^{2+}$ oxide, we find that the Kitaev and off-diagonal $\Gamma$ interactions are substantial and antiferromagnetic but somewhat weaker than the Heisenberg contribution. Except $\Gamma'$, all nearest-neighbor couplings are mainly determined by Coulomb exchange, different from current representations of anisotropic interaction terms. This highlights the limits of existing anisotropic models and the need for systematic wave-function quantum chemical studies to clarify exchange mechanisms in Kitaev-Heisenberg magnets and the way of tuning intersite couplings towards the Kitaev spin liquid ground state.</description>

      <title>Interleaved bond frustration in a triangular lattice antiferromagnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Frustration of long-range order via lattice geometries serves to amplify fluctuations of the order parameter and generate unconventional ground states that are highly sensitive to perturbations. Traditionally, this concept of geometric frustration is used to engineer unconventional magnetic states in a variety of materials; however, the charge degree of freedom and bond order can be similarly frustrated. Finding materials that host both frustrated magnetic and bond networks holds promise for engineering structural and magnetic states with the potential of coupling to one another via either the magnetic sector (via magnetic field) or via the lattice sector (via strain). In this paper, we identify an unusual instance of this coexistence in the triangular lattice antiferromagnetic compounds $Ln$Cd$_3$P$_3$ ($Ln$ = La, Ce, Pr, and Nd). These compounds feature two-dimensional planes of unique trigonal-planar CdP$_3$ units that manifest an underlying bond instability with its long-range ordering frustrated via emergent kagome ice bond correlations. Our results establish $Ln$Cd$_3$P$_3$ as a rare class of materials where frustrated magnetism across a tunable rare-earth triangular network is embedded within a dopable semiconductor with a frustrated bond order instability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The delafossite-like compound NaYbO$_2$ hosts a triangular lattice of Yb$^{3+}$ moments and is a promising candidate for the realization of a quantum spin liquid ground state -- an exotic, quantum-disordered magnetic phase featuring long-range entanglement of spins. Tuning this system away from this quantum-disordered regime toward classical order or spin freezing is a powerful approach to shed light on the nature of the parent ground state. Here we leverage the substitution of nonmagnetic Lu$^{3+}$ onto the Yb$^{3+}$ sites to study the effects of magnetic disorder in NaYbO$_2$ using low-temperature ac susceptibility, heat capacity, and muon spin relaxation ($\mu$SR) measurements. Our $\mu$SR measurements reveal resilient, correlated magnetic fluctuations that persist to at least 15\% dilution, precluding conventional spin freezing and magnetic inhomogeneity. Heat capacity and magnetic susceptibility resolve a rapid suppression of the field-induced ``up-up-down'' magnetic order upon dilution and a crossover in the power-law behavior of the low-temperature magnetic excitations associated with the zero-field quantum disordered ground state. Taken together, these results support the notion of a robust network of entangled moments in NaYbO$_2$, and provides experimental validation of several models of a Heisenberg triangular lattice antiferromagnet in the presence of disorder.</description>

Abstract: We present a detailed investigation of longitudinal magneto-thermal transport in the $S=1/2$ ferromagnetic XXZ model with easy-axis exchange anisotropy ($\Delta&gt;1$) on a face-centered cubic lattice consisting of four sublattices. We employ linear spin-wave theory and the Kubo formalism to evaluate the longitudinal spin and thermal conductivities, both of which exhibit activated temperature dependence in the low-temperature regime, and to determine their magnetic-field dependence. Our analysis indicates that a magnon gap is crucial for ensuring the convergence of these conductivities. Furthermore, by examining the ratio of thermal conductivity to spin conductivity, we identify an analog of the Wiedemann-Franz law for magnon transport at low temperatures. Finally, we demonstrate that these results can be generalized to systems with arbitrary spin.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14656v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tensor networks are not only numerical tools for describing ground states of quantum many-body systems, but also conceptual aids for understanding their entanglement structures. The proper way to understand tensor networks themselves is through explicit examples of solvable ground states that they represent exactly. In fact, this has historically been how tensor networks for gapped ground states, such as the matrix product state (MPS) and the projected entangled paired state (PEPS), emerged as an elegant analytical framework from numerical techniques like the density matrix renormalization group. However, for gapless ground states, generically described by the multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA), a corresponding exactly solvable model has so far been missing. This is because the hierarchical structure of MERA intrinsically breaks the translational invariance. We identify a condition for MERA to be compatible with translational invariance by examining equivalent networks of rank-3 tensors. The condition is satisfied by the previously constructed hierarchical tensor network for the Motzkin and Fredkin chains, which can be considered a non-unitary generalization to the MERA. The hierarchical TN description is complemented by a translationally invariant MPS alternative, which is used to derive the power-law decay of the correlation function and critical exponents of a $q$-deformation phase transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26596v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Altermagnets, which encompass a broad landscape of materials, are compensated collinear magnetic phases in which the antiparallel magnetic moments are related by a crystalline rotation. Here, we argue that collinear altermagnetic-like states can also be realized in lattices with an odd number of sublattices, provided that the electronic interactions promote non-uniform magnetic moments. We demonstrate this idea for a kagome metal whose band filling places the Fermi level close to the van Hove singularity. Combining phenomenological and microscopic modeling, we show that the intertwined charge density-wave and loop-current instabilities of this model lead to a wide parameter range in which orbital ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, and altermagnetic phases emerge inside the charge-ordered state. In the presence of spin-orbit coupling, their electronic structures display the usual spin-split fingerprints associated with the three types of collinear magnetic order. We discuss the possible realization of orbital altermagnetic phases in the $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ family of kagome metals.</description>

Abstract: It is well-known that the standard bulk-boundary correspondence does not hold for non-Hermitian systems in which also new phenomena such as exceptional points do occur. Here we study, mostly by analytical means, a paradigmatic one-dimensional non-Hermitian model with dimerization, asymmetric hopping, and imaginary staggered potentials. We present analytical solutions for the singular-value and the eigensystem of this model with both open and closed boundary conditions. We explicitly demonstrate that the proper bulk-boundary correspondence is between topological winding numbers in the periodic case and singular values, {\it not eigenvalues}, in the open case. These protected singular values are connected to hidden edge modes which only become exact zero-energy eigenmodes in the semi-infinite chain limit. We also show that a non-trivial topology leads to protected eigenvalues in the entanglement spectrum. In the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric case, we find that the model has a so far overlooked phase where exceptional points become dense in the thermodynamic limit. This phase shows unusual hyper-ballistic transport properties with a dynamical critical exponent $z=1/2$.</description>

      <title>A unified quantum framework for electrons and ions: The self-consistent harmonic approximation on a neural network curved manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08882v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The numerical solution of the many-body problem of interacting electrons and ions is a key challenge in condensed matter physics, chemistry, and materials science. Traditional methods to solve the multi-component quantum Hamiltonian are usually specialized for one kind of particles -- electrons or ions -- and can suffer from a methodological gap when applied to the other ones.
  This work extends the self-consistent harmonic approximation, a proven successful technique for simulating quantum ions at finite temperatures in anharmonic crystals, to electrons. The approach minimizes the total free energy by optimizing an ansatz density matrix, solving a fermionic self-consistent harmonic Hamiltonian on a curved manifold parametrized through a neural network. This approach preserves an analytical expression for entropy, enabling the direct computation of free energies and phase diagrams of materials. By benchmarking this technique across several prototypical cases -- a double-well potential, the hydrogen atom, and the H$_2$ dissociation -- we demonstrate it can address both the ground- and excited-state properties of electronic systems, capture quantum tunneling and static electronic correlations, thereby providing a unified quantum framework of electrons and atomic nuclei.</description>

      <title>Estimating time in quantum chaotic systems and black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19885v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterize new universal features of the dynamics of chaotic quantum many-body systems, by considering a hypothetical task of "time estimation." Most macroscopic observables in a chaotic system equilibrate to nearly constant late-time values. Intuitively, it should become increasingly difficult to estimate the precise value of time by making measurements on the state. We use a quantity called the Fisher information from quantum metrology to quantify the minimum uncertainty in estimating time. Due to unitarity, the uncertainty in the time estimate does not grow with time if we have access to optimal measurements on the full system. Restricting the measurements to act on a small subsystem or to have low computational complexity leads to results expected from equilibration, where the time uncertainty becomes large at late times. With optimal measurements on a subsystem larger than half of the system, we regain the ability to estimate the time very precisely, even at late times.
  Hawking's calculation for the reduced density matrix of the black hole radiation in semiclassical gravity contradicts our general predictions for unitary quantum chaotic systems. Hawking's state always has a large uncertainty for attempts to estimate the time using the radiation, whereas our general results imply that the uncertainty should become small after the Page time. This gives a new version of the black hole information loss paradox in terms of the time estimation task. By restricting to simple measurements on the radiation, the time uncertainty becomes large. This indicates from a new perspective that the observations of computationally bounded agents are consistent with the semiclassical effective description of gravity.</description>

      <title>The category of anyon sectors for non-abelian quantum double models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15611v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Kitaev's quantum double model for arbitrary finite gauge group in infinite volume, using an operator-algebraic approach. The quantum double model hosts anyonic excitations which can be identified with equivalence classes of `localized and transportable endomorphisms', which produce anyonic excitations from the ground state. Following the Doplicher--Haag--Roberts (DHR) sector theory from AQFT, we organize these endomorphisms into a braided monoidal category capturing the fusion and braiding properties of the anyons. We show that this category is equivalent to $\mathrm{Rep}_f \mathcal{D}(G)$, the representation category of the quantum double of $G$. This establishes for the first time the full DHR structure for a class of 2d quantum lattice models with non-abelian anyons.</description>

      <title>Mixed Quantum-Classical Methods for Polaron Spectral Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13365v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, using two distinct semiclassical approaches, namely the mean-field Ehrenfest (MFE) method and the mapping approach to surface hopping (MASH), we investigate the spectral function of a single charge interacting with phonons on a lattice. This quantity is relevant for the description of angle-resolved photoemission experiments. Focusing on the one-dimensional Holstein model, we compare the performance of these approaches across a range of coupling strengths and lattice sizes, exposing the relative strengths and weaknesses of each. We demonstrate that these approaches can be efficiently applied with reasonable accuracy to ab initio polaron models. Our work provides a route to the calculation of spectral properties in realistic electron-phonon-coupled systems in a computationally inexpensive manner with encouraging accuracy.</description>

      <title>Computing excited eigenstates using inexact Lanczos methods and tree tensor network states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22574v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To understand the dynamics of quantum many-body systems, it is essential to study excited eigenstates. While tensor network states have become a standard tool for computing ground states in computational many-body physics, obtaining accurate excited eigenstates remains a significant challenge. In this work, we develop an approach that combines the inexact Lanczos method, which is designed for efficient computations of excited states, with tree tensor network states (TTNSs). We demonstrate our approach by computing excited vibrational states for three challenging problems: (1) 122 states in two different energy intervals of acetonitrile (12-dimensional), (2) Fermi resonance states of the fluxional Zundel ion (15-dimensional), and (3) selected excited states of the fluxional and very correlated Eigen ion (33-dimensional). The proposed TTNS inexact Lanczos method is directly applicable to other quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Mesoscale variations of chemical and electronic landscape on the surface of Weyl semimetal Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ visualized by ARPES and XPS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The multiple crystalline terminations in magnetic Weyl semimetal Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ display distinct topological and trivial surface states, which have successfully been distinguished experimentally. However, a model of pure terminations is known to be inadequate because these surfaces exhibit a high degree of spatial heterogeneity and point disorder. Here we perform a spectromicroscopy study of the surface chemistry and surface electronic structure using photoemission measurements in combination with first-principles calculations of core levels. We identify an intermediate region with properties distinct from both the sulfur and tin terminations, and demonstrate that the spectral features in this region can be associated with a disordered termination with a varying density of surface tin vacancies. This work establishes heuristics for identifying variable surface disorder using photoemission, an important prerequisite to experimentally establishing the behavior of momentum-space topological surface features subject to variable surface disorder on a single cleave.</description>

      <title>Exact Quench Dynamics from Thermal Pure Quantum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05346v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an exact solution for the real-time dynamics following a quench from a thermal pure quantum (TPQ) state in an integrable system. Although equilibration is expected in this setting because the TPQ state already encodes the thermal expectation values of all conserved quantities, the approach to equilibrium shows highly nontrivial coherent dynamics. In the spin-1/2 XX chain, local observables become stationary at their thermal values after dephasing, while the entanglement entropy exhibits a characteristic double-plateau structure. We obtain this behavior exactly using three complementary approaches: two-dimensional (2D) conformal field theory (CFT) on the Klein bottle, an exact numerical evolution based on the matrix Riccati equation, and an asymptotically exact quasiparticle picture. These results demonstrate that the non-monotonic entanglement evolution is a macroscopic manifestation of the coherent dephasing of anomalous pairing correlations in the initial TPQ state.</description>
