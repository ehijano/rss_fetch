      <title>Controllable and Continuous Quantum Phase Transitions in Intrinsic Magnetic Topological Insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The intrinsic magnetic topological material MnBi2Te4 has demonstrated great potential to investigate the interplay between topology and magnetism, which opens up new avenues for manipulating non-trivial electronic states and designing quantum devices. However, challenges and controversies remain due to its inevitable n-type antisite defects, hindering the experimental realization of intrinsic magnetic topological phenomena and rendering the precise control of topological phase transitions (TPTs) unachievable. Here, we study a candidate material family, Mn(1-x)GexBi2Te4, in which the heavy n-type doping features are strongly suppressed when the Ge content reaches 0.46, and multiple topological phases are well maintained with the surface Dirac point located near the Fermi level. Based on angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, transport measurements, and first-principles calculations, we reveal two magnetism-induced TPTs: the first is antiferromagnetic-ordering-induced transition from strong topological insulator to a magnetic topological insulator as revealed by gap opening of topological surface states; the second is external-magnetic-field-dependent transition from magnetic topological insulator to a Weyl semimetal with the gap reclosed. Our work paves the way for the realization of intrinsic magnetic topological states in MnBi2Te4 family and provides an ideal platform for achieving controllable and continuous TPTs towards future spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>The study of double kicked top: a classical and quantum perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the double kicked top (DKT), which is an extension of the standard quantum kicked top (QKT) model. The model allows us to study the transition from time-reversal symmetric to broken time-reversal symmetric dynamics. Our transformation in the kick strength parameter space $(k, k') \to (k_r, k_\theta)$ reveals interesting features. The transformed kicked strength parameter $k_r$ drives a higher growth of chaos and is equivalent to the standard QKT, whereas the other transformed kicked strength parameter $k_\theta$ leads to a weaker growth. We discuss the fixed points, their stability, and verify results obtained by computing the largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE) and the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy (KSE). We exactly solve 2- to 4-qubit versions of DKT by obtaining its eigenvalues, eigenvectors and the entanglement dynamics. Furthermore, we find the criteria for periodicity of the entanglement dynamics. We investigate measures of quantum correlations from two perspectives: the deep quantum and the semi-classical regime. Signatures of phase-space structure are numerically shown in the long-time averages of the quantum correlations. Our model can be realised experimentally as an extension of the standard QKT.</description>

      <title>Antiferroelectric switching inside ferroelastic domain walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ferroelastic materials (materials with switchable spontaneous strain) often are centrosymmetric, but their domain walls are always polar, as their internal strain gradients cause polarization via flexoelectricity. This polarization is generally not switchable by an external electric field, because reversing the domain wall polarity would require reversing the strain gradient, which in turn would require switching the spontaneous strain of the adjacent domains, destroying the domain wall in the process. However, domain wall polarization can also arise from biquadratic coupling between polar and non-polar order parameters (e.g. octahedral tilts in perovskites). Such coupling is independent of the sign of the polarization and thus allows switching between +P and -P. In this work, we seek to answer the question of whether the polarization of domain walls in ferroelastic perovskites is switchable, as per the symmetric biquadratic term, or non-switchable due to the unipolar flexoelectric bias. Using perovskite calcium titanate (CaTiO3) as a paradigm, molecular dynamics calculations indicate that high electric fields broaden the ferroelastic domain walls, thereby reducing flexoelectricity (as the domain wall strain gradient is inversely proportional to the wall width), eventually enabling switching. The polarization switching, however, is not ferroelectric-like with a simple hysteresis loop, but antiferroelectric-like with a double hysteresis loop. Ferroelastic domain walls thus behave as functional antiferroelectric elements, and also as nucleation points for a bulk phase transition to a polar state.</description>

      <title>Multistep reversible excitation transfer in a multicomponent rigid solution: II. Modeling the dynamics of radiationless transfer as a time-resolved Markov chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15425v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To determine the effect of nonradiative excitation energy transfer on the fluorescence of a rigid multicomponent solution, a new analytical method was developed by treating this transfer as a time-resolved Markov chain (TRMC). In the TRMC approach, we assume that the Markov chain under consideration is governed by bivariate joint probability mass-density functions. One of the random variables is discrete and represents the state number to which the process passes at a given step, while the other random variable is continuous and determines the moment in time at which this transition occurs. In general, the time distributions of this second variable can be arbitrary, continuous or discrete, and not just exponential, as required by the method known as continuous time Markov chains (CTMC). The correctness of the TRMC method is confirmed by the fact that the time courses of fluorescence intensities calculated by this method agree with those calculated using ordinary analytical methods. In the section on calculating the quantum yields of individual components, the suitability of a method known as discrete time Markov chains (DTMC) was found. However, we argue that the DTMC method does not refer to time and propose to rename it as time-unspecified Markov chain (TUMC). The results generated by TRMC, when integrated over time, become equivalent to those generated by TUMC. The fluorescence cases of binary and ternary solutions are discussed in detail</description>

      <title>Multistep reversible excitation transfer in a multicomponent rigid solution: I. Calculation of steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence intensities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15428v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Previously obtained expressions describing the intensity of stationary fluorescence emitted by a multicomponent solution were significantly improved by using matrix calculus. Then, using a similar technique, new expressions describing the decay of the fluorescence intensity of the multicomponent system after pulsed excitation were found. In both of these cases, the effects of the internal filter, the effects of multistep radiative transfer of excitation energy, the possibility of radiative back-transfer, as well as the possibility of changes in the quantum yield of individual components due to radiationless transfer of excitation energy were taken into account. The cases of one-, two- and three-component systems were discussed in detail.</description>

      <title>Relative knot probabilities in confined lattice polygons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08835v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we examine the relative knotting probabilities in a lattice model of ring polymers confined in a cavity. The model is of a lattice knot of size $n$ in the cubic lattice, confined to a cube of side-length $L$ and with volume $V=(L{+}1)^3$ sites. We use Monte Carlo algorithms to approximately enumerate the number of conformations of lattice knots in the confining cube. If $p_{n,L}(K)$ is the number of conformations of a lattice polygon of length $n$ and knot type $K$ in a cube of volume $L^3$, then the relative knotting probability of a lattice polygon to have knot type $K$, relative to the probability that the polygon is the unknot (the trivial knot, denoted by $0_1$), is $\rho_{n,L}(K/0_1) = p_{n,L}(K)/p_{n,L}(0_1)$. We determine $\rho_{n,L}(K/0_1)$ for various knot types $K$ up to six crossing knots. Our data show that these relative knotting probabilities are small so that the model is dominated by lattice polygons of knot type the unknot. Moreover, if the concentration of the monomers of the lattice knot is $\varphi = n/V$, then the relative knot probability increases with $\varphi$ along a curve that flattens off as the Hamiltonian state is approached.</description>

      <title>Multi-scale physics of cryogenic liquid helium-4: Inverse coarse-graining properties of smoothed particle hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14244v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our recent numerical studies on cryogenic liquid helium-4 strongly indicate the features of multiscale physics that can be identified using the Landau's two-fluid model. This study presents the possibility that two-fluid models based on classical and quantum hydrodynamics have a relationship between the scale transformation using filtering in large eddy simulations (LES) and the inverse scale transformation using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). We show that the spin angular momentum conservation term, which we previously introduced into the two-fluid model as a quantum mechanical correction, formally corresponds to the subgrid-scale (SGS) model, which can be derived from the scale transformation of the two-fluid model from quantum to classical hydrodynamics. Our theoretical analysis shows that solving the two-fluid model based on classical hydrodynamics using SPH can reproduce the microscopic fluctuations even at the macroscopic scale because the truncation errors owing to the smoothing kernel approximation can substitute the microscopic fluctuations. In particular, the fluctuations can be amplified according to the size of the kernel radius at the macroscopic scale. Our further theoretical analysis shows that the Condiff viscosity model can serve as an SGS model and incorporate the quantum vortex interactions into the two-fluid model. Our results and discussion provide new insights into the microscopic composition of the cryogenic liquid helium-4 within a multiscale framework. First, a normal fluid can be a mixture of inviscid and viscous fluid particles. Second, a flow identified as a normal fluid on the microscopic scale because of the presence of molecular viscosity is still classified as an inviscid fluid on the hydrodynamic scale because its viscosity is insufficient to produce eddy viscosity.</description>

      <title>Nitrogen and hydrogen intercalation into crystalline fullerite C$_{60}$ and photoluminescent studies in a wide temperature range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical properties of fullerite C$_{60}$ single crystals saturated with hydrogen and nitrogen molecules were studied in the temperature range from 20 K to 230 K using the spectral-luminescent method. Saturation was carried out under a pressure of 30 atm at various temperatures from 470 K to 720 K. At saturation temperatures above 520 K for hydrogen and 690 K for nitrogen, chemical interaction of impurity molecules and the fullerene matrix occurs, forming new chemical compounds. The results of a study of the photoluminescent properties of a new substances are presented for the first time.</description>
