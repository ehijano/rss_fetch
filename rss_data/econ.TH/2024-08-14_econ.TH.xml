      <title>Identifying Restrictions on the Random Utility Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize those ex-ante restrictions on the random utility model which lead to identification. We first identify a simple class of perturbations which transfer mass from a suitable pair of preferences to the pair formed by swapping certain compatible lower contour sets. We show that two distributions over preferences are behaviorally equivalent if and only if they can be obtained from each other by a finite sequence of such transformations. Using this, we obtain specialized characterizations of which restrictions on the support of a random utility model yield identification, as well as of the extreme points of the set of distributions rationalizing a given data set. Finally, when a model depends smoothly on some set of parameters, we show that under mild topological assumptions, identification is characterized by a straightforward, local test.</description>

      <title>Monotone comparative statics for submodular functions, with an application to aggregated deferred acceptance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.12171v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose monotone comparative statics results for maximizers of submodular functions, as opposed to maximizers of supermodular functions as in the classical theory put forth by Veinott, Topkis, Milgrom, and Shannon among others. We introduce matrons, a natural structure that is dual to sublattices that generalizes existing structures such as matroids and polymatroids in combinatorial optimization and M-sets in discrete convex analysis. Our monotone comparative statics result is based on a natural order on matrons, which is dual in some sense to Veinott's strong set order on sublattices. As an application, we propose a deferred acceptance algorithm that operates in the case of divisible goods, and we study its convergence properties.</description>
