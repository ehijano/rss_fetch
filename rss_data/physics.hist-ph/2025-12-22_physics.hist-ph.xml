      <title>Realism and Ontology in Quantum Mechanics and String Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dualities in physics have challenged traditional forms of scientific realism by undermining the idea that theories describe a unique underlying ontology. In this paper, we develop a new perspective on scientific realism that responds to this challenge. We argue that while realist commitment remains appropriate at the level of a theory's full formal structure, ontological commitment should be treated as tied to specific empirical contexts rather than to a fixed, real ontology. Our proposal draws inspiration from Dennett's notion of a "compression algorithm" as a defining criterion of a scientific theory. On this basis, we separate realism from ontological commitment. To clarify the stakes of this distinction, we contrast our approach with common core realism, which locates ontology in the invariant structure shared by dual models. Focusing on dualities in quantum mechanics and string theory, we show how our view accommodates ontological pluralism while preserving a robust form of structural realism.</description>

      <title>Subsystems (in)dependence in GIE proposals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17024v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent proposals suggest that detecting entanglement between two spatially superposed masses would establish the quantum nature of gravity. However, these gravitationally induced entanglement (GIE) experiments rely on assumptions about subsystem independence. We sharpen the theoretical underpinnings of such proposals by examining them through the lens of algebraic quantum field theory (AQFT), distinguishing distinct operational and algebraic notions of independence. We argue that state and measurement independence of subsystems, essential to the experimental logic, is nontrivial in the presence of gauge constraints and gravitational dressing. Using gravitationally dressed fields, we recall that commutation relations between spacelike separated observables are nontrivial, undermining strict Hilbert space factorization. We further explore the implications for entanglement witnesses, investigating the Tsirelson bound when subsystem algebras fail to commute, and showing that the Tsirelson bound persists for a suitably symmetrized CHSH observable even though the operational status of such "joint" observables becomes delicate when commensurability fails. Our analysis highlights how even within linearized covariant quantum gravity, violations of microcausality may affect both the interpretation, modelling, and design of proposed laboratory tests of quantum gravity, despite remaining negligible for current experimental regimes. Although we consider GIE-style protocols as a concrete case study, the subsystem-independence issues we highlight are generic to low-energy (perturbative) quantum gravity. Finally, we derive estimates for dressing-induced microcausality violations, which suggest a complementary avenue to current proposals: in principle, bounding dressing-induced microcausality violations themselves as a probe of the quantum nature of gravity.</description>

      <title>Chronicle: "Foot of the iceberg" of Nobel Prize in Physics 2025: ILTPE and LTP contribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Nobel Prize in Physics 2025 has been awarded to John Clarke, John Martinis, and Michel Devoret for "the discovery of macroscopic quantum mechanical tunnelling and energy quantisation in an electric circuit". The paper explains the essence of their studies and shows in a historical context the importance of earlier research in superconductivity and quantum physics of macroscopic systems by other physicists, particularly, Ukrainian scientists, including employees of the B. Verkin Institute for Low Temperature Physics and Engineering of the NAS of Ukraine (ILTPE). The role of the Fizyka Nyzkykh Temperatur (FNT) journal issued by ILTPE in Kharkiv and its translation as AIP Low Temperature Physics (LTP) in dissemination of results of the theoretical and experimental studies in the field is emphasized as well.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Rashomon Effect: A Strengthened Frauchiger-Renner Argument</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.12716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.12716v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Frauchiger-Renner argument aims to show that `quantum theory cannot consistently describe the use of itself': in many-party settings where agents are themselves subject to quantum experiments, agents may make predictions that contradict observations. Here, we introduce a simplified setting using only three agents, that is independent of the initial quantum state, thus eliminating in particular any need for entanglement, and furthermore does not need to invoke any final measurement and resulting collapse. Nevertheless, the predictions and observations made by the agents cannot be integrated into a single, consistent account. We propose that the existence of this sort of \emph{Rashomon effect}, i.e. the impossibility of uniting different perspectives, is due to failing to account for the limits put on the information available about any given system as encapsulated in the notion of an \emph{epistemic horizon}.</description>

      <title>Deriving the Born Rule from a model of the quantum measurement process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06375v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum mechanics postulate called the Born Rule attributes a probabilistic meaning to a wave function. This paper derives the Born Rule from other quantum principles along with a model of the measurement process.
  The nondeterministic nature of quantum measurements is hypothesized to arise from an ignorance of the quantum states of a measuring device's microscopic components. Their interactions with a system to be measured are modeled heuristically with any member of a particular class of stochastic processes, each of which generate the Born Rule. One member of the class appears particularly compatible with properties expected of quantum interactions.</description>
