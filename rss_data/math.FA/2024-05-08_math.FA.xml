      <title>Kannappan-Wilson and Van Vleck-Wilson functional equations on semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $S$ be a semigroup, $Z(S)$ the center of $S$ and $\sigma:S\rightarrow S$ is an involutive automorphism. Our main results is that we describe the solutions of the Kannappan-Wilson functional equation \[\displaystyle \int_{S} f(xyt)d\mu(t) +\displaystyle \int_{S} f(\sigma(y)xt)d\mu(t)= 2f(x)g(y),\ x,y\in S,\] and the Van Vleck-Wilson functional equation \[\displaystyle \int_{S} f(xyt)d\mu(t) -\displaystyle \int_{S} f(\sigma(y)xt)d\mu(t)= 2f(x)g(y),\ x,y\in S,\] where $\mu$ is a measure that is a linear combination of Dirac measures $(\delta_{z_i})_{i\in I}$, such that $z_i\in Z(S)$ for all $i\in I$. Interesting consequences of these results are presented.</description>

      <title>Extremes of interpolation scales of Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: M. Daher gave conditions so that the spheres of the spaces in the interior of a complex interpolation scale are uniformly homeomorphic. We look for sufficient conditions for the validity of this result and related ones on the extremes of the scale, with applications to uniform homeomorphism between spheres of Banach spaces and the sphere of $\ell_2$.</description>

      <title>Transference of measures via disintegration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a compact space $K$ and a Banach space $E$ we study the structure of positive measures on the product space $K\times B_{E^*}$ representing functionals on $C(K,E)$, the space of $E$-valued continuous functions on $K$. Using the technique of disintegration we provide an alternative approach to the procedure of transference of measures introduced by Batty (1990). This enables us to substantially strengthen some of his results, to discover a rich order structure on these measures, to identify maximal and minimal elements and to relate them to the classical Choquet order.</description>

      <title>A characterization of wavelet sets on Vilenkin groups with its application to construction of MRA wavelets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a Vilenkin group. In 2008, Y. A. Farkov constructed wavelets on $G$ via the multiresolution analysis method. In this article, a characterization of wavelet sets on $G$ is established, which provides another method for the construction of wavelets. As an application, the relation between multiresolution analyses and wavelets determined from wavelet sets is also presented. To some extent, these results positively answer a question mentioned by P. Mahapatra and D. Singh in [Bull. Sci. Math. 167 (2021), Paper No. 102945, 20 pp].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigated the existence of solutions for a class of Ambrosetti-Prodi type systems involving the fractional Laplacian operator and with nonlinearities reaching critical growth and interacting, in some sense, with the spectrum of the operator. The resonant case in $\lambda_{k,s}$ for $k&gt;1$ is also investigated.</description>

      <title>Stress solution of static linear elasticity with mixed boundary conditions via adjoint linear operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit stress problems in linear elasticity to provide a perspective from the geometrical and functionalanalytic points of view. For the static stress problem of linear elasticity with mixed boundary conditions we write the associated pair of unbounded adjoint operators. The stress solution is found as an intersection of affine translations of the fundamental subspaces of the adjoint operators. In particular, we treat the equilibrium equation in the operator form, involving spaces of traces on a part of the boundary, known as Lions-Magenes spaces. Our analysis of the pair of adjoint operators for the problem with mixed boundary conditions relies on the properties of the analogous pair of operators for the problem with the displacement boundary conditions, which we also include in the paper.</description>

      <title>A discrete framework for the interpolation of Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.08373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.08373v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a discrete framework for the interpolation of Banach spaces, which contains the well-known real and complex interpolation methods, but also more recent methods like the Rademacher, $\gamma$- and $\ell^q$-interpolation methods. Our framework is based on a sequential structure imposed on a Banach space, which allows us to deduce properties of interpolation methods from properties of sequential structures. Our framework has a formulation modelled after both the real and the complex interpolation methods. This enables us to extend various results, previously known only for either the real or the complex interpolation method, to all interpolation methods that fit into our framework. As applications, we prove an interpolation result for analytic operator families and an interpolation result for intersections.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.02286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that any Sobolev norm of nonnegative integer order of radially symmetric functions is equivalent to a weighted Sobolev norm of their radial profile. This establishes in terms of weighted Sobolev spaces on an interval a complete characterization of radial Sobolev spaces, which was open until now. As an application, we give a description of Sobolev norms of corotational maps.</description>

      <title>Decomposition of the algebra of analytic functionals on a connected complex Lie group and its completions into iterated analytic smash products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.04192v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that a decomposition of a complex Lie group $G$ into a semidirect product generates that of the algebra of analytic functional, ${\mathscr A}(G)$, into an analytic smash product in the sense of Pirkovskii. Also we find sufficient conditions for a semidirect product to generate similar decompositions of certain Arens-Michael completions of ${\mathscr A}(G)$. The main result: if $G$ is connected, then its linearization admits a decomposition into an iterated semidirect product (with the composition series consisting of abelian factors and a semisimple factor) that induces a decomposition of algebras in a class of completions of ${\mathscr A}(G)$ into iterated analytic smash products. Considering the extreme cases, the envelope of ${\mathscr A}(G)$ in the class of all Banach algebras (aka the Arens-Michael envelope) and the envelope in the class Banach PI-algebras (a new concept that is introduced in this article), we decompose, in particular, these envelopes into iterated analytic smash products.</description>

      <title>Sampling discretization of the uniform norm and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.14207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Discretization of the uniform norm of functions from a given finite dimensional subspace of continuous functions is studied. Previous known results show that for any $N$-dimensional subspace of the space of continuous functions it is sufficient to use $e^{CN}$ sample points for an accurate upper bound for the uniform norm by the discrete norm and that one cannot improve on the exponential growth of the number of sampling points for a good discretization theorem in the uniform norm. In this paper we focus on two types of results, which allow us to obtain good discretization of the uniform norm with polynomial in $N$ number of points. In the first way we weaken the discretization inequality by allowing a bound of the uniform norm by the discrete norm multiplied by an extra factor, which may depend on $N$. In the second way we impose restrictions on the finite dimensional subspace under consideration. In particular, we prove a general result, which connects the upper bound on the number of sampling points in the discretization theorem for the uniform norm with the best $m$-term bilinear approximation of the Dirichlet kernel associated with the given subspace.</description>

      <title>A comparison among a fuzzy algorithm for image rescaling with other methods of digital image processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14545v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to present a comparison among the fuzzy-type algorithm for image rescaling introduced by Jurio et al., 2011, quoted in the list of references, with some other existing algorithms such as the classical bicubic algorithm and the so-called sampling Kantorovich (SK) one. Note that, the SK algorithm is a recent tool for image rescaling and enhancement that revealed to be useful in several applications to real world problems, while bicubic algorithm is widely known in the literature. The comparison among the above mentioned algorithms (all implemented by MatLab programming language) has been done in term of suitable similarity indexes such as the Peak-Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (PSNR) and the likelihood index $S$. Moreover, also the CPU time of the considered algorithms has been analysed.</description>

      <title>Banach lattices of homogeneous polynomials not containing $c_0$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: First we develop a technique to construct Banach lattices of homogeneous polynomials. We obtain, in particular, conditions for the linear spans of all positive compact and weakly compact $n$-homogeneous polynomials between the Banach lattices $E$ and $F$, denoted by ${\cal P}_{\cal K}^r(^n E; F)$ and $\mathcal{P}_{\mathcal{W}}^r(^n E; F)$, to be Banach lattices with the polynomial regular norm. Next we study when the following are equivalent for ${\cal I} = {\cal K}$ or ${\cal I} = {\cal W}$: (1) The space $\mathcal{P}^r(^n E; F)$ of regular polynomials contains no copy of $c_0$. (2) ${\cal P}_{\mathcal{I}}^r(^n E; F)$ contains no copy of $c_0$. (3) ${\cal P}_{\mathcal{I}}^r(^n E; F)$ is a projection band in $\mathcal{P}^r(^n E; F)$. (4) Every positive polynomial in $\mathcal{P}^r(^n E; F)$ belongs to ${\cal P}_{\cal I}^r(^nE;F)$. The result we obtain in the compact case can be regarded as a lattice polynomial Kalton theorem.</description>

      <title>Completely mixed linear games and irreducibility concepts for Z-transformations over self-dual cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13464v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the setting of a self-dual cone in a finite-dimensional inner product space, we consider (zero-sum) linear games. In our previous work, we showed that a Z-transformation with positive value is completely mixed. The present paper considers the case when the value is zero. Motivated by the matrix game result that a Z-matrix with value zero is completely mixed if and only if it is irreducible, we formulate our general results based on the concepts of cone-irreducibility and space-irreducibility. While the concept of cone-irreducibility for a positive linear transformation is well-known, we introduce space-irreducibility for a general linear transformation by reformulating the irreducibility concept of Elsner. Our main result is that for a Z-transformation with value zero, space-irreducibility is necessary and sufficient for the completely mixed property. We also extend a recent result of Parthasarathy et al. on matrix games with value zero to the setting of a symmetric cone (in a Euclidean Jordan algebra). Additionally, we present a refined cone/space-irreducibility result for positive transformations on symmetric cones.</description>

      <title>The Dirac Delta as a Singular Potential for the 2D Schrodinger Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15126v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the framework of distributionally generalized quantum theory, the object $H\psi$ is defined as a distribution. The mathematical significance is a mild generalization for the theory of para- and pseudo-differential operators (as well as a generalization of the weak eigenvalue problem), where the $\psi$-do symbol (which is not a proper linear operator in this generalized case) can have its coefficient functions take on singular distributional values. Here, a distribution is said to be singular if it is not L$^p(\mathbb{R}^d)$ for any $p\geq 1$. Physically, the significance is a mathematically rigorous method, which does not rely upon renormalization or regularization of any kind, while producing bound state energy results in agreement with the literature. In addition, another benefit is that the method does not rely upon self-adjoint extensions of the Laplace operator. This is important when the theory is applied to non-Schrodinger systems, as is the case for the Dirac equation and a necessary property of any finite rigorous version of quantum field theory. The distributional interpretation resolves the need to evaluate a wave function at a point where it fails to be defined. For $d=2$, this occurs as $K_o(a|x|)\delta(x)$, where $K_o$ is the zeroth order MacDonald function. Finally, there is also the identification of a missing anomalous length scale, owing to the scale invariance of the formal symbol(ic) Hamiltonian, as well as the common identity for the logarithmic function, with $a,\,b\in\mathbb{R}^+$, $\log(ab)=\log(a)+\log(b)$, which loses unitlessness in its arguments. Consequently, the energy or point spectrum is generalized as a family (set indexed by the continuum) of would-be spectral values, called the C-spectrum.</description>

      <title>Completely Bounded Norms of $k$-positive Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12352v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given an operator system $\mathcal{S}$, we define the parameters $r_k(\mathcal{S})$ (resp. $d_k(\mathcal{S})$) defined as the maximal value of the completely bounded norm of a unital $k$-positive map from an arbitrary operator system into $\mathcal{S}$ (resp. from $\mathcal{S}$ into an arbitrary operator system).
  In the case of the matrix algebras $M_n$, for $1 \leq k \leq n$, we compute the exact value $r_k(M_n) = \frac{2n-k}{k}$ and show upper and lower bounds on the parameters $d_k(M_n)$.
  Moreover, when $\mathcal{S}$ is a finite-dimensional operator system, adapting recent results of Passer and the 4th author, we show that the sequence $(r_k( \mathcal{S}))$ tends to $1$ if and only if $\mathcal{S}$ is exact and that the sequence $(d_k(\mathcal{S}))$ tends to $1$ if and only if $\mathcal{S}$ has the lifting property.</description>
