      <title>Micrometeoroid Impact Rate Analysis for an Artemis-Era Lunar Base</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NASA's Artemis Mission aims to return astronauts to the Moon and establish a base at the lunar south pole. A key challenge is understanding the threat from micrometeoroid impacts, which are too small to monitor directly. Using NASA's Meteoroid Engineering Model 3 (\texttt{MEM~3}), we estimate micrometeoroid impact rates on a base comparable in size to the International Space Station (100\,m $\times$ 100\,m $\times$ 10\,m). We find that a lunar base would experience $\sim$15,000--23,000 incident impacts per year by micrometeoroids with a mass range of $10^{-6}$--$10^{1}$~g, depending on location -- with minima at the lunar poles, a maximum near the sub-Earth longitude, and a factor of $\sim$1.6 variation between the two. To assess the mitigating effect of protection systems, we present a functional relationship describing the number of impacts that penetrate the shielding as a function of the minimum meteoroid mass capable of penetrating the shield -- the ``critical mass.'' We estimate that state-of-the-art Whipple shields protect against $\sim$99.9997\% of micrometeoroids. By re-running \texttt{MEM~3} with a minimum mass equal to the critical mass of modern Whipple shields, we determine that a shielded lunar base would experience $\sim$0.024--0.037 penetrating impacts per year -- again with minima at the poles and a maximum near the sub-Earth longitude. These results indicate that (1) the lunar poles are optimal for sustained habitation, (2) gravitational focusing by Earth dominates over its geometric shielding for this micrometeoroid flux, and (3) current shielding technology can reduce micrometeoroid threats by nearly five orders of magnitude, making long-duration lunar habitation feasible.</description>

      <title>Mass determination of the three long-period Neptune- and sub-Neptune-sized planets transiting TOI-282</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: TOI-282 is a bright (V=9.38) F8 main-sequence star known to host three transiting long-period ($P_b$=22.9 d, $P_c$=56.0 d, and $P_d$=84.3 d) small ($R_p\approx$ 2-4 $R_{\oplus}$) planets. The orbital period ratio of the two outermost planets, namely TOI-282 c and d, is close to the 3:2 commensurability, suggesting that the planets might be trapped in a mean motion resonance. We combined space-borne photometry from the TESS telescope with high-precision HARPS and ESPRESSO Doppler measurements to refine orbital parameters, measure the planetary masses, and investigate the architecture and evolution of the system. We performed a Markov chain Monte Carlo joint analysis of the transit light curves and radial velocity time series, and carried out a dynamical analysis to model transit timing variations and Doppler measurements along with N-body integration. In agreement with previous results, we found that TOI-282 b, c, and d have radii of $R_b=2.69 \pm 0.23 \ R_{\oplus}$, $R_c=4.13^{+0.16}_{-0.14} \ R_{\oplus}$, and $R_d=3.11 \pm 0.15 \ R_{\oplus}$, respectively. We measured planetary masses of $M_b=6.2\pm1.6 \ M_{\oplus}$, $M_c=9.2\pm2.0 \ M_{\oplus}$, and $M_d=5.8^{+0.9}_{-1.1} \ M_{\oplus}$, which imply mean densities of $\rho_b=1.8^{+0.7}_{-0.6} \ \text{g cm}^{-3}$, $\rho_c=0.7 \pm 0.2 \ \text{g cm}^{-3}$, and $\rho_d=1.1^{+0.3}_{-0.2} \ \text{g cm}^{-3}$, respectively. The three planets may be water worlds, making TOI-282 an interesting system for future atmospheric follow-up observations with JWST and ELT.</description>

      <title>Upper limits on atmospheric abundances of KELT-11b and WASP-69b from a retrieval approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: WASP-69b and KELT-11b are two low-density hot Jupiters, which are expected to show strong atmospheric features in their transmission spectra. Such features offer valuable insights into the chemical composition, thermal structure, and cloud properties of exoplanet atmospheres. High-resolution spectroscopic observations can be used to study the line-forming regions in exoplanet atmospheres and potentially detect signals despite the presence of clouds. We aimed to detect various molecular species and constrain the chemical abundances and cloud deck pressures using high-resolution spectroscopy. We observed multiple transits of these planets with CARMENES and applied the cross-correlation method to detect atmospheric signatures. Further, we used an injection-recovery approach and retrievals to place constraints on the atmospheric properties. We detected a tentative H$_2$O signal for KELT-11b but not for WASP-69b, and searches for other molecules such as H$_2$S and CH$_4$ resulted in non-detections for both planets. By investigating the signal strength of injected synthetic models, we constrained which atmospheric abundances and cloud deck pressures are consistent with our cross-correlation results. In addition, we show that a retrieval-based approach leads to similar constraints of these parameters.</description>

      <title>EMPEROR I. Exoplanet MCMC parallel tempering for RV orbit retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present \texttt{EMPEROR}, an open-source Python framework designed for efficient exoplanet detection and characterisation with radial velocities (RV). \texttt{EMPEROR} integrates Dynamic Nested Sampling (DNS) and Adaptive Parallel Tempering (APT) Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), supporting multiple noise models such as Gaussian Processes (GPs) and Moving Averages (MA). The framework enables systematic model comparison using statistical metrics, including Bayesian evidence ($\ln{\mathcal{Z}}$) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), while providing automated, publish-ready visualisations. \texttt{EMPEROR} is evaluated across three distinct systems to assess its capabilities in different detection scenarios. Sampling performance, model selection, and the search for Earth-mass planets are evaluated in data for 51 Pegasi, HD 55693 and Barnard's Star (GJ 699). For 51 Pegasi, APT achieves an effective sampling increase over DNS by a factor 3.76, while retrieving tighter parameter estimates. For HD 55693 the stellar rotation $P_{\text{rot}}=29.72^{+0.01}_{-0.02}$ and magnetic cycle $P_{\text{mag}}=2557.0^{+70.1}_{-36.7}$ are recovered, while demonstrating the sensitivity of $\ln{\mathcal{Z}}$ to prior selection. For Barnard's star, several noise models are compared, and the confirmed planet parameters are successfully retrieved with all of them. The best model shows a period of 3.1536$\pm$0.0003~d, minimum mass of 0.38$\pm$0.03 M$_{\rm{\oplus}}$, and semi-major axis of 0.02315$\pm$0.00039~AU. Purely statistical inference might be insufficient on its own for robust exoplanet detection. Effective methodologies must integrate domain knowledge, heuristic criteria, and multi-faceted model comparisons. The versatility of \texttt{EMPEROR} in handling diverse noise structures, its systematic model selection, and its improved performance make it a valuable tool for RV exoplanetary studies.</description>

      <title>Multiplicity of stellar systems in the solar neighbourhood, wide binaries, and planet-hosting stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This doctoral thesis studies stellar multiplicity in the solar neighborhood (d &lt; 10 pc) and in systems hosting planets (d &lt; 100 pc). Using data from the Washington Double Star Catalogue, Gaia DR3, and a comprehensive literature review, it builds the most complete and homogeneous sample of multiple systems within 10 pc. Multiplicity and companion fractions are derived with reduced uncertainties, providing improved statistical reliability. The analysis of orbital periods from one day to millions of years shows that the log-normal cumulative distribution can be seen as a modern revision of \"Opik's law. A key contribution is the study of wide binaries ({\rho} &gt; 1000 arcsec) with Gaia DR3, expanding the known sample by over an order of magnitude and improving astrometric precision. Newly identified companions, including ultracool dwarfs at the M-L boundary and a hot white dwarf, refine the distinction between true binaries and unrelated young moving-group members. The thesis also explores the effect of multiplicity on exoplanetary systems within 100 pc. New stellar companions are found in known planetary systems, with separations for over 200 pairs and parameters compiled for 276 exoplanets. Compared to single-star systems, multiple systems host more massive, short-period, and high-eccentricity planets. About 22% of exoplanetary systems have stellar companions, with significant (&gt; 4 {\sigma}) correlations between high eccentricities and small projected separations, and a weaker (&gt; 2 {\sigma}) trend showing that massive planets (M &gt; 40 M_Earth) orbit closer in multiple systems. Finally, a review of Giovanni Battista Hodierna's 17th-century catalogues shows he compiled the first list of multiple systems over a century earlier than previously believed, advancing the understanding of stellar multiplicity and its influence on planetary formation.</description>

      <title>Upper Limits on Radio Emission from the K2-18 System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar and planetary magnetic fields play a crucial role in the habitability of a planet and the integrity of its atmosphere. The recently claimed detection of biosignatures, methane, carbon dioxide and dimethyl sulfide/disulfide, in the atmosphere of K2-18 b, a sub-Neptune orbiting an M dwarf star present an intriguing question regarding the stellar magnetic environment and the resistance of the planet's magnetosphere (if it exists) to erosion by magnetic activity from the host. To probe for radio emission from the system, we have conducted observations using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) at S, C and X-bands (2-4, 4.5-7.5 and 8-10 GHz respectively) to search for coherent and incoherent radio emission. We detect no radio emission associated with incoherent emission mechanisms. We report $3\sigma$ Stokes I upper limits of $49.8\ \mu\rm{Jybeam}^{-1}$ at S-band, $17.7\ \mu\rm{Jybeam}^{-1}$at C-band and $18.0\ \mu\rm{Jybeam}^{-1}$ at X-band and an upper limit of the ratio of the radio to the total bolometric luminosity of $\log L_\text{R}/\log L_\text{bol}&lt;-8.8$. We have also searched for short duration bursts associated with coherent emission mechanisms at C and X-bands . No signals above a $3\sigma$ significance threshold are detected. Although no signals are detected our radio observations offer constraints, albeit limited, on the stellar magnetic environment supporting recent X-ray observations indicating K2-18 is a very faint emitter. Our results also contextualise any planetary transmission spectra by providing constraints on the activity level of the host.</description>

      <title>On the Interpretation of Velocity Residuals in Protoplanetary Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a first-order analytical model for line-of-sight velocity residuals, defined as the difference between observed velocities and those predicted by a fiducial model, assuming a flared, nearly axisymmetric disk with the perturbations in disk surface height $\delta h(r)$, inclination $\delta i(r)$, and position angle $\delta\mathrm{PA}(r)$. Introducing projection-deprojection mapping between sky-plane and disk-frame coordinates, we demonstrate that the normalized velocity residuals exhibit Fourier components up to the third harmonic ($\sin3\phi$ and $\cos3\phi$). Moreover, we show that the radial profiles of $\delta h(r)$, $\delta i(r)$, and $\delta\mathrm{PA}(r)$ can be uniquely recovered from the data by solving a linear inverse problem. For comparison, we highlight factors that are not considered in previous models. We also outline how our framework can be extended beyond the first-order residuals and applied to additional observables, such as line intensities and widths.</description>

      <title>DiskMINT: Self-Consistent Thermochemical Disk Models with Radially Varying Gas and Dust -- Application to the Massive, CO-Rich Disk of IM Lup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Disks around young stars are the birthplaces of planets, and the spatial distribution of their gas and dust masses is critical for understanding where and what types of planets can form. We present self-consistent thermochemical disk models built with DiskMINT, which extends its initial framework to allow for spatially decoupled gas and dust distributions. DiskMINT calculates the gas temperature based on thermal equilibrium with dust grains, solves vertical gas hydrostatic equilibrium, and includes key processes for the CO chemistry, specifically selective photodissociation, and freeze-out with conversion CO/CO$_2$ ice. We apply DiskMINT to study the IM Lup disk, a large massive disk, yet with an inferred CO depletion of up to 100 based on earlier thermochemical models. By fitting the multi-wavelength SED along with the millimeter continuum, ${\rm C^{18}O}$ radial emission profiles, we find $0.02-0.08\,{\rm M_\odot}$ for the gas disk mass, which are consistent with the dynamical-based mass within the uncertainties. We further compare the derived surface densities for dust and gas and find that the outer disk is drift-dominated, with a dust-to-gas mass ratio of approximately 0.01-0.02, which is likely insufficient to meet the conditions for the streaming instability to occur. Our results suggest that when interpreted with self-consistent thermochemical models, ${\rm C^{18}O}$ alone can serve as a reliable tracer of both the total gas mass and its radial distribution. This approach enables gas mass estimates in lower-mass disks, where dynamical constraints are not available, and in fainter systems where rare species like ${\rm N_2H^+}$ are too weak to detect.</description>

      <title>Not All Sub-Neptune Exoplanets Have Magma Oceans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The evolution and structure of sub-Neptunes may be strongly influenced by interactions between the outer gaseous envelope of the planet and a surface magma ocean. However, given the wide variety of permissible interior structures of these planets, it is unclear whether conditions at the envelope-mantle boundary will always permit a molten silicate layer, or whether some sub-Neptunes might instead host a solid silicate surface. In this work, we use internal structure modeling to perform an extensive exploration of surface conditions within the sub-Neptune population across a range of bulk and atmospheric parameters. We find that a significant portion of the population may lack present-day magma oceans. In particular, planets with a high atmospheric mean molecular weight and large envelope mass fraction are likely to instead have a solid silicate surface, since the pressure at the envelope-mantle boundary is high enough that the silicates will be in solid post-perovskite phase. This result is particularly relevant given recent inferences of high-mean molecular weight atmospheres from JWST observations of several sub-Neptunes. We apply this approach to a number of sub-Neptunes with existing or upcoming JWST observations, and find that in almost all cases, a range of solutions exist which do not possess a present-day magma ocean. Our analysis provides critical context for interpreting sub-Neptunes and their atmospheres.</description>

      <title>Estimating Orbital Parameters of Direct Imaging Exoplanet Using Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a new flow-matching Markov chain Monte Carlo (FM-MCMC) algorithm for estimating the orbital parameters of exoplanetary systems, especially for those only one exoplanet is involved. Compared to traditional methods that rely on random sampling within the Bayesian framework, our approach first leverages flow matching posterior estimation (FMPE) to efficiently constrain the prior range of physical parameters, and then employs MCMC to accurately infer the posterior distribution. For example, in the orbital parameter inference of beta Pictoris b, our model achieved a substantial speed-up while maintaining comparable accuracy-running 77.8 times faster than Parallel Tempered MCMC (PTMCMC) and 365.4 times faster than nested sampling. Moreover, our FM-MCMC method also attained the highest average log-likelihood among all approaches, demonstrating its superior sampling efficiency and accuracy. This highlights the scalability and efficiency of our approach, making it well-suited for processing the massive datasets expected from future exoplanet surveys. Beyond astrophysics, our methodology establishes a versatile paradigm for synergizing deep generative models with traditional sampling, which can be adopted to tackle complex inference problems in other fields, such as cosmology, biomedical imaging, and particle physics.</description>

      <title>Wind-AE: A Fast, Open-source 1D Photoevaporation Code with Metal and Multi-frequency X-ray Capabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Throughout their lives, short period exoplanets (&lt;100 days) experience X-ray and extreme-UV (XUV) stellar irradiation that can heat and photoionize planets' upper atmospheres, driving transonic outflows. This photoevaporative mass loss plays a role in both evolution and observed demographics; however, mass loss rates are not currently directly observable and can only be inferred from models. To that end, we present an open-source fast 1D, XUV multi-frequency, multispecies, steady-state, hydrodynamic Parker Wind photoevaporation relaxation model based on Murray-Clay et al. (2009,arXiv:0811.0006). The model can move smoothly between high and low flux regimes and accepts custom multi-frequency stellar spectra. While the inclusion of high-energy X-rays increases mass loss rates ($\dot{M}$), metals decrease $\dot{M}$, and the net result for a typical hot Jupiter is a similar $\dot{M}$, but a hotter, faster, and more gradually ionized wind. We find that mulitfrequency photons (e.g., 13.6-2000eV) are absorbed over a broader range of heights in the atmosphere resulting in a wind-launch radius, $R_{XUV}$, that is of order 10 nanobars for all but the highest surface gravity planets. Grids of H/He solar metallicity atmospheres reveal that, for typical hot Jupiters like HD 209458b, $R_{XUV}$~1.1-1.8$R_P$ for low-fluxes, meaning that the energy-limited mass loss rate, $\dot{M}_{Elim}(R)$, computed at $R=R_P$ is a good approximation. However, for planets with low escape velocities, like many sub-Neptunes and super-Earths, $R_{XUV}$ can be &gt;&gt;$R_P$, making it necessary to use $\dot{M}_{Elim}(R=R_{XUV})$ to avoid significantly underestimating mass loss rates. For both high escape velocities and large incident fluxes, radiative cooling is significant and energy-limited mass loss overestimates $\dot{M}$.</description>

      <title>Computing the Full Earth System at 1 km Resolution</title>

Abstract: We present the first-ever global simulation of the full Earth system at 1.25 km grid spacing, achieving highest time compression with an unseen number of degrees of freedom. Our model captures the flow of energy, water, and carbon through key components of the Earth system: atmosphere, ocean, and land. To achieve this landmark simulation, we harness the power of 8192 GPUs on Alps and 20480 GPUs on JUPITER, two of the world's largest GH200 superchip installations. We use both the Grace CPUs and Hopper GPUs by carefully balancing Earth's components in a heterogeneous setup and optimizing acceleration techniques available in ICON's codebase. We show how separation of concerns can reduce the code complexity by half while increasing performance and portability. Our achieved time compression of 145.7 simulated days per day enables long studies including full interactions in the Earth system and even outperforms earlier atmosphere-only simulations at a similar resolution.</description>
