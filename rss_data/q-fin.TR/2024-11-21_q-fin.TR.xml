      <title>A Survey of Financial AI: Architectures, Advances and Open Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Financial AI empowers sophisticated approaches to financial market forecasting, portfolio optimization, and automated trading. This survey provides a systematic analysis of these developments across three primary dimensions: predictive models that capture complex market dynamics, decision-making frameworks that optimize trading and investment strategies, and knowledge augmentation systems that leverage unstructured financial information. We examine significant innovations including foundation models for financial time series, graph-based architectures for market relationship modeling, and hierarchical frameworks for portfolio optimization. Analysis reveals crucial trade-offs between model sophistication and practical constraints, particularly in high-frequency trading applications. We identify critical gaps and open challenges between theoretical advances and industrial implementation, outlining open challenges and opportunities for improving both model performance and practical applicability.</description>

      <title>FinBERT-BiLSTM: A Deep Learning Model for Predicting Volatile Cryptocurrency Market Prices Using Market Sentiment Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series forecasting is a key tool in financial markets, helping to predict asset prices and guide investment decisions. In highly volatile markets, such as cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), forecasting becomes more difficult due to extreme price fluctuations driven by market sentiment, technological changes, and regulatory shifts. Traditionally, forecasting relied on statistical methods, but as markets became more complex, deep learning models like LSTM, Bi-LSTM, and the newer FinBERT-LSTM emerged to capture intricate patterns. Building upon recent advancements and addressing the volatility inherent in cryptocurrency markets, we propose a hybrid model that combines Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) networks with FinBERT to enhance forecasting accuracy for these assets. This approach fills a key gap in forecasting volatile financial markets by blending advanced time series models with sentiment analysis, offering valuable insights for investors and analysts navigating unpredictable markets.</description>

      <title>Supervised Autoencoders with Fractionally Differentiated Features and Triple Barrier Labelling Enhance Predictions on Noisy Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the enhancement of financial time series forecasting with the use of neural networks through supervised autoencoders (SAE), to improve investment strategy performance. Using the Sharpe and Information Ratios, it specifically examines the impact of noise augmentation and triple barrier labeling on risk-adjusted returns. The study focuses on Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum as the traded assets from January 1, 2016, to April 30, 2022. Findings indicate that supervised autoencoders, with balanced noise augmentation and bottleneck size, significantly boost strategy effectiveness. However, excessive noise and large bottleneck sizes can impair performance.</description>

      <title>Simulating Liquidity: Agent-Based Modeling of Illiquid Markets for Fractional Ownership</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research investigates liquidity dynamics in fractional ownership markets, focusing on illiquid alternative investments traded on a FinTech platform. By leveraging empirical data and employing agent-based modeling (ABM), the study simulates trading behaviors in sell offer-driven systems, providing a foundation for generating insights into how different market structures influence liquidity. The ABM-based simulation model provides a data augmentation environment which allows for the exploration of diverse trading architectures and rules, offering an alternative to direct experimentation. This approach bridges academic theory and practical application, supported by collaboration with industry and Swiss federal funding. The paper lays the foundation for planned extensions, including the identification of a liquidity-maximizing trading environment and the design of a market maker, by simulating the current functioning of the investment platform using an ABM specified with empirical data.</description>

      <title>Learning the Market: Sentiment-Based Ensemble Trading Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose and study the integration of sentiment analysis and deep reinforcement learning ensemble algorithms for stock trading by evaluating strategies capable of dynamically altering their active agent given the concurrent market environment. In particular, we design a simple-yet-effective method for extracting financial sentiment and combine this with improvements on existing trading agents, resulting in a strategy that effectively considers both qualitative market factors and quantitative stock data. We show that our approach results in a strategy that is profitable, robust, and risk-minimal - outperforming the traditional ensemble strategy as well as single agent algorithms and market metrics. Our findings suggest that the conventional practice of switching and reevaluating agents in ensemble every fixed-number of months is sub-optimal, and that a dynamic sentiment-based framework greatly unlocks additional performance. Furthermore, as we have designed our algorithm with simplicity and efficiency in mind, we hypothesize that the transition of our method from historical evaluation towards real-time trading with live data to be relatively simple.</description>
