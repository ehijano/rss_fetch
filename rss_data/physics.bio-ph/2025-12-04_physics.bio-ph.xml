      <title>A novel multiscale modelling for the hemodynamics in retinal microcirculation with an analytic solution for the capillary-tissue coupled system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mathematical modelling of the microcirculatory hemodynamics in the retina is an essential tool for understanding various diseases of the retina, yet remains challenging due to the multiscale nature of the retinal vasculature and its coupling to surrounding tissue. To address this, we develop a multiscale model that couples retinal vasculature across scales with interstitial tissue. Our model combines the one-dimensional (1D) model for arteries and veins with the coupled Darcy equations for capillaries and tissue. The model uses an analytic solution for capillary-tissue coupled system that provides a simple interpretation of the results along with much faster computation. The analytic solution implies a dynamic coupling condition that links the capillary bed with upstream arterial and downstream venous flows. The model is mathematically robust, demonstrated through analysis of the solution's truncation error and convergence. Its predictive accuracy is verified against experimental data and other models, making it useful in interpreting experimental results. Finally, the role of various parameters in controlling retinal hemodynamics is explored.</description>

      <title>V-Reactor Dynamics: Dual Chaotic System and Rewriting the Antiviral Response History</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic revealed a key vulnerability: our failure to anticipate novel viral threats. Moving beyond descriptive virology, we introduce V-Reactor Dynamics (V-Dynamics), a physics-based framework modeling host-virus interaction as a synchronized dual chaotic system. This paradigm predicts viral evolution, immune response, transmission, and virulence through equations governed by the parameter reactivity ($\rho$). It quantifies infection phases, peak ($\rho&gt;0$), plateau ($\rho\approx0$), clearance ($\rho&lt;0$), transmission, and modality via $\rho/\ell$ (Reactivity/Generation time). Retrospectively, it correctly predicted SARS-CoV-2's higher transmissibility versus SARS-CoV's lethality and forecasted Omicron waves, exposing the lockdown-socioeconomic cost trade-off. We introduce measurable constants, viral replication, immune evasion, and drug absorption cross sections, derived from in vitro virion interactions. These quantum mechanical analogues relate to $\rho$ and $\ell$, enabling pre-outbreak predictive surveillance.V-Dynamics reveals a duality: microscopic chaos in viral production and macroscopic chaos in population transmission, linked by a scaling law. The sign of $\rho$, tied to the Lyapunov Exponent, dictates pandemic trajectory ($\rho&gt;0$ for outbreak, $\rho&lt;0$ for termination), offering a control mechanism. By unifying kinetics, cross-scale dynamics, and chaos theory, this framework provides a quantitative roadmap to preempt future pandemics.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Active Matter in Incompressible Fluid Membranes</title>

Abstract: Active proteins and membrane-bound motors exert force dipole flows along fluid interfaces and lipid bilayers. We develop a unified hydrodynamic and Hamiltonian framework for the interactions of pusher and puller dipoles embedded in an incompressible two-dimensional membrane supported by a shallow viscous subphase. Beginning from the screened Stokes equations of the membrane--subphase composite, we derive the real-space incompressible Green's tensor, obtain its near- and far-field asymptotics, and construct the resulting dipolar velocity and stream functions. Although generic dipoles reorient under the local membrane vorticity, we show that the far-field dipolar flow is vorticity-free; force-free motors therefore retain fixed orientation and obey a Hamiltonian dynamics in which the positions of $N$ dipoles evolve via an effective Hamiltonian built from the dipolar stream function. In the near field, where the flow possesses finite vorticity, a Hamiltonian formulation is recovered in the quenched-orientation limit. Exploiting this structure, we simulate ensembles of pusher and puller dipoles and compare the dynamics generated by the $1/r$ near-field kernel and the subphase screened $1/r^{3}$ far-field kernel. For identical dipoles, the far-field Hamiltonian produces rapid clustering from random initial conditions, whereas the near-field Hamiltonian suppresses collapse and yields extended, non-aggregating configurations.</description>

      <title>Miniature work-to-work converter engine powered by motor protein</title>

Abstract: Designing a miniature microscale engine that can override the role of thermal fluctuations has remained elusive and is an important open challenge. Here we provide the design and theoretical framework for a unique information-based engine - a work-to-work converter - comprising a sub-micron size bead and motor protein-microtubule (MT) complex in an optical trap setup. We demonstrate how by implementing a simple motor protein state-dependent feedback protocol of the optical trap stiffness, this engine is able to harness and convert the movement of a motor protein into work output. Unlike other conventional microengines, the fidelity and performance of this engine is determined by the stochasticity of motor (un)binding characteristics. We obtain an analytical form of the work distribution function, average work output and average power output, providing quantitative predictions for engine performance which are validated by stochastic simulations. Remarkably, the average work output per cycle is at least an order of magnitude higher than the thermal fluctuations and supersedes the performance of other microscale engines realized so far.</description>

      <title>Genesis of Horizontal Electric Field in Bilayer Hydrophobic Core</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15637v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For over a century, the electric field of biological membranes has been regarded as a one-dimensional quantity, defined solely by the component normal to the bilayer (E_VERT). Here, we challenge this conventional view by developing a device that generates a horizontal electric field within the hydrophobic core of a lipid bilayer (E_HORZ). The device incorporates micrometre-scale electrodes embedded within the bilayer's torus, enabling the steady generation of E_HORZ. Applied E_HORZ selectively and reversibly accelerates the slow inactivation of a voltage-gated potassium channel, while leaving activation essentially unchanged. Physical considerations reveal that E_HORZ naturally arises wherever membrane potential varies spatially, such as at the wavefront of an action potential, implying that it is inherent to many physiological processes. This E_HORZ system provides experimental access to fully three-dimensional membrane electric fields, revealing previously overlooked dimension of membrane bioelectricity.</description>

      <title>Invariance under Structure Translation as the Origin of Host Immune Capacity Conservation from Noether's Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02730v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The capacity to resist pathogens is recognized as a fundamental property of the immune system, yet it remains a phenomenological concept and lacks a defined physical basis, leaving its fundamental entity, definition, and quantification unresolved. Here, we address these questions by introducing a theoretical framework based on Lagrangian analytical mechanics, which recasts immune recognition as a dynamical system in an immunological state space. Generalized coordinates are used to describe the conformational states of immune receptors, and their evolution is governed by Euler-Lagrange equations constructed from the antigen-receptor interaction. Central to our theory is the identification of a continuous symmetry: the action remains invariant under specific translations within the antigenic structure space. From this symmetry, Noether's theorem dictates a conserved quantity, I. We identify this conserved quantity as the physical embodiment of host immunity, a measurable quantity that encapsulates the system's protective capacity, encompassing both its breadth and intensity. This prediction is testable through statistically indistinguishable responses to antigen pairs related by the symmetry transformation. Furthermore, This theoretical model provides a unified framework for understanding key immunological phenomena, including vaccination, immune memory, tolerance, original antigenic sin, and T cell exhaustion. The conserved quantity I comprises a component quantifying protective breadth (with the dimension of action) and a component governing response intensity (with the dimension of energy), is thus established as a fundamental physical entity. This work transforms immune capacity from a phenomenological concept into a quantifiable entity, thereby establishing a foundational framework for predictive immunology and immunological intervention.</description>

      <title>ConfRover: Simultaneous Modeling of Protein Conformation and Dynamics via Autoregression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding protein dynamics is critical for elucidating their biological functions. The increasing availability of molecular dynamics (MD) data enables the training of deep generative models to efficiently explore the conformational space of proteins. However, existing approaches either fail to explicitly capture the temporal dependencies between conformations or do not support direct generation of time-independent samples. To address these limitations, we introduce ConfRover, an autoregressive model that simultaneously learns protein conformation and dynamics from MD trajectories, supporting both time-dependent and time-independent sampling. At the core of our model is a modular architecture comprising: (i) an encoding layer, adapted from protein folding models, that embeds protein-specific information and conformation at each time frame into a latent space; (ii) a temporal module, a sequence model that captures conformational dynamics across frames; and (iii) an SE(3) diffusion model as the structure decoder, generating conformations in continuous space. Experiments on ATLAS, a large-scale protein MD dataset of diverse structures, demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in learning conformational dynamics and supporting a wide range of downstream tasks. ConfRover is the first model to sample both protein conformations and trajectories within a single framework, offering a novel and flexible approach for learning from protein MD data.
