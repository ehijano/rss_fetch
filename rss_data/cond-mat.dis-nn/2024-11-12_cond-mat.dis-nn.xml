      <title>Exploring Structural Nonlinearity in Binary Polariton-Based Neuromorphic Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the performance of a binarized neuromorphic network leveraging polariton dyads, optically excited pairs of interfering polariton condensates within a microcavity to function as binary logic gate neurons. Employing numerical simulations, we explore various neuron configurations, both linear (NAND, NOR) and nonlinear (XNOR), to assess their effectiveness in image classification tasks. We demonstrate that structural nonlinearity, derived from the network's layout, plays a crucial role in facilitating complex computational tasks, effectively reducing the reliance on the inherent nonlinearity of individual neurons. Our findings suggest that the network's configuration and the interaction among its elements can emulate the benefits of nonlinearity, thus potentially simplifying the design and manufacturing of neuromorphic systems and enhancing their scalability. This shift in focus from individual neuron properties to network architecture could lead to significant advancements in the efficiency and applicability of neuromorphic computing.</description>

      <title>Short-range depinning in the presence of velocity-weakening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phenomena including friction and earthquakes are complicated by the joint presence of disorder and non-linear instabilites, such as those triggered by the presence of velocity weakening. In [de Geus and Wyart, Phys. Rev. E 106, 065001 (2022)], we provided a theory for the nucleation of flow and the magnitude of hysteresis, building on recent results on disorder-free systems described by so called rate-and-state descriptions of the frictional interface, and treating disorder perturbatively. This theory was tested for models of frictional interfaces, where long range elastic interactions are present. Here we test it for short-range depinning, and confirm that (i) nucleation is triggered by avalanches, governed by a critical point at some threshold force $f_c$ close to the minimum of the flow curve and that (ii) due to an armouring mechanism by which the elastic manifold displays very little plasticity after a big slip event, very slowly decaying finite size effects dominate the hysteresis magnitude, with an exponent we can relate to other observables.</description>

      <title>Hidden self-duality in quasiperiodic network models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobility edges (MEs), which separate the extended phases from the localized phases, are one of the most crucial concepts in Anderson localization. In one-dimensional quasiperiodic systems, only a few models with exact MEs can be constructed using the generalized self-dual theory, the Avila's global theory, or the renormalization groups method. Then, an intriguing question is that can we realize much more physical models with exact solvable MEs? Here we uncover the hidden self-duality in a class of quasiperiodic network models constituted by periodic sites and quasiperiodic sites. While the original models do not have self-duality, after integrating out the periodic sites, the effective Hamiltonian with energy dependent potentials will have this duality, yielding MEs. The mosaic models studied in the literature are the simplest quasiperiodic netowork models. For a long time the MEs in these models are believed to come from the absent of self-duality, and we show that they actually come from the hidden self-duality. Finally, we extend this idea to more network models and explicitly determine their exact MEs with the hidden duality. The predictions in these models can be realized using optical and acoustic waveguide arrays and electric circuits in experiments. The new models presented in this work can greatly advance our understanding of MEs in Anderson transition.</description>

      <title>A Finite-Element Model Showing Increased Carrier Mobility in Downscaled Amorphous Semiconductors for Flexible Microprocessors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is shown that the carrier mobilities of amorphous semiconductors can be significantly increased through device downscaling without material-level optimization. This is based on a recently published scalable finite-element model for amorphous semiconductors. Using hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) in an ideal field effect transistor (FET) as an example, the intrinsic DC electron mobility at room temperature is estimated to increase by a factor of at least 8.33 when the channel length is decreased to 10 nm. Keeping a sufficient channel width ensures device-to-device (D2D) uniformity. The simulation is based on the multiple trapping and release (MTR) theory in combination with statistical equivalent analyses. The increased mobility is attributed to the short channel length relative to the characteristic length scale of band fluctuation that is determined by the medium-range order of the material. This paper may inspire the development of next-generation high-density, high-speed, flexible microprocessors based on low-cost amorphous semiconductors for Internet of Things devices.</description>

      <title>A fast transferable method for predicting the glass transition temperature of polymers from chemical structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new method that successfully predicts the glass transition temperature $T_{\! \textrm{g}}$ of polymers based on their monomer structure. The model combines ideas from Group Additive Properties (GAP) and Quantitative Structure Property Relationship (QSPR) methods, where GAP (or Group Contributions) assumes that sub-monomer motifs contribute additively to $T_{\! \textrm{g}}$, and QSPR links $T_{\! \textrm{g}}$ to the physico-chemical properties of the structure through a set of molecular descriptors. This method yields fast and accurate predictions of $T_{\! \textrm{g}}$ for polymers based on chemical motifs outside the data sample, which resolves the main limitation of the GAP approach. Using a genetic algorithm, we show that only two molecular descriptors are necessary to predict $T_{\! \textrm{g}}$ for PAEK polymers. Our QSPR-GAP method is readily transferred to other physical properties, to measures of activity (QSAR), or to different classes of polymers such as conjugated or bio-polymers.</description>

      <title>A Fully Analog Pipeline for Portfolio Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Portfolio optimization is a ubiquitous problem in financial mathematics that relies on accurate estimates of covariance matrices for asset returns. However, estimates of pairwise covariance could be better and calculating time-sensitive optimal portfolios is energy-intensive for digital computers. We present an energy-efficient, fast, and fully analog pipeline for solving portfolio optimization problems that overcomes these limitations. The analog paradigm leverages the fundamental principles of physics to recover accurate optimal portfolios in a two-step process. Firstly, we utilize equilibrium propagation, an analog alternative to backpropagation, to train linear autoencoder neural networks to calculate low-rank covariance matrices. Then, analog continuous Hopfield networks output the minimum variance portfolio for a given desired expected return. The entire efficient frontier may then be recovered, and an optimal portfolio selected based on risk appetite.</description>

      <title>Persistence of vortexlike phase fluctuations in underdoped to heavily overdoped Bi-2201 cuprates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mechanism that controls the superconducting (SC) transition temperature $T_{\mathrm{c}}^{0}$ as a function of doping is one of the central questions in cuprate high-temperature superconductors. While it is generally accepted that $T_{\mathrm{c}}^{0}$ in underdoped cuprates is not determined by the scale of pairing but by the onset of global phase coherence, the role of phase fluctuations in the overdoped region has been controversial. Here, our transport measurements in perpendicular magnetic fields ($H$) on underdoped Bi-2201 reveal immeasurably small Hall response for $T&gt;T_{\mathrm{c}}(H)$ as a signature of SC phase with vortexlike phase fluctuations. We find that the extent of such a regime in $T$ and $H$ is suppressed near optimal doping but becomes strongly enhanced in heavily overdoped Bi-2201. Our results thus show that vortexlike phase fluctuations play an important role in the field-tuned SC transition in the heavily overdoped region, in contrast to conventional mean-field Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer description. The unexpected nonmonotonic dependence of phase fluctuations on doping provides a new perspective on the SC transition in cuprates.</description>

      <title>Identifying the impact of local connectivity patterns on dynamics in excitatory-inhibitory networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Networks of excitatory and inhibitory (EI) neurons form a canonical circuit in the brain. Seminal theoretical results on dynamics of such networks are based on the assumption that synaptic strengths depend on the type of neurons they connect, but are otherwise statistically independent. Recent synaptic physiology datasets however highlight the prominence of specific connectivity patterns that go well beyond what is expected from independent connections. While decades of influential research have demonstrated the strong role of the basic EI cell type structure, to which extent additional connectivity features influence dynamics remains to be fully determined. Here we examine the effects of pairwise connectivity motifs on the linear dynamics in EI networks using an analytical framework that approximates the connectivity in terms of low-rank structures. This low-rank approximation is based on a mathematical derivation of the dominant eigenvalues of the connectivity matrix and predicts the impact on responses to external inputs of connectivity motifs and their interactions with cell-type structure. Our results reveal that a particular pattern of connectivity, chain motifs, have a much stronger impact on dominant eigenmodes than other pairwise motifs. An overrepresentation of chain motifs induces a strong positive eigenvalue in inhibition-dominated networks and generates a potential instability that requires revisiting the classical excitation-inhibition balance criteria. Examining effects of external inputs, we show that chain motifs can on their own induce paradoxical responses where an increased input to inhibitory neurons leads to a decrease in their activity due to the recurrent feedback. These findings have direct implications for the interpretation of experiments in which responses to optogenetic perturbations are measured and used to infer the dynamical regime of cortical circuits.</description>

      <title>Autoregressive neural quantum states of Fermi Hubbard models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural quantum states (NQS) have emerged as a powerful ansatz for variational quantum Monte Carlo studies of strongly-correlated systems. Here, we apply recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and autoregressive transformer neural networks to the Fermi-Hubbard and the (non-Hermitian) Hatano-Nelson-Hubbard models in one and two dimensions. In both cases, we observe that the convergence of the RNN ansatz is challenged when increasing the interaction strength. We present a physically-motivated and easy-to-implement strategy for improving the optimization, namely, by ramping of the model parameters. Furthermore, we investigate the advantages and disadvantages of the autoregressive sampling property of both network architectures. For the Hatano-Nelson-Hubbard model, we identify convergence issues that stem from the autoregressive sampling scheme in combination with the non-Hermitian nature of the model. Our findings provide insights into the challenges of the NQS approach and make the first step towards exploring strongly-correlated electrons using this ansatz.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models exhibit robust generative properties by approximating the underlying distribution of a dataset and synthesizing data by sampling from the approximated distribution. In this work, we explore how the generative performance may be be modulated if noise sources with temporal correlations -- akin to those used in the field of active matter -- are used for the destruction of the data in the forward process. Our numerical and analytical experiments suggest that the corresponding reverse process may exhibit improved generative properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07232v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel neuromorphic network architecture based on a lattice of exciton-polariton condensates, intricately interconnected and energized through non-resonant optical pumping. The network employs a binary framework, where each neuron, facilitated by the spatial coherence of pairwise coupled condensates, performs binary operations. This coherence, emerging from the ballistic propagation of polaritons, ensures efficient, network-wide communication. The binary neuron switching mechanism, driven by the nonlinear repulsion through the excitonic component of polaritons, offers computational efficiency and scalability advantages over continuous weight neural networks. Our network enables parallel processing, enhancing computational speed compared to sequential or pulse-coded binary systems. The system's performance was evaluated using diverse datasets, including the MNIST dataset for image recognition and the Speech Commands dataset for voice recognition tasks. In both scenarios, the proposed system demonstrates the potential to outperform existing polaritonic neuromorphic systems. For image recognition, this is evidenced by an impressive predicted classification accuracy of up to 97.5%. In voice recognition, the system achieved a classification accuracy of about 68\% for the ten-class subset, surpassing the performance of conventional benchmark, the Hidden Markov Model with Gaussian Mixture Model.</description>

      <title>Meta-plasticity and memory in multi-level recurrent feed-forward networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Network systems can exhibit memory effects in which the interactions between different pairs of nodes adapt in time, leading to the emergence of preferred connections, patterns, and sub-networks. To a first approximation, this memory can be modelled through a ``plastic'' Hebbian or homophily mechanism, in which edges get reinforced proportionally to the amount of information flowing through them. However, recent studies on glia-neuron networks have highlighted how memory can evolve due to more complex dynamics, including multi-level network structures and ``meta-plastic'' effects that modulate reinforcement. Inspired by those systems, here we develop a simple and general model for the dynamics of an adaptive network with an additional meta-plastic mechanism that varies the rate of Hebbian strengthening of its edge connections. The meta-plastic term acts on a second network level in which edges are grouped together, simulating local, longer time-scale effects. Specifically, we consider a biased random walk on a cyclic feed-forward network. The random walk chooses its steps according to the weights of the network edges. The weights evolve through a Hebbian mechanism modulated by a meta-plastic reinforcement, biasing the walker to prefer edges that have been already explored. We study the dynamical emergence (memorisation) of preferred paths and their retrieval and identify three regimes: one dominated by the Hebbian term, one in which the meta-reinforcement drives memory formation, and a balanced one. We show that, in the latter two regimes, meta-reinforcement allows the retrieval of a previously stored path even after the weights have been reset to zero to erase Hebbian memory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18559v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Eigenstate multifractality, a hallmark of non-interacting disordered metals which can potentially be observed in many-body localized states as well, is characterized by anomalous slow dynamics and appears relevant for many areas of quantum physics from measurement-driven systems to superconductivity. We propose a novel approach to achieve non-ergodic multifractal (NEM) states without disorder by iteratively introducing defects into a crystal lattice, reshaping it from a plain structure into fractal geometry. By comprehensive analysis of the Sierpi\'nski gasket case, we find a robust evidence of the emergence of NEM states that go beyond the conventional classification of quantum states and designate new pathways for quantum transport studies. We discuss potential experimental signatures of these states.</description>

      <title>The Overlap Gap Property limits limit swapping in QAOA</title>

Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a quantum algorithm designed for Combinatorial Optimization Problem (COP). We show that if a local algorithm is limited in performance at logarithmic depth for a spin glass type COP with an underlying Erd\"os--R\'enyi hypergraph, then a random regular hypergraph exhibits it as well. As such, we re-derived the fact that the average-case value obtained by QAOA for the Max-$q$-XORSAT for even $q\ge 4$ is bounded away from optimality even when the algorithm runs indefinitely if optimised using the so-called tree parameters due to the presence of the Overlap Gap Property (OGP). While this result was proven before, the proof is rather technical compared to ours. In addition, we show that the earlier result implicitly also implies limitation at logarithmic depth $p \le \epsilon \log n$ providing an improvement over limitation at superconstant depth. Lastly, the results suggests that even when sub-optimised, the performance of QAOA on spin glass is equal in performance to classical algorithms in solving the mean field spin glass problem providing further evidence that the conjecture of getting the exact solution under limit swapping for the Sherrington--Kirkpatrick model to be true.</description>

Abstract: Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) using an annealing-based approach involves solving generalized eigenvalue problems. Discretizing a PDE yields a system of linear equations (SLE). Solving an SLE can be formulated as a general eigenvalue problem, which can be transformed into an optimization problem with an objective function given by a generalized Rayleigh quotient. The proposed algorithm requires iterative computations. However, it enables efficient annealing-based computation of eigenvectors to arbitrary precision without increasing the number of variables. Investigations using simulated annealing demonstrate how the number of iterations scales with system size and annealing time. Computational performance depends on system size, annealing time, and problem characteristics.</description>
