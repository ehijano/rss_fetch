      <title>Investigating the Relationship between Simulation Parameters and Flow Variables in Simulating Atmospheric Gravity Waves in Wind Energy Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wind farms, particularly offshore clusters, are becoming larger than ever before. Besides influencing wind farms and local meteorology downstream, large wind farms can trigger atmospheric gravity waves in the inversion layer and the free atmosphere aloft. Wind farm-induced gravity waves can cause adverse pressure gradients upstream of the wind farm, that contribute to the global blockage effect, and favorable pressure gradients above and downstream of the wind farm that enhance wake recovery.
  Numerical modeling is a powerful means of studying wind farm-induced atmospheric gravity waves, but it comes with the challenge of handling spurious reflections of these waves from domain boundaries. Approaches like radiation boundary conditions and forcing zones are used to avoid the reflections. However, the simulation setup heavily relies on ad-hoc processes. For instance, the widely used Rayleigh damping method requires ad-hoc tuning to acquire a setup only applicable to a particular case. To surmount this hurdle, we conduct a systematic LES study for flow over a 2D hill and through wind farm canopies that explores the dependence of domain size and damping layer setup on parameters driving linearly stratified atmospheric flows.
  Mainly the internal waves in the free atmosphere reflect from the boundaries, therefore by simulation linearly stratified conditions we focus on internal waves only. The Froude number drives most of the internal wave properties, such as wavelengths, amplitude, and direction. Therefore, the domain sizing and Rayleigh damping layer setup mainly depends on the Froude number. We anticipated the effective wavelengths to be the correct length scale to size the domain and damping layer thickness. Also, the damping coefficient is scaled with Brunt-V\"ais\"al\"a frequency.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Machine Learning for Weather and Climate Prediction: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advanced machine learning models have recently achieved high predictive accuracy for weather and climate prediction. However, these complex models often lack inherent transparency and interpretability, acting as "black boxes" that impede user trust and hinder further model improvements. As such, interpretable machine learning techniques have become crucial in enhancing the credibility and utility of weather and climate modeling. In this survey, we review current interpretable machine learning approaches applied to meteorological predictions. We categorize methods into two major paradigms: 1) Post-hoc interpretability techniques that explain pre-trained models, such as perturbation-based, game theory based, and gradient-based attribution methods. 2) Designing inherently interpretable models from scratch using architectures like tree ensembles and explainable neural networks. We summarize how each technique provides insights into the predictions, uncovering novel meteorological relationships captured by machine learning. Lastly, we discuss research challenges around achieving deeper mechanistic interpretations aligned with physical principles, developing standardized evaluation benchmarks, integrating interpretability into iterative model development workflows, and providing explainability for large foundation models.</description>

      <title>A Constrained Spectral Approximation of Subgrid-Scale Orography on Unstructured Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The representation of subgrid-scale orography is a challenge in the physical parameterization of orographic gravity-wave sources in weather forecasting. A significant hurdle is encoding as much physical information with as simple a representation as possible. Other issues include scale awareness, i.e., the orographic representation has to change according to the grid cell size and usability on unstructured geodesic grids with non-quadrilateral grid cells. This work introduces a novel spectral analysis method approximating a scale-aware spectrum of subgrid-scale orography on unstructured geodesic grids. The dimension of the physical orographic data is reduced by more than two orders of magnitude in its spectral representation. Simultaneously, the power of the approximated spectrum is close to the physical value. The method is based on well-known least-squares spectral analyses. However, it is robust to the choice of the free parameters, and tuning the algorithm is generally unnecessary. Numerical experiments involving an idealized setup show that this novel spectral analysis performs significantly better than a straightforward least-squares spectral analysis in representing the physical energy of a spectrum. Studies involving real-world topographic data are conducted, and reasonable error scores within $\pm 10\%$ error relative to the maximum physical quantity of interest are achieved across different grid sizes and background wind speeds. The deterministic behavior of the method is investigated along with its principal capabilities and potential biases, and it is shown that the error scores can be iteratively improved if an optimization target is known. Discussions on the method's limitations and broader applicability conclude this work.</description>

      <title>Environmental monitoring using orbital angular momentum mode decomposition enhanced machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atmospheric interaction with light has been an area of fascination for many researchers over the last century. Environmental conditions, such as temperature and wind speed, heavily influence the complex and rapidly varying optical distortions propagating optical fields experience. The continuous random phase fluctuations commonly make deciphering the exact origins of specific optical aberrations challenging. The generation of eddies is a major contributor to atmospheric turbulence, similar in geometric structure to optical vortices that sit at the centre of OAM beams. Decomposing the received optical fields into OAM provides a unique spatial similarity that can be used to analyse turbulent channels. In this work, we present a novel mode decomposition assisted machine learning approach that reveals trainable features in the distortions of vortex beams that allow for effective environmental monitoring. This novel technique can be used reliably with Support Vector Machine regression models to measure temperature variations of 0.49C and wind speed variations of 0.029 m/s over a 36m experimental turbulent free-space channels with controllable and verifiable temperature and wind speed with short 3s measurement. The predictable nature of these findings could indicate the presence of an underlying physical relationship between environmental conditions that lead to specific eddy formation and the OAM spiral spectra.</description>
