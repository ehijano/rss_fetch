      <title>Ramanujan's oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We aim to show that the dimensionless unit angular frequency of a certain mechanical oscillator is realized by a condition involving the Hardy-Ramanujan number 1729. This type of coupled oscillator can be called a Ramanujan's oscillator.</description>

      <title>A resource theoretical unification of Mpemba effects: classical and quantum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Mpemba effect originally referred to the observation that, under certain thermalizing dynamics, initially hotter samples can cool faster than colder ones. This effect has since been generalized to other anomalous relaxation behaviors even beyond classical domains, such as symmetry restoration in quantum systems. This work demonstrates that resource theories, widely employed in information theory, provide a unified organizing principle to frame Mpemba physics. We show how the conventional thermal Mpemba effect arises naturally from the resource theory of athermality, while its symmetry-restoring counterpart is fully captured by the resource theories of asymmetry. Leveraging the framework of modes of asymmetry, we demonstrate that the Mpemba effect due to symmetry restoration is governed by the initial overlap with the slowest symmetry-restoring mode -- mirroring the role of the slowest Liouvillian eigenmode in thermal Mpemba dynamics. Through this resource-theoretical formalism, we uncover the connection between these seemingly disparate effects and show that the dynamics of thermalization naturally splits into a symmetry-respecting and a symmetry-breaking term.</description>

      <title>A solvable microscopic model for the propagation of light in a dielectric medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17415v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work examines a dielectric medium consisting of small, polarizable classical atoms arranged on a cubic lattice. Using a regularized variant of the discrete dipole approximation method (DDA), we derive the solution for the propagation of light in this medium in the long wavelength limit. Under typical conditions, the atoms remain effectively stationary, but acquire momentum. The analytical solution is used to calculate the mechanical contribution to the signal momentum from the electromagnetic stress tensor, as well as from the Lorentz and Coulomb force. The results essentially agree with that of R. Peierls from 1976, and disagree with commonly accepted expressions. Experiments tend to support the conventional values. We paraphrase the solution of the discrepancy presented by Peierls in his 1976 work.</description>

      <title>Geodesics of charged particle in electromagnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14814v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report calculations about the motion of a charged particle in an external electric and magnetic field. The metric for the particle moving on a slope with non-zero traction and coefficient of friction is also evaluated for weak fields. We have geometric solutions in terms of Finsler geometry. We show that our solution metrics belong to the ({\alpha}, \b{eta})-metric class for cases with and without motion on a slope. Further, the external magnetic field is manifested in an additional parameter in the metric. The geodesic spray coefficients under the influence of magnetic field have also been calculated. Finally, we have estimated the indicatrices and geodesics for slippery plane and cone.</description>
