      <title>Theory of Nonequilibrium Crystallization and the Phase Diagram of Active Brownian Spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The crystallization of hard spheres at equilibrium is perhaps the most familiar example of an entropically-driven phase transition. In recent years, it has become clear that activity can dramatically alter this order-disorder transition in unexpected ways. The theoretical description of active crystallization has remained elusive as the traditional thermodynamic arguments that shape our understanding of passive freezing are inapplicable to active systems. Here, we develop a statistical mechanical description of the one-body density field and a nonconserved order parameter field that represents local crystalline order. We develop equations of state, guided by computer simulations, describing the crystallinity field which result in shifting the order-disorder transition to higher packing fractions with increasing activity. We then leverage our recent dynamical theory of coexistence to construct the full phase diagram of active Brownian spheres, quantitatively recapitulating both the solid-fluid and liquid-gas coexistence curves and the solid-liquid-gas triple point.</description>

      <title>Rough or crumpled: Strong coupling phases of a generalized Kardar-Parisi-Zhang surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a generalized Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation [D. Jana et al, Phys. Rev. E 109, L032104 (2024)], that sets the paradigm for universality in roughening of growing nonequilibrium surfaces without any conservation laws, but with competing local and nonlocal nonlinear effects. We show that such a generalized KPZ equation in two dimensions can describe a strong coupling rough or a crumpled surface, in addition to a weak coupling phase. The conformation fluctuations of such a rough surface are given by nonuniversal exponents, with orientational long-ranged order and positional short-ranged order, whereas the crumpled phase has positional and orientational short range order. Experimental and theoretical implications of these results are discussed.</description>

      <title>Occupation Uncertainty Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce occupation uncertainty relations (OURs) for dynamics of a Markov process over discrete configurations. Those are lower bounds on uncertainties of system observables that are time-integrated along stochastic trajectories. The uncertainty is defined as the ratio of the variance to the square of the average, with the latter necessarily shifted by the average in a reference distribution. The derived bounds are observable independent, but rely on the reference choice. We show, however, that all OURs originate from a matrix bound on correlations between times spent in different system configurations, i.e., occupation times. This result is reference independent, and expressed only in terms of stationary probability and lifetimes of individual configurations. Any dynamics that saturates the matrix bound, is optimal in approximating stationary distribution by occupation times; this always occurs for unidirectional cycles. Furthermore, using this bound, dynamic correlations can be asymptotically bounded in terms of static correlations, in turn leading to the positivity of dynamic exponents in the thermodynamic limit. While at a finite size the matrix bound generally saturates away from equilibrium, we demonstrate detailed-balance dynamics can still saturate it asymptotically, by leading to vanishing dynamic exponents and optimal simulations in that context.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Hamiltonian and effective temperature of non-Hermitian quantum spin ladders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17062v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement plays a crucial role not only in understanding Hermitian many-body systems but also in offering valuable insights into non-Hermitian quantum systems. In this paper, we analytically investigate the entanglement Hamiltonian and entanglement energy spectrum of a non-Hermitian spin ladder using perturbation theory in the biorthogonal basis. Specifically, we examine the entanglement properties between coupled non-Hermitian quantum spin chains. In the strong coupling limit ($J_\mathrm{rung}\gg1$), first-order perturbation theory reveals that the entanglement Hamiltonian closely resembles the single-chain Hamiltonian with renormalized coupling strengths, allowing for the definition of an ad hoc temperature. Our findings provide new insights into quantum entanglement in non-Hermitian systems and offer a foundation for developing novel approaches for studying finite temperature properties in non-Hermitian quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Investigating Stark MBL with Continuous Unitary Transformation Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the ergodicity-to-localization transition in interacting fermion systems subjected to a spatially uniform electric field. For that we employ the recently proposed Tensorflow Equations (TFE), a type of continuous unitary flow equations. This enables us to iteratively determine an approximate diagonal basis of the quantum many-body system. We present improvements to the method, which achieves good accuracy at small to intermediate interaction strengths, even in the absence of an electric field or disorder. Then, we examine two quantities that reveal the fate of Stark MBL in 1D and 2D. First, we investigate the structure of the resulting basis to determine the crossover between ergodic and localized regimes with respect to electric field strength. Second, we simulate long-time dynamics at infinite temperature. Our results in 1D show a localization transition at non-zero field for finite interaction that vanishes with increasing system size leading to localization at infinitesimally small field even in the presence of interactions. In 2D we find less clear signatures of localization and strong finite size effects. We establish that the TFE work accurately up to intermediate times but cannot capture higher order effects in interaction strength that lead to delocalization at longer times in finite-size Stark MBL systems.</description>

      <title>On Intersecting Conformal Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the physics of 2 and 3 mutually intersecting conformal defects forming wedges and corners in general dimension. For 2 defects we derive the beta-function of the edge interactions for infinite and semi-infinite wedges and study them in the tricritical model in $d=3-\epsilon$ as example. We discuss the dependency of the anomalous dimension on the intersection angle, connecting to an old issue known in the literature. Additionally, we study trihedral corners formed by 3 planes, and compute the corner anomalous dimension which can be considered as a higher-dimensional analog of the cusp anomalous dimension. We also study 3-line corners related to the three-body potential of point-like impurities.</description>

      <title>Postselection in lattice bosons undergoing continuous measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study in detail the postselection problem in a specific model: bosons hopping on a lattice subjected to continuous local measurements of quadrature observables. We solve the model analytically and show that the postselection overhead can be reduced by postprocessing the entire measurement record into one or two numbers for each trajectory and then postselecting based only on these numbers. We then provide a step-by-step protocol designed to recover connected two-point functions of the quantum trajectories, which display an exponentially decaying profile that is not observable in the unconditional, trajectory averaged, state. With the analytical solution in hand, we analyse the features of this postprocessing stage with the intention of abstracting away the properties that make postselection feasible in this model and may help in mitigating postselection in more general settings. We also test the protocol numerically in a way that utilizes only experimentally accessible information, showing that various quantum trajectory observables can be recovered with a few repetitions of the numerical experiment, even after including inevitable coarse-graining procedures expected under realistic experimental conditions. Furthermore, all the information required to design the postprocessing stage is independently present both in the unconditional dynamics and also in the measurement record, thus bypassing the need to solve for the conditional evolution of the model. We finalize by providing experimental implementations of these models in cavity-QED and circuit-QED.</description>

      <title>Limits of the Lindblad and non-Hermitian description of open systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While it is well established that the dynamics of an open system is described well by the Lindblad master equation if the coupling to the bath is either in the weak or in the singular limit, it is not known whether this description can be extended to some other coupling strength. Here we use the exact solution of a microscopic system coupled to baths, to show that, for a pure decay system, Lindbladian dynamics \textit{only} holds in the weak and singular coupling limits. We also show that Lindblad and non-Hermitian dynamics are equivalent in the highest particle subspace of such systems with pure decay. Using this equivalence, we rule out the possibility of obtaining non-Hermitian dynamics for any other couplings. Furthermore, we argue that exceptional points can only occur in the singular coupling limit, never in the weak coupling limit. Physically, this means that exceptional points can occur when the intrinsic time evolution of the isolated system is comparable to the relaxation time scale.</description>

      <title>Edge-Edge Correlations without Edge-States: $\eta$-clustering State as Ground State of the Extended Attractive SU(3) Hubbard Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the phase diagram of the extended attractive SU($3$) Hubbard chain with two-body hopping and nearest-neighbor attraction at half-filling. In the large on-site attraction limit, we identify three different phases: phase separation (PS), Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL), and charge density wave (CDW). Our analysis reveals that the $\eta$-clustering state, a three-component generalization of the $\eta$-pairing state, becomes the ground state at the boundary between the PS and TLL phases. On an open chain, this state exhibits an edge-edge correlation, which we call boundary off-diagonal long-range order (bODLRO). Using the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method, we numerically study the phase diagram of the model with large but finite on-site interactions and find that the numerical results align with those obtained in the strong coupling limit.</description>

      <title>Entropic tug of war: Topological constraints spontaneously rectify the dynamics of a polymer with heterogeneous fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polymers with active segments constitute prospective future materials and are used as a model for some biological systems such as chromatin. The directions of the active forces are typically introduced with temporal or spatial correlations to establish directional motion of the chain and corresponding active dynamics. Instead, here we consider an active-passive copolymer, where the two segments differ only by the magnitude of their fluctuations and feature no artificial correlations. Here we show that although the model itself does not possess directional dynamics, if the chains are concentrated, directional persistent motion spontaneously arises as a consequence of the broken translational symmetry owing to the topological constraints. Using scaling arguments and simulations, we explain the phenomenon and describe the ensuing dynamics. Our work has thus far-reaching consequences for the mechanical properties of all dense active polymeric systems with heterogeneous fluctuations and in particular for chromatin conformation and dynamics that are crucial for biological functionality.</description>

      <title>Kinetic model for transport in granular mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A kinetic model for granular mixtures is considered to study three different non-equilibrium situations. The model is based on the equivalence between a gas of elastic hard spheres subjected to a drag force proportional to the particle velocity and a gas of inelastic hard spheres. As a first problem, the relaxation of the velocity moments to their forms in the homogeneous cooling state (HCS) is studied. Then, taking the HCS as the reference state, the kinetic model is solved by the Chapman-Enskog method, which is conveniently adapted to inelastic collisions. For small spatial gradients, the mass, momentum and heat fluxes of the mixture are determined and exact expressions for the Navier-Stokes transport coefficients are obtained. As a third nonequilibrium problem, the kinetic model is solved exactly in the uniform shear flow (USF) state, where the rheological properties of the mixture are computed in terms of the parameter space of the mixture. In addition to the transport properties, the velocity distribution functions of each species are also explicitly obtained. To assess the reliability of the model, its theoretical predictions are compared with both (approximate) analytical results and computer simulations of the original Boltzmann equation. In general, the comparison shows a reasonable agreement between the two kinetic equations. While the diffusion transport coefficients show excellent agreement with the Boltzmann results, more quantitative differences appear in the case of the shear viscosity coefficient and the heat flux transport coefficients. In the case of the USF, although the model qualitatively captures the shear rate dependence of the rheological properties well, the discrepancies increase with increasing inelasticity in collisions.</description>

      <title>Efficient Eigenstate Preparation in an Integrable Model with Hilbert Space Fragmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the preparation of all the eigenstates of spin chains using quantum circuits. It is known that generic eigenstates of free-fermionic spin chains can be prepared with circuits whose depth grows only polynomially with the length of the chain and the number of particles. We show that the polynomial growth is also achievable for selected interacting models where the interaction between the particles is sufficiently simple. Our working example is the folded XXZ model, an integrable spin chain that exhibits Hilbert space fragmentation. We present the explicit quantum circuits that prepare arbitrary eigenstates of this model on an open chain efficiently. We perform error-mitigated noisy simulations with circuits of up to 13 qubits and different connectivities between qubits, achieving a relative error below 5%. As a byproduct, we extend a recent reformulation of the Bethe ansatz as a quantum circuit from closed to open boundary conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2111.04470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Atmospheric self-organization and activator-inhibitor dynamics in biology provide examples of checkerboard-like spatio-temporal organization. We study a simple model for local activation-inhibition processes. Our model, first introduced in the context of atmospheric moisture dynamics, is a continuous-energy and non-Abelian version of the fixed-energy sandpile model. Each lattice site is populated by a non-negative real number, its energy. Upon each timestep all sites with energy exceeding a unit threshold re-distribute their energy at equal parts to their nearest neighbors. The limit cycle dynamics gives rise to a complex phase diagram in dependence on the mean energy $\mu$: For low $\mu$, all dynamics ceases after few re-distribution events. For large $\mu$, the dynamics is well-described as a diffusion process, where the order parameter, spatial variance $\sigma$, is removed. States at intermediate $\mu$ are dominated by checkerboard-like period-two phases which are however interspersed by much more complex phases of far longer periods. Phases are separated by discontinuous jumps in $\sigma$ or $\partial_{\mu}\sigma$ - akin to first and higher-order phase transitions. Overall, the energy landscape is dominated by few energy levels which occur as sharp spikes in the single-site density of states and are robust to noise.</description>

Abstract: Carnot efficiency sets a fundamental upper bound on the heat engine efficiency, attainable in the quasi-static limit, albeit at the cost of completely sacrificing power output. In this Letter, we present a minimal heat engine model that can attain Carnot efficiency while achieving maximum power output. We unveil the potential of intrinsic divergent physical quantities within the working substance, such as degeneracy, as promising thermodynamic resources to break through the universal power-efficiency trade-off imposed by nonequilibrium thermodynamics for conventional heat engines. Our findings provide novel insights into the collective advantage in harnessing energy of many-body interacting systems.</description>

Abstract: This work computationally investigates an algorithm that was originally proposed for creating and searching trees of patterns under the assumption that it seeks the most efficient internal representation of the external world, namely a real-world dataset of patterns. The algorithm produces a transition from star graph to regular 1d lattice, passing through irregular scale-invariant trees, under the effect of a single control parameter. The relatively novel information-theoretic tools of the von Neumann entropy and its derivative, the specific heat, together with the recent definition of thermodynamic quantities, such as work and heat, for networks are reviewed and applied to inspect the tree structures produced by the formation protocol. We observe some consistency between the optimal thermodynamic efficiency for networks and the optimal pattern-matching efficiency, defined in terms of the trade-off between accuracy and computational cost when the former is measured at the meso-resolution scale involved in the phase transition from star graph to scale-invariant network. We adduce the hypothesis of a richer frequency content at the meso-scale of the self-organized network to explain this observation. Moreover, empirical evidence suggests that the system benefits from the vicinity to the mentioned phase transition if it is faced with higher-complexity environments, while it does not when the environment is simpler. A phase portrait of the tree-generating algorithm is provided and multiple phase transitions are identified.</description>

      <title>Cellular Automata model for period-$n$ synchronization: A new universality class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There are few known universality classes of absorbing phase transitions in one dimension and most models fall in the well-known directed percolation (DP) class. Synchronization is a transition to an absorbing state and this transition is often DP class. With local coupling, the transition is often to a fixed point state. Transitions to a periodic synchronized state are possible. We model those using a cellular automata model with states 1 to $n$. The rules are a) Each site in state $i$ changes to state $i+1$ for $i&lt;n$ and 1 if $i=n$. b) After this update, it takes the value of either neighbour unless it is in state 1. With these rules, we observe a transition to synchronization with critical exponents different from those of DP for $n&gt;2$. For $n=2$, a different exponent is observed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14450v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a quantum theory of Casimir forces between perfect electrical conductors, based on quantum electrodynamics and quantum statistical physics. This theory utilizes Kapusta's finite-temperature quantum field theory, combined with the Faddeev-Popov ghost formalism. This approach allows us to calculate Casimir forces at finite temperatures, providing both previously known and new physical insights from a unified perspective. Furthermore, our method enables us to compute the stress tensor associated with Casimir forces, in accordance with the Helmholtz free energy of an equilibrium quantum electromagnetic field. Using this methodology, we calculate the excess surface tension on the walls of slit-like pores due to the Casimir effect.</description>

      <title>Critical and tricritical behavior of the $d=3$ Blume-Capel model: Results from small-scale Monte Carlo simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01710v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the location of the critical and tricritical points of the three-dimensional Blume-Capel model by analyzing the behavior of the first Lee-Yang zero, the density of partition function zeros, and higher-order cumulants of the magnetization. Our analysis is conducted through Monte Carlo simulations, intentionally using only small system sizes. We demonstrate that this approach yields excellent results for studying the critical behavior of the model. Our findings indicate that at the tricritical point, where logarithmic corrections are anticipated, the numerical results align closely with the theoretical exponents describing these corrections. These expected values are then employed to accurately determine the coordinates of the tricritical point. At the model's critical point, the corrections correspond to those of the three-dimensional Ising model criticality, which we also use to precisely ascertain the critical temperature at zero crystal field. Additionally, we utilize more traditional thermodynamic quantities to validate the self-consistency of our analysis.</description>

      <title>A Rigorous Theory of Quantum-Classical Systems at Finite Temperature, Part I: Exact Functional Formulation in the Canonical Ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11821v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Combining classical density functional theory (cDFT) with quantum mechanics (QM) methods offers a computationally efficient alternative to traditional QM/molecular mechanics (MM) approaches for modeling mixed quantum-classical systems at finite temperatures. However, both QM/MM and QM/cDFT rely on approximations that introduce ambiguities. This series of papers aims to establish a rigorous theoretical framework to guide the development of a QM/cDFT formulation that clarifies the approximations involved. In this first paper, we establish a comprehensive density functional theory (DFT) framework for mixed quantum (QM)-classical (MM) systems within the canonical ensemble. We derive the equilibrium density matrix for a system comprising N qm QM and N mm MM particles and, based on this derivation, propose a variational formulation of the Helmholtz free energy in terms of the full QM-MM density matrix. By leveraging permutational symmetry and thanks to constrained-search methods, we reformulate the variational problem using functionals of objects having reduced dimensionalities. Three different formulations are presented, each using quantities with progressively lower dimensionalities. This ultimately enables computation of the Helmholtz free energy using only the QM and MM one-body densities, generalizing both cDFT and electronic DFT (eDFT) for QM-MM systems. In a subsequent paper, this formalism will be extended to the grand canonical ensemble, allowing classical particle number fluctuations. This extension, in which cDFT is most naturally formulated, provides a framework for studying solvation problems.</description>

      <title>Multipartite Entanglement in Crossing the Quantum Critical Point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.07892v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the multipartite entanglement for a slow quantum quench crossing a critical point. We consider the quantum Ising model and the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, which are local and full-connected quantum systems, respectively. The multipartite entanglement is quantified by quantum Fisher information with the generator defined as the operator of the ferromagnetic order parameter. The quench dynamics begins with a ground state in a paramagnetic phase, and then the transverse field is driven slowly to cross a quantum critical point, and ends with a zero transverse field. For the quantum Ising model, based on methods of matrix product states, we calculate the quantum Fisher information density of the final state. Numerical results of both linear and nonlinear quenches show that the quantum Fisher information density of the final state scales as a power law of the quench rate, which overall conforms to the prediction of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism with a small correction. We show that this correction results from the long-range behaviors. We also calculate the quantum Fisher information density in the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model. The results show that the scaling of quantum Fisher information in this full-connected system conforms to the Kibble-Zurek mechanism better, since the long-range physics cannot be defined in this nonlocal system. Our results reveal that the multipartite entanglement provides an alternative viewpoint to understand the dynamics of quantum phase transitions, specifically, the nontrivial long-range physics.</description>

      <title>A universal niche geometry governs the response of ecosystems to environmental perturbations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01276v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How ecosystems respond to environmental perturbations is a fundamental question in ecology, made especially challenging due to the strong coupling between species and their environment. Here, we introduce a theoretical framework for calculating the steady-state response of ecosystems to environmental perturbations in generalized consumer-resource. Our construction is applicable to a wide class of systems, including models with non-reciprocal interactions, cross-feeding, and non-linear growth/consumption rates. Within our framework, all ecological variables are embedded into four distinct vector spaces and ecological interactions are represented by geometric transformations between these spaces. We show that near a steady state, such geometric transformations directly map environmental perturbations - in resource availability and mortality rates - to shifts in niche structure. We illustrate these ideas in a variety of settings including a minimal model for pH-induced toxicity in bacterial denitrification. We end by discussing the biological implications of our framework. In particular, we show that it is extremely difficult to distinguish cooperative and competitive interactions by measuring species' responses to external perturbations.</description>

      <title>Reassessing quantum-thermodynamic enhancements in continuous thermal machines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19280v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum coherence has been shown to impact the operational capabilities of quantum systems performing thermodynamic tasks in a significant way, and yet the possibility and conditions for genuine coherence-enhanced thermodynamic operation remain unclear. We show that for steady-state quantum thermal machines -- both autonomous and externally driven -- that interact weakly with thermal reservoirs and work sources, the presence of coherence induced by perturbations in the machine Hamiltonian guarantees a genuine thermodynamic advantage. Such advantage applies both for the cases in which the induced coherence is between levels with different energies or between degenerate levels. On the other hand, we show that engines subjected to noise-induced coherence, can be outperformed by classical stochastic engines using exactly the same set of (incoherent) resources. We illustrate our results with three prototypical models of heat engines and refrigerators and employ multi-objective optimization techniques to characterize quantum-enhanced regimes in connection with the thermodynamic uncertainty relation and beyond it.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interpolation method is a powerful tool for rigorous analysis of mean-field spin glass models, both with and without dilution. In this study, we show that the interpolation method can be applied to Ising spin glass models in one dimension, such as a one-dimensional chain and a two-leg ladder. In one dimension, the replica symmetric (RS) cavity method is naturally expected to be rigorous for Ising spin glass models. Using the interpolation method, we rigorously prove that the RS cavity method provides lower bounds on the quenched free energies of Ising spin glass models in one dimension at any finite temperature in the thermodynamic limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03691v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In frustrated magnets, a variety of novel phenomena arise due to their peculiar magnetic states, whose excitations usually reside in the GHz to THz range. Intense THz lasers, therefore, lead to examining nonlinear optical effects in such magnets. Employing an unbiased numerical method, we calculate the laser-pulse driven harmonic spectra of the Shastry-Sutherland magnets, which is well known as the model of a quantum frustrated magnet $SrCu_2(BO_3)_2$. As a result, nonlinear responses of triplons and a two-triplon bound state are observed through the Zeeman or magnetoelectric couplings between the laser and the electron spin. Furthermore, we find that one can obtain information on magnetic anisotropy and symmetry from the spectra by manipulating external fields or two-color lasers. Our results indicate that laser-driven harmonic spectra are useful as a probe of less-detectable quantum many-body states in frustrated magnets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10244v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the behavior of the entanglement asymmetry in the ground state of a (1+1)-dimensional conformal field theory with a boundary condition that explicitly breaks a bulk symmetry. Our focus is on the asymmetry of a subsystem $A$ originating from the symmetry-breaking boundary and extending into a semi-infinite bulk. By employing the twist field formalism, we derive a universal expression for the asymmetry, showing that the asymptotic behavior for large subsystems is approached algebraically, with an exponent which is twice the conformal dimension of a boundary condition-changing operator. As a secondary result, we also establish a similar asymptotic behavior for the string order parameter. Our exact analytical findings are validated through numerical simulations in the critical Ising and 3-state Potts models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10607v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cylindrical inclusions in mobile brushes experience apparent attraction, which arises from a tendency to minimize the depletion zone around the inclusions, thereby maximizing the overall entropy. We find that correlation blobs act as the basic units of the attraction. In tall brushes, however, the depletion zone formed above the inclusions can generate repulsion, partially offsetting the depletion attraction. Our study offers physical insights into the brush-induced depletion interaction and suggests it as a mechanism for protein cluster formation on cell surfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13337v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The entanglement asymmetry measures the extent to which a symmetry is broken within a subsystem of an extended quantum system. Here, we analyse this quantity in Haar random states for arbitrary compact, semi-simple Lie groups, building on and generalising recent results obtained for the $U(1)$ symmetric case. We find that, for any symmetry group, the average entanglement asymmetry vanishes in the thermodynamic limit when the subsystem is smaller than its complement. When the subsystem and its complement are of equal size, the entanglement asymmetry jumps to a finite value, indicating a sudden transition of the subsystem from a fully symmetric state to one devoid of any symmetry. For larger subsystem sizes, the entanglement asymmetry displays a logarithmic scaling with a coefficient fixed by the dimension of the group. We also investigate the fluctuations of the entanglement asymmetry, which tend to zero in the thermodynamic limit. We check our findings against exact numerical calculations for the $SU(2)$ and $SU(3)$ groups. We further discuss their implications for the thermalisation of isolated quantum systems and black hole evaporation.</description>
