      <title>Interatomic Coulombic decay in lithium-doped large helium nanodroplets induced by photoelectron impact excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Irradiation of condensed matter with ionizing radiation generally causes direct photoionization as well as secondary processes that often dominate the ionization dynamics. Here, large helium (He) nanodroplets with radius &gt;40 nm doped with lithium (Li) atoms are irradiated with extreme ultraviolet (XUV) photons of energy &gt;44.4 eV and indirect ionization of the Li dopants is observed in addition to direct photoionization of the He droplets. Specifically, Li ions are efficiently produced by an interatomic Coulombic decay (ICD) process involving metastable He atoms and He_2 excimers which are populated by elastic and inelastic scattering of photoelectrons in the nanodroplets as well as by electron-ion recombination. This type of indirect ICD, observed in large He nanodroplets in nearly the entire XUV range, turns out to be more efficient than Li dopant ionization by ICD following direct resonant photoexcitation at a photon energy of 21.6 eV and by charge-transfer ionization. Indirect ICD processes induced by scattering of photoelectrons likely play an important role in other condensed phase systems exposed to ionizing radiation as well, including biological matter.</description>

      <title>A large language model-type architecture for high-dimensional molecular potential energy surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computing high dimensional potential surfaces for molecular and materials systems is considered to be a great challenge in computational chemistry with potential impact in a range of areas including fundamental prediction of reaction rates. In this paper we design and discuss an algorithm that has similarities to large language models in generative AI and natural language processing. Specifically, we represent a molecular system as a graph which contains a set of nodes, edges, faces etc. Interactions between these sets, which represent molecular subsystems in our case, are used to construct the potential energy surface for a reasonably sized chemical system with 51 dimensions. Essentially a family of neural networks that pertain to the graph-based subsystems, get the job done for this 51 dimensional system. We then ask if this same family of lower-dimensional neural networks can be transformed to provide accurate predictions for a 186 dimensional potential surface. We find that our algorithm does provide reasonably accurate results for this larger dimensional problem with sub-kcal/mol accuracy for the higher dimensional potential surface problem.</description>
