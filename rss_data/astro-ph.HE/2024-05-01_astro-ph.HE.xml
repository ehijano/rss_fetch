      <title>Gamma-ray Emission from a Young Star Cluster in the Star-Forming Region RCW 38</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the detection of gamma-ray emission near the young Milky Way star cluster ($\approx$ 0.5 Myr old) in the star-forming region RCW 38. Using 15 years of data from the Fermi-LAT, we find a significant ($ \sigma &gt; 22$) detection coincident with the cluster, producing a total $\gamma$-ray luminosity of $L_{\gamma} = (2.66\pm 0.92) \times 10^{34}$ erg s$^{-1}$ adopting a power-law spectral model ($\Gamma = 2.34\pm0.04$) in the 0.1 $-$ 500 GeV band. We estimate the total wind power to be $7 \times 10^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$, corresponding to a CR acceleration efficiency of $\eta_{\rm CR} \simeq 0.4$ for a diffusion coefficient consistent with the local interstellar medium of $D = 10^{28}$ cm$^{2}$ s$^{-1}$. Alternatively, the $\gamma$-ray luminosity could also account for a lower acceleration efficiency of 0.1 if the diffusion coefficient in the star-forming region is smaller, $D\simeq 2.5\times10^{27}\,{\rm cm^2\,\,s^{-1}}$. We compare the hot-gas pressure from Chandra X-ray analysis to the CR pressure and find the former is four orders of magnitude greater, suggesting that the CR pressure is not dynamically important relative to the stellar wind feedback. As RCW 38 is too young for supernovae to have occurred, the high CR acceleration efficiency in RCW 38 demonstrates that stellar winds may be an important source of Galactic cosmic rays.</description>

      <title>SN 2024ggi in NGC 3621: Rising Ionization in a Nearby, CSM-Interacting Type II Supernova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present UV/optical/NIR observations and modeling of supernova (SN) 2024ggi, a type II supernova (SN II) located in NGC 3621 at 7.2 Mpc. Early-time ("flash") spectroscopy of SN 2024ggi within +0.8 days of discovery shows emission lines of H I, He I, C III, and N III with a narrow core and broad, symmetric wings (i.e., IIn-like) arising from the photoionized, optically-thick, unshocked circumstellar material (CSM) that surrounded the progenitor star at shock breakout. By the next spectral epoch at +1.5 days, SN 2024ggi showed a rise in ionization as emission lines of He II, C IV, N IV/V and O V became visible. This phenomenon is temporally consistent with a blueward shift in the UV/optical colors, both likely the result of shock breakout in an extended, dense CSM. The IIn-like features in SN 2024ggi persist on a timescale of $t_{\rm IIn} = 3.8 \pm 1.6$ days at which time a reduction in CSM density allows the detection of Doppler broadened features from the fastest SN material. SN 2024ggi has peak UV/optical absolute magnitudes of $M_{\rm w2} = -18.7$ mag and $M_{\rm g} = -18.1$ mag that are consistent with the known population of CSM-interacting SNe II. Comparison of SN 2024ggi with a grid of radiation hydrodynamics and non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (nLTE) radiative-transfer simulations suggests a progenitor mass-loss rate of $\dot{M} = 10^{-2}$M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ ($v_w$ = 50 km/s), confined to a distance of $r &lt; 5\times 10^{14}$ cm. Assuming a wind velocity of $v_w$ = 50 km/s, the progenitor star underwent an enhanced mass-loss episode in the last ~3 years before explosion.</description>

      <title>SN 1054 as a Pulsar-Driven Supernova: Implications for the Crab Pulsar and Remnant Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most studied objects in astronomy, the Crab Nebula, is the remnant of the historical supernova SN 1054. Historical observations of the supernova imply a typical supernova luminosity, but contemporary observations of the remnant imply a low explosion energy and low ejecta kinetic energy. These observations are incompatible with a standard $^{56}$Ni-powered supernova, hinting at an an alternate power source such as circumstellar interaction or a central engine. We examine SN 1054 using a pulsar-driven supernova model, similar to those used for superluminous supernovae. The model can reproduce the luminosity and velocity of SN 1054 for an initial spin period of $\sim$ 13 ms and an initial dipole magnetic field of 10$^{14-15}$ G. We discuss the implications of these results, including the evolution of the Crab pulsar, the evolution of the remnant structure, formation of filaments, and limits on freely expanding ejecta. We discuss how our model could be tested further through potential light echo photometry and spectroscopy, as well as the modern analogues of SN 1054.</description>

      <title>The calm before the (next) storm: no third outburst in 2019--2020, and ongoing monitoring of the transient AGN IC 3599</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on follow-up observations of the Seyfert 1.9 galaxy IC 3599 with the NASA Neil Gehrels Swift mission. The detection of a second X-ray outburst in 2010 by Swift after the first discovery of a bright X-ray outburst in 1990 by ROSAT led to the suggestion of two very different explanations: The first one assumed that IC 3599 exhibits outbursts due to repeated partial tidal stripping of a star, predicting another outburst of IC 3599 in 2019/2020. The second, alternative scenario assumed that the event observed in X-rays is due to an accretion disk instability which would suggest a much longer period between the large outbursts. Our continued monitoring campaign by Swift allowed us to test the first scenario which predicted a repetition of high amplitude flaring activity in 2019/2020. We do not find any evidence of dramatic flaring activity with factors of 100 since the last X-ray outburst seen in 2010. These observations support the accretion disk scenario. Further, while IC 3599 remains in low emission states, the long-term X-ray light curve of IC 3599 reveals ongoing strong variability of a factor of a few. The most remarkable event is a mini flare of a factor of 10 in X-rays in December 2022. After that flare, the otherwise supersoft X-ray spectrum shows an exceptional hardening, reminiscent of a temporary corona formation.</description>

      <title>A Panchromatic Study of the X-ray Binary Population in NGC 300 on Sub-Galactic Scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The population-wide properties and demographics of extragalactic X-ray binaries (XRBs) correlate with the star formation rates (SFRs), stellar masses ($M_{\star}$), and environmental factors (such as metallicity, $Z$) of their host galaxy. Although there is evidence that XRB scaling relations ($L_X$/SFR for high mass XRBs [HMXBs] and $L_X$/$M_{\star}$ for low mass XRBs [LMXBs]) may depend on metallicity and stellar age across large samples of XRB-hosting galaxies, disentangling the effects of metallicity and stellar age from stochastic effects, particularly on subgalactic scales, remains a challenge. We use archival X-ray through IR observations of the nearby galaxy NGC 300 to self-consistently model the broadband spectral energy distribution and examine radial trends in its XRB population. We measure a current ($&lt;$100 Myr) SFR of 0.18$\pm$0.08 $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ and $M_{\star}$= $(2.15^{+0.26}_{-0.14})\times10^9$ $M_{\odot}$. Although we measure a metallicity gradient and radially resolved star formation histories that are consistent with the literature, there is a clear excess in the number of X-ray sources below $\sim10^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$ that are likely a mix of variable XRBs and additional background AGN. When we compare the subgalactic $L_X$/SFR ratios as a function of $Z$ to the galaxy-integrated $L_X$-SFR-$Z$ relationships from the literature, we find that only the regions hosting the youngest ($\lesssim$30 Myr) HMXBs agree with predictions, hinting at time evolution of the $L_X$-SFR-$Z$ relationship.</description>

      <title>Low-energy Injection and Nonthermal Particle Acceleration in Relativistic Magnetic Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relativistic magnetic turbulence has been proposed as a process for producing nonthermal particles in high-energy astrophysics. The particle energization may be contributed by both magnetic reconnection and turbulent fluctuations, but their interplay is poorly understood. It has been suggested that during magnetic reconnection the parallel electric field dominates the particle acceleration up to the lower bound of the power-law particle spectrum, but recent studies show that electric fields perpendicular to the magnetic field can play an important, if not dominant role. In this study, we carry out fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulations of magnetically dominated decaying turbulence in a relativistic pair plasma. For a fixed magnetization parameter $\sigma_0 = 20$, we find that the injection energy~$\varepsilon_{\rm inj}$ converges with increasing domain size to~$\varepsilon_{\rm inj} \simeq 10 \, m_ec^2$. In contrast, the power-law index, the cut-off energy, and the power-law extent increase steadily with domain size. We trace a large number of particles and evaluate the contributions of the work done by the parallel ($W_\parallel$) and perpendicular ($W_\perp$) electric fields during both the injection phase and the post-injection phase. We find that during the injection phase, the $W_\perp$ contribution increases with domain size, suggesting that it may eventually dominate injection for a sufficiently large domain. In contrast, both components contribute equally during the post-injection phase, insensitive to the domain size. For high energy ($\varepsilon \gg \varepsilon_{\rm inj}$) particles, $W_\perp$ dominates the subsequent energization. These findings may improve our understanding of nonthermal particles and their emissions in astrophysical plasmas.</description>

      <title>Optical Spectroscopy of Type Ia Supernovae by the Carnegie Supernova Projects I and II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the second and final release of optical spectroscopy of Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) obtained during the first and second phases of the Carnegie Supernova Project (CSP-I and CSP-II). The newly released data consist of 148 spectra of 30 SNe Ia observed in the course of the CSP-I, and 234 spectra of 127 SNe Ia obtained during the CSP-II. We also present 216 optical spectra of 46 historical SNe Ia, including 53 spectra of 30 SNe Ia observed by the Cal\'an/Tololo Supernova Survey. We combine these observations with previously published CSP data and publicly-available spectra to compile a large sample of measurements of spectroscopic parameters at maximum light, consisting of pseudo-equivalent widths and expansion velocities of selected features, for 232 CSP and historical SNe Ia (including more than 1000 spectra). Finally, we review some of the strongest correlations between spectroscopic and photometric properties of SNe Ia. Specifically, we define two samples: one consisting of SNe Ia discovered by targeted searches (most of them CSP-I objects) and the other composed of SNe Ia discovered by untargeted searches, which includes most of the CSP-II objects. The analysed correlations are similar for both samples. We find a larger incidence of SNe Ia belonging to the Cool (CL)and Broad Line (BL) Branch subtypes among the events discovered by targeted searches, Shallow Silicon (SS) SNe Ia are present with similar frequencies in both samples, while Core Normal (CN) SNe Ia are more frequent in untargeted searches.</description>

      <title>Chandra Study of the Proper Motion of HST-1 in the Jet of M87</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The radio galaxy M87 is well known for its jet, which features a series of bright knots observable from radio to X-ray wavelengths. We analyze the X-ray image and flux variability of the knot HST-1 in the jet. Our analysis includes all 112 available \textit{Chandra} ACIS-S observations from 2000-2021, with a total exposure time of $\sim$887 ks. We use de-convolved images to study the brightness profile of the X-ray jet and measure the relative separation between the core and HST-1. From 2003-2005 (which coincides with a bright flare from HST-1), we find a correlation between the flux of HST-1 and its offset from the core. In subsequent data, we find a steady increase in this offset, which implies a bulk superluminal motion for HST-1 of 6.6$\pm$0.9 c (2.0$\pm$0.3 pc yr$^{-1}$), in keeping with prior results. We discuss models for the flux-offset correlation that feature either two or four emission regions separated by \textbf{tens} of parsecs. We attribute these results to moving shocks in the jet, that allow us to measure the internal structure of the jet.</description>

      <title>Phase-Dependent Spectral Shape Changes in the Ultraluminous X-Ray Pulsar NGC 5907 ULX1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discovery of coherent pulsations from several ultraluminous X-ray pulsars (ULXPs) has provided direct evidence of super-critical accretion flow. However, geometrical structure of such accretion flow onto the central neutron star remains poorly understood. NGC 5907 ULX1 is one of the most luminous ULXPs with the luminosity exceeding $10^{41}~{\rm erg~s^{-1}}$. Here we present a broadband X-ray study of this ULXP using the data from simultaneous observations with XMM-Newton and NuSTAR conducted in July 2014. The phase-resolved spectra are well reproduced by a model consisting of a multicolor disk blackbody emission with a temperature gradient of $p = 0.5~(T \propto r^{-p})$ and a power law with an exponential cutoff. The disk component is phase-invariant, and has an innermost temperature of $\sim 0.3~{\rm keV}$. Its normalization suggests a relatively low inclination angle of the disk, in contrast to the previous claim in other literature. The power law component, attributed to the emission from the accretion flow inside the magnetosphere of the neutron star, indicates phase-dependent spectral shape changes; the spectrum is slightly harder in the pre-peak phase than in the post-peak phase. This implies that the magnetosphere has an asymmetric geometry around the magnetic axis, and that hotter regions close to the magnetic pole become visible before the pulse peak.</description>

      <title>Energy dependence of Quasi-periodic oscillations in accreting X-ray pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results from an investigation of the energy dependence of Quasi-Periodic Oscillations (QPOs) exhibited by accreting X-ray pulsars using data from archival \textit{XMM-Newton}, \textit{NuSTAR}, \textit{RXTE}, and \textit{NICER} observations. In a search for the presence of QPOs in 99 \textit{XMM-Newton} and \textit{NuSTAR} observations, we detected QPOs in eleven observations of five sources, viz., 4U 1626--67 (48 mHz), IGR J19294+1816 (30 mHz), V 0332+53 (2, 18 and 40 mHz), Cen X--3 (30 mHz), and XTE J1858+034 (180 mHz). A positive correlation of the QPO rms amplitude with energy is exhibited by 4U 1626--67, IGR J19294+1816, Cen X--3 and XTE J1858+034, while no energy dependence is observed in V 0332+53. We also analysed the energy spectrum to decouple thermal (soft-excess) from non-thermal emission and determine if the soft-excess has different QPO properties. We found no evidence for different QPO characteristics of the soft excess. The \textit{NuSTAR} observations of V 0332+53 during the Type-I outburst in 2016 show the presence of twin QPOs at 2.5 mHz and 18 mHz, while the \textit{XMM-Newton} and \textit{NuSTAR} observations during the Type-II outburst in 2015 show a QPO at 40 mHz. We review the observed QPO properties in the context of QPOs found in other types of accreting sources and the models usually used to explain the QPOs in accreting X-ray pulsars.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Constraint on Equation of State of Neutron Star based on the Binary Neutron Star Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The merger of neutron star (NS)-NS binary can form different production of the compact remnant, among which the supramassive NS (SMNS) could create an internal plateau and the followed steep decay marks the collapse of the SMNS. The proportion of SMNS and the corresponding collapse-time are often used to constrain the NS equation of state (EoS). This paper revisits this topic by considering the effect of an accretion disk on the compact remnant, which is not considered in previous works. Compared with previous works, the collapse-time distribution (peaks $\sim$100 s) of the SMNSs formed from NS-NS merger is almost unaffected by the initial surface magnetic ($B_{{\rm s},i}$) of NS, but the total energy output of the magnetic dipole radiation from the SMNSs depends on $B_{{\rm s},i}$ significantly. Coupling the constraints from the SMNS fraction, we exclude some EoSs and obtain three candidate EoSs, i.e., DD2, ENG, and MPA1. By comparing the distributions of the collapse-time and the luminosity of the internal plateau (in the short gamma-ray bursts) for those from observations with those obtained based on the three candidate EoSs, it is shown that only the EoS of ENG is favored. Our sample based on the ENG EOS and a mass distribution motivated by Galactic systems suggests that approximately $99\%$ of NS-NS mergers collapse to form a black hole within $10^7$s. This includes scenarios forming a BH promptly ($36.5\%$), a SMNS ($60.7\%$), or a stable NS that transitions into a BH or a SMNS following accretion ($2.1\%$). It also indicates that the remnants for GW170817 and GW190425, and the second object of GW190814 are more likely to be BHs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The IceCube collaboration has identified neutrinos of energy $\sim 10-100$ TeV from the blazar TXS 0506+056 and the active galaxy NGC 1068, which must have traveled through a dense dark matter spike surrounding the supermassive black holes that power the galactic nuclei. We use this to set new constraints on dark matter-neutrino scattering, and interpret the results in terms of a dark photon that couples to baryon minus lepton number.</description>

      <title>Status Report on Global Pulsar-Timing-Array Efforts to Detect Gravitational Waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stability of the spin of pulsars and the precision with which these spins can be determined, allows many unique tests of interest to physics and astrophysics. Perhaps the most challenging and revolutionary of these, is the detection of nanohertz gravitational waves. An increasing number of efforts to detect and study long-period gravitational waves by timing an array of pulsars have been ongoing for several decades and the field is moving ever closer to actual gravitational-wave science. In this review article, we summarise the state of this field by presenting the current sensitivity to gravitational waves and by reviewing recent progress along the multiple lines of research that are part of the continuous push towards greater sensitivity. We also briefly review some of the most recent efforts at astrophysical interpretation of the most recent GW estimates derived from pulsar timing.</description>

      <title>Cool-core, X-ray cavities and cold front revealed in RXCJ0352.9+1941 cluster by Chandra and GMRT observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of 30 ks Chandra and 46.8 ks (13 Hr) 1.4 GHz GMRT radio data on the cool-core cluster RXCJ0352.9+1941 with an objective to investigate AGN activities at its core. This study confirms a pair of X-ray cavities at projected distances of about 10.30 kpc and 20.80 kpc, respectively, on the NW and SE of the X-ray peak. GMRT L band (1.4 GHz) data revealed a bright radio source associated with the core of this cluster hosting multiple jet-like emissions. The spatial association of the X-ray cavities with the inner pair of radio jets confirm their origin due to AGN outbursts. The 1.4 GHz radio power ${\rm 7.4 \pm 0.8 \times 10^{39} \, erg\, s^{-1}}$ is correlated with the mechanical power stored in the X-ray cavities ($\sim7.90\times 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$), implying that the power injected by radio jets in the ICM is sufficient enough to offset the radiative losses. The X-shaped morphology of diffuse radio emission seems to be comprised of two pairs of orthogonal radio jets, likely formed due to a spin-flip of jets due to the merger of two systems. The X-ray surface brightness analysis of the ICM in its environment revealed two non-uniform, extended spiral-like emission structures on either side of the core, pointing towards the sloshing of gas due to a minor merger and might have resulted in a cold front at $\sim$31 arcsec (62 kpc) with a temperature jump of 1.44 keV.</description>

      <title>Recovery of the X-ray polarization of Swift J1727.8$-$1613 after the soft to hard spectral transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the detection of X-ray polarization in the black-hole X-ray binary Swift J1727.8$-$1613 during its dim hard spectral state by the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE). This is the first detection of the X-ray polarization at the transition from the soft to the hard state in an X-ray binary. We find a 2$-$8 keV averaged polarization degree of (3.3 ${\pm}$ 0.4) % and the corresponding polarization angle of 3{\deg} ${\pm}$ 4{\deg}, which matches with the polarization detected during the rising stage of the outburst, in September$-$October 2023, within 1${\sigma}$ uncertainty. The observational campaign complements previous studies of this source and enables comparison of the X-ray polarization properties of a single transient across the X-ray hardness-intensity diagram. The complete recovery of X-ray polarization properties, including energy dependence, follows a dramatic drop of the X-ray polarization during the soft state. The new IXPE observations in the dim hard state at the reverse transition indicate that the accretion properties, including the geometry of the corona, appear to be strikingly similar to the bright hard state during the outburst rise even though the X-ray luminosities differ by two orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>SRG/ART-XC discovery of SRGAJ144459.2-604207: a well-tempered bursting accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the discovery of the new accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar SRGAJ144459.2-604207 using the SRG/ART-XC data. The source was observed twice in February 2024 during the declining phase of the outburst. Timing analysis revealed a coherent signal near 447.8~Hz modulated by the Doppler effect due to the orbital motion. The derived parameters for the binary system are consistent with the circular orbit with a period of $\sim5.2$~h. The pulse profiles of the persistent emission, showing a sine-like part during half a period with a plateau in between, can well be modelled by emission from two circular spots partially eclipsed by the accretion disk. Additionally, during our 133~ks exposure observations, we detected 19 thermonuclear X-ray bursts. All bursts have similar shapes and energetics, and do not show any signs of photospheric radius expansion. The burst rate decreases linearly from one per $\sim$1.6~h at the beginning of observations to one per $\sim$2.2~h at the end and anticorrelates with the persistent flux. Spectral evolution during the bursts is consistent with the models of the neutron star atmospheres heated by accretion and imply a neutron star radius of 11--12~km and the distance to the source of 8--9~kpc. We also detected pulsations during the bursts and showed that the pulse profiles differ substantially from those observed in the persistent emission. However, we could not find a simple physical model explaining the pulse profiles detected during the bursts.</description>

      <title>Investigating the correlations between IceCube high-energy neutrinos and Fermi-LAT $\gamma$-ray observations. II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given that gamma rays with energies larger than TeV are severely absorbed by background radiation fields, for many extragalactic sources, the GeV-TeV gamma-ray observations are the messengers that are closest in energy to the TeV-PeV neutrinos observed by IceCube. Investigating whether there is a correlation between the gamma-ray and neutrino observations can help us identify high-energy neutrino sources and determine which sources are the main contributors to the all-sky diffuse neutrino flux of IceCube. In previous work, we have already studied the possible gamma-neutrino correlations by analyzing 10 years of IceCube muon-track data. In this work, we further investigate such correlations by employing the IceCube p-value sky map of the scan for point sources. We examine the spatial associations of hotspots in the neutrino sky map with various gamma-ray source samples: the third Fermi-LAT catalog of high-energy sources (3FHL), LAT 14-year source catalog (4FGL), the fourth catalog of active galactic nuclei (4LAC) and subsets of these samples. Among all the samples, the 3FHL sample shows a possible correlation with the neutrino hotspots, with a pre-trial p-value of $1.1\times10^{-4}$ ($\sim 3.9\,\sigma$). However, this is found to be caused by three already known neutrino sources/source candidates: NGC 1068, TXS 0506+056, and PKS 1424+240. In order to validate our analysis procedure and to test the robustness of the previously claimed correlation between the 5BZCAT blazars and neutrino hotspots, we also consider 5BZCAT blazars in our correlation study. We find that the way in which mock sources are generated in the simulation used to derive the chance coincidence probability may have a large impact on the claimed correlation.</description>

      <title>An evaluation of the BALROG and RoboBA algorithms for determining the position of Fermi/GBM GRBs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fermi/GBM instrument is a vital source of detections of gamma-ray bursts and has an increasingly important role to play in understanding gravitational-wave transients. In both cases, its impact is increased by accurate positions with reliable uncertainties. We evaluate the RoboBA and BALROG algorithms for determining the position of gamma-ray bursts detected by the Fermi/GBM instrument. We construct a sample of 54 bursts with detections both by Swift/BAT and by Fermi/GBM. We then compare the positions predicted by RoboBA and BALROG with the positions measured by BAT, which we can assume to be the true position. We find that RoboBA and BALROG are similarly precise for bright bursts whose uncertainties are dominated by systematic errors, but RoboBA performs better for faint bursts whose uncertainties are dominated by statistical noise. We further find that the uncertainties in the positions predicted by RoboBA are consistent with the distribution of position errors, whereas BALROG seems to be underestimating the uncertainties by a factor of about two. Additionally, we consider the implications of these results for the follow-up of the optical afterglows of Fermi/GBM bursts. In particular, for the DDOTI wide-field imager we conclude that a single pointing is best. Our sample would allow a similar study to be carried out for other telescopes.</description>

      <title>Magnetospheric Accretion and Ejection of Matter in Resistive Magnetohydrodynamic Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1112.6226</link>
      <description>arXiv:1112.6226v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ejection of matter in the close vicinity of a young stellar object is investigated, treating the accretion disk as a gravitationally bound reservoir of matter. By solving the resistive MHD equations in 2D axisymmetry using our version of the Zeus-3D code with newly implemented resistivity, we study the effect of magnetic diffusivity in the magnetospheric accretion-ejection mechanism. Physical resistivity was included in the whole computational domain so that reconnection is enabled by the physical as well as the numerical resistivity. We show, for the first time, that quasi-stationary fast ejecta of matter, which we call {\em micro-ejections}, of small mass and angular momentum fluxes, can be launched from a purely resistive magnetosphere. They are produced by a combination of pressure gradient and magnetic forces, in presence of ongoing magnetic reconnection along the boundary layer between the star and the disk, where a current sheet is formed. Mass flux of micro-ejection increases with increasing magnetic field strength and stellar rotation rate, and is not dependent on the disk to corona density ratio and amount of resistivity.</description>

      <title>X-ray View of Little Red Dots: Do They Host Supermassive Black Holes?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of Little Red Dots (LRDs) -- a population of compact, high-redshift, dust-reddened galaxies -- is one of the most surprising results from \textit{JWST}. However, the nature of LRDs is still debated: some studies suggest that these galaxies host accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs), while others conclude that the near-infrared emission primarily originates from intense star formation. In this work, we utilize ultra-deep \textit{Chandra} observations and study LRDs residing behind the lensing galaxy cluster, Abell~2744. We probe the X-ray emission from individual galaxies but find that they remain undetected and provide SMBH mass upper limits of $\lesssim(1.5-16)\times10^{6}~\rm{M_{\odot}}$ assuming Eddington limited accretion. To increase the signal-to-noise ratios, we conduct a stacking analysis of the full sample with a total lensed exposure time of $\approx87$~Ms. We also bin the galaxies based on their stellar mass, lensing magnification, and detected broad-line H$\alpha$ emission. All but one stacked sample remains undetected with SMBH mass upper limits of $\lesssim2.5\times10^{6}~\rm{M_{\odot}}$. We obtain a tentative, $\approx2.6\sigma$ detection for LRDs exhibiting broad-line H$\alpha$ emission. Taking this detection at face value, the inferred mean SMBH mass is $\approx3.2\times10^{6}~\rm{M_{\odot}}$ assuming Eddington-limited accretion, about 1.5 orders of magnitude lower than that inferred from \textit{JWST} data. Our results imply that LRDs do not host over-massive SMBHs and/or accrete at a few percent of their Eddington limit. The significant discrepancy between the \textit{JWST} and \textit{Chandra} data hints that the scaling relations used to infer the SMBH mass from the H$\alpha$ line and virial relations may not be applicable for high-redshift LRDs.</description>

      <title>Neutron stars and the cosmological constant problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase transitions can play an important role in the cosmological constant problem, allowing the underlying vacuum energy, and therefore the value of the cosmological constant, to change. Deep within the core of neutron stars, the local pressure may be sufficiently high to trigger the QCD phase transition, thus generating a shift in the value of the cosmological constant. The gravitational effects of such a transition should then be imprinted on the properties of the star. Working in the framework of General Relativity, we provide a new model of the stellar interior, allowing for a QCD and a vacuum energy phase transition. We determine the impact of a vacuum energy jump on mass-radius relations, tidal deformability-radius relations, I-Love-Q relations and on the combined tidal deformability measured in neutron star binaries.</description>

      <title>On the Pair-Instability Supernova origin of J1010+2358</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first (Pop III) stars formed only out of H and He and were likely more massive than present-day stars. Massive Pop III stars in the range 140-260 M$_\odot$ are predicted to end their lives as pair-instability supernovae (PISNe), enriching the environment with a unique abundance pattern, with high ratios of odd to even elements. Recently, the most promising candidate for a pure descendant of a zero-metallicity massive PISN (260 M$_{\odot}$) was discovered by the LAMOST survey, the star J1010+2358. However, the key elements to verify the high PISN contribution, C and Al, were missing from the analysis. To rectify this, we obtained and analyzed a high-resolution VLT/UVES spectrum, correcting for 3D and/or non-LTE effects. Our measurements of both C and Al give much higher values (~1 dex) than expected from a 260 M$_{\odot}$ PISN. Furthermore, we find significant discrepancies with the previous analysis, and therefore a much less pronounced odd-even effect. Thus, we show that J1010+2358 cannot be a pure descendant of a 260 M$_{\odot}$ PISN. Instead, we find that the best fit model consists of a 13 M$_{\odot}$ Pop II core-collapse supernova combined with a Pop III supernova. Alternative, less favoured solutions $(\chi^2/\chi^2_{\rm best}\approx2.3)$ include a 50% contribution from a 260 M$_{\odot}$ PISN, or a 40% contribution from a Pop III type Ia supernova. Ultimately, J1010+2358 is certainly a unique star giving insights into the earliest chemical enrichment. However, this star has not necessarily obtained any of its metals from a PISN. So the search continues for a concrete proof of the existence of zero-metallicity PISNe.</description>

      <title>Tayler Instability Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tayler instability of toroidal magnetic fields $B_\phi$ is broadly invoked as a trigger for turbulence and angular momentum transport in stars. This paper presents a systematic revision of the linear stability analysis for a rotating, magnetized, and stably stratified star. For plausible configurations of $B_\phi$, instability requires diffusive processes: viscosity, magnetic diffusivity, or thermal/compositional diffusion. Our results reveal a new physical picture, demonstrating how different diffusive effects independently trigger instability of two types of waves in the rotating star: magnetostrophic waves and inertial waves. It develops via overstability of the waves, whose growth rate sharply peaks at some characteristic wavenumbers. We determine instability conditions for each wave branch and find the characteristic wavenumbers. The results are qualitatively different for stars with magnetic Prandtl number $Pm\ll 1$ (e.g. the Sun) and $Pm\gg 1$ (e.g. protoneutron stars).

      <title>High-energy neutrino signals from supernova explosions: a new window into dark photon parameter space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark photons, hypothetical feebly interacting massive vector bosons, appear in many extensions of the Standard Model. This study investigates their production and subsequent decay during supernova explosions. We demonstrate that the decay of dark photons, with masses ranging from 200 to 400 MeV, can lead to the emission of neutrinos with energies surpassing those emitted by supernovae. These neutrinos therefore serve as a distinct signal of new physics, allowing for the exploration of previously uncharted regions of the dark photon parameter space and complementing both accelerator-based searches and other astrophysical constraints. The signal is largely unaffected by the specifics of the supernova's temperature and density radial profiles outside the SN core, rendering the prediction both robust and model-independent. Our results indicate that searching for high-energy neutrinos accompanying supernova explosions provides a novel approach to probe physics beyond the Standard Model, including dark photons, heavy neutral leptons, and other feebly interacting particles with masses in the hundreds of MeV range.</description>

      <title>More luminous red novae that require jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I study two intermediate luminosity optical transients (ILOTs) classified as luminous red novae (LRNe) and argue that their modeling with a common envelope evolution (CEE) without jets encounters challenges. LRNe are ILOTs powered by violent binary interaction. Although popular in the literature is to assume a CEE is the cause of LRNe, I here repeat an old claim that many LRNe are powered by grazing envelope evolution (GEE) events; the GEE might end in a CEE or a detached binary system. I find that the LRN AT 2021biy might have continued to experience mass ejection episodes after its eruption and, therefore, might not suffered a full CEE during the outburst. This adds to an earlier finding that a jet-less model does not account for some of its properties. I find that a suggested jet-less CEE model for the LRN AT 2019zhd does not reproduce its photosphere radius evolution. These results that challenge jet-less models of two LRNe strengthen a previous claim that jets play major roles in powering ILOTs and shaping their ejecta and that in many LRNe, the more compact companion launches the jets during a GEE.</description>

      <title>The Nature of X-Rays from Young Stellar Objects in the Orion Nebula Cluster -- A Chandra HETGS Legacy Project</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) is the closest site of very young ($\sim$ 1 Myrs) massive star formation. The ONC hosts more than 1600 young and X-ray bright stars with masses ranging from $\sim$ 0.1 to 35 $M_\odot$. The Chandra HETGS Orion Legacy Project observed the ONC with the Chandra high energy transmission grating spectrometer (HETGS) for $2.1\,$Ms. We describe the spectral extraction and cleaning processes necessary to separate overlapping spectra. We obtained 36 high resolution spectra which includes a high brilliance X-ray spectrum of $\theta^1$ Ori C with over 100 highly significant X-ray lines. The lines show Doppler broadening between 300 and $400\;\mathrm{km}\;\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. Higher spectral diffraction orders allow us to resolve line components of high Z He-like triplets in $\theta^1$ Ori C with unprecedented spectral resolution. Long term light curves spanning $\sim$20 years show all stars to be highly variable, including the massive stars. Spectral fitting with thermal coronal emission line models reveals that most sources show column densities of up to a few times $10^{22}\,$cm$^{-2}$ and high coronal temperatures of 10 to 90 MK. We observe a bifurcation of the high temperature component where some stars show a high component of 40 MK, while others show above 60 MK indicating heavy flaring activity. Some lines are resolved with Doppler broadening above our threshold of $\sim200\;\mathrm{km}\;\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, up to $500\;\mathrm{km}\;\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. This data set represents the largest collection of HETGS high resolution X-ray spectra from young pre-MS stars in a single star-forming region to date.</description>

      <title>On the detection and precise localisation of merging black holes events through strong gravitational lensing</title>

Abstract: To unlock the full spectrum of astrophysical and cosmological applications of gravitational-wave detections, it is essential to localise the associated black-hole mergers to high precision inside their host galaxies. One possible method to achieve this is to compare the properties of multiple detections of gravitationally-lensed binary black-hole merger events with the properties of strong gravitational lens systems located in the joint sky localisation of the gravitational-wave detections. In this work, we simulate the population of binary black-hole mergers lensed by galaxy-scale lenses and detectable by LIGO-Virgo-Kagra in the coming decade and the population of galaxy-scale strong lenses that will be detected by Euclid. We use these simulations to investigate the prospects for localising strongly lensed binary black-hole mergers inside the lensed galaxies of 'Euclid-like' galaxy-scale strong lenses. We find that for 20-50% of strongly lensed gravitational wave events the lens system is detectable with Euclid, if the event falls in its survey footprint. Of these, we expect to correctly identify the strongly-lensed host galaxy as likely (with posterior probability) host galaxy - based on Bayesian evidence ranking of candidate hosts - for 34.6-21.9% of quadruply-lensed gravitational-wave events when given an a-priori 1-5 deg^2 gravitational-wave-only sky localisation. For triply and doubly lensed gravitational-wave events, this becomes 29.8-14.9% and 16.4-6.6% respectively. If successfully identified, however, the localisation can be better than a fraction of the host-galaxy size, i.e. of order milli-arcseconds. A first detection in the coming decade, however, probably requires dedicated deep and high-resolution follow-ups and continued upgrades in the current and planned gravitational-wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Mass and radius of the most massive neutron star: The probe of the equation of state and perturbative QCD</title>

Abstract: Recently, an association of GW190425 and FRB 20190425A had been claimed and a highly magnetized neutron star (NS) remnant was speculated. Given the $\sim 2.5$-h delay of the occurrence of FRB 20190425A, a uniformly rotating supramassive magnetar is favored since the differential rotation would have been promptly terminated by the magnetic braking. The required maximum gravitational mass ($M_{\rm TOV}$) of the nonrotating NS is $\approx 2.77M_\odot$, which is strongly in tension with the relatively low $M_{\rm TOV}\approx 2.25M_\odot$ obtained in current equation of state (EOS) constraints incorporating perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD) information. However, the current mass-radius and mass-tidal deformability measurements of NSs alone do not convincingly exclude the high $M_{\rm TOV}$ possibility. By performing EOS constraints with mock measurements, we find that with a $2\%$ determination for the radius of PSR J0740+6620-like NS it is possible to distinguish between the low and high $M_{\rm TOV}$ scenarios. We further explore the prospect to resolve the issue of the appropriate density to impose the pQCD constraints with future massive NS observations or determinations of $M_{\rm TOV}$ and/or $R_{\rm TOV}$. It turns out that measuring the radius of a PSR J0740+6620-like NS is insufficient to probe the EOSs around 5 nuclear saturation density, where the information from pQCD becomes relevant. The additional precise $M_{\rm TOV}$ measurements anyhow could provide insights into the EOS at such a density. Indeed, supposing the central engine of GRB 170817A is a black hole formed via the collapse of a supramassive NS, the resulting $M_{\rm TOV}\approx 2.2M_\odot$ considerably softens the EOS at the center of the most massive NS, which is in favor of imposing the pQCD constraint at density beyond the one achievable in the NSs.</description>

      <title>Constraints on UHECR sources and extragalactic magnetic fields from directional anisotropies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02645v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A dipole anisotropy in ultra-high-energy cosmic ray (UHECR) arrival directions, of extragalactic origin, is now firmly established at energies E &gt; 8 EeV. Furthermore, the UHECR angular power spectrum shows no power at smaller angular scales than the dipole, apart from hints of possible individual hot or warm spots for energy thresholds $\gtrsim$40 EeV. Here, we exploit the magnitude of the dipole and the limits on smaller-scale anisotropies to place constraints on two quantities: the extragalactic magnetic field (EGMF) and the number density of UHECR sources or the volumetric event rate if UHECR sources are transient. We also vary the bias between the extragalactic matter and the UHECR source densities, reflecting whether UHECR sources are preferentially found in over- or under-dense regions, and find that little or no bias is favored. We follow Ding et al. (2021) in using the Cosmic Flows 2 density distribution of the local universe as our baseline distribution of UHECR sources, but we improve and extend that work by employing an accurate and self-consistent treatment of interactions and energy losses during propagation. Deflections in the Galactic magnetic field are treated using both the full JF12 magnetic field model, with random as well as coherent components, or just the coherent part, to bracket the impact of the GMF on the dipole anisotropy. This Large Scale Structure (LSS) model gives good agreement with both the direction and magnitude of the measured dipole anisotropy and forms the basis for simulations of discrete sources and the inclusion of EGMF effects.</description>

      <title>The Origin of the Slow-to-Alfv\'en Wave Cascade Power Ratio and its Implications for Particle Heating in Accretion Flows</title>

Abstract: The partition of turbulent heating between ions and electrons in radiatively inefficient accretion flows plays a crucial role in determining the observational appearance of accreting black holes. Modeling this partition is, however, a challenging problem because of the large scale separation between the macroscopic scales at which energy is injected by turbulence and the microscopic ones at which it is dissipated into heat. Recent studies of particle heating from collisionless damping of turbulent energy have shown that the partition of energy between ions and electrons is dictated by the ratio of the energy injected into the slow and Alfv\'en wave cascades as well as the plasma $\beta$ parameter. In this paper, we study the mechanism of the injection of turbulent energy into slow- and Alfv\'en- wave cascades in magnetized shear flows. We show that this ratio depends on the particular ($r\phi$) components of the Maxwell and Reynolds stress tensors that cause the transport of angular momentum, the shearing rate, and the orientation of the mean magnetic field with respect to the shear. We then use numerical magnetohydrodynamic shearing-box simulations with background conditions relevant to black hole accretion disks to compute the magnitudes of the stress tensors for turbulence driven by the magneto-rotational instability and derive the injection power ratio between slow and Alfv\'en wave cascades. We use these results to formulate a local subgrid model for the ion-to-electron heating ratio that depends on the macroscopic characteristics of the accretion flow.</description>

      <title>The cause of the difference in the propagation distances between compact and transient jets in black-hole X-ray binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accreting black-hole binaries change their properties during evolution, passing through two main luminous states, dominated by either hard or soft X-rays. In the hard state, steady compact jets emitting multiwavelength radiation are present. Those jets are usually observed in radio, and when resolved, their extent is $\lesssim\!10^{15}$ cm. Then, during hard-to-soft transitions, powerful ejecta in the form of blobs appear. They are observed up to distances of $\sim\!10^{18}$ cm, which are $\gtrsim$1000 times larger than the extent of hard-state jets. On the other hand, estimates of the accretion rates during most luminous hard states and the hard-to-soft transitions are very similar, implying that maximum achievable powers of both types of jets are similar and cannot cause the huge difference in their propagation. Instead, we explain the difference in the propagation length by postulating that the ejecta consist of electron-ion plasmas, whereas the hard-state jets consist mostly of electron-positron pairs. The inertia of the ejecta are then much higher than those of compact jets, and the former are not readily stopped by ambient media. A related result is that the accretion flow during the hard state is of Standard and Normal Evolution (SANE), while it is a Magnetically Arrested Disk (MAD) during transient ejections. The pairs in hard-state jets can be produced by collisions of photons of the hard spectrum emitted by hot accretion flows within the jet base. On the other hand, the X-ray spectra during the state transitions are relatively soft and the same process produces much fewer pairs.</description>

Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts are promising candidate sources of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos. The recent GRB 221009A event, identified as the brightest gamma-ray burst ever detected, provides a unique opportunity to investigate hadronic emissions involving neutrinos. The KM3NeT undersea neutrino detectors participated in the worldwide follow-up effort triggered by the event, searching for neutrino events. In this letter, we summarize subsequent searches, in a wide energy range from MeV up to a few PeVs. No neutrino events are found in any of the searches performed. Upper limits on the neutrino emission associated with GRB 221009A are computed.</description>

      <title>Plasmoid Instability in the Multiphase Interstellar Medium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.06434v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The processes controlling the complex clump structure, phase distribution, and magnetic field geometry that develops across a broad range of scales in the turbulent interstellar medium remains unclear. Using unprecedentedly high resolution three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations of thermally unstable turbulent systems, we show that large current sheets unstable to plasmoid-mediated reconnection form regularly throughout the volume. The plasmoids form in three distinct environments: (i) within cold clumps, (ii) at the asymmetric interface of the cold and warm phases, and (iii) within the warm, volume-filling phase. We then show that the complex magneto-thermal phase structure is characterized by a predominantly highly magnetized cold phase, but that regions of high magnetic curvature, which are the sites of reconnection, span a broad range in temperature. Furthermore, we show that thermal instabilities change the scale dependent anisotropy of the turbulent magnetic field, reducing the increase in eddy elongation at smaller scales. Finally, we show that most of the mass is contained in one contiguous cold structure surrounded by smaller clumps that follow a scale free mass distribution. These clumps tend to be highly elongated and exhibit a size versus internal velocity relation consistent with supersonic turbulence, and a relative clump distance-velocity scaling consistent with subsonic motion. We discuss the striking similarity of cold plasmoids to observed tiny scale atomic and ionized structures and HI fibers, and consider how the prevalence of plasmoids will modify the motion of charged particles thereby impacting cosmic ray transport and thermal conduction in the ISM and other similar systems.</description>

      <title>The viability of low-mass subhaloes as targets for gamma-ray dark matter searches</title>

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the discovery potential of low-mass Galactic dark matter (DM) subhaloes for indirect searches of DM. We use data from the Via Lactea II (VL-II) N-body cosmological simulation, which resolves subhaloes down to $\mathcal{O}(10^4)$ solar masses and it is thus ideal for this purpose. First, we characterize the abundance, distribution and structural properties of the VL-II subhalo population in terms of both subhalo masses and maximum circular velocities. Then, we repopulate the original simulation with millions of subhaloes of masses down to about five orders of magnitude below the minimum VL-II subhalo mass (more than one order of magnitude in velocities). We compute subhalo DM annihilation astrophysical "J-factors" and angular sizes for the entire subhalo population, by placing the Earth at a random position but at the right galactocentric distance in the simulation. Thousands of these realizations are generated in order to obtain statistically meaningful results. We find that some nearby low-mass Galactic subhaloes, not massive enough to retain stars or gas, may indeed yield DM annihilation fluxes comparable to those expected from other, more massive and acknowledgeable DM targets like dwarf satellite galaxies. Typical angular sizes are of the order of the degree, thus subhaloes potentially appearing as extended sources in gamma-ray telescopes, depending on instrument angular resolution and sensitivity. Our work shows that low-mass Galactic subhaloes with no visible counterparts are expected to play a relevant role in current and future indirect DM search searches and should indeed be considered as excellent DM targets.</description>

      <title>SKA Sensitivity to Sub-GeV Dark Matter Decay: Synchrotron Radio Emissions in White Dwarf Magnetospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02707v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the potential of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) in detecting synchrotron radiation emitted from the decay of sub-GeV dark matter (dark matter with masses below the GeV scale) in the presence of strong magnetic fields. As a concrete setup, we consider scenarios where the magnetosphere of a magnetic white dwarf overlaps with dense dark matter environments, such as those surrounding a primordial black hole. Our study reveals that the encounters of compact objects such as white dwarfs and black holes offer a promising avenue for upcoming radio telescopes to probe the properties of light dark matter, which has been less explored compared with more conventional heavier (masses above the GeV scale) dark matter.</description>

      <title>A New Window for Studying Intermediate Polars and Tilted Accretion Disk Precession</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08162v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: TV Col is a long-period eclipsing intermediate polar (IPs) prototype star for the negative superhump (NSH) system. We investigate the eclipse minima, eclipse depth, and NSH amplitude based on TESS photometry. Using the same analytical method as SDSS J081256.85+191157.8, we find periodic variations of the O-C for eclipse minima and NSH amplitudes with periods of 3.939(25) d and 3.907(30) d, respectively. The periodic variation of the NSH amplitude of TV Col confirms that periodic NSH amplitude changes in response to the tilted disk precession may be universal, which is another evidence that the origin of the NSHs is related to the tilted disk precession. We suggest that the NSH amplitude variation may be similar to the superorbital signal, coming from the periodic change in visual brightness of the energy released by streams touching the tilted disk with tilted disk precession. Finally, we find for the first time that the eclipse depth exhibits bi-periodic variations with periods of P1 = 3.905(11) d and P2 = 1.953(4) d, respectively. P2 is about half of P1 and the disk precession period (P1~ Pprec ~ 2 * P2). We suggest that P1 may come from the periodic change in the brightness of the eclipse center due to tilted disk precession, while P2 may come from two accretion curtains precessing together with the tilted disk, but more verification and discussion are necessary. The discovery of bi-periodic variations in eclipse depth provides a new window for studying IPs and tilted disk precession.</description>

      <title>Energy self-extraction of a Kerr black hole with the force-free magnetosphere frame-dragged</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is shown that the zero-angular-momentum-observers (ZAMOs) circulating with the frame-dragging-angular-velocity $\omega$ plays a leading part in energy extraction. When the condition $\Omega_{\rm F}&lt;\Omega_{\rm H}$ is satisfied, where $\Omega_{\rm H}$ and $\Omega_{\rm F}$ are the horizon and field-line (FL) angular-velocities (AVs), they will see that the null surface S$_{\rm N}$ with $\omega_{\rm N}=\Omega_{\rm F}$ always exists in the force-free magnetosphere.
  Denoting the ZAMO-measured FLAV with $\Omega_{{\rm F}\omega} \equiv \Omega_{\rm F} - \omega$, this surface S$_{\rm N}$ where $\Omega_{{\rm F}\omega}=0$ defines the gravito-magneto-centrifugal divider of the magnetosphere, with a kind of plasma-shed on it. The outer domain ${D}_{\rm (out)}$ outside S$_{\rm N}$ spins forward ($\Omega_{{\rm F}\omega}&gt;0$), whereas the inner domain ${D}_{\rm (in)}$ inside spins backward ($\Omega_{{\rm F}\omega}&lt;0$).
  The force-free and freezing-in conditions break down on S$_{\rm N}$, thereby allowing the particle-current sources to be set up on S$_{\rm N}$. Because the electric field ${\bf E}_{\rm p}$ reverses direction there, the Poynting flux reverses direction as well from outward to inward, though the positive angular momentum always flows outwardly.
  Electromagnetic self-extraction of energy will be possible only through the frame-dragged magnetosphere, with the inner domain ${D}_{\rm (in)}$ nested between the horizon and the surface S$_{\rm N}$, in order to comply with the 1st and 2nd laws of thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Photo-production of axions in Supernovae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Compact stellar objects like supernovae and neutron stars are believed to cool by emitting axions predominantly via axion bremsstrahlung ($NN \to NNa$), pion conversion ($\pi^- p^+ \to N a$) and photo-production ($\gamma N \to N a$). In this paper, we study in detail the photo-production channel, from the unavoidable anomaly induced Wess-Zumino-Witten term $\propto \epsilon^{\mu \nu \alpha \beta}\, F_{\mu \nu}\, \partial_\alpha a \, \omega_\beta$ in conjunction with the low energy pion photo-production data. We found that for heavier axions, i.e., $m_a\sim\mathcal{O}(100)$ MeV, photo-production processes can be dominant compared to the usual axion emission processes. In addition, the spectrum of axions emitted in the process is significantly harder than those originating from bremsstrahlung.</description>

      <title>Generation of narrow beams of super high-energy gamma quanta in the resonant inverse Compton-effect in the field of a strong x-ray wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15519v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The article presents a theoretical study of Oleinik resonances in the process of scattering a gamma quantum by an ultrarelativistic electron in the field of a strong electromagnetic wave. It is shown that under resonant conditions, the scattering channels of the reaction effectively split into two first-order processes according to a fine structure constant such as the external field-stimulated Compton effect. And the annihilation channel of the reaction effectively decays into direct and reverse the external field-stimulated Breit-Wheeler processes. The significant dependence of the resonant energy of final particles and resonant cross sections on the outgoing angles of the final gamma quantum, the number of absorbed and emitted photons of the wave, as well as the characteristic quantum parameters of the problem is shown. These quantum parameters are determined by the ratio of the initial particle energies to the characteristic energies of the Compton effect and the Breit-Wheeler process. An unambiguous relationship between the outgoing angles of final electrons and gamma quanta has been obtained, which qualitatively distinguishes the resonant process from the non-resonant one. The cases when the energy of the initial electrons significantly exceeds the energy of the initial gamma quanta have been studied. The conditions under which the energy of high-energy initial electrons is converted into the energy of final gamma quanta are obtained. At the same time, the resonant differential cross-section of such a process significantly (by several orders of magnitude) exceeds the corresponding non-resonant cross-section. This theoretical study predicts a number of new physical effects that may explain the high-energy fluxes of gamma quanta born near neutron stars and magnetars.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-wave lensing in Einstein-aether theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07782v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Einstein-aether theory provides a model to test the validity of local Lorentz invariance in gravitational interactions. The speed of gravitational waves as measured from the binary neutron star event GW170817 sets stringent limits on Einstein-aether theory, but only on a combination of the theory's free parameters. For this reason, a significant part of the theory's parameter space remains unconstrained by observations. Motivated by this, we explore the propagation of gravitational waves in Einstein-aether theory over an inhomogeneous background (i.e., gravitational wave lensing) as a potential mechanism to break the degeneracies between the theory's free parameters, and hence enable new constraints on the theory to be obtained. By bringing the field equations into the form of the so-called kinetic matrix and applying a formalism known as the propagation eigenstate framework, we find that the speed of gravitational waves is modified by inhomogeneities in the aether field. However, the modification is common to both gravitational polarizations and vanishes in the limit in which gravitational waves propagate with luminal speed. This lens-dependent gravitational wave speed contrasts with the lens-induced birefringence observed in other theories beyond general relativity, like Horndeski's theory. While the potential to improve tests based on gravitational-wave speed is limited, our formalism sets the basis to fully describe signal propagation over inhomogeneous spacetimes in Einstein-aether theory and other extensions of general relativity.</description>

      <title>Bayesian inference of neutron-skin thickness and neutron-star observables based on effective nuclear interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09511v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have obtained the constraints on the density dependence of the symmetry energy from neutron-skin thickness data by parity-violating electron scatterings and neutron-star observables using a Bayesian approach, based on the standard Skyrme-Hartree-Fock (SHF) model and its extension as well as the relativistic mean-field (RMF) model. While the neutron-skin thickness data (neutron-star observables) mostly constrain the symmetry energy at subsaturation (suprasaturation) densities, they may more or less constrain the behavior of the symmetry energy at suprasaturation (subsaturation) densities, depending on the energy-density functional form. Besides showing the final posterior density dependence of the symmetry energy, we also compare the slope parameters of the symmetry energy at 0.10 fm$^{-3}$ as well as the values of the symmetry energy at twice saturation density from three effective nuclear interactions. The present work serves as a comparison study based on relativistic and non-relativistic energy-density functionals, for constraining the nuclear symmetry energy from low to high densities using a Bayesian approach.</description>

      <title>The Black-Hole Masses of High-Redshift QSOs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observations of high-redshift quasars frequently promote suggestions of large black hole masses, whose presence so early in cosmic time is not easily explicable. I consider the parallel with ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) -- now known to be stellar-mass black hole (and neutron star) binaries apparently radiating far above their Eddington luminosities $L_{\rm Edd}$. The true luminosity in ULXs is actually only of order $L_{\rm Edd}$, for {\it stellar-mass} accretors, but has a very anisotropic (`beamed') component, plus a near-isotropic component of similar luminosity but much lower specific intensity. Observers viewing ULXs from within the beam but assuming spherical symmetry deduce a luminosity $\gg L_{\rm Edd}$. These features appear because the accretors are fed mass at highly super-Eddington rates, most of it expelled in high-speed ($v &gt;0.2c$) outflows from the accretion disc.
  I show that in similarly-beamed AGN, emission-line properties would be essentially the same as in unbeamed sources, but standard virial mass indicators unusable because velocity widths are dominated by the outflows, not bound motions about the black holes. In an ensemble of this kind the apparently most luminous systems are always the most distant, but have the lowest black hole masses. Interpreting observations of this ensemble without knowing that they are beamed leads instead to very high black hole mass estimates. The analogy with ULXs therefore suggests that high-redshift quasars might actually have central black hole masses which could have grown from stellar values within the lookback time. I consider how one might test these ideas observationally.</description>
