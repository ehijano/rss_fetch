      <title>Zeros and Orthogonality of generalized Fibonacci polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper analyzes the concept of orthogonality in second-order polynomial sequences that have Binet formula similar to that of the Fibonacci and Lucas numbers, referred to as Generalized Fibonacci Polynomials (GFP). We give a technique to find roots of the GFP. As a corollary of this result, we give an alternative proof of a special case of Favard's Theorem. The general case of Favard's Theorem guarantees that there is a measure to determine whether a sequence of second-order polynomials is orthogonal or not. However, the theorem does not provide an explicit such measure. Our special case gives both the explicit measure and the relationship between the second-order recurrence and orthogonality, demonstrating whether the GFP polynomials are orthogonal or not. This allows us to classify which of familiar GFPs are orthogonal and which are not. Some familiar orthogonal polynomials include the Fermat, Fermat-Lucas, both types of Chebyshev polynomials, both types of Morgan-Voyce polynomials, and Vieta and Vieta-Lucas polynomials. However, we prove that the Fibonacci, Lucas, Pell, and Pell-Lucas sequences are not orthogonal.
  In Section \ref{sectionrw}, we give a brief description of discrete--time and continuous--time Morkov chains with special emphasis on birth-and-death stochastic processes.
  We find sufficient conditions on the polynomial's coefficients under which a given family of orthogonal polynomial induces a Markov chain. These families of orthogonal polynomials include Chebyshev polynomials of first kind and Fermat-Lucas.
  In the final section, we highlight some connections between orthogonal polynomials and Markov processes. These relations are not new but seem to have been somewhat forgotten. We do so to draw the attention of researchers in the orthogonal polynomial and probability communities for further collaboration.</description>

      <title>Monadic non-definability and gain-graphic matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analogue of a Myhill-Nerode characterisation which will allow us to prove that classes of hypergraphs cannot be defined by sentences in the counting monadic second-order logic of hypergraphs. We apply this to classes of gain-graphic matroids, and show that if the group $\Gamma$ is not uniformly locally finite, then the class of $\Gamma$-gain-graphic matroids is not monadically definable. (A group is uniformly locally finite if and only if there is a maximum size amongst subgroups generated by at most $k$ elements, for every $k$.) In addition, we define the conviviality graph of a group, and show that if the group $\Gamma$ has an infinite conviviality graph, then the class of $\Gamma$-gain-graphic matroids is not monadically definable. This will be useful in future constructions.</description>

      <title>Improved upper bounds on color reversal by local inversions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of color reversal in bicolored graphs under local inversions. A \emph{bicoloration} of a graph $G=(V,E)$ is a mapping $\beta: V \to \{-1,1\}$. A \emph{local inversion} at a vertex $v \in V$ consists of reversing the colors of all neighbors of $v$ and replacing the subgraph induced by these neighbors with its complement, while leaving $v$ and the rest of $G$ unchanged. Sabidussi (Discrete Mathematics, 1987) showed that any bicolored graph on $n$ vertices without isolated vertices can be color-reversed (that is, all vertex colors flipped while preserving the underlying graph) in at most $6n+3$ local inversions, and that any bicolored graph can be transformed into another bicolored graph on the same underlying graph in at most $9n$ local inversions. We improve both bounds: we prove that the first task can be accomplished in at most $4n-3$ local inversions, and the second in at most $ \left \lfloor \frac{11n-3}{2} \right \rfloor$ local inversions. Furthermore, we show that for stars and complete graphs, color reversal can be performed with at most $3n$ local inversions.</description>

      <title>Radio gracefulness of Moore graphs and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of radio graceful labelings is motivated by modeling efficient frequency assignment to radio towers, cellular towers, and satellite networks. For a simple, connected graph $G = (V(G), E(G))$, a radio labeling is a mapping $f: V(G) \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}^+$ satisfying (for any distinct vertices $u,v$) $$|f(u)-f(v)| + d(u,v) \geq diam(G)+1,$$ where $d(u,v)$ is the distance between $u$ and $v$ in $G$ and $diam(G)$ is the diameter of $G$. A graph is radio graceful if there is a radio labeling such that $f(V(G)) = \{1, \dots, |V(G)|\}$. In this paper, we determine the radio gracefulness of low-diameter graphs with connections to high-performance computing, including Moore graphs, bipartite Moore graphs, and approximate Moore graphs like $(r,g)-$cages, Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi polarity graphs, and McKay-Miller-\v{S}ir\'a\v{n} graphs. We prove a new necessary and sufficient condition for radio graceful bipartite graphs with diameter $3$. We compute the radio number of $(r,g)-$cages arising from generalized $n-$gons. Additionally, we determine Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi polarity graphs and McKay-Miller-\v{S}ir\'a\v{n} graphs are radio graceful.</description>

      <title>On the maximal size of $(a,b)$-town$\pmod k$ families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A family $\mathcal{F}\subseteq\mathcal{P}(n)$ is an $(a,b)$-town$\pmod k$ if all sets in it have cardinality $a\pmod k$ and all pairwise intersections in it have cardinality $b\pmod k$. For $k=2$ the maximal size of such a family is known for each $a,b$, while for $k=3$ only $b-a\equiv 2 \pmod 3$ is fully understood. We provide a bound for $k=3$ when $b-a\equiv 1 \pmod 3$ and $n\equiv 2 \pmod 3$, which turns out to be tight for infinitely many such $n$. We also give sufficient conditions on the parameters $a,b,k,n$, which result in a better bound than the one from general settings by Ray-Chaudhuri--Wilson, in particular showing that this bound occurs infinitely often in a sense where all of $a,b,n$ can vary for a fixed $k$.</description>

      <title>Equal knapsack identities between symmetric group character degrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a series of ``knapsack'' type equalities for irreducible character degrees of symmetric groups. That is, we find disjoint subsets of the partitions of $n$ so that the two corresponding character-degree sums are equal. Our main result refines our recent description of the Riordan numbers as the sum of all character degrees $f^\lambda$ where $\lambda$ is a partition of $n$ into three parts of the same parity. In particular, the sum of the ``fat-hook'' degrees $f^{(k,k,1^{n-2k})}+f^{(k+1,k+1,1^{n-2k-2})}$ equals the sum of all $f^\lambda$ where $\lambda$ has three parts, with the second equal to $k$ and the second and third of equal parity. We further prove an infinite family of additional ``knapsack'' identities between character degrees</description>

      <title>Hook immanantal inequalities for totally nonnegative matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a weakly decreasing positive integer sequence $\lambda = (\lambda_1,\dotsc,\lambda_\ell)$ summing to $n$, let $\chi^\lambda$ denote the irreducible character of the symmetric group $S_n$ indexed by $\lambda$. This representation has dimension $\chi^\lambda(e)$, where $e$ is the identity element of $S_n$. Let $\mathrm{Imm}_{\chi^\lambda}$ denote the corresponding irreducible character immanant, the function on $n \times n$ matrices $A = (a_{i,j})$ defined by $\mathrm{Imm}_{\chi^\lambda}(A) := \sum_{w \in S_n} \chi^\lambda(w) a_{1,w_1} \cdots a_{n,w_n}$. Merris conjectured [Linear Multilinear Algebra 14 (1983) pp. 21--35] and Heyfron proved [Linear Multilinear Algebra 24 (1988) pp. 65--78] that irreducible character immanants indexed by ``hook'' sequences $(k, 1, \dotsc, 1)$ satisfy the inequalities $\mathrm{per}(A)=\frac{\mathrm{Imm}_{\chi^n}(A)}{\chi^{n}(e)}\geq \frac{\mathrm{Imm}_{\chi^{n-1,1}}(A)}{\chi^{n-1,1}(e)}\geq \frac{\mathrm{Imm}_{\chi^{ n-2,1,1}}(A)}{\chi^{n-2,1,1}(e)}\geq \cdots \geq \frac{\mathrm{Imm}_{\chi^{1,\dotsc,1}}(A)}{\chi^{1,\dotsc,1}(e)}=\det(A)$ whenever $A$ is an $n \times n$ Hermitian positive semidefinite matrix. We prove that the same inequalities hold whenever $A$ is an $n \times n$ totally nonnegative matrix.</description>

      <title>A Note on Tur\'an Numbers and the Erd\H{o}s-Stone-Simonovits Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a fixed graph H, we say that a graph G is H-free if G does not contain H as a subgraph. The Tur\'an number ex(n, H) of H is the maximum number of edges in an n-vertex H-free graph. The study of Tur\'an number of graphs is a central topic in extremal graph theory. The purpose of this article is to present some well-known results about this field but also to prove the Erd\H{o}s-Stone-Simonovits theorem in an original manner.</description>

      <title>Latin squares with three disjoint subsquares of the same order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an integer partition $P = (h_1h_2\dots h_k)$ of $n$, a realization of $P$ is a latin square with disjoint subsquares of orders $h_1,h_2,\dots,h_k$. Most known results restrict either $k$ or the number of different integers in $P$. There is little known for partitions with arbitrary $k$ and subsquares of at least three orders. It has been conjectured that if $h_1=h_2=h_3\geq h_4\geq\dots\geq h_k$ then a realization of $P$ always exists. We prove this conjecture, and thus show the existence of realizations for many general partitions.</description>

      <title>Throttling for metric dimension and its variants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metric dimension is a graph parameter that has been applied to robot navigation and finding low-dimensional vector embeddings. Throttling entails minimizing the sum of two available resources when solving certain graph problems. In this paper, we introduce throttling for metric dimension, edge metric dimension, and mixed metric dimension. In the context of vector embeddings, metric dimension throttling finds a low-dimensional, low-magnitude embedding with integer coordinates. We show that computing the throttling number is NP-hard for all three variants. We give formulas for the throttling numbers of special families of graphs, and characterize graphs with extremal throttling numbers. We also prove that the minimum possible throttling number of a graph of order $n$ is $\Theta\left(\frac{\log{n}}{\log{\log{n}}}\right)$, while the minimum possible throttling number of a tree of order $n$ is $\Theta(n^{1/3})$ or $\Theta(n^{1/2})$ depending on the variant of metric dimension.</description>

      <title>A note on the $k$-defect number: Vertex Coloring with a Fixed Number of Monochromatic Edges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce and study a novel graph parameter called the $k$-defect number, denoted $\phi_{k}(G)$, for a graph $G$ and an integer $0\leq k\leq |E(G)|$. Unlike traditional defective colorings that bound the local degree within monochromatic components, the $k$-defect number represents the smallest number of colors required to achieve a vertex coloring of $G$ having exactly \emph{$k$ monochromatic edges (also termed ``bad edges")}. This parameter generalizes the well-known chromatic number of a graph, $\chi (G)$, which is precisely $\phi _{0}(G)$. We establish fundamental properties of the $k$-defect number and derive bounds on $\phi _{k}(G)$ for specific graph classes, including trees, cycles, and wheels. Furthermore, we extend and generalize several classical properties of the chromatic number to this new edge-centric $k$-defect framework for values of $1\leq k\leq |E(G)|$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a new Rogers--Ramanujan type identity for overpartitions by extending the asymmetrical version of Schur's theorem due to Lovejoy to a broader class of infinite products. More precisely, we provide a combinatorial interpretation of the following product, for any positive integer $k$, as a generating function for a class of overpartitions in which parts appear in $2^k - 1$ colors: \[ \frac{(-y_1 q;q)_\infty \cdots (-y_k q;q)_\infty}{(y_1 d q;q)_\infty}. \] Our proof is bijective and unifies two earlier approaches: Lovejoy's bijective proof of the asymmetrical Schur theorem and the iterative-bijective technique developed by Corteel and Lovejoy.</description>

      <title>Cube Height, Cube Width and Related Extremal Problems for Posets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a poset $P$, a family $\mathcal{S}=\{S_x:x\in P\}$ of sets indexed by the elements of $P$ is called an inclusion representation of $P$ if $x\leqslant y$ in $P$ if and only if $S_x\subseteq S_y$. The cube height of a poset is the least non-negative integer $h$ such that $P$ has an inclusion representation for which every set has size at most $h$. In turn, the cube width of $P$ is the least non-negative integer $w$ for which there is an inclusion representation $\mathcal{S}$ of $P$ such that $|\bigcup\mathcal{S}|=w$ and every set in $\mathcal{S}$ has size at most the cube height of $P$. In this paper, we show that the cube width of a poset never exceeds the size of its ground set, and we characterize those posets for which this inequality is tight. Our research prompted us to investigate related extremal problems for posets and inclusion representations. Accordingly, the results for cube width are obtained as extensions of more comprehensive results that we believe to be of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: Coxeter pointed out that a number of polytopes can be projected orthogonally into two dimensions in such a way that their vertices lie on a number of concentric regular triacontagons (or 30-gons). Among them are the 600-cell and 120-cell in four dimensions and Gosset's polytope in eight dimensions. We show how these projections can be modified into Kochen-Secker diagrams from which parity proofs of the Bell-Kochen-Specker theorem are easily extracted. Our construction trivially yields parity proofs of fifteen bases for all theree polytopes and also allows many other proofs of the same type to be constructed for two of them. The defining feature of these proofs is that they have a fifteen-fold symmetry about the center of the Kochen-Specker diagram and thus involve both rays and bases that are multiples of fifteen. Any proof of this type can be written as a word made up of an odd number of distinct letters, each representing an orbit of fifteen bases. Knowing a word makes it possible to write down all the features of the associated proof without first having to recover its bases. A comparison is made with earlier approaches that have been used to obtain parity proofs in these polytopes, and two questions related to possible applications of these polytopes are raised.</description>

      <title>Inverse Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials of matroids under deletion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a deletion formula for the inverse Kazhdan--Lusztig polynomial and the inverse $Z$-polynomial of a matroid. Our formulas provide analogues to the deletion formulas of Braden--Vysogorets for Kazhdan--Lusztig and $Z$-polynomials. We discuss several consequences, which include closed formulas and recursions for these invariants on uniform matroids, projective geometries, glued cycles, and arbitrary matroids of corank $2$. As a relevant application of our deletion formula, we show the existence of a matroid of rank $19$ which disproves a conjecture of Xie and Zhang concerning a real-rootedness property of inverse Kazhdan--Lusztig polynomials.</description>

      <title>On partitions associated with elementary symmetric polynomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The elementary symmetric partition function is a map on the set of partitions. It sends a partition lambda to the partition whose parts are the summands in the evaluation of the elementary symmetric function on the parts of lambda. These elementary symmetric partition functions have been studied before, and are related to plethysm. In this note, we study properties of the elementary symmetric partition functions, particularly related to injectivity and the number of parts appearing in their image partitions.</description>

      <title>Degree sequences realizing labelled perfect matchings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $n\in \mathbb{N}$ and $d_1 \geq d_2 \geq d_n\geq 1$ be integers. There is characterization of when $(d_1, d_1, \ldots, d_n)$ is the degree sequence of a graph containing a perfect matching, due to results of Lov\'{a}sz (1974) and Erd\H{o}s and Gallai (1960). But \emph{which} perfect matchings can be realized in the labelled graph? Here we find the extremal answers to this question, showing that the sequence $(d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n)$: (1) can realize a perfect matching iff it can realize $\{(1, n), (2,n-1), \ldots, (n/2, n/2+1)\}$, and; (2) can realize any perfect matching iff it can realize $\{(1, 2), (3,4), \ldots, (n-1, n)\}$. Our main result is a characterization of when (2) occurs, extending the work of Lov\'{a}sz and Erd\H{o}s and Gallai. Separately, we are also able to establish a conjecture of Yin and Busch, Ferrera, Hartke, Jacobsen, Kaul, and West about packing graphic sequences, establishing a degree-sequence analog of the Sauer-Spencer packing theorem. We conjecture an $h$-factor analog of our main result, and discuss implications for packing $h$ disjoint perfect matchings.</description>

      <title>On Graphical Partitions with Restricted Parts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the distributions of parts in random integer partitions subject to general arithmetic restrictions. In particular, we enumerate restricted graphical partitions of an even integer $n$ and identify the conditions under which the fraction of graphical partitions, relative to all restricted partitions, is maximal. We prove that this maximal fraction is asymptotically $O(n^{-1/2})$. Furthermore, for any set of arithmetic restrictions, we establish the existence of a minimal lower bound on the parts beyond which the influence of these restrictions on the fraction of graphical partitions becomes negligible; in this regime, the fraction depends primarily on the choice of this lower bound. We highlight a key example of partitions restricted to powers of 2, where the critical lower bound is found to be $\frac{1}{2}n^{\log2}+O(\log n)$.</description>

      <title>On minimal product-one sequences of maximal length over the non-abelian group of order $pq$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group. A sequence over $G$ is a finite multiset of elements of $G$, and it is called product-one if its terms can be ordered so that their product is the identity of $G$. The large Davenport constant $\D(G)$ is the maximal length of a minimal product-one sequence, that is, a product-one sequence that cannot be partitioned into two nontrivial product-one subsequences. Let $p,q$ be odd prime numbers with $p \mid q-1$ and let $C_q \rtimes C_p$ denote the non-abelian group of order $pq$. It is known that $\D(C_q \rtimes C_p) = 2q$. In this paper, we describe all minimal product-one sequences of length $2q$ over $C_q \rtimes C_p$. As an application, we further investigate the $k$-th elasticity (and, consequently, the union of sets containing $k$) of the monoid of product-one sequences over these groups.</description>

      <title>Further Applications of Cubic $q$-Binomial Transformations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider \begin{align*} G(N,M;\alpha,\beta,K,q) = \sum\limits_{j\in\mathbb{Z}}(-1)^jq^{\frac{1}{2}Kj((\alpha+\beta)j+\alpha-\beta)}\left[\begin{matrix}M+N\\N-Kj\end{matrix}\right]_{q}. \end{align*} In this paper, we prove the non-negativity of coefficients of some cases of $G(N,M;\alpha,\beta,K,q)$. For instance, for non-negative integers $n$ and $t$, we prove that \begin{align*} G\left(n,n;\frac{4}{3}+\frac{3(3^t-1)}{2},\frac{5}{3}+\frac{3(3^t-1)}{2},3^{t+1},q\right) \end{align*} and \begin{align*} G\left(n-\frac{3^t-1}{2},n+\frac{3^t+1}{2};\frac{8}{3}+2(3^t-1),\frac{4}{3}-(3^t-1),3^{t+1},q\right)\\ \end{align*} are polynomials in $q$ with non-negative coefficients. Using cubic positivity preserving transformations of Berkovich and Warnaar and some known formulae arising from Rogers-Szeg\"{o} polynomials, we establish new identities such as \begin{align*} \sum\limits_{0\le 3j\le n}\dfrac{(q^3;q^3)_{n-j-1}(1-q^{2n})q^{3j^2}}{(q;q)_{n-3j}(q^6;q^6)_{j}} = \sum\limits_{j=-\infty}^{\infty}(-1)^jq^{6j^2}{2n\brack n-3j}_q. \end{align*}</description>

      <title>Complexity of the Zero Set of a Matrix Schubert Ideal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $T$-varieties are normal varieties equipped with an action of an algebraic torus $T$. When the action is effective, the complexity of a $T$-variety $X$ is $\dim(X)-\dim(T)$. Matrix Schubert varieties, introduced by Fulton in 1992, are $T$-varieties consisting of $n \times n$ matrices satisfying certain constraints on the ranks of their submatrices. In this paper, we focus on the complexity of certain torus-fixed affine subvarieties of matrix Schubert varieties. Concretely, given a matrix Schubert variety $\overline{X_{w}}$ where $w\in S_n$, we study the complexity of $Y_w$ obtained by the decomposition $\overline{X_{w}} = Y_{w} \times \mathbb{C}^{k}$ with $k$ as large as possible. Building up from results by Escobar and M\'{e}sz\'{a}ros and Donten-Bury, Escobar, and Portakal, we show that for a fixed $n$, the complexity of $Y_{w}$ with respect to this action can be any integer between $0$ and $(n-1)(n-3)$, except $1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study topological aspects of supersolvable abelian arrangements, toric arrangements in particular. The complement of such an arrangement sits atop a tower of fiber bundles, and we investigate the relationship between these bundles and bundles involving classical configuration spaces. In the toric case, we show that the monodromy of a supersolvable arrangement bundle factors through the Artin braid group, and that of a strictly supersolvable arrangement bundle factors further through the Artin pure braid group. The latter factorization is particularly informative -- we use it to determine a number of invariants of the complement of a strictly supersolvable arrangement, including the cohomology ring and the lower central series Lie algebra of the fundamental group.</description>

      <title>Torus Actions on Matrix Schubert and Kazhdan-Lusztig Varieties, and their Links to Statistical Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00250v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the toric geometry of two families of generalised determinantal varieties arising from permutations: Matrix Schubert varieties ($\overline{X_w}$) and Kazhdan-Lusztig varieties ($\mathcal{N}_{v,w}$). Matrix Schubert varieties can be written as $\overline{X_w} = Y_w \times \mathbb C^d$, where $d$ is maximal. We are especially interested in the structure and complexity of these varieties $Y_w$ and $\mathcal{N}_{v,w}$ under the so-called usual torus actions. In the case when $Y_w$ is toric, we provide a full characterisation of the simple reflections $s_i$ that render ${Y_{w \cdot s_i}}$ toric, as well as the corresponding changes to the weight cone. For Kazhdan-Lusztig varieties, we consider how moving one of the two permutations $v,w$ along a chain in the Bruhat poset affects their complexity. Additionally, we study the complexity of these varieties, for permutations $v$ and $w$ of a specific structure. Finally, we consider the links between these determinantal varieties and two classes of statistical models; namely conditional independence and quasi-independence models.</description>

Abstract: We prove central limit theorems for the number of descents and the number of inversions after a shelf-shuffle. In particular, we bound the convergence rate for the number of inversions independently of the number of shelves. Along the way, we determine the mean and variance for the number of inversions after a shelf shuffle, which was also an open problem. We also suggest ways to extend our results to biased shelf-shuffles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss smooth functions which are Morse on preimages of values not being local extrema. We call such a function internally Morse or I-Morse.
  The Reeb graph of a smooth function is the space of all connected components of preimages of single points of it topologized with the natural quotient topology of the manifolds and a vertex of it is a point corresponding to a preimage with critical points. A smooth function is neat with respect to the Reeb graph or N-Reeb if the preimages of the vertices are the closed subsets in the manifolds of the domains with interiors being empty.
  We discuss I-Morse and N-Reeb functions, IN-Morse-Reeb functions. Our main result presents an IN-Morse-Reeb function respecting two such functions, on a connected sum of these given manifolds.</description>

      <title>On global isomorphisms and a closure property of semigroups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $S$ be a semigroup (written multiplicatively). Endowed with the operation of setwise multiplication induced by $S$ on its parts, the non-empty subsets of $S$ form themselves a semigroup, denoted by $\mathcal P(S)$. Accordingly, we say that a semigroup $H$ is globally isomorphic to a semigroup $K$ if $\mathcal P(H)$ is isomorphic to $\mathcal P(K)$; and that a class $\mathscr C$ of semigroups is globally closed if a semigroup in $\mathscr C$ can only be globally isomorphic to an isomorphic copy of a semigroup in the same class.
  We show that the classes of groups, torsion-free monoids, and numerical monoids are each globally closed. The first result extends a 1967 theorem of Shafer, while the last relies non-trivially on the second and on a classical theorem of Kneser from additive number theory.</description>

In this note, we present a simplified proof of this monotonicity by slightly modifying Banaszczyk's transform, so that it interacts smoothly with Ehrhard symmetrizations, thereby yielding a somewhat easier proof of the 5K-theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a bipartite graph that has a perfect matching, a prefect proportional allocation is an assignment of positive weights to the nodes of the right partition so that every left node is fractionally assigned to its neighbors in proportion to their weights, and these assignments define a fractional perfect matching. We prove that a bipartite graph has a perfect proportional allocation if and only if it is matching covered, by using a classical result on matrix scaling. We also present an extension of this result to provide simple proportional allocations in non-matching-covered bipartite graphs.</description>

Abstract: As a result of 33 intercontinental Zoom calls, we characterise big Ramsey degrees of the generic partial order. This is an infinitary extension of the well known fact that finite partial orders endowed with linear extensions form a Ramsey class (this result was announced by Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il and R\"odl in 1984 with first published proof by Paoli, Trotter and Walker in 1985). Towards this, we refine earlier upper bounds obtained by Hubi\v{c}ka based on a new connection of big Ramsey degrees to the Carlson-Simpson theorem and we also introduce a new technique of giving lower bounds using an iterated application of the upper-bound theorem.</description>

      <title>Extending simple monotone drawings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the following variant of Levi's Enlargement Lemma: for an arbitrary arrangement $\mathcal{A}$ of $x$-monotone pseudosegments in the plane and a pair of points $a,b$ with distinct $x$-coordinates and not on the same pseudosegment, there exists a simple $x$-monotone curve with endpoints $a,b$ that intersects every curve of $\mathcal{A}$ at most once. As a consequence, every simple monotone drawing of a graph can be extended to a simple monotone drawing of a complete graph. We also show that extending an arrangement of cylindrically monotone pseudosegments is not always possible; in fact, the corresponding decision problem is NP-hard.</description>

      <title>Designs in finite classical polar spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11188v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Combinatorial designs have been studied for nearly 200 years. Fifty years ago, Cameron, Delsarte, and Ray-Chaudhury started investigating their q-analogs, also known as subspace designs or designs over finite fields.
  Designs can be defined analogously in finite classical polar spaces, too. The definition includes the m-regular systems from projective geometry as the special case where the blocks are generators of the polar space. The first nontrivial such designs for t &gt; 1 were found by De Bruyn and Vanhove in 2012, and some more designs appeared recently in the PhD thesis of Lansdown.
  In this article, we investigate the theory of classical and subspace designs for applicability to designs in polar spaces, explicitly allowing arbitrary block dimensions. In this way, we obtain divisibility conditions on the parameters, derived and residual designs, intersection numbers and an analog of Fisher's inequality. We classify the parameters of symmetric designs. Furthermore, we conduct a computer search to construct designs of strength t=2, resulting in designs for more than 140 previously unknown parameter sets in various classical polar spaces over GF(2) and GF(3).</description>

      <title>Towards a classification of $1$-homogeneous distance-regular graphs with positive intersection number $a_1$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01134v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a graph with diameter at least two. Then $\Gamma$ is said to be $1$-homogeneous (in the sense of Nomura) whenever for every pair of adjacent vertices $x$ and $y$ in $\Gamma$, the distance partition of the vertex set of $\Gamma$ with respect to both $x$ and $y$ is equitable, and the parameters corresponding to equitable partitions are independent of the choice of $x$ and $y$. Assume that $\Gamma$ is $1$-homogeneous distance-regular with intersection number $a_1&gt;0$ and diameter $D\geqslant 5$. Define $b=b_1/(\theta_1+1)$, where $b_1$ is the intersection number and $\theta_1$ is the second largest eigenvalue of $\Gamma$. We show that if intersection number $c_2$ is at least $2$, then $b\geqslant 1$ and one of the following (i)--(vi) holds: (i) $\Gamma$ is a regular near $2D$-gon, (ii) $\Gamma$ is a Johnson graph $J(2D,D)$, (iii) $\Gamma$ is a halved $\ell$-cube with $\ell \in \{2D,2D+1\}$, (iv) $\Gamma$ is a folded Johnson graph $\bar{J}(4D,2D)$, (v) $\Gamma$ is a folded halved $4D$-cube, (vi) the valency of $\Gamma$ is bounded by a function of $b$. Using this result, we characterize $1$-homogeneous graphs with classical parameters and $a_1&gt;0$, as well as tight distance-regular graphs.</description>

      <title>The degree of functions in the Johnson and q-Johnson schemes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1982, Cameron and Liebler investigated certain "special sets of lines" in PG(3,q), and gave several equivalent characterizations. Due to their interesting geometric and algebraic properties, these "Cameron-Liebler line classes" got much attention. Several generalizations and variants have been considered in the literature, the main directions being a variation of the dimensions of the involved spaces, and studying the analogous situation in the subset lattice. An important tool is the interpretation of the objects as Boolean functions in the "Johnson" and "q-Johnson schemes".
  In this article, we develop a unified theory covering all these variations. Generalized versions of algebraic and geometric properties will be investigated, having a parallel in the notion of "designs" and "antidesigns" in association schemes, which is connected to Delsarte's concept of "design-orthogonality". This leads to a natural definition of the "degree" and the "weights" of functions in the ambient scheme, refining the existing definitions. We will study the effect of dualization and of elementary modifications of the ambient space on the degree and the weights. Moreover, a divisibility property of the sizes of Boolean functions of degree t will be proven.</description>

      <title>Completing the enumeration of inversion sequences avoiding one or two patterns of length 3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07701v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present four constructions of inversion sequences, and use them to compute the enumeration sequences of 24 classes of pattern-avoiding inversion sequences. This completes the enumeration of inversion sequences avoiding one or two patterns of length 3. Some of our constructions are based on generating trees. Others involve pattern-avoiding words, which we also count using generating trees. To solve some of these cases, we introduce a generalization of inversion sequences, which we call shifted inversion sequences. Lastly, we briefly discuss the asymptotics of pattern-avoiding inversion sequences, focusing on their exponential or super-exponential behavior.</description>

      <title>A Study On The Graph Formulation Of Union Closed Sets Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02221v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Union Closed Sets Conjecture is one of the most renowned problems in combinatorics. Its appeal lies in the simplicity of its statement contrasted with the potential complexity of its resolution. The conjecture posits that, in any union closed family of sets, there exists at least one element that appears in at least half of the sets within the family.
  We establish the graph-theoretic version of certain set-theoretic results by connecting the set-based and graph-based formulations. We then prove a theorem in which we investigate the conjecture for graphs, focusing on their decompositions and the position of certain pendant vertices. As a result, we extend the validity of the conjecture to a broader class of graph structures.</description>

      <title>Twenty years of Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il's classification programme of Ramsey classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17293v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the 1970s, structural Ramsey theory emerged as a new branch of combinatorics. This development came with the isolation of the concepts of the $\mathbf{A}$-Ramsey property and Ramsey class. Following the influential Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il-R\"odl theorem, several Ramsey classes have been identified. In the 1980s, Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il, inspired by a seminar of Lachlan, discovered a crucial connection between Ramsey classes and Fra\"iss\'e classes, and, in his 1989 paper, connected the classification programme of homogeneous structures to structural Ramsey theory. In 2005, Kechris, Pestov, and Todor\v{c}evi\'c revitalized the field by connecting Ramsey classes to topological dynamics. This breakthrough motivated Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il to propose a program for classifying Ramsey classes. We review the progress made on this program in the past two decades, list open problems, and discuss recent extensions to new areas, namely the extension property for partial automorphisms (EPPA), and big Ramsey structures.</description>

      <title>Power sum expansions for Kromatic symmetric functions using Lyndon heaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21285v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In arXiv:2301.02177, Crew, Pechenik, and Spirkl defined the Kromatic symmetric function $\overline{X}_G$ as a $K$-analogue of Stanley's chromatic symmetric function $X_G$, and one question they asked was how $\overline{X}_G$ expands in their $\overline{p}_\lambda$ basis, which they defined as a $K$-analogue of the classic power sum basis $p_\lambda.$ In arXiv:2408.01395, we gave a formula that partially answered this question but did not explain the combinatorial significance of the coefficients. Here, we give combinatorial descriptions for the $\overline{p}$-coefficients of $\overline{X}_G$ and $\omega(\overline{X}_G)$, lifting the $p$-expansion of $X_G$ in terms of acyclic orientations that was given by Bernardi and Nadeau in arXiv:1904.01262. We also propose an alternative $K$-analogue $\overline{p}'$ of the $p$-basis that gives slightly cleaner expansion formulas. Our expansions are based on Lyndon heaps, introduced by Lalonde (1995), which are representatives for certain equivalence classes of acyclic orientations on clan graphs of $G$. Additionally, we show that knowing $\overline{X}_G$ is equivalent to knowing the multiset of independence polynomials of induced subgraphs of $G$, which gives shorter proofs of all our results from arXiv:2403.15929 that $\overline{X}_G$ can be used to determine the number of copies in $G$ of certain induced subgraphs. We also give power sum expansions for the Kromatic quasisymmetric function $\overline{X}_G(q)$ defined by Marberg in arXiv:2312.16474 in the case where $G$ is the incomparability graph of a unit interval order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate $f$-Diophantine sets over finite fields via new explicit constructions of families of quasi-random hypergraphs from multivariate polynomials. In particular, our construction not only offers a systematic method for constructing quasi-random hypergraphs but also provides a unified framework for studying various hypergraphs arising from multivariate polynomials over finite fields, including Paley sum hypergraphs, and hypergraphs derived from Diophantine tuples and their generalizations. We derive an asymptotic formula for the number of $k$-Diophantine $m$-tuples, answering a question of Hammonds et al., and study some related questions for $f$-Diophantine sets, extending and improving several recent works. We also sharpen a classical estimate of Chung and Graham on even partial octahedrons in Paley sum hypergraphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07736v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a graph $\Gamma=(V(\Gamma),E(\Gamma))$, a subset $C$ of $V(\Gamma)$ is called an $(\alpha,\beta)$-regular set in $\Gamma$, if every vertex of $C$ is adjacent to exactly $\alpha$ vertices of $C$ and every vertex of $V(\Gamma)\setminus C$ is adjacent to exactly $\beta$ vertices of $C$. In particular, if $C$ is an $(\alpha,\beta)$-regular set in some Cayley sum graph of a finite group $G$ with connection set $S$, then $C$ is called an $(\alpha,\beta)$-regular set of $G$. In this paper, we consider a generalized dicyclic group $G$ and for each subgroup $H$ of $G$, by giving an appropriate connection set $S$, we determine each possibility for $(\alpha,\beta)$ such that $H$ is an $(\alpha,\beta)$-regular set of $G$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08680v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For an $r$-graph $F$, define Sidorenko exponent $s(F)$ as $$s(F):= \sup \{s \geq 0: \exists \text{$r$-graph $H$ s.t. } t_F(H) = t_{K^{(r)}_r} (H)^s &gt; 0\},$$ where $t_{H_1}(H_2)$ denotes the homomorphism density of $H_1$ in $H_2$. The celebrated Sidorenko's conjecture states that $s(F) = e(F)$ holds for every bipartite graph $F$. It is known that for all $r \geq 3$, the $r$-uniform version of Sidorenko's conjecture is false, and only a few hypergraphs are known to be Sidorenko. In this paper, we discover a new broad class of Sidorenko hypergraphs and obtain general upper bounds on $s(F)$ for certain hypergraphs related to dominating hypergraphs. This makes progress toward a problem raised by Nie and Spiro. We also discover a new connection between Sidorenko exponents and upper bounds on the extremal numbers of a large class of hypergraphs, which generalizes the hypergraph analogue of K\H{o}v\'{a}ri--S\'{o}s--Tur\'{a}n theorem proved by Erd\H{o}s.</description>

Abstract: For the finite ordered sets $A, D$, write $A^D$ for the ordered set of isotone maps $D \to A$ with the pointwise order. It was proved in earlier work that the order structure of $A^A$ determines~$A$ up to isomorphism. In this note we extend the result to higher function ordered sets such as $A^{(A^A)}$ and $(A^A)^A$. Our main theorem shows that the structure of $A^D$ determines~$A$.</description>

      <title>A Lower Bound for the Max Entropy Algorithm for TSP</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01950v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the most famous conjectures in combinatorial optimization is the four-thirds conjecture, which states that the integrality gap of the subtour LP relaxation of the TSP is equal to $\frac43$. For 40 years, the best known upper bound was 1.5, due to Wolsey (1980). Recently, Karlin, Klein, and Oveis Gharan (2022) showed that the max entropy algorithm for the TSP gives an improved bound of $1.5 - 10^{-36}$. In this paper, we show that the approximation ratio of the max entropy algorithm is at least 1.375, even for graphic TSP. Thus the max entropy algorithm does not appear to be the algorithm that will ultimately resolve the four-thirds conjecture in the affirmative, should that be possible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23996v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $b(n)$ be the number of partition triples $\pi=(\pi_1,\pi_2,\pi_3)$ of $n$ such that $\pi_1$ consists of distinct odd parts, and $\pi_2$ and $\pi_3$ consist of parts divisible by $4$. Utilizing modular forms, Lin obtained the generating functions for $b(3n+1)$ and $b(3n+2)$, which yields the congruence $b(3n+2)\equiv 0\pmod{3}$ for all $n\geq 0$. We provide in this note elementary proofs of these generating functions by employing $q$-series manipulations and dissection formulas. We also establish infinite families of internal congruences modulo $3$ for $b(n)$.</description>

Abstract: We introduce and study peak state transfer, a notion of high state transfer in qubit networks modeled by continuous-time quantum walks. Unlike perfect or pretty good state transfer, peak state transfer does not require fidelity arbitrarily close to 1, but crucially allows for an explicit determination of the time at which transfer occurs. We provide a spectral characterization of peak state transfer, which allows us to find many examples of peak state transfer, and we also establish tight lower bounds on fidelity and success probability. As a central example, we construct a family of weighted path graphs that admit peak state transfer over arbitrarily long distances with transfer probability approaching $\pi/4 \approx 0.78$. These graphs offer exponentially improved sensitivity over known perfect state transfer examples such as the weighted paths related to hypercubes, making them practical candidates for efficient quantum wires.</description>
