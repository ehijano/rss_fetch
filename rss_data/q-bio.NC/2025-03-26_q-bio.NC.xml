      <title>The Fragility of the Reverse Facilitation Effect in the Stroop Task: A Dynamic Neurocognitive Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In typical Stroop experiments, participants perform better when the colors and words are congruent compared to when they are incongruent or neutral. Paradoxically, in some experimental conditions, neutral trials are faster than congruent trials. This phenomenon is known as Reverse Facilitation Effect (RFE). However, RFE has not been consistently replicated, leading to the so-called fragile results. There are some models that capture this effect, but they are not parsimonious. Here we employed our previous model of priming effect, without its conflict monitoring module, to demonstrate that RFE, including its fragility, is mainly due to attentional dynamics with limited resources. The simulations of the RFE resulted from weak attentional activation for neutral stimuli (e.g., non-color or nonword strings) that causes less attentional refraction for the target stimuli (e.g., font colors). The refractory period or attenuation of attention usually happens when meaningful stimuli (color name primes) are used along font color targets. This simpler model provides a straightforward understanding of the underlying processes.</description>

      <title>GyralNet Subnetwork Partitioning via Differentiable Spectral Modularity Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the structural and functional organization of the human brain requires a detailed examination of cortical folding patterns, among which the three-hinge gyrus (3HG) has been identified as a key structural landmark. GyralNet, a network representation of cortical folding, models 3HGs as nodes and gyral crests as edges, highlighting their role as critical hubs in cortico-cortical connectivity. However, existing methods for analyzing 3HGs face significant challenges, including the sub-voxel scale of 3HGs at typical neuroimaging resolutions, the computational complexity of establishing cross-subject correspondences, and the oversimplification of treating 3HGs as independent nodes without considering their community-level relationships. To address these limitations, we propose a fully differentiable subnetwork partitioning framework that employs a spectral modularity maximization optimization strategy to modularize the organization of 3HGs within GyralNet. By incorporating topological structural similarity and DTI-derived connectivity patterns as attribute features, our approach provides a biologically meaningful representation of cortical organization. Extensive experiments on the Human Connectome Project (HCP) dataset demonstrate that our method effectively partitions GyralNet at the individual level while preserving the community-level consistency of 3HGs across subjects, offering a robust foundation for understanding brain connectivity.</description>

      <title>Information-Seeking Decision Strategies Mitigate Risk in Dynamic, Uncertain Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To survive in dynamic and uncertain environments, individuals must develop effective decision strategies that balance information gathering and decision commitment. Models of such strategies often prioritize either optimizing tangible payoffs, like reward rate, or gathering information to support a diversity of (possibly unknown) objectives. However, our understanding of the relative merits of these two approaches remains incomplete, in part because direct comparisons have been limited to idealized, static environments that lack the dynamic complexity of the real world. Here we compared the performance of normative reward- and information-seeking strategies in a dynamic foraging task. Both strategies show similar transitions between exploratory and exploitative behaviors as environmental uncertainty changes. However, we find subtle disparities in the actions they take, resulting in meaningful performance differences: whereas reward-seeking strategies generate slightly more reward on average, information-seeking strategies provide more consistent and predictable outcomes. Our findings support the adaptive value of information-seeking behaviors that can mitigate risk with minimal reward loss.</description>

      <title>Distinct social-linguistic processing between humans and large audio-language models: Evidence from model-brain alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Voice-based AI development faces unique challenges in processing both linguistic and paralinguistic information. This study compares how large audio-language models (LALMs) and humans integrate speaker characteristics during speech comprehension, asking whether LALMs process speaker-contextualized language in ways that parallel human cognitive mechanisms. We compared two LALMs' (Qwen2-Audio and Ultravox 0.5) processing patterns with human EEG responses. Using surprisal and entropy metrics from the models, we analyzed their sensitivity to speaker-content incongruency across social stereotype violations (e.g., a man claiming to regularly get manicures) and biological knowledge violations (e.g., a man claiming to be pregnant). Results revealed that Qwen2-Audio exhibited increased surprisal for speaker-incongruent content and its surprisal values significantly predicted human N400 responses, while Ultravox 0.5 showed limited sensitivity to speaker characteristics. Importantly, neither model replicated the human-like processing distinction between social violations (eliciting N400 effects) and biological violations (eliciting P600 effects). These findings reveal both the potential and limitations of current LALMs in processing speaker-contextualized language, and suggest differences in social-linguistic processing mechanisms between humans and LALMs.</description>

      <title>Reanimating Images using Neural Representations of Dynamic Stimuli</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02659v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While computer vision models have made incredible strides in static image recognition, they still do not match human performance in tasks that require the understanding of complex, dynamic motion. This is notably true for real-world scenarios where embodied agents face complex and motion-rich environments. Our approach, BrainNRDS (Brain-Neural Representations of Dynamic Stimuli), leverages state-of-the-art video diffusion models to decouple static image representation from motion generation, enabling us to utilize fMRI brain activity for a deeper understanding of human responses to dynamic visual stimuli. Conversely, we also demonstrate that information about the brain's representation of motion can enhance the prediction of optical flow in artificial systems. Our novel approach leads to four main findings: (1) Visual motion, represented as fine-grained, object-level resolution optical flow, can be decoded from brain activity generated by participants viewing video stimuli; (2) Video encoders outperform image-based models in predicting video-driven brain activity; (3) Brain-decoded motion signals enable realistic video reanimation based only on the initial frame of the video; and (4) We extend prior work to achieve full video decoding from video-driven brain activity. BrainNRDS advances our understanding of how the brain represents spatial and temporal information in dynamic visual scenes. Our findings demonstrate the potential of combining brain imaging with video diffusion models for developing more robust and biologically-inspired computer vision systems. We show additional decoding and encoding examples on this site: https://brain-nrds.github.io/.</description>

      <title>Multi-Site rs-fMRI Domain Alignment for Autism Spectrum Disorder Auxiliary Diagnosis Based on Hyperbolic Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05493v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Increasing the volume of training data can enable the auxiliary diagnostic algorithms for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) to learn more accurate and stable models. However, due to the significant heterogeneity and domain shift in rs-fMRI data across different sites, the accuracy of auxiliary diagnosis remains unsatisfactory. Moreover, there has been limited exploration of multi-source domain adaptation models on ASD recognition, and the interpretability of models is often poor. To address these challenges, we proposed a domain-adaptive algorithm based on hyperbolic space embedding. Hyperbolic space is naturally suited for representing the topology of complex networks such as brain functional networks. Therefore, we embedded the brain functional network into hyperbolic space and constructed the corresponding hyperbolic space community network to effectively extract latent representations. To address the heterogeneity of data across different sites and the issue of domain shift, we introduce a constraint loss function, Hyperbolic Maximum Mean Discrepancy (HMMD), to align the marginal distributions in the hyperbolic space. Additionally, we employ class prototype alignment to to mitigate discrepancies in conditional distributions across domains. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed algorithm shows superior classification performance for ASD compared with baseline models, and is more robust to multi-site heterogeneity.</description>

      <title>Communities in the Kuramoto Model: Dynamics and Detection via Path Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17546v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The behavior of multivariate dynamical processes is often governed by underlying structural connections that relate the components of the system. For example, brain activity which is often measured via time series is determined by an underlying structural graph, where nodes represent neurons or brain regions and edges represent cortical connectivity. Existing methods for inferring structural connections from observed dynamics, such as correlation-based or spectral techniques, may fail to fully capture complex relationships in high-dimensional time series in an interpretable way. Here, we propose the use of path signatures a mathematical framework that encodes geometric and temporal properties of continuous paths to address this problem. Path signatures provide a reparametrization-invariant characterization of dynamical data and, in particular, can be used to compute the lead matrix which reveals lead-lag phenomena. We showcase our approach on time series from coupled oscillators in the Kuramoto model defined on a stochastic block model graph, termed the Kuramoto stochastic block model (KSBM). Using mean-field theory and Gaussian approximations, we analytically derive reduced models of KSBM dynamics in different temporal regimes and theoretically characterize the lead matrix in these settings. Leveraging these insights, we propose a novel signature-based community detection algorithm, achieving exact recovery of structural communities from observed time series in multiple KSBM instances. Our results demonstrate that path signatures provide a novel perspective on analyzing complex neural data and other high-dimensional systems, explicitly exploiting temporal functional relationships to infer underlying structure.</description>
