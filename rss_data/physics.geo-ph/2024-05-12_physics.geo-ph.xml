      <title>Minimax polynomial ECEF to geodetic coordinate transformation approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Minimax polynomial ECEF to geodetic coordinate transformation approximations are presented, including often preferable n-vector versions. The approximations provide tunable computational-cost-to-accuracy trade-off and an unprecedented low latency down to an accuracy of $\sim10^{-5}$m, which is demonstrated in an extensive benchmark. This sets a new standard for fast ECEF to geodetic coordinate transformations and opens up a new realm of further improvement opportunities and extensions to other geodetic quantities.</description>

      <title>An explicit granular-mechanics approach to marine sediment acoustics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here we theoretically and computationally study the frequency dependence of phase speed and attenuation for marine sediments from the perspective of granular mechanics. We leverage recent theoretical insights from the granular physics community as well as discrete-element method simulations, where the granular material is treated as a packing of discrete objects that interact via pairwise forces. These pairwise forces include both repulsive contact forces as well as dissipative terms which may include losses from the fluid as well as losses from inelasticity at grain-grain contacts. We show that the structure of disordered granular packings leads to anomalous scaling laws for frequency-dependent phase speed and attenuation that do not follow from a continuum treatment. Our results demonstrate that granular packing structure, which is not explicitly considered in existing models, may play a crucial role in a complete theory of sediment acoustics. While this simple approach does not explicitly treat sound propagation or inertial effects in the interstitial fluid, it provides a starting point for future models that include these and other more complex features.</description>
