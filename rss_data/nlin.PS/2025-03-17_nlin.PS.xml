      <title>Perturbed Nonlinear Evolution of Optical Soliton Gases: Growth and Decay in Integrable Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present optical fiber experiments investigating the perturbed, non-integrable evolution of soliton gases (SGs) under weak linear damping and gain. By measuring the amplitude and phase of the optical field in a recirculating loop, we determine the spectral distribution of SGs at various propagation distances. We demonstrate that a SG, initially prepared as a soliton condensate with a Weyl distribution, undergoes significant changes in its spectral distribution due to dissipation. Specifically, weak gain leads to the emergence of a nearly monochromatic SG, while weak damping results in a SG with a semicircular spectral distribution at long propagation distances. These observed dissipation-driven changes in the SG's spectral characteristics are not explained by existing hydrodynamic or kinetic theories.</description>

      <title>Effect of oblique horizontal magnetic field on convection rolls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of external horizontal magnetic field applied on the convection rolls obliquely (at an angle $\phi$ with the $x$-axis) in electrically conducting low Prandtl number fluids under the paradigm of the Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard convection by performing three-dimensional direct numerical simulations. The control parameters, namely, the Chandrasekhar number ($\mathrm{Q}$) and the reduced Rayleigh number $r$ (ratio of Rayleigh number to critical Rayleigh number), are varied in the ranges $0 \leq \mathrm{Q} \leq 1000$ and $1 \leq r \leq 20$ for the Prandtl numbers $\mathrm{Pr} = 0.1$ and $0.2$ by considering three horizontal aspect ratios ($\Gamma$): $\frac{1}{2}$, $1$ and $2$. In the absence of the magnetic field, the convection starts in the form of steady rolls including the one parallel to the $x$-axis. As the oblique horizontal magnetic field is switched on at an angle $\phi \in (0^\circ, ~90^\circ]$ with the $x$-axis, it is observed that the Lorentz force generated by the component of the magnetic field transverse to the axis of the convection rolls inhibits convection in the form of steady rolls. Thus, with the application of the magnetic field, the convection is suppressed and restarts for a higher Rayleigh number in the form of steady convection rolls. The rolls can either be oriented along the $x$-axis (steady parallel rolls, SPR) or oriented at an angle $45^\circ$ (steady oblique rolls, SOR$^+$) with the $x$-axis depending on the choices of the parameters. A rich bifurcation structure with standing and traveling patterns emerges at higher $r$. The oscillatory instability of steady rolls scales as \( \mathrm{Q}^\alpha \) with distinct exponents for weak and strong magnetic fields. Additionally, heat transfer decreases with increasing \( \phi \) for given \( \mathrm{Q} \) and \( \mathrm{Pr} \).</description>

      <title>Dynamical field theories for biaxial liquid crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase field crystal (PFC) models constitute central tools for a microscopic understanding of the dynamics of complex systems in soft matter physics. They have found widespread application in the modeling of the uniaxial orientational ordering of liquid crystals. However, only very limited progress has been made in applying them to the more complex cases of biaxial phases and biaxial particles. Here, we discuss the microscopic derivation of PFC models for biaxial liquid crystals. We illustrate it by presenting two models, one involving four scalar orientational order parameters relevant for the dynamics of biaxial particles, and one involving two scalar order parameters and a director field to describe biaxial phases in a three-dimensional uniaxial nematic liquid crystal. These models allow for an efficient simulation of spatially inhomogeneous biaxial orientational ordering dynamics. We also combine a microscopic and macroscopic approach to extract model coefficients for a full biaxial model from the microscopic derivation for a simple special case. This universal method also enables to perform derivations for other low-symmetry particles where, due to the complexity of the general case, this has not been previously attempted.</description>

      <title>Breather interactions in the integrable discrete Manakov system and trigonometric Yang-Baxter maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of this work is to obtain a complete characterization of soliton and breather interactions in the integrable discrete Manakov (IDM) system, a vector generalization of the Ablowitz-Ladik model. The IDM system, which in the continuous limit reduces to the Manakov system (i.e., a 2-component vector nonlinear Schrodinger equation), was shown to admit a variety of discrete vector soliton solutions: fundamental solitons, fundamental breathers, and composite breathers. While the interaction of fundamental solitons was studied early on, no results are presently available for other types of soliton-breather and breather-breather interactions. Our study reveals that upon interacting with a fundamental breather, a fundamental soliton becomes a fundamental breather. Conversely, the interaction of two fundamental breathers generically yields two fundamental breathers with polarization shifts, but may also result in a fundamental soliton and a fundamental breather. Composite breathers interact trivially both with each other and with a fundamental soliton or breather. Explicit formulas for the scattering coefficients that characterize fundamental and composite breathers are given. This allows us to interpret the interactions in terms of a refactorization problem and derive the associated Yang-Baxter maps describing the effect of interactions on the polarizations. These give the first examples of parametric Yang-Baxter maps of trigonometric type.</description>

      <title>3D morphology formation in a mixture of three differently averse components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Film formation from solvent evaporation in polymer ternary solutions is relevant for several technological applications, such as the fabrication of organic solar cells. The performance of the final device will strongly depend on the internal morphology of the obtained film, which, in turn, is affected by the processing conditions. We are interested in modeling morphology formation in 3D for ternary mixtures using both a lattice model and its continuous counterpart in the absence of evaporation. In our previous works, we found that, in 2D, both models predict the existence of two distinct regimes: (i) a low-solvent regime, characterized by two interpenetrated domains of the two polymers, and (ii) a high-solvent regime, where isolated polymer domains are dispersed in the solvent background. In the significantly more intriguing 3D case, we observe a comparable scenario both for the discrete and the continuous model. The lattice model reveals its ability to describe morphology formation even in the high solvent content 3D case, in which the three-dimensional nature of space could have prevented cluster formation.</description>
