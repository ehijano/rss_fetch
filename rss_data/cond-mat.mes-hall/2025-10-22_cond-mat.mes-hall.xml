      <title>Interplay of Noise and Reservoir-induced Decoherence in Persistent Currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Persistent current is a hallmark of quantum phase coherence. We study the fate of the persistent current in a non-equilibrium setting, where a tight-binding ring is subjected to stochastic disorder as well as a fermionic reservoir attached to each site. We evaluate the current using Keldysh technique and find that it exhibits non-monotonic behavior, suggesting two distinct mechanisms of decoherence. While coupling to the reservoirs introduces a coherence length scale given by the inverse of the coupling strength, the other mechanism is more subtle and driven by the ratio of noise strength to reservoir coupling. The interplay of noise and reservoir constitutes a purely non-equilibrium steady state with a flatter distribution function that we effectively describe using classical rate equations. We discuss possibilities of realizing our findings in ultracold-atom experiments.</description>

      <title>Magnus Induced Magnetic Diode Effect in Skyrmion Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that skyrmions can exhibit what we call a magnetic diode effect, where there is a nonreciprocal response in the transport when the magnetic field is reversed. This effect can be achieved for skyrmions moving in a channel with a sawtooth potential on one side and a reversed sawtooth potential on the other side. We consider the cases of both spin-transfer torque (STT) and spin-orbit torque (SOT) driving. When the magnetic field is held fixed, the velocity response of the skyrmion is the same for current applied in either direction for both STT and SOT driving, so there is no current diode effect. When the magnetic field is reversed, under STT driving the velocity of the skyrmion reverses and its absolute value changes. Under SOT driving, the velocity remains in the same direction but drops to a much lower value, resulting in negative differential conductivity. For a fixed current, we find a nonreciprocal skyrmion velocity as a function of positive and negative applied fields, in analogy to the velocity-current curves observed in the usual diode effect. The nonreciprocity is generated by the Magnus force, which causes skyrmions to interact preferentially with one side of the channel. Since the channel sides have opposite asymmetry, a positive magnetic field can cause the skyrmion to interact with the "hard" asymmetry side of the channel, while a negative magnetic field causes the skyrmion to interact with the easy asymmetry side. This geometry could be used to create new kinds of magnetic-field-induced diode effects that can be harnessed in new types of skyrmion-based devices.</description>

      <title>A Hall viscosity for skyrmion via magnon interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify a Hall viscosity term directly from the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), that breaks parity symmetry, in the skyrmion motion of insulating magnets by time-averaging the magnon contribution to all orders. The viscosity term is proportional to the skyrmion charge. Skyrmion Hall angle shows significant dependence on the skyrmion shape and size, the ratio of exchange over DMI parameters, while roughly independent of the Gilbert damping parameter. The Hall angles have the same magnitude for opposite skyrmion charges. We speculate a velocity-dependent Hall viscosity contribution to seek asymmetric Hall angles for the opposite charges.</description>

      <title>Altermon: a magnetic-field-free parity protected qubit based on a narrow altermagnet Josephson junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets provide a new route to engineer superconducting circuits without magnetic fields. We theoretically study the Andreev bound state (ABS) spectrum of a finite-width altrmagnet-based Josephson junction and show how the $d$-wave altermagnetic symmetry and geometric confinement shape its low-energy excitations. We find a clear distinction between the two $d$-wave symmetries: $d_{x^2-y^2}$ order produces spin splitting, whereas $d_{xy}$ order preserves spin degeneracy and exhibits splitting of the ABS spectrum induced by intermode hybridization. Leveraging these novel features, we propose applying a transverse electric field to tune the system and realize a magnetic-field-free, parity-protected superconducting qubit that we call altermon.</description>

      <title>All-Electrical Self-Switching of van der Waals Chiral Antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antiferromagnets have garnered significant attention due to their negligible stray field and ultrafast magnetic dynamics, which are promising for high-density and ultrafast spintronic applications. Their dual functionality as both spin sources and information carriers could enable all-electrical self-induced switching of antiferromagnetic order, offering great potential for ultra-compact spintronic devices. However, related progress is still elusive. Here, we report the deterministic switching of chiral antiferromagnetic orders induced by charge current at zero external magnetic field in the van der Waals (vdW) magnetically intercalated transition metal dichalcogenide CoTa3S6. This system exhibits strong interactions between cobalt atom magnetic moment lattice and itinerant electrons within the metallic layers, as demonstrated by temperature-dependent angle-resolved photoemission, scanning tunneling spectroscopy, and topological Nernst effect measurements. Notably, the itinerant-localization interactions lead to current-induced chiral spin orbit torques as well as Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) exchange torques that interact with the localized magnetic moments, facilitating all-electrical switching of the chiral magnetic order in the CoTa3S6 flake. Our work opens a promising avenue for manipulating antiferromagnetic orders by delicately engineering the synergistic interactions between magnetic moments and itinerant electrons.</description>

      <title>Spin gaps in Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Nanoribbons with atomic Adsorbates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Edge-functionalized Transition Metal dichalcogenide nanoribbons of the zigzag type (zTMDCNRs) are explored in terms of their spin transmission properties. Specifically, systems of the type 5-zWXYNR + nA (X, Y = S, Se; n = 0, 1, 2; A = H, B, C, N, O), involving five rows of a zWXY unit, are investigated as transmission elements between semi-infinite electrodes, to identify atomic adsorbates and adsorption conditions for maximizing the spin polarization of current traversing the ribbons. Janus counterparts of these units, asymmetric structures comprising a transition metal layer sandwiched by two different chalcogen layers, are included in this study. In all cases considered, density functional theory (DFT) modeling, involving the hybrid Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE) exchange-correlation functional, is combined with the non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) approach to determine both spin and charge transport properties. The effect of the selected atomic absorbates on the geometric, electronic, and magnetic properties of 5-zWXYNR (X, Y = S, Se) is evaluated. A protocol to assess the spin-filtering capacity of 5-zWXYNR + nad as a function of the nature and the density of atomic adsorbates, is formulated in terms of band structure analysis of the respective electrode units. Spin gaps emerging close to the Fermi energy of the electrode are shown to provide an effective predictor for the degree of current spin polarization achieved by any of the transmission systems studied here. For any adsorbate configuration considered, ferromagnetic (FM) as well as antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering is examined, and the impact of the magnetic phase on the spin transport properties is discussed. A spin-selective negative differential resistance effect is identified for specific nanoribbon systems.</description>

      <title>Semiconductor-Semimetal Transition in van der Waals Carbyne Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Freestanding van der Waals crystals made of single-atom carbon chains (carbynes) have been recently realized technologically. Here we investigate their electronic and optical properties experimentally, by continuous-wave and time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy, and theoretically. Employing a fully three-dimensional tight-binding formalism benchmarked against density functional theory calculations we predict the semimetal-semiconductor transition to occur in van der Waals carbyne crystals composed by the chains of about 42 atoms long. The semiconductor phase is characterized by a hyperbolic van Hove singularity which gives rise to unconventional hyperbolic exciton states. Experimentally, we access the semiconductor phase, where resonant features associated with hyperbolic excitons are clearly visible. The exciton oscillator strength is found to be strongly sensitive to the length of carbon chains: our experiments show that it decreases with the increasing chain length. This tendency, confirmed by the theoretical modeling, manifests the evolution of the hyperbolic exciton state on the way to the semiconductor-semimetal crossover. Our approach accounts for the actual crystalline geometry, including alternating intra-chain hoppings and inter-chain couplings. By fitting tight-binding dispersions to density functional theory data we extract consistent parameters and establish a comprehensive framework for the physics of carbyne crystals. This study paves the way towards efficient band-gap engineering in ultimate one-dimensional carbon crystals.</description>

      <title>Fibonacci-Engineered Spin and Charge Thermoelectrics in a Long Range Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Chain: A Pathway to Giant Figure of Merit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a novel investigation into the spin-dependent thermoelectric performance of an extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, showcasing for the first time how its intrinsic spin filtration mechanism can be strategically harnessed to function as an efficient spin thermoelectric generator. By introducing a Fibonacci-type aperiodic modulation in the onsite energies, we engineer a deterministic disorder that mimics realistic aperiodic systems and profoundly influences transport characteristics. Furthermore, we incorporate both nearest-neighbor (NN) and next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) hopping amplitudes with tunable cosine dependencies, enabling us to meticulously explore the intricate interplay between these hopping processes and its implications on thermoelectric behavior. Our analysis reveals a remarkable enhancement in the dimensionless thermoelectric figure of merit ZT for both charge and spin transport channels, under carefully optimized conditions. Notably, the spin thermoelectric response exhibits distinct advantages, opening a new frontier in the design of next-generation thermoelectric materials and devices. This qualitative study not only deepens our understanding of aperiodic topological systems but also establish a foundational framework for exploiting spin-based thermoelectricity in low-dimensional platforms.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian learning quantum magnets with dynamical impurity tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanoscale engineered spin systems, ranging from spins on surfaces to nanographenes, provide flexible platforms to realize entangled quantum magnets from a bottom up approach. However, assessing the quantum many-body Hamiltonian realized in a specific experiment remains an exceptional open challenge, due to the difficulty of disentangling competing terms accounting for the many-body excitations. Here, we demonstrate a machine learning strategy to learn a quantum many-body spin Hamiltonian from scanning spectroscopy measurements of spin excitations. Our methodology leverages the spatially-resolved reconstruction of the many-body excitations induced by depositing quantum impurities next to the quantum magnet. We demonstrate that our algorithm allows us to predict long-range Heisenberg exchange interactions, anisotropic exchange, as well as antisymmetric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, including in the presence of sizable noise. Our methodology establishes defect-induced spatially-resolved dynamical excitations in quantum magnets as a powerful strategy to understand the nature of quantum spin many-body models.</description>

      <title>Cavity modification of magnetoplasmon mode through coupling with intersubband polaritons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the coupling of a multi-mode metal-insulator-metal cavity to a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in a quantum well in the presence of a strong magnetic field. The TM cavity mode is strongly hybridized with an intersubband transition of the 2DEG, forming a polaritonic mode in the ultrastrong coupling regime, while the TE mode remains an almost purely cavity mode. The magnetoplasmon excitation emerging from the presence of the magnetic field couples with both TM and TE modes, exhibiting different coupling strengths and levels of spatial field inhomogeneity. While the strong homogeneity of the bare TE mode gives rise to the standard anticrossing of strong coupling, the inhomogeneous polaritonic TM mode is shown to activate an observable Coulombic effect in the spectral response, often referred to as non-locality. This experiment demonstrates a cavity-induced modification of the 2DEG response and offers a new route to probing the effect of Coulomb interactions in ultrastrongly coupled systems via reshaping of their cavity mode profiles.</description>

      <title>Geometric control of the moire twist angle in heterobilayer flakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a finite twist-angle stabilization mechanism in lattice-mismatched 2D heterobilayers, which results from the geometric alignment between the flake edges and its moire pattern. Using atomistic simulations of graphene on hexagonal boron nitride flakes with diameters of up to $\sim 2500${\AA}, we identify robust metastable angles at $\sim 0.61^\circ$ for armchair and $\sim1.89^\circ$ for zigzag-edged flakes, tunable via in-plane heterostrain. This locking mechanism, which relies on energy barriers that are an order of magnitude larger than those of nearby metastable twist angles, provides a geometric route to precision twist-angle control of two-dimensional heterostructures and to understand the self-orientation of macroscopic flakes.</description>

      <title>Extinction Coefficients of CdSe, CdS, and CdTe Nanoplatelets in Solution: A Practical Tool for Concentration Determination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semiconductor nanoplatelets possess exceptional optical properties that make them promising candidates for next-generation optoelectronic applications. However, unlike quantum dots where absorption spectroscopy alone can determine both size and concentration, nanoplatelets present a significant characterization challenge: the absorption peak position reveals only thickness, providing no information about lateral dimensions or concentration. This limitation forces researchers to rely on time-consuming and costly elemental analysis techniques for complete sample characterization. Here, we present an experimentally verified theoretical framework that predicts the frequency-dependent absorption coefficient of randomly oriented CdSe, CdS, and CdTe nanoplatelets, enabling concentration determination from absorption measurements and lateral size estimates. Our model shows that the integrated absorption coefficient depends universally on nanoplatelet surface area and thickness, yielding a practical tool to extract concentrations without laborious elemental analysis. This approach bridges the characterization gap between quantum dots and nanoplatelets, offering a streamlined method for rapid sample analysis that could accelerate nanoplatelet research and applications.</description>

      <title>Self-Consistent Model for Gate Control of Narrow-, Broken-, and Inverted-Gap (Topological) Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Even small electrostatic potentials can dramatically influence the band structure of narrow-, broken-, and inverted-gap materials. A quantitative understanding often necessitates a self-consistent Hartree approach. The valence and conduction band states strongly hybridize and/or cross in these systems. This makes distinguishing between electrons and holes impossible and the assumption of a flat charge carrier distribution at the charge neutrality point hard to justify. Consequently the wide-gap approach often fails in these systems. An alternative is the full-band envelope-function approach by Andlauer and Vogl, which has been implemented into the open-source software package kdotpy (arXiv:2407.12651). We show that this approach and implementation gives numerically stable and quantitatively accurate results where the conventional method fails by modeling the experimental subband density evolution with top-gate voltage in thick (26 nm - 110 nm), topologically inverted HgTe quantum wells. We expect our openly-available implementation to greatly benefit the investigation of narrow-, broken-, and inverted-gap materials.</description>

      <title>Fermi arcs for generic nodal points hosting monopoles or dipoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fermi arcs represent the surface states at the boundary of a three-dimensional topological semimetal with the vacuum, illustrating the notion of bulk-boundary correspondence playing out in real materials. Their special character is tied up with the topological charges carried by the nodes of the semimetal in the momentum space, where two or more bands cross. In fact, they are constrained to begin and end on the perimeters of the projections of the Fermi surfaces of the bands tangentially, signalling their mixing with the bulk states. The number of Fermi arcs grazing onto the tangents of the outermost projection about a given node also reflects the magnitude of the charge at the node (equalling the Berry-curvature monopole), revealing the intrinsic topology of the underlying bandstructure, which can be visualised in experiments like ARPES. Here we take upon the task of unambiguously characterising the analytical structure of these states for generic nodal points, (1) whose degeneracy might be twofold or multifold; and (2) the associated bands might exhibit isotropic or anisotropic, linear- or nonlinear-in-momentum dispersion. Moreover, we also address the question of whether we should get any Fermi arcs at all for topological nodes carrying zero values of monopoles, but representing ideal dipoles.</description>

      <title>Frequency multiplication in Terahertz band using AlGaN/GaN plasmonic crystals</title>

Abstract: The plasma oscillations in high-mobility field-effect transistors (HEMTs) have emerged as a key physical mechanism for manipulating electromagnetic radiation in the sub-terahertz (sub-THz) and THz frequency ranges. These collective electron excitations can be excited and tuned electrically offering a compelling route to compact, integrable components for a wide range of next-generation technologies, including sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks, high-resolution biomedical and chemical spectroscopy, industrial process monitoring, and advanced security and defense systems. For these applications, plasmonic crystals -- periodic arrays of many strongly coupled FET channels -- are particularly promising. In this work, we report on a new class of collective excitations in plasmonic crystals termed rotonic plasmons, which arise at plasmonic mode crossings and exhibit a parabolic dispersion law reminiscent of soft-mode and roton-like spectra. We show that uniform gate modulation across plasmonic crystal unit cells induces periodic variations in the sheet carrier concentration and, consequently, in the plasma frequency. This time-periodic modulation drives nonlinear plasmonic parametric resonances enabling RF-to-THz conversion. By solving the generalized Mathieu equation with damping, we demonstrate that high-amplitude gate pumping enables frequency multiplication and, at cryogenic temperatures (77K) leads to parametric instabilities due to enhanced electron mobility. In plasmonic crystals with lower mobility, RF-to-THz conversion can instead be realized via periodic short-pulse excitation, a regime we introduce as Time-Domain Frequency Multiplication (TDFM). Investigation of AlGaN/GaN low-high plasmonic crystals confirm their potential as tunable, compact THz sources.</description>

      <title>Chirality/Axiality-Induced Axiality/Chirality via Surface Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In condensed matter physics, a broad spectrum of physical characteristics, such as chirality, axiality, and polarity, arises as a direct consequence of the underlying symmetry of the system. We here theoretically investigate the effective coupling between chirality and axiality at their domain boundaries, mediated by polarity. Based on symmetry considerations and model analyses, we propose the concept of chirality-induced axiality via surface polarization, which refers to a phenomenon where the handedness of chirality selects an axial moment with a particular orientation by lowering its energy at the surface. We further establish the inverse process, termed axiality-induced chirality via surface polarization, whereby axiality in turn dictates the preferred chirality. These reciprocal couplings open a new pathway for stabilizing single-domain states of chirality and axiality. They further imply interfacial functionalities, including the selective adsorption of chiral and axial molecules.</description>

      <title>Covariant field theory of 3D massive fractons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a covariant and gauge-invariant theory describing massive fractons in three spacetime dimensions, based on a symmetric rank-2 tensor field. The model includes a Chern-Simons-like term that plays a dual role: it generates a topological mass for the tensor gauge field and simultaneously acts as a source of intrinsic fractonic matter. This dual mechanism is novel and leads to a propagating fractonic degree of freedom described by a massive Klein-Gordon equation. The theory propagates two degrees of freedom -- one massive, one massless -- whose number is preserved in the massless limit, in analogy with the Maxwell-Chern-Simons mechanism of Deser-Jackiw-Templeton. We analyze the resulting equations of motion and show that the intrinsic fractonic matter satisfies Gauss- and Amp\`ere-like laws, with conserved dipole and trace of the quadrupole moment. Upon coupling to external matter, a second fractonic sector emerges, leading to a coexistence of intrinsic and extrinsic subsystems with different mobility and conservation properties. Our model provides a unified framework for describing massive fractons with internal structure, and offers a covariant setting for exploring their interactions and extensions.</description>

      <title>Spatially Mapping Phonon Drag in Ultrascaled 5-nm Silicon Nanowire Field-Effect Transistor Based on a Quantum Hydrodynamic Formalism</title>

Abstract: The growing demand for better performance and lower thermal energy dissipation in nanoelectronic devices is the major driving force of the semiconductor industry's quest for future generations of nanotransistors. Over the past 15 years, the miniaturization of silicon-based nanoelectronics predicted by Moore's law has driven an aggressive scaling down of transistor structures, including materials, design, and geometries. In this regard, the electronic device community has expanded its focus to ultrascaled transistors targeting the 7 nm technology node and beyond. However, these emerging nanodevices also present thermal challenges that can limit carrier transport as a result of strong electron-phonon coupling. In this work, we investigate the physical origin of self-heating effects in an ultrascaled 5 nm silicon nanowire field-effect transistor. Based on a quantum hydrodynamic approach, we also provide an explanation of the phonon drag contribution to thermal conductivity. We report the impact of the phonon drag effect on the electrical and thermal performance of 5 nm gate-all-around silicon nanowire field-effect transistors. Our findings provide new insight into the origin of self-heating as a result of mutual electron-phonon coupling. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the phonon drag effect significantly reduces thermal conductivity by nearly 50% under high-bias conditions.</description>

      <title>Quantum Kinetic Uncertainty Relations in Mesoscopic Conductors at Strong Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13200v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kinetic Uncertainty Relations (KURs) establish quantum transport precision limits by linking signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to the system's dynamical activity, valid in the weak-coupling regime where particle-like transport dominates. At strong coupling, quantum coherence challenges the validity of KURs and questions the concept of activity itself. In this Letter, we achieve two distinct, yet complementary main results. First, we introduce a general definition of dynamical activity valid at arbitrary coupling, which reveals the breakdown of standard KURs at strong coupling. Second, we prove a novel uncertainty relation valid at arbitrary coupling strength, which we denote Quantum KUR (QKUR). This QKUR corresponds to a nontrivial quantum extension of KUR, involving fundamental contributions of the generalized dynamical activity. These two achievements provide a general framework for out-of-equilibrium quantum transport precision analysis, in close analogy with the transition from TURs to QTURs [Phys. Rev. Lett. 135, 046302]. Explicit steady-state expressions are obtained within Green's-function and Landauer-B\"uttiker formalisms. We illustrate these concepts for paradigmatic quantum-coherent mesoscopic devices: a single quantum channel pinched by a quantum point contact and open single- and double-quantum dot systems.</description>

      <title>Dimensional crossover of superfluid $^{3}$He in a magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments on superfluid $^3$He in nanoscale-confined geometries, we theoretically investigate the associated phase diagram in a slab geometry and perpendicular magnetic field as the size of confinement is varied. Our analysis is based on minimizing the Ginzburg--Landau free energy for the $3\times 3$ matrix superfluid order parameter for three different boundary conditions. We observe a smooth crossover from the phase diagram of the 3D system to the quasi-2D limit for slab heights of several hundred nanometres and magnetic fields of several kilogauss. We illuminate that, despite the apparent complexity of the underlying equations, many precise numerical and even analytical statements can be made about the phase structure for general values of the coefficients of the free energy functional, which can in turn be used to constrain or measure these parameters. To guide future experimental studies, we compute the phase diagram in dependence of pressure, temperature, slab height, and magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Terahertz radiation induced attractive-repulsive Fermi polaron conversion in transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15708v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a theoretical study of terahertz radiation-induced transitions between attractive and repulsive Fermi polaron states in monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides. Going beyond the simple few-particle trion picture, we develop a many-body description that explicitly accounts for correlations with the Fermi sea of resident charge carriers. We calculate the rate of the direct optical conversion process which has a threshold where the terahertz photon energy equals to the Fermi polaron binding energy. This process features a characteristic frequency dependence near the threshold, due to final-state electron-exciton scattering related to the trion correlation with the Fermi sea hole. Furthermore, we demonstrate that intense terahertz pulses can significantly heat the electron gas via Drude absorption enabling an additional, indirect conversion mechanism through collisions between hot electrons and polarons, which exhibits a strong exponential dependence on the electron temperature. Our results reveal the important role of many-body correlations and thermal effects in the terahertz-driven dynamics of excitonic complexes in two-dimensional semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Giant thermal modulation via a semiconductor-superconductor photonic field-effect heat transistor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17683v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a groundbreaking demonstration of thermal modulation in a field-effect-controllable semiconductor-superconductor hybrid structure, wherein the heating mechanism is exclusively radiative. The architecture comprises two reservoirs separated by $\sim 1$ mm and interconnected via a completely non-galvanic electrical circuit, enabling the transfer of black-body radiation from the hot to the cold reservoir. Our device utilizes a superconducting Josephson field-effect transistor to achieve magnetic-field-free gate-tunable regulation of heat currents within the circuit. While prior studies have indicated the potential for electrostatic modulation of thermal transport properties, our framework demonstrates a temperature modulation of up to $\sim 45$ mK, exceeding prior findings by more than an order of magnitude. Furthermore, it proves a thermal transimpedance of $\sim 20$ mK/V at a bath temperature of $30$ mK. The development of such systems holds substantial promise for advancing heat management and routing in quantum chips and radiation sensors, as it enables precise nonlocal control of heat flow towards a designated structure, even when the heat source is distant and non-galvanically coupled.</description>

      <title>Exceptional Andreev spectrum and supercurrent in p-wave non-Hermitian Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23022v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the spectrum of Andreev bound states and supercurrent in a $p$-wave non-Hermitian Josephson junction (NHJJ) in one dimension. The studied NHJJ is composed of two topological $p$-wave superconductors connected by a non-Hermitian dissipative junction. Starting from the effective non-Hermitian Bogoliubov-de Gennes bulk Hamiltonian, we find that a pair of exceptional points emerge in the complex spectrum of Andreev quasi-bound states. The two exceptional points with zero energy locate symmetrically with respect to Josephson phase difference $\phi=\pi$, at which a Majorana zero mode persists. Notably, the exceptional points descend from a pair of Majorana zero modes after turning on the non-Hermiticity and are topologically protected. By analyzing the non-Hermitian scattering process at the junction, we explicitly demonstrate the loss of quasiparticles through the decay of scattering amplitude probabilities. Furthermore, we obtain the supercurrent directly by the inelastic Andreev reflection amplitudes, which provides a more intuitive interpretation of transport properties in NHJJs. The supercurrent varies continuously as a function of $\phi$ across the exceptional points. No enhancement of critical current is observed. We also generalize our analysis to a mixed $s$-$p$ wave NHJJ. Our results provide new insights on transport properties of Josephson junctions in presence of Majorana zero modes, exceptional points, and non-Hermiticity.</description>
