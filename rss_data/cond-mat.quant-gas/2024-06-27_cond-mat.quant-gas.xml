      <title>Atom Optics with Cold Bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trapped bosonic atoms can be cooled down to temperatures where the atomic cloud experiences Bose-Einstein condensation. Almost all atoms in a dilute gaseous system can be Bose-condensed, which implies that this system is in a coherent state. The coherent atomic system enjoys many properties typical of coherent optical systems. It is possible to generate different condensate coherent modes similarly to the generation of optical modes. Several effects can be observed, such as interference patterns, interference current, Rabi oscillations, harmonic generation, parametric conversion, Ramsey fringes, mode locking, dynamic transition between Rabi and Josephson regimes, and atomic squeezing.</description>

      <title>The dynamics of Tonks-Girardeau gas excited by a pulse drive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the dynamics of Tonks-Girardeau (TG) gases in a harmonic potential driven by Gaussian pulse, which is a correspondence of the excitation dynamics of electrons in matters driven by ultrashort laser pulse. The evolving dynamics of TG gas are obtained with Bose-Fermi mapping method combined with the numerical techniques. We calculate the evolving dynamics of occupation distribution of single-particle energy levels, density distribution and momentum distribution of the system. It is shown that the system arrived at a dynamically stable state at the end of driving. At high-frequency regime TG gases return back to ground state while at low-frequency regime the population inversion exhibits and all atoms occupy high levels.</description>

      <title>Probing a Modified Luttinger Sum Rule in the Strongly Interacting 1D Fermi-Hubbard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fermi surface reconstruction in cuprates can lead to an abrupt change in the Fermi momentum $k_F$ between different phases. This phenomenon remains subject of debate and is at the heart of an ongoing discussion about the nature of the metallic state in the pseudogap regime. Here we study a minimal model of a $k_F$ changing crossover in the one-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model, where a tuning of the onsite interaction leads to a crossover between a spin-$1/2$ Luttinger liquid with small Fermi momentum and a spinless chargon liquid with large Fermi momentum. We attribute this to an emergent $U(1)$ symmetry in the strongly correlated limit, which can be used to derive a modified Luttinger sum rule recovering the large Fermi momentum. We analyse Friedel oscillations at the edge of a system to directly probe the change of Fermi momentum at zero and non-zero temperature. This paves the way for a direct experimental observation of changes of the Fermi momentum using ultracold fermions in a quantum gas microscope, with possible extensions to higher dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Scalable tomography of many-body quantum environments with low temporal entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Describing dynamics of a quantum system coupled to a complex many-body environment is a ubiquitous problem in quantum science. General non-Markovian environments are characterized by their influence matrix~(IM) -- a multi-time tensor arising from repeated interactions between the system and environment. While complexity of the most generic IM grows exponentially with the evolution time, recent works argued that for many instances of physical many-body environments, the IM is significantly less complex. This is thanks to area-law scaling of temporal entanglement, which quantifies the correlations between the past and the future states of the system. However, efficient classical algorithms for computing IM are only available for non-interacting environments or certain interacting 1D environments. Here, we study a learning algorithm for reconstructing IMs of large many-body environments simulated on a quantum processor. This hybrid algorithm involves experimentally collecting quantum measurement results of auxiliary qubits which are repeatedly coupled to the many-body environment, followed by a classical machine-learning construction of a matrix-product (MPS) representation of the IM. Using the example of 1D spin-chain environments, with a classically generated training dataset, we demonstrate that the algorithm allows scalable reconstruction of IMs for long evolution times. The reconstructed IM can be used to efficiently model quantum transport through an impurity, including cases with multiple leads and time-dependent controls. These results indicate the feasibility of characterizing long-time dynamics of complex environments using a limited number of measurements, under the assumption of a moderate temporal entanglement.</description>

      <title>Universal scaling in far-from-equilibrium quantum systems: an equivalent differential approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.15646v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent progress in out-of-equilibrium closed quantum systems has significantly advanced the understanding of mechanisms behind their evolution towards thermalization. Notably, the concept of non-thermal fixed points (NTFPs) - responsible for the emergence of spatio-temporal universal scaling in far-from-equilibrium systems - has played a crucial role in both theoretical and experimental investigations. In this work, we introduce a differential equation that has the universal scaling associated with NTFPs as a solution. The advantage of working with a differential equation, rather than only with its solution, is that we can extract several insightful properties not necessarily present in the solution alone. How the differential equation is derived allows physical interpretation of the universal exponents in terms of the time dependence of the amplitude of the distributions and their momentum scaling. Employing two limiting cases of the equation, we determined the universal exponents related to the scaling using the distributions near just two momentum values. We established a solid agreement with previous investigations by validating this approach with three distinct physical systems. This consistency highlights the universal nature of scaling due to NTFPs and emphasizes the predictive capabilities of the proposed differential equation. Moreover, under specific conditions, the equation predicts a power-law related to the ratio of the two universal exponents, leading to implications concerning particle and energy transport. This suggests that the observed power-laws in far-from-equilibrium turbulent fluids could be related to the universal scaling due to NTFPs, potentially offering new insights into the study of turbulence.</description>

      <title>Accelerated creation of NOON states with ultracold atoms via counterdiabatic driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17545v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A quantum control protocol is proposed for the creation of NOON states with N ultracold bosonic atoms on two modes, corresponding to the coherent superposition $\vert N,0\rangle + \vert 0,N\rangle$. This state can be prepared by using a third mode where all bosons are initially placed and which is symmetrically coupled to the two other modes. Tuning the energy of this third mode across the energy level of the other modes allows the adiabatic creation of the NOON state. While this process normally takes too much time to be of practical usefulness, due to the smallness of the involved spectral gap, it can be drastically boosted through counterdiabatic driving which allows for efficient gap engineering. We demonstrate that this process can be implemented in terms of static parameter adaptations that are experimentally feasible with ultracold quantum gases. Gain factors in the required protocol speed are obtained that increase exponentially with the number of involved atoms and thus counterbalance the exponentially slow collective tunneling process underlying this adiabatic transition.</description>

      <title>Electrodynamics of superconductors: from Lorentz to Galilei at zero temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04493v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the derivation of the electrodynamics of superconductors coupled to the electromagnetic field from a Lorentz-invariant bosonic model of Cooper pairs. Our results are obtained at zero temperature where, according to the third law of thermodynamics, the entropy of the system is zero. In the nonrelativistic limit we obtain a Galilei-invariant superconducting system which differs with respect to the familiar Schr\"odinger-like one. From this point of view, there are similarities with the Pauli equation of fermions which is derived from the Dirac equation in the nonrelativistic limit and has a spin-magnetic field term in contrast with the Schr\"odinger equation. One of the peculiar effects of our model is the decay of a static electric field inside a superconductor exactly with the London penetration length. In addition, our theory predicts a modified D'Alembert equation for the massive electromagnetic field also in the case of nonrelativistic superconducting matter. We emphasize the role of the Nambu-Goldstone phase field which is crucial to obtain the collective modes of the superconducting matter field. In the special case of a nonrelativistic neutral superfluid we find a gapless Bogoliubov-like spectrum, while for the charged superfluid we obtain a dispersion relation that is gapped by the plasma frequency.</description>

      <title>Symplectic quantization III: Non-relativistic limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12355v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: First of all we shortly illustrate how the symplectic quantization scheme [Gradenigo and Livi, 2021] can be applied to a relativistic field theory with self-interaction. Taking inspiration from the stochastic quantization method by Parisi and Wu, this procedure is based on considering explicitly the role of an intrinsic time variable, associated with quantum fluctuations. The major part of this paper is devoted to showing how the symplectic quantization scheme can be extended to the non-relativistic limit for a Schr\"odinger-like field. Then we also discuss how one can obtain from this non-relativistic theory a linear Schr\"odinger equation for the single-particle wavefunction. This further passage is based on a suitable coarse-graining procedure, when self-interaction terms can be neglected, with respect to interactions with any external field. In the Appendix we complete our survey on symplectic quantization by discussing how this scheme applies to a non-relativistic particle under the action of a generic external potential.</description>

      <title>The Gross-Pitaevskii equation for a infinite square-well with a delta-function barrier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13833v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Gross-Pitaevskii equation is solved by analytic methods for an external double-well potential that is an infinite square well plus a $\delta$-function central barrier. We find solutions that have the symmetry of the non-interacting Hamiltonian as well as asymmetric solutions that bifurcate from the symmetric solutions for attractive interactions and from the antisymmetric solutions for repulsive interactions. We present a variational approximation to the asymmetric state as well as an approximate numerical approach. Stability of the states is briefly considered.</description>
