      <title>Universality of Heavy Operators in Matrix Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In large $N$ theories with a gravity dual, generic heavy operators should be dual to black holes in the bulk. The microscopic details of such operators should then be irrelevant in the low energy theory. We look for such universality in the strong coupling limit of a very simple two matrix model -- the Hoppe model. Using analytics as well as Monte Carlo simulations, we show that there exists a universal black hole regime where the eigenvalue densities are given by parabolas and the correlation functions of probes in these backgrounds are completely determined by a few parameters. An important feature of strong coupling in this model is that the matrices commute and one can define joint eigenvalue distributions which also exhibit universality. These two results extend the beautiful findings of Berenstein, Hanada and Hartnoll. Not all heavy operators are universal and at strong coupling there is a sharp phase boundary between the universal and non universal regimes. Moreover, in the non universal phase, we also find an interesting phenomenon we call Abelianization where some eigenvalues run off to infinity, reminiscent of heavy dual giant gravitons in $\mathcal N=4$ SYM.</description>

      <title>Dynamical symmetry breaking in Georgi-Glashow chiral-gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate dynamical symmetry breaking in a class of chiral gauge theories containing the Georgi-Glashow model. These theories feature a gauge sector and two fermion species that transform in the two-index antisymmetric and antifundamental representations with different multiplicities. Using the effective action formalism and the functional renormalization group, we derive the flow of four-fermion interactions that encode their resonant structure and information about bound-state formation. Generalizing the theories to multiple generations, we make contact with the loss of asymptotic freedom and dissect the boundary of a conjectured conformal window. Our results show that, while most of the theory space displays a dominant color-breaking condensate, there exists a strongly coupled regime where the lowest-laying mechanisms fail and more intricate dynamics are expected to arise. This analysis provides a first step toward the infrared behavior of chiral gauge theories with functional methods.</description>

      <title>GSO Defects: IIA/IIB Walls and the Surprisingly Stable $\mathrm{R}7$-Brane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently proposed Swampland Cobordism Conjecture predicts the existence of new non-supersymmetric objects which supplement the spectrum of low-energy gravitational effective field theories. In this paper, we study a subset of these defects related to the GSO projection on the string worldsheet. These include the predicted domain wall between Type IIA and IIB superstring theories and the newly-discovered $\mathrm{R}7$-brane. We study these defects in two different ways: via long-string probes and target-space effective field theory. We find that the $\mathrm{R}7$-brane can be identified with a collapsed cylindrical configuration of the IIA/IIB wall, and further, that the $\mathrm{R}7$-brane is stable, in contrast to previous expectations. Moreover, we argue that BPS D-branes pulled across the IIA/IIB wall become non-BPS D-branes, which we identify with fluxbrane configurations. We show that the non-BPS D-branes of either Type II theory are charged under a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ remnant of the Ramond-Ramond potentials of the other, which we identify with the mod 2 reduction of the Ramond-Ramond fluxes. Similar considerations provide a complementary perspective on the Heterotic ${\mathfrak{so}(32)}$ S-duals of known non-BPS 7- and 8-branes in Type I string theory.</description>

      <title>Resummation of Cosmological Correlators and their UV-Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmological correlators are important observables in cosmology. They are often approximated by de Sitter space correlators. In this paper, we give a first precise diagrammatical computation of higher loop diagrams to all orders for a conformally coupled scalar in four dimensions. We show that, in contrast to flat space, diagrams of necklace topology do not resum using the natural application of de Sitter-invariant regularization and are thus hard to evaluate. We propose a modification to the UV-regularization of the loops, compatible with de Sitter invariance, but much easier to work with. The modified diagrams can be resummed to give a glimpse at non-perturbative effects for de Sitter correlators. Furthermore, they fit nicely with recently proposed cosmological dressing rules.</description>

      <title>Extremal AdS Black Holes as Fluids: A Matrix Large-Charge EFT Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a simple, yet powerful, matrix-valued large-charge EFT that captures the thermodynamic behavior of rotating extremal large-charge AdS black holes. We introduce a minimal "matrix EFT" by promoting the complex scalar in large charge EFT to a complex $N\times N$ adjoint scalar, whose $O(N^2)$ modes contribute at zero temperature. Employing a mean-field approximation, we solve the self-consistency equations and obtain explicit rigidly rotating fluid solutions. We demonstrate that their energy, angular momenta, and charge densities exactly reproduce the thermodynamics and boundary stress tensor of zero-temperature conformal fluids. A microscopic mode-counting further accounts for the $O(N^2)$ entropy. Via the fluid/gravity correspondence, this fluid describes an extremal AdS black hole in large charge limit. We also comment on supersymmetric BPS black holes, which fall outside the usual hydrodynamic regime but nevertheless exhibit simple, universal behavior in the large angular momentum limit. In this regime, their non-linear charge-spin relations simplify to form reminiscent of our extremal fluid solutions at large angular momentum limit.</description>

      <title>QCD-Gravity double copy in Regge asymptotics: from $2\rightarrow n$ amplitudes to radiation in shockwave collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These lectures discuss multi-particle production in QCD and in gravity at ultrarelativistic energies, their double copy relations, and strong parallels in emergent shockwave dynamics. Dispersive techniques are applied to derive the BFKL equation for multi-gluon production in Regge asymptotics. Identical methods apply in gravity and are captured by a gravitational Lipatov equation. The building blocks in both cases are Lipatov vertices and reggeized propagators satisfying double copy relations; in gravity, Weinberg's soft theorem is recovered as a limit of the Lipatov framework. BFKL evolution in QCD generates wee parton states of maximal occupancy characterized by an emergent semi-hard saturation scale. A Color Glass Condensate EFT, and renormalization group equations in this framework, describe wee parton correlations, and their rapidity evolution. A shockwave picture of deeply inelastic scattering and hadron-hadron collisions follows, with multi-particle production described by Cutkosky's rules in strong time-dependent fields. Gluon radiation in this framework has a double copy in gravitational shockwave collisions, with a similar correspondence applicable to gluon and graviton shockwave propagators. Possible extensions of this double copy are outlined for computing multi-particle production in gravitational shockwave collisions, self-force and tidal contributions, and classical and quantum noise in the focusing of geodesics.</description>

      <title>Confronting infrared divergences in de Sitter: loops, logarithms and the stochastic formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A well-established result in quantum field theory in four-dimensional de Sitter space is that the vacuum state of a massless scalar field breaks the de Sitter isometry group, leading to time-dependent (secular) growth in correlation functions computed in inflationary coordinates. This behavior is widely believed to extend to more general theories involving light scalar fields with weak non-derivative interactions. In such cases, secular growth is thought to be further amplified by loop corrections, and the stochastic formalism is often regarded as the appropriate framework to resum these infrared effects. In this article we challenge this prevailing view. A crucial distinction must be made between two cases: a massless scalar field protected by a shift symmetry, and a light scalar without such a symmetry. In the former, the shift symmetry enforces derivative interactions, yielding observables in which secular growth plays no physical role. In the latter, although correlation functions develop infrared divergences in the massless limit, they remain fully invariant under the de Sitter isometry group. We analyze the structure of these divergences arising from loop integrals and show that, in the soft-momentum limit, they do not alter the time dependence of tree-level correlators. In fact, using a de Sitter-invariant renormalization scheme based on Wilson's axioms for integration, these divergences can be systematically removed order by order. We therefore conclude that neither massless nor light scalar fields in de Sitter space exhibit genuine secular growth. We further discuss the implications of these findings for the validity and scope of the stochastic approach to inflation.</description>

      <title>Logarithmically Divergent Vacuum Energy in Effective Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vacuum energy density due to a single quantum field diverges quarticly with the ultraviolet cutoff $\Lambda$, in wild disagreement with the value implied by cosmological observations. We show that in effective field theories containing bosons and fermions the requirement of a Lorentz invariant vacuum makes any divergence faster than logarithmic exponentially unlikely. We show this by generating an ensemble of mass spectra by Monte Carlo, and find that the probability distribution function for the vacuum energy is a gaussian centered on zero with a width that grows only logarithmically with the ultraviolet cutoff.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics with multiple charges and holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the connection between thermodynamic and dynamical instabilities in relativistic hydrodynamics with multiple flavours of conserved U(1) charges. In theories with positive hydrodynamic entropy production, where the underlying perfect fluid has a positive speed of sound squared and satisfies the null energy condition, we show that hydrodynamic instabilities can arise only through negative diffusion coefficients associated with the U(1) charges. The onset of such instabilities is governed by the eigenvalues of the thermodynamic Hessian matrix, while the flavour-space polarisations of the unstable diffusion modes are determined by the corresponding eigenvectors. We illustrate this connection using strongly coupled N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory at finite densities of the three U(1) R-charges. In the dual holographic description, the five-dimensional STU black brane exhibits unstable quasinormal modes precisely at the onset of thermodynamic instability. We derive analytic expressions for the R-charge diffusion coefficients in several representative cases, including the configuration with three equal chemical potentials.</description>

      <title>Higher-genus multiple zeta values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple zeta values arise as special values of polylogarithms defined on Riemann surfaces of various genera. Building on the vast knowledge for classical and elliptic multiple zeta values, we explore a canonical extension of the formalism to Riemann surfaces of higher genera, which yields higher-genus multiple zeta values. We provide a regularization prescription for higher-genus polylogarithms, which we extend to higher-genus multiple zeta values. Our regularization uses the Schottky uniformization to trace back higher-genus endpoint regularization to known regularization at genus one. Additionally, we are commenting on relations among higher-genus multiple zeta values implied by degeneration of the underlying geometry, where we distinguish between the two types of separating and non-separating degeneration. Finally, employing functional relations for higher-genus polylogarithms in the Schottky uniformization, we explore relations among higher-genus multiple zeta values and check them against our numerical testing setup. We identify relations for higher-genus multiple zeta values beyond those implied by polylogarithm identities, thereby matching the situation for genus zero and genus one. While we find several known structures for elliptic multiple zeta values to generalize to relations for higher-genus multiple zeta values, there are further classes of relations arising from the interplay and combinatorics of different cycles.</description>

      <title>Kaluza-Klein ansatz from Lorentzian quantum gravity on the fuzzy sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If Kaluza-Klein ideas were correct as an explanation of Yang-Mills and General Relativity on spacetime, the extra fibre geometry would have to be a sphere of constant size of the order of 10 Planck lengths, hence subject to quantum gravity corrections. Conversely, it was shown in previous work that modelling such corrections by noncommutative coordinates indeed forces the Kaluza-Klein cylinder ansatz form of the metric, and we now propose that the remaining restrictions needed come from quantum gravity on the fibre. Working with a fuzzy sphere fibre, we find that the expected value of the metric is indeed spherical and we propose that it can be taken as of constant size due to freedom in the renormalisation of divergences. In this way, we outline a mechanism whereby the observed structure of gravity plus Yang-Mills can emerge at low energies as a consequence of quantum gravity effects.</description>

      <title>Why Emergence of Gravity in Matrix Theories is Entropic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matrix theories exhibit the phenomenon of spacetime emergence in certain regimes of their dynamics. In this work, I posit that the key to this emergence is a hierarchy between two timescales -- very slow modes that an observer measures plus a chaotic cloud of very fast modes; this then leads to a natural operator algebra for measurements for the slow modes and an associated density matrix for the full system. I show that this density matrix implies the same gravitational potential energy that has been identified previously in the literature; furthermore, I show that the corresponding emergent gravitational force is nothing but the entropic force associated with the entropy of the fast modes of the system. I also demonstrate that the posited regime corresponds to distances being super-Planckian in the dual eleven dimensional supergravity.</description>

      <title>On correlation functions of the open XYZ spin 1/2 chain with boundary fields related by a constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the quantum XYZ open spin-1/2 chain with boundary fields. We focus on the particular case in which the six boundary parameters are related by a single constraint enabling us to describe part of the spectrum by standard Bethe equations. We derive for this model exact representations for a set of elementary blocks of correlation functions, hence generalising to XYZ the results obtained in the XXZ open case in arXiv:2208.10097. Our approach is also similar to the approach proposed in the XXZ case arXiv:2208.10097: we solve the model by Sklyanin's version of the quantum Separation of Variables, using Baxter's Vertex-IRF transformation; in this framework, we identify a basis of local operators with a relatively simple action on the transfer matrix eigenstates; we then use the solution of the quantum inverse problem and our recent formulae on scalar products of separate states arXiv:2402.04112 to compute some of the corresponding matrix elements, which can therefore be considered as elementary building blocks for the correlation functions. The latter are expressed in terms of multiple sums in the finite chain, and as multiple integrals in the thermodynamic limit. Our results evidence that, once the basis of local operators is properly chosen, the corresponding building blocks for correlation functions have a similar structure in the XXX/XXZ/XYZ open chains, and do not require any insertion of non-local "tail operators".</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The experimental search for the pion -- proposed in 1935 by Hideki Yukawa as the force carrier of the strong nucleon-nucleon interaction -- was rewarded in 1947 when in cosmic ray photographic emulsion data a charged particle was identified with the proper mass of about 300 times the electron mass, completed three years later by the discovery of the neutral pion. Since then, accelerator-driven pion and meson (photo-)production on the nucleon and the associated production of new baryons have become the key elements for ground-breaking discoveries in numerous areas of particle and nuclear physics, from fundamental symmetries and their breaking to low-energy QCD dynamics, laying also foundations for modern elementary particle physics and the Standard Model. This article is an overview of eight decades of experimental and theoretical meson production physics, from isospin to charm and beyond, forming our understanding of hadrons and their interactions.</description>

      <title>Anomalies of global symmetries on the lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 't Hooft anomalies of global symmetries play a fundamental role in quantum many-body systems and quantum field theory (QFT). In this paper, we make a systematic analysis of lattice anomalies - the analog of 't Hooft anomalies in lattice systems - for which we give a precise definition. Crucially, a lattice anomaly is not a feature of a specific Hamiltonian, but rather is a topological invariant of the symmetry action. The controlled setting of lattice systems allows for a systematic and rigorous treatment of lattice anomalies, shorn of the technical challenges of QFT. We find that lattice anomalies reproduce the expected properties of QFT anomalies in many ways, but also have crucial differences. In particular, lattice anomalies and QFT anomalies are not, contrary to a common expectation, in one-to-one correspondence, and there can be non-trivial anomalies on the lattice that are infrared (IR) trivial: they admit symmetric trivial gapped ground states, and map to trivial QFT anomalies at low energies. Nevertheless, we show that lattice anomalies (including IR-trivial ones) have a number of interesting consequences in their own right, including connections to commuting projector models, phases of many-body localized (MBL) systems, and quantum cellular automata (QCA). We make substantial progress on the classification of lattice anomalies and develop several theoretical tools to characterize their consequences on symmetric Hamiltonians. Our work places symmetries of quantum many-body lattice systems into a unified theoretical framework and may also suggest new perspectives on symmetries in QFT.</description>

      <title>Reheating after the Supercooled Phase Transitions with Radiative Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Theories with radiative symmetry breaking (RSB) lead to first-order phase transitions and the production of gravitational waves as well as primordial black holes if the supercooling period lasted long enough. Here we explain how to efficiently reheat the universe after such period in the above-mentioned class of theories. Two cases are possible, depending on whether the RSB scale is much larger than the electroweak (EW) symmetry breaking scale or not. When it is, the dominant reheating mechanism can be the decays of the field responsible for RSB in the Standard Model (SM) sector. We point out that in a similar way dark matter (DM) can be produced and we analyze in some detail the case of a sterile-neutrino, finding that the full DM abundance is reproduced when this particle is at the $10^2$ MeV scale in a well-motivated SM completion. When the RSB scale is not much larger than the EW symmetry breaking scale, we find that efficient reheating always occurs when the energy density of the false vacuum is first entirely transferred to a dark photon and then to SM fermions via dark-photon decays.</description>

      <title>Radion Portal Freeze-Out Dark-Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that, in a consistent model of a stabilized extra-dimensional theory, the radion can serve as a natural portal between ordinary matter and WIMP dark matter. With an effective coupling scale of the Kaluza-Klein theory of 20-100 TeV, the radion portal can produce the observed relic abundance through resonant annihilation for dark matter masses up to a TeV. Existing and planned direct dark matter detection experiments cannot constrain this model. However, indirect detection limits exclude dark matter masses between 5 and 80 GeV, where the radion mediator primarily decays into b-quarks.</description>

      <title>Gravitational form factors of the nucleon in the Skyrme model based on scale-invariant chiral perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the role of the QCD scale anomaly in the gravitational form factors of the nucleon -- particularly the $D(t)$ form factor -- as well as the associated stress distribution and internal forces, using a Skyrme model based on the scale-invariant chiral perturbation theory. A distinctive feature of this model is the inclusion of both the pion and the scalar meson, which respectively capture the effects of the current quark mass and gluonic quantum contributions to the scale anomaly. By varying the mass of the scalar meson, we evaluate the sensitivity of the gluonic scale anomaly to the nucleon properties. We find that the gluonic scale anomaly plays a crucial role in satisfying the stability conditions of the nucleon and provides an internal confining force. Moreover, we also evaluate the momentum-transfer dependence of $D(t)$, which closely reproduces the lattice QCD results. With an appropriate choice of the anomalous dimension associated with the quark mass, its forward-limit value (i.e., the D-term) also matches the lattice data well.</description>

      <title>Conical singularity in spacetimes with NUT is observer-dependent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the issue of defining and measuring conical deficits (conicity) in spacetimes with the torsion singularity such as the Misner string in Taub--NUT spacetime. We propose a geometric definition that generalizes the standard notion of conicity to stationary axially symmetric spacetimes with torsion singularity, where the conical deficit becomes observer-dependent -- it depends on the choice of a timelike Killing vector. This implies the existence of observers who perceive no conical singularity along the symmetry axis. As a result, in any spacetime with a non-vanishing NUT parameter, there are observers for whom the conicity has the same value on both semi-axes. This challenges the usual interpretation of conicity differences as indicators of string/rod-induced acceleration along the axis. We illustrate our definition across the full Pleba\'nski--Demia\'nski class, including the recently identified accelerated Taub--NUT solution. Our attempts in determining a canonical observer lead to even less desirable definitions of conicity.</description>

      <title>Quantum Aspects of Natural Top Quark Condensation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In top quark condensation the Brout-Englert-Higgs (BEH) boson is a $\bar{t}t$ bound state. With a UV completion of a single coloron exchange interaction, a recent semiclassical treatment gave a novel theory of the BEH boson as an extended object with composite scale $M_0\sim 6$ TeV. Presently we obtain the semiclassical theory as an effective action, using the source/Legendre transformation techniques of Jackiw, \etal, and fermion loop effects in the large-$N_c$ limit by deploying an auxiliary field to implement the sum of leading fermion loop diagrams. The theory remains natural at the loop level, with fine tuning at the level of a few \%, and the effective coupling of the 4-fermion interaction, $\bar{g}_0^2$, is significantly enhanced by quantum loops over the fundamental coloron coupling, $g_0^2$. Hence a relatively weaker ``topcolor'' theory can produce critical coupling in the effective BEH bound state theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present counterexamples to the lore that symmetries that cannot be gauged or made on-site are necessarily anomalous. Specifically, we construct unitary, internal symmetries of two-dimensional lattice models that cannot be consistently coupled to background or dynamical gauge fields or disentangled to a tensor product of on-site operators. These symmetries are nevertheless anomaly-free in the sense that they admit symmetric, gapped Hamiltonians with unique, invertible ground states. We show that symmetries of this kind are characterized by an index $[\omega]\in H^2(G,\mathbb{Q}_+)$, where $\mathbb{Q}_+$ is the multiplicative group of rational numbers labeling one-dimensional quantum cellular automata.</description>

      <title>Planckian charged black holes and their cosmological ramifications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The application of nonlinear electrodynamics at high energy scales has led to a variety of interesting phenomena in recent years, particularly within the context of non-singular spacetime geometries. Additionally, it is postulated that gravity near the Planck scale is governed by a minimal cut-off length, which acts as a renormalization scale against ultraviolet pathologies. Within this framework, we combine both concepts by introducing modifications to the electric and matter sectors of a black hole as its size approaches this minimal length. The result is an electrically charged black hole that is free from ultraviolet divergences and recovers the Maxwell limit at classical scales. We further explore the geometric and thermodynamic properties of the resulting solution within a cosmological anti-de Sitter background, revealing a chemical analogy with that of a Van der Waals fluid. Subsequently, we examine the charged black hole in de Sitter space and construct four corresponding gravitational instantons. We then study their cosmological quantum production using the formalism of the pair creation rate within the context of the no-boundary proposal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider certain Lambert series as generating functions of divisor sums twisted by Dirichlet characters and compute their exact resurgent transseries expansion near $q=1^-$. For special values of the parameters, these Lambert series are expressible in terms of iterated integrals of holomorphic Eisenstein series twisted by the same characters and the transseries representation is a direct consequence of the action of Fricke involution on such twisted Eisenstein series. When the parameters of the Lambert series are generic the transseries representation provides for a quantum-modular version of Fricke involution which for a particular example we show being equivalent to modular resurgent structures found in topological strings observables.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes of regular black holes surrounded by skewed dark matter distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Regular black holes, nonsingular solutions to gravitational collapse with quantum corrections, offer a compelling alternative to classical black holes with curvature singularities. In this work, we investigate how the presence of skewed dark matter distributions outside the innermost stable circular orbit of regular black holes modifies the gravitational wave signals emitted by such objects. Rather than introducing corrections directly into an effective potential, we model the influence of dark matter through metric corrections, allowing a full control over the spatial distribution and abundance of dark matter. We demonstrate that a skewed normal profile generically introduces shallow potential wells or secondary barriers in the effective potential of perturbation equations, depending sensitively on the type of perturbations: scalar, spinor, or tensor. These modifications lead to distinctive quasinormal mode features, including long-lived modes, echo effects, and in some cases, altered stability behaviors. Notably, the axial and polar sectors of tensor field perturbations respond asymmetrically to identical dark matter profiles, revealing a deeper structural distinction in their perturbation dynamics. These results provide a theoretical framework for probing regular black holes in the dark matter environment through gravitational wave observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scalar fields in the early Universe are mostly discussed in two limits: either in equilibrium or completely decoupled. In this work we discuss scenarios where there are scalar fields that are not in equilibrium, but for which the coupling to thermal bath leads to interesting non-trivial dynamics. For example, in theories where scalar fields control the effective couplings of the theory, such out-of-equilibrium behavior can lead to cases where the couplings vary during cosmological evolution. We systematically examine the generic features governing the evolution of these couplings, and as an application we highlight a novel effect where the scalar quartic coupling of an Abelian Higgs model is modified, leading to stronger cosmological phase transitions than would be obtained for static non-evolving quartics.</description>

We show that MTMVMG admits a stable cosmological solutions i.e. free from ghost, gradient, and tachyonic instabilities around the homogeneous and isotropic background. We further demonstrate that the dynamical external scalar field$\textendash\textendash$which is responsible for the mass of the graviton$\textendash\textendash$can suitably serve as either dark energy or the inflaton, yielding a description consistent with current cosmological observations.</description>

      <title>Foundations of Relational Quantum Field Theory I: Scalars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop foundations for a relational approach to quantum field theory (RQFT) based on the operational quantum reference frames (QRFs) framework considered in a relativistic setting. Unlike other efforts in combining QFT with QRFs, we use the latter to provide novel mathematical and conceptual foundations for the former. We focus on scalar fields in Minkowski spacetime and discuss the emergence of relational local (bounded) observables and (pointwise) fields from the consideration of Poincar\'e-covariant (quantum) frame observables defined over the space of (classical) inertial reference frames. We recover a relational notion of Poincar\'e covariance, with transformations on the system directly linked to the state preparations of the QRF. We introduce and analyse various causality conditions and how they can arise as a consequence of the properties of the frame itself. The theory makes direct contact with established foundational approaches to QFT: we demonstrate that the vacuum expectation values derived within our framework reproduce many of the essential properties of Wightman functions, carry out a detailed comparison of the proposed formalism with Wightman QFT with the frame smearing functions describing the QRF's localisation uncertainty playing the role of the Wightmanian test functions, and show how the algebras generated by relational local observables satisfy all of the core axioms of Algebraic QFT. We finish with an extensive outlook describing a number of further research directions. This work is an early step in revisiting the mathematical foundations of QFT from a relational and operational perspective.</description>

      <title>Does DESI DR2 challenge $\Lambda$CDM paradigm ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although the debate about the systematic errors of DESI DR1 is still open, recent DESI DR2 is consistent with DESI DR1 and further strengthens the results of DESI DR1. In this analysis, we present a $\sim 2.38 \sigma$ discrepancy between Planck $\Lambda$ CDM cosmology and the DESI DR2 Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG1) data at $z_{\text{eff}} = 0.51$, which predicts an unexpectedly large value for $\Omega_m$, $\Omega_m = 0.471^{+0.119}_{-0.065}$. We find that the $w_0 w_a$CDM model, using DESI DR2 data, suggests $w_0 &gt; 1$, indicating a deviation from the standard $\Lambda$CDM paradigm, where is strictly $w_0 = -1$. Additionally, the DESI DR2 data reveals that the value of $\Omega_m$ fluctuates at the 2.97 $\sigma$ level as redshift bin increases, particularly within the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. The DESI DR2 LRG1 data at $z_{\text{eff}} = 0.51$ seem to contradict the results from Type Ia supernovae in the same redshift range. However, it is expected that this discrepancy will become less significant with future DESI data releases, and the trend for $\Omega_m$ is expected to continue to increase as higher redshifts are considered. The statistical significance of this trend was approximately $1.8 \sigma$ when only the DESI DR1 data was considered, but, in the light of DESI DR2 data, the significance has decreased to about $0.52 \sigma$. Despite this reduction, the trend showing an increase in $\Omega_m$ with higher redshifts remains, though with less statistical confidence. This highlights the importance of understanding why the DESI LRG1 data at $z_{\text{eff}} = 0.51$ appear to be an outlier in the determination of $\Omega_m$.</description>

      <title>Constructive Quantum Field Theory on Curved Surfaces and Related Topics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is the Ph.D. thesis of the author. In this thesis, we construct the $ P(\phi)_2 $ Quantum Field Theory (QFT) model on curved surfaces and show that it satisfies Segal's axioms (arXiv:2403.12804). An important ingredient in this construction is the use of a local regularization procedure to define the interaction as a random variable with respect to the Gaussian Free Field (GFF). We provide a counterexample demonstrating that spectral truncation regularization violates locality (arXiv:2312.15511). We then explain how Segal's formalism can be extended to the gluing of surfaces with slits, which offers a geometric interpretation of the entanglement entropy. Using this interpretation, we exploit the Polyakov anomaly formula in Conformal Field Theory (CFT) and apply a simple renormalization procedure to define a quantity corresponding to entanglement entropy within this geometric interpretation. We then show that this quantity behaves like a CFT correlation function. This allows us to rigorously derive an entropy calculation of Cardy and Calabrese (arXiv:2501.19014). Finally, Segal's formalism is also related to the asymptotics of zeta determinants on surfaces of large genus where the genus tends to infinity (arXiv:2505.01586). We provide a geometric proof--independent of Segal's axioms--of the corresponding result using heat kernels, in addition to another proof based on Segal's axioms. Both proofs are presented in the thesis.</description>

      <title>Van der Waals Black Holes: Universality, Quantum Corrections, and Topological Classifications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the universal extremality relation and thermodynamic topology of Van der Waals (VdW) black holes-solutions of Einstein's equations whose thermodynamic behavior closely resembles that of Van der Waals fluids. In the classical case, the black hole entropy obeys the Bekenstein-Hawking area law and satisfies the standard universality relation. We then incorporate quantum corrections using three distinct frameworks: the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP), the Extended Uncertainty Principle (EUP), and Rainbow Gravity. While these corrections modify the entropy law, we find that a generalized form of the universal extremality relation still holds. Next, we explore the thermodynamic topology of VdW black holes, focusing on the distribution of topological charges. Our analysis reveals that variations in the black hole and model parameters lead to significant changes in topological classifications and stability, as quantified by winding numbers. In the GUP-corrected case, topological charge distributions exhibit robustness against parameter variations, suggesting classification stability. For EUP-corrected black holes, we identify two distinct topological classes, with some configurations displaying three non-zero topological charges and others maintaining a total charge of zero, despite changes in individual charge counts. The Rainbow Gravity-corrected scenario shows similar consistency in topological behavior.</description>

      <title>Energy Extraction From the Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson Black Hole via Magnetic Reconnection under Circular Plasma and Plunging Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, a class of exact solutions describing rotating black holes immersed in a uniform magnetic field has been proposed, and various properties of such black holes remain unclear. This paper aims to explore how to extract energy based on the magnetic reconnection mechanism in both the circular orbit region and the plunging region. After introducing the properties of this spacetime, we analyze physical quantities such as the size of the ergoregion, the event horizon, and the boundaries of the ergosphere. We then analyze the magnetic reconnection process within circular orbits. We plot energy extraction parameter diagrams, and analyze the power and efficiency of energy extraction. The results show that the magnetic field impedes energy extraction. Comparing with Kerr black holes and Kerr-Melvin black holes, we find that this black hole's energy extraction capability is stronger than that of the Kerr-Melvin black hole but weaker than that of the Kerr black hole. Furthermore, we study magnetic reconnection and energy extraction in the plunging region of this black hole. The results indicate that the magnetic field still impedes energy extraction. The black hole's energy extraction capability in this region also remains weaker than that of a Kerr black hole but stronger than that of a Kerr-Melvin black hole. Comparing the plunging region with the circular orbit region, we find that the energy extraction power in the plunging region is consistently stronger than in the circular orbit region.</description>

      <title>Infrared singularities and the collinear limits of multi-leg scattering amplitudes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scattering amplitudes are expected to admit a factorised structure in special kinematic limits, such as the Regge, soft and collinear limits. However, less is known about the precise mechanisms through which factorisation of $n$-particle scattering amplitudes is realised at high perturbative orders, where more complex structures arise. Starting with the soft anomalous dimension, in this work we investigate the multi-particle collinear limits of massless amplitudes at three- and four-loop orders. Using colour conservation and rescaling symmetry, we show how strict collinear factorisation of multiple massless final-state coloured particles is realised, and provide results for the corresponding splitting amplitude soft anomalous dimensions. In particular, we demonstrate through four loops that the conditions on the structure of the soft anomalous dimension that are required by strict collinear factorisation in all two-particle collinear limits, are sufficient to guarantee such factorisation also in any multiple collinear limit. Then, assuming that strict collinear factorisation of massless partons holds also for amplitudes containing massive coloured particles, we derive new constraints on the soft anomalous dimension from multi-collinear limits.</description>

      <title>Accretion dynamics in black holes with spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the spherical accretion of various types of fluids onto a Schwarzschild-like black hole solution modified by a Kalb-Ramond field implementing spontaneous Lorentz symmetry violation (LV). The system is analyzed for isothermal fluids characterized by the equation of state $p=\omega\rho$, including ultra-stiff, ultra-relativistic, and radiation fluids. We investigate the effect of the LV parameter $l$ on the fluid density $\rho(r)$, radial velocity $u(r)$, and accretion rate $\dot{M}$. Using a Hamiltonian dynamical systems approach, we examine the behavior near critical points and identify the sonic transitions in each scenario. Our results show that the LV parameter influences the location of critical points, the flow structure, and the accretion rate, with $l&gt;0$ ($l&lt;0$) enhancing (suppressing) the latter. For ultra-stiff fluids, no critical points are found, and the flow remains entirely subsonic. For ultra-relativistic and radiation fluids, transonic solutions exist, with the position of the sonic point depending on the sign of $l$. We also analyze polytropic fluids $p=\mathcal{K} \rho^{\Gamma}$ with $\Gamma=5/3$ and $\Gamma=4/3$, observing similar qualitative behavior, where the sonic transition is affected by both the equation of state and the LV parameter. These findings suggest that Lorentz symmetry breaking can significantly alter accretion dynamics in black hole spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Universal Cardy-Like Behavior of 3D Partition Functions from Supersymmetric Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05462v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate 3d $\mathscr{N}=2$ supersymmetric gauge theories on $S^1 \times S^2$ and the corresponding 2d effective field theories arising in the limit of small ratio of radii, $\beta=R_{S^1}/R_{S^2}\to 0$. We evaluate the exact partition function of these theories in the framework of supersymmetric localization on curved backgrounds. As a result, we establish a finite-$N$ map between a particular, superconformal-index-inspired partition function and the topologically twisted index. Taking the large-$N$ limit of the partition functions, we reproduce the entropy functions of either spherically symmetric, magnetically charged, or rotating, electrically charged asymptotically AdS$_4$ black holes. We then recast the problem of evaluating the 3d partition functions directly in the framework of rigid supersymmetry. By carefully tracking the background fields, we find that in the small-$\beta$ limit, the partition functions of these 3d large-$N$ superconformal field theories have a universal behavior related to the coefficients of the R-symmetry or flavor symmetry 2-point current correlation functions, thus obtaining a universal Cardy-like formula for 3d $\mathscr{N}=2$ superconformal field theories.</description>

      <title>Quantization of causal diamonds in (2+1)-dimensional gravity -- Part I: Classical reduction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.11741v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop the non-perturbative reduced phase space quantization of causal diamonds in (2+1)-dimensional gravity with a nonpositive cosmological constant. In this Part I we focus on the classical reduction process, and the description of the reduced phase space, while in Part II we discuss the quantization of the phase space and quantum aspects of the causal diamonds. The system is defined as the domain of dependence of a spacelike topological disk with fixed boundary metric. By solving the constraints in a constant-mean-curvature time gauge and removing all the spatial gauge redundancy, we find that the phase space is the cotangent bundle of Diff^+(S^1)/PSL(2,R), i.e., the group of orientation-preserving diffeomorphisms of the circle modulo the projective special linear subgroup. Classically, the states correspond to causal diamonds embedded in AdS_3 (or Mink_3 if $\Lambda = 0$), with fixed corner length, and whose Cauchy surfaces have the topology of a disc.</description>

      <title>Quantization of causal diamonds in (2+1)-dimensional gravity -- Part II: Group-theoretic quantization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop the non-perturbative reduced phase space quantization of causal diamonds in (2+1)-dimensional gravity with a nonpositive cosmological constant. In Part I we described the classical reduction process and the reduced phase space, $\widetilde{\mathcal P} = T^*(\text{Diff}^+\!(S^1)/\text{PSL}(2, \mathbb R))$, while in Part II we discuss the quantization of the phase space and quantum aspects of the causal diamonds. Because the phase space does not have a natural linear structure, a generalization of the standard canonical (coordinate) quantization is required. In particular, as the configuration space is a homogeneous space for the $\text{Diff}^+\!(S^1)$ group, we apply Isham's group-theoretic quantization scheme. We propose a quantization based on (projective) unitary irreducible representations of the $\text{BMS}_3$ group, which is obtained from a natural prescription for extending $\text{Diff}^+\!(S^1)$ into a transitive group of symplectic symmetries of the phase space. We find a class of suitable quantum theories labelled by a choice of a coadjoint orbit of the Virasoro group and an irreducible unitary representation of the corresponding little group. The most natural choice, justified by a Casimir matching principle, corresponds to a Hilbert space realized by wavefunctions on $\text{Diff}^+\!(S^1)/\text{PSL}(2, \mathbb R)$ valued in some unitary irreducible representation of $\text{SL}(2, \mathbb R)$. A surprising result is that the twist of the diamond corner loop is quantized in terms of the ratio of the Planck length to the corner perimeter.</description>

      <title>Toward quantum tunneling from excited states: Recovering imaginary-time instantons from a real-time analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00099v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the path integral description of quantum tunneling and lay the groundwork for its generalization to excites states through real-time path integral techniques. For clarity, we focus on the simple toy model of a point particle in a double-well potential, for which we perform all steps explicitly. Instead of performing the familiar Wick rotation from physical to imaginary time -- which is inconsistent with the requisite boundary conditions when treating tunneling from states other than the false vacuum -- we regularize the path integral by adding an infinitesimal complex contribution to the Hamiltonian, while keeping time strictly real. We find that this gives rise to a complex stationary-phase solution, in agreement with recent insights from Picard-Lefshitz theory. We then show that there exists a class of analytic solutions for the corresponding equations of motion, which can be made to match the appropriate boundary conditions in the physically relevant limits of a vanishing regulator and an infinite physical time. We provide a detailed discussion of this non-trivial limit. We find that, for systems without an explicit time-dependence, our approach reproduces the picture of an instanton-like solution defined on a finite Euclidean-time interval. Lastly, we discuss the generalization of our approach to broader classes of systems, for which it serves as a reliable framework for high-precision calculations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08882v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the chiral phase transition relevant for QCD matter at finite temperature but with vanishing baryon density. Presumably, the chiral phase transition is of second order for two-flavor QCD in the chiral limit. Near the transition temperature, we apply the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism and construct a low-energy effective field theory for the system, in which fluctuations and dissipations are systematically captured. The dynamical variables involve the chiral charge densities and order parameter (chiral condensate). Via the holographic Schwinger-Keldysh technique, the effective action is further confirmed within a modified AdS/QCD model. With higher-order terms suitably neglected, the stochastic equations derived from the effective field theory resemble those of model F in the Hohenberg-Halperin classification. Within the effective field theory, we briefly discuss the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry and Goldstone modes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study five-dimensional $N=4$ gauged supergravity coupled to three vector multiplets with $SO(2)_D\times SO(3)$ gauge group. The gauged supergravity admits two supersymmetric $AdS_5$ vacua. One of the vacua, at the origin of the scalar manifold $\mathbb{R}^+\times SO(5,3)/SO(5)\times SO(3)$, preserves $N=4$ supersymmetry and the full $SO(2)_D\times SO(3)$ gauge symmetry. The second $AdS_5$ vacuum is $N=2$ supersymmetric and invariant under $SO(2)_{\textrm{diag}}$ which is a diagonal subgroup of $SO(2)_D$ and $SO(2)\subset SO(3)$. By considering a truncation to $SO(2)_{\textrm{diag}}$ invariant scalars, we find a class of Janus solutions interpolating among these vacua. These solutions should be holographically dual to conformal interfaces within the dual $N=1$ and $N=2$ SCFTs in four dimensions. In addition, we also find examples of solutions describing RG-flow interfaces between $N=1$ and $N=2$ SCFTs on each side of the interfaces. All of the solutions could possibly be uplifted to eleven dimensions by a consistent truncation of M-theory on $M_3\times S^2\times S^1$ with a 3-manifold $M_3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09371v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore AdS/CFT duality in the large $N$ limit, where the duality reduces to gauge/gravity correspondence, from the viewpoint of covariant phase space formalism (CPSF). In particular, we elucidate the role of the $W, Y$, and $Z$ freedoms (also known as ambiguities) in the CPSF and their meaning in the gauge/gravity correspondence. We show that $W$-freedom is associated with the choice of boundary conditions and slicing of solution space in the gravity side, which has been related to deformations by multi-trace operators in the gauge theory side. The gauge/gravity correspondence implies the equivalence of on-shell symplectic potentials on both sides, thereby the $Y$-freedom of the gravity side specifies the on-shell symplectic form of the gauge theory side. The $Z$-freedom, which determines the corner Lagrangian on the gravity side, establishes the boundary conditions and choice of slicing in the boundary theory and its solution space. We utilize these results to systematically formulate freelance holography in which boundary conditions of the fields on the gravity side are chosen freely and are not limited to Dirichlet boundary conditions, and discuss some examples with different boundary conditions.</description>

Before the deformation, the seed model can be understood as a sector of the $\mathfrak{psu}(2,2|4)$-invariant spin-chain encoding the spectral problem of $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills at one loop in the planar limit. The deformation gives rise to interesting features because, while being integrable, the Hamiltonian is non-hermitian and non-diagonalisable, so that it only admits a Jordan decomposition. Moreover, the eigenvalues of the deformed Hamiltonian coincide with those of the original undeformed spin-chain. We use explicit examples as well as the techniques of the coordinate and of the algebraic Bethe ansatz to discuss the construction of the (generalised) eigenvectors of the deformed model. We also show that the deformed spin-chain is equivalent to an undeformed one with twisted boundary conditions, and that it may be derived from a scaling limit of the non-compact $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$-invariant $XXZ_{-1/2} $ spin-chain.</description>

      <title>Dirac brackets for classical radiative observables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03249v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new coherent state expansion of the exponential representation of the S-matrix for the classical gravitational two-body problem. By combining the Kosower-Maybee-O'Connell (KMOC) formalism with the Dirac bracket structure emerging in the classical limit, we derive compact and gauge-invariant expressions for scattering observables in the presence of radiation. This causal formulation bypasses the calculation of KMOC cuts and provides a direct link between observables and a minimal set of classical matrix elements extracted from amplitudes. We illustrate our method with several examples, including the impulse, spin kick, angular momentum, waveform and the related radiative fluxes. Finally, using our formalism we evaluate for the first time the spin kick and the change in angular momentum of each particle up to $\mathcal{O}(G^2 s_1^{j_1} s_2^{j_2})$ with $j_1+ j_2 \leq 11$.</description>

      <title>Exact Confining Solution of the Planar QCD Loop Equation via a Matrix Ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05096v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct an exact solution to the planar QCD loop equation in four-dimensional Euclidean space using a novel matrix-valued momentum loop formalism. Central to this construction is a new loop calculus, in which functional derivatives act directly on the loop velocity $ \dot{C}(\theta) $. This framework yields finite, well-defined expressions for point and area derivatives in loop space and reveals the role of the loop-space Bianchi identity in ensuring gauge consistency.
  The Wilson loop is expressed as an average over matrix-valued momentum loops $ P(\theta) $ tracing closed paths in a compact complex manifold, constrained by self-duality and boundary conditions. Self-duality dynamically nullifies the classical Yang--Mills term in the loop equation, while the boundary constraints eliminate the contact terms in the planar ($ N \to \infty$)) limit. Thus, the full planar QCD loop equation is satisfied exactly and without modification.
  We further argue that these random walks define a self-dual minimal surface in an extended matrix space, and \textbf{prove} that the area of this matrix minimal surface scales proportionally to the Euclidean minimal area bounded by the same loop $ C $, thereby providing a sufficient condition for quark confinement. In the example of an circular loop, we construct the exact surface and compute its area analytically, finding that it equals the Euclidean area multiplied by a universal factor of $ 6 \sqrt{2}$.
  These results provide the first known explicit construction of a quark-confining minimal surface that solves the planar QCD loop equation exactly, and open a new path toward understanding gauge--string duality from first principles.</description>

      <title>Holographic QCD Matter: Chiral Soliton Lattices in Strong Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16897v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the chiral soliton lattice (CSL) in the framework of holographic QCD in magnetic field. Under appropriate boundary conditions for the gauge field and the quark mass deformation, we demonstrate that the ground state in the gravitational dual of QCD is given by the CSL in the background magnetic field and the baryon number density. In the presence of the background magnetic field, we show that the CSL is interpreted as a uniformly distributed D4-branes in the holographic setup, where the chiral soliton is identified with a non-self-dual instanton vortex or a center vortex in the five dimensional bulk gauge theory. While the baryon numbers are given to chiral solitons as well as Skyrmions due to the different terms in the Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) term in the chiral perturbation theory, these baryon numbers with different origins are unified in terms of the instanton charge density in five dimensions. With bulk analysis of the WZW term, we find that the pion decay constant becomes dependent on the magnetic field. For the massless pion case, we obtain an analytical form that is in qualitative agreement with lattice QCD results for strong magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic relation on rotating charged black strings with arbitrary cosmological constant</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Goon-Penco (GP) relation was investigated on rotating charged black strings with an arbitrary cosmological constant. It has been demonstrated that the GP relation retains its form in the context of spacetimes described by cylindrical coordinates. In addition, the GP relation is derived in scenarios where the energy state parameters (including angular momentum $J$ and charge $Q$, etc.) are expressed as functions of the perturbation parameter $\eta$. This finding indicates that the GP relation is not only valid for spacetimes described by spherically symmetric coordinates, but also prevalent for non-spherically symmetric spacetimes, such as cylindrical coordinates. Therefore, the present study demonstrated that the GP relation is universal for spacetimes with arbitrary cosmological constants, irrespective of the adopted coordinate system.</description>

      <title>Gradient properties of $\varphi^3$ in $d=6-\varepsilon$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20761v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The renormalization group flow of the multiscalar interacting $\varphi^3$ theory in $d=6$ dimensions is known to have a gradient structure, in which suitable generalizations of the beta functions $B^{I}$ emerge as the gradient of a scalar function $A$, $\partial_I A = T_{IJ} B^J $, with a nontrivial tensor $T_{IJ}$ in the space of couplings. This has been shown directly to three loops in schemes such as $\overline{\rm MS}$ and can be argued in general by identifying $A$ with the coefficient of the topological term of the trace-anomaly in $d=6$ up to a normalization. In this paper we show that the same renormalization group has a gradient structure in $d=6-\varepsilon$. The requirement of a gradient structure is translated to linear constraints that the coefficients of the $\overline{\rm MS}$ beta functions must obey, one of which is new and pertinent only to the extension to $d \neq 6$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.14642v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript we confirm the presence of a Rindler horizon at CERN-NA63 by exploring its thermodynamics induced by the Unruh effect in their high energy channeling radiation experiments. By linking the entropy of the emitted radiation to the photon number, we find the measured spectrum to be a simple manifestation of the second law of Rindler horizon thermodynamics and thus a direct measurement of the recoil Fulling-Davies-Unruh (FDU) temperature. Moreover, since the experiment is born out of an ultra-relativistic positron, and the FDU temperature is defined in the proper frame, we find that temperature boosts as a length and thus fast objects appear colder. The spectrum also provides us with a simple setting to measure fundamental constants, and we employ it to measure the positron mass.</description>

      <title>Delving into the Phenomenology of Very Special Relativity: From Subatomic Particles to Binary Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03104v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this thesis, we investigate the implications of Lorentz-violating (LV) theories, focusing on Very Special Relativity (VSR) and its phenomenological consequences. Initially presented as an alternative mechanism for neutrino masses, VSR has since become a significant part of the general LV framework, distinguished by its unique group structure and non-local operators. After a comprehensive introduction to the principles of LV and VSR, we present the corresponding modifications to the Dirac equation. A significant part of the thesis is dedicated to the development of a Hamiltonian formalism within the VSR context, addressing its inherent non-localities. This approach is further extended to the non-relativistic limit, connecting it to the conventional Schr\"odinger picture. We then set upper bounds on the VSR parameters by examining its corrections to a wide range of physical systems and scenarios, such as Landau levels of charged particles, the $\mathsf g-$factor of electrons, the energy spectrum of ultracold neutrons in Earth's gravitational field, and the gravitational emission from binary stars. The latter analysis led us to the construction of a VSR field theory for spin-2 fields in flat space, which was surprisingly found to accommodate a gauge-invariant graviton mass. Through this comprehensive study, we bridged theoretical predictions with experimental data, paving the way for future explorations in Lorentz-violating theories and highlighting their potential to address unresolved questions in modern physics.</description>

      <title>Corrections to Kerr-Newman black hole from Noncommutative Einstein-Maxwell equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03337v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this letter we introduce the noncommutative geometry into the standard Einstein-Hilbert-Maxwell action via the $\partial_t\wedge\partial_\varphi$ Drinfeld twist and solve the equation of motion pertubatively in the expansion of the noncommutative parameter $a$. The equation of motion, the NC Einstein-Maxwell equation, turns out to be effectively a problem in nonlinear electrodynamics where the energy-momentum tensor $T_{\mu\nu}$ obtains correction terms with three Faraday tensors $F_{\mu\nu}$. A solution with nonzero $a^1$ terms turns out to be the Kerr-Newman black hole modified with nonzero $g_{t\theta}, g_{r\varphi}, g_{tr}$ and $g_{\varphi\theta}$ components proportional to $a$, while the electromagnetic potential is the Seiberg-Witten expanded Kerr-Newman potential which introduces a nonzero $A_{\theta}$ term proportional to $a$.</description>

      <title>Unification of Stochastic and Quantum Thermodynamics in Scalar Field Theory via a Model with Brownian Thermostat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03059v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic procedure to derive a quantum master equation for thermal relaxation in real scalar field theory, expanding on the method proposed in [Koide and Nicacio, Phys. Lett. A494, 129277 (2024)]. We begin by introducing a generalized model for a classical scalar field interacting with a Brownian thermostat, consistent with stochastic thermodynamics. Applying canonical quantization to this model, we derive the corresponding quantum master equation, that is applicable to any form of the scalar field Hamiltonian. While its evolution is generally non-CPTP (Completely Positive and Trace-Preserving), it can be adjusted to describe a CPTP evolution, such as those found in the GKSL (Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad) equation by appropriately tuning the parameters of the model. In this framework, we define heat, work, and entropy in a way that satisfies the first and second laws of quantum thermodynamics. This suggests that the quantum-classical correspondence extends beyond closed systems governed by unitary time evolution to open systems as well. We further investigate the relation between the second law in quantum thermodynamics and relative entropy, providing insights into the study of quantum fluctuations through information-theoretical techniques in quantum field theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17318v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study exact static spherically symmetric vacuum solutions in generic six-derivative gravity (i.e., without assuming specific relations between the coupling constants). Using modified Schwarzschild coordinates, we systematically classify solutions through Frobenius expansions, determining their number of free parameters and confirming previously known cases, such as the regular solutions at the origin. Importantly, we identify novel solutions absent in four-derivative gravity, including those with (double-degenerate) extreme horizons (and their near-horizon limits) that exist without matter sources, which may indicate the existence of regular black holes. We also find asymptotically (anti-)de Sitter spacetimes, giving rise to an effective cosmological constant. The solutions can be classified into six main classes, and, when possible, we provide the description in standard Schwarzschild coordinates, in which they split into thirteen main solution classes.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the particle production by the Nambu-Goldstone boson in the spontaneous baryogenesis scenario for large misalignment angles. Studying numerically the case of an arbitrary initial phase, we reproduce the cubic dependence on the initial value of the phase of baryon asymmetry in the case of small oscillations and present our results for an initial phase close to {\pi}. Our calculations indicate that there is a saturation in particle production as the initial phase approaches {\pi} in Minkowski spacetime. Furthermore, we present numerical solutions in the Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) spacetime in conformal time, where we demonstrate a strong dependence on the decay rate of the scalar field. We also discuss the probability distribution of the baryon asymmetry.</description>

      <title>Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld gravity: Constraints from the generalized parton distributions (GPDs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld (EiBI) theory of gravity modifies general relativity in high-density regimes. It offers an alternative framework that avoids cosmological singularities and remodels gravitational dynamics within compact objects. An important feature of EiBI gravity is its additional parameter, $\kappa$, which governs deviations from standard gravitational behavior. In this study, we investigate constraints on $\kappa$ using the internal pressure distribution of the proton, derived from gravitational form factor (GFF) $ D(t) $ obtained through a QCD analysis of generalized parton distributions (GPDs). By comparing pressure profiles extracted from skewness-dependent GPDs with previous determinations based on deeply virtual Compton scattering (DVCS) data, we establish updated bounds on $\kappa$. Our results show that the choice of proton pressure model significantly impacts the constraints, with the strongest limits ($|\kappa| \leq 0.10\text{--}0.3\, \text{m}^5\, \text{kg}^{-1}\, \text{s}^{-2}$). We further demonstrate that constraints obtained based on the first and second moments of the pressure distribution yield competitive bounds compared to those derived from peak pressures or those derived from just the first moment. These findings highlight the importance of precise experimental and theoretical determinations of the proton's mechanical properties in testing alternative theories of gravity. The present study motivates future improvements in GPD reconstructions for stronger constraints on EiBI gravity and related modifications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14225v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It was proposed that five-dimensional (5D) inflation can blow up the size of a compact dimension from the 5D Planck length to the micron size, as required by the dark dimension proposal, relating the weakness of the actual gravitational force to the size of the observable universe. Moreover, it was shown that 5D inflation can generate the (approximate) flat power spectrum of primordial density fluctuations consistent with present observations. Here we compute the bispectrum of primordial scalar perturbations and show that unlike the power spectrum, it differs from the four-dimensional case at all angular distances, due to the fact that in contrast to global dilatations, invariance under special conformal transformations is not restored at late times. Moreover there is an additional enhancement in the squeezed limit.</description>

      <title>Strong coupling and instabilities in singularity-free inflation from an infinite sum of curvature corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20586v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Four-dimensional gravitational theories derived from an infinite sum of Lovelock curvature invariants, combined with a conformal rescaling of the metric, are equivalent to a subclass of shift-symmetric Horndeski theories that possess a single scalar degree of freedom. Under the assumption of a homogeneous and isotropic cosmological background, the theory admits an inflationary solution that replaces the Big Bang singularity. This can be achieved by a solution where the Hubble expansion rate $H$ is equal to the time derivative of the scalar field $\dot{\phi}$. We show that the solution $H=\dot{\phi}$ suffers from a strong coupling problem, characterized by the vanishing kinetic term of linear scalar perturbations at all times. Consequently, nonlinear scalar perturbations remain uncontrolled from the onset of inflation throughout the subsequent cosmological evolution. Moreover, tensor perturbations are generally subject to Laplacian instabilities during inflation. This instability in the tensor sector also persists under background initial conditions where $H \neq \dot{\phi}$. In the latter case, both the coefficient of the kinetic term for scalar perturbations and the scalar sound speed diverge at the onset of inflation. Thus, the dominance of inhomogeneities in this theory renders the homogeneous background solution illegitimate.</description>

      <title>MatBYIB: A Matlab-based code for Bayesian inference of extreme mass-ratio inspiral binary with arbitrary eccentricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05954v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate parameter estimation(PE) of gravitational waves(GW) is essential for GW data analysis. In extreme mass-ratio inspiral binary(EMRI) systems, orbital eccentricity is a critical parameter for PE. However, current software for for PE of GW often neglects the direct estimation of orbital eccentricity. To fill this gap, we have developed the MatBYIB, a MATLAB-based software package for PE of GW with arbitrary eccentricity. The MatBYIB employs the Analytical Kludge (AK) waveform as a computationally efficient signal generator and computes parameter uncertainties via the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) and the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). For Bayesian inference, we implement the Metropolis-Hastings (M-H) algorithm to derive posterior distributions. To guarantee convergence, the Gelman-Rubin convergence criterion (the Potential Scale Reduction Factor R) is used to determine sampling adequacy, with MatBYIB dynamically increasing the sample size until R &lt; 1.05 for all parameters. Our results demonstrate strong agreement between FIM- based predictions and full MCMC sampling. This program is user-friendly and allows for estimation of gravitational wave parameters with arbitrary eccentricity on standard personal computers. Code availability:The implementation is open-source at https://github.com/GenliangLi/MatBYIB.</description>

      <title>A Gauge-Theoretic Action Principle for Viscous Incompressible Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11202v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel action principle for two dimensional incompressible fluid dynamics that naturally incorporates both vorticity and viscous dissipation via gauge field couplings. The action features a Chern Simons like term, $\epsilon^{\mu\nu\rho} A_\mu \partial_\nu A_\rho$, capturing the topological structure of vorticity, alongside a quadratic term $(\epsilon^{\mu\nu\rho} \partial_\nu A_\rho)^2$ representing viscous damping. Incompressibility is enforced through a Lagrange multiplier, while coupling to an external potential allows applications in geophysical flows. We derive the equations of motion, recovering the vorticity formulation of the two-dimensional incompressible Navier Stokes equations and explicitly identifying the kinematic viscosity. This gauge theoretic framework leads to a Helmholtz type equation for vorticity linking topological and dissipative phenomena in viscous incompressible fluids. Analysis of Noether symmetries reveals conserved charges arising from gauge invariance and spatial translations, while viscosity explicitly breaks time reversal symmetry within this topological setting. Furthermore, the velocity vorticity gauge correspondence naturally suggests a Lindblad operator structure, providing a pathway toward a quantum description of viscous dissipation and allowing quantization of dissipative hydrodynamics. This framework also highlights how vorticity emerges as a natural Lindblad operator, capturing the transition from coherent rotational motion to thermal disorder.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Horizons and Black Hole Soft Hair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16939v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the present work, quasilocal Brown-York charges are derived that coincide in the large sphere limit with the conserved supertranslation hair and superrotation charges introduced by Hawking, Perry and Strominger in [45, 46]. Given these charges, a general scenario is outlined in which a non-rotating black hole completely evaporates after its collapse due to particle creation effects, whereby a genuine one-way traversable event horizon is never formed, but merely a two-way traversable dynamical (resp. future trapping) horizon. The formation of such a dynamical horizon has the consequence, as is demonstrated, that quasilocal energy transported by the considered charges, and thus information, can continuously escape through the black hole horizon to infinity; a mechanism which, as is argued, could possibly prevent information loss once the black hole formation and evaporation process comes to an end.</description>

      <title>Standardizing a larger, higher-quality, homogeneous sample of reverberation-mapped H$\beta$ active galactic nuclei using the broad-line region radius-luminosity relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17422v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a high-quality, homogeneous sample of 157 H$\beta$ reverberation-mapped active galactic nuclei (RM AGNs) spanning redshifts $0.00308 \leq z \leq 0.8429$, which is approximately 3.8 times larger than the previously available high-quality homogeneous sample. Using the broad-line region radius$-$luminosity relation ($R-L$), which involves the broad H$\beta$ line time delay and the monochromatic luminosity at 5100\,\AA\,, we show that the sample is standardizable by using six spatially flat and nonflat cosmological models. The inferred cosmological model parameters are consistent within 2$\sigma$ uncertainties with those from better established baryon acoustic oscillation and Hubble parameter measurements, with the exception of two nonflat models that are ruled out by other data. The $R-L$ relation slope is found to be flatter ($\gamma=0.428 \pm 0.025$ in the flat $\Lambda$CDM model) than the slope expected from a simple photoionization model as well as the slope found previously for the smaller homogeneous sample. In addition, we find a mild dependence of H$\beta$ $R-L$ relation parameters as well as its intrinsic scatter on the Eddington ratio by comparing the $R-L$ relations for low- and high-accreting equal-sized subsamples. A future analysis of a larger homogeneous sample containing a broader range of luminosities and Eddington ratios is necessary to confirm the standardizability of H$\beta$ AGNs.</description>
