      <title>Extremes of summer Arctic sea ice reduction investigated with a rare event algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09984v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Various studies identified possible drivers of extremes of Arctic sea ice reduction, such as observed in the summers of 2007 and 2012, including preconditioning, local feedback mechanisms, oceanic heat transport and the synoptic- and large-scale atmospheric circulations. However, a robust quantitative statistical analysis of extremes of sea ice reduction is hindered by the small number of events that can be sampled in observations and numerical simulations with computationally expensive climate models. Recent studies tackled the problem of sampling climate extremes by using rare event algorithms, i.e., computational techniques developed in statistical physics to reduce the computational cost required to sample rare events in numerical simulations. Here we apply a rare event algorithm to ensemble simulations with the intermediate complexity coupled climate model PlaSim-LSG to investigate extreme negative summer pan-Arctic sea ice area anomalies under pre-industrial greenhouse gas conditions. Owing to the algorithm, we estimate return times of extremes orders of magnitude larger than feasible with direct sampling, and we compute statistically significant composite maps of dynamical quantities conditional on the occurrence of these extremes. We find that extremely low sea ice summers in PlaSim-LSG are associated with preconditioning through the winter sea ice-ocean state, with enhanced downward longwave radiation due to an anomalously moist and warm spring Arctic atmosphere and with enhanced downward sensible heat fluxes during the spring-summer transition. As a consequence of these three processes, the sea ice-albedo feedback becomes active in spring and leads to an amplification of pre-existing sea ice area anomalies during summer.</description>

      <title>Towards an end-to-end artificial intelligence driven global weather forecasting system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12462v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The weather forecasting system is important for science and society, and significant achievements have been made in applying artificial intelligence (AI) to medium-range weather forecasting. However, existing AI-based weather forecasting models rely on analysis or reanalysis products from traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems as initial conditions for making predictions. Initial states are typically generated by traditional data assimilation components, which are computational expensive and time-consuming. Here we present an AI-based data assimilation model, i.e., Adas, for global weather variables. By introducing the confidence matrix, Adas employs gated convolution to handle sparse observations and gated cross-attention for capturing the interactions between the background and observations. Further, we combine Adas with the advanced AI-based forecasting model (i.e., FengWu) to construct the first end-to-end AI-based global weather forecasting system: FengWu-Adas. We demonstrate that Adas can assimilate global observations to produce high-quality analysis, enabling the system operate stably for long term. Moreover, we are the first to apply the methods to real-world scenarios, which is more challenging and has considerable practical application potential. We have also achieved the forecasts based on the analyses generated by AI with a skillful forecast lead time exceeding that of the IFS for the first time.</description>

      <title>Direct in-situ observations of wave-induced floe collisions in the deeper Marginal Ice Zone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02750v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ocean waves propagating through the Marginal Ice Zone (MIZ) and the pack ice are strongly attenuated. This attenuation is critical for protecting sea ice from energetic wave events that could otherwise lead to sea ice break-up and dislocation over large areas. Despite the importance of waves-in-ice attenuation, the exact physical mechanisms involved, and their relative importance, are still uncertain. Here we present for the first time direct in situ measurements of floe-floe interactions under the influence of waves, including collisions between adjacent floes. The collision events we report are aligned with the incoming wave direction, and phase-locked to the wave signal, which indicates that the individual collisions we detect are wave-induced. The observations demonstrate that wave attenuation by wave-induced floe-floe collisions, which have been studied in idealized laboratory and field experiments in the outer MIZ, are indeed a likely source of wave energy dissipation deep inside the MIZ as well.</description>

      <title>Negative APE dissipation as the fundamental criterion for double diffusive instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12536v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The background potential energy (BPE) is the only reservoir that double diffusive instabilities can tap their energy from when developing from an unforced motionless state with no available potential energy (APE). Recently, Middleton and Taylor linked the extraction of BPE into APE to the sign of the diapycnal component of the buoyancy flux, but their criterion can only predict diffusive convection instability, not salt finger instability. Here, we show that the problem can be corrected if the sign of the APE dissipation rate is used instead, making it emerge as the most fundamental criterion for double diffusive instabilities. A theory for the APE dissipation rate for a two-component fluid relative to its single-component counterpart is developed as a function of three parameters: the diffusivity ratio, the density ratio, and a spiciness parameter. The theory correctly predicts the occurrence of both salt finger and diffusive convection instabilities in the laminar unforced regime, while more generally predicting that the APE dissipation rate for a two-component fluid can be enhanced, suppressed, or even have the opposite sign compared to that for a single-component fluid, with important implications for the study of ocean mixing. Because negative APE dissipation can also occur in stably stratified single-component and doubly stable two-component stratified fluids, we speculate that only the thermodynamic theory of exergy can explain its physics; however, this necessitates accepting that APE dissipation is a conversion between APE and the internal energy component of BPE, in contrast to prevailing assumptions.</description>

      <title>Environmental monitoring using orbital angular momentum mode decomposition enhanced machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Atmospheric interaction with light has been an area of fascination for many researchers over the last century. Environmental conditions, such as temperature and wind speed, heavily influence the complex and rapidly varying optical distortions propagating optical fields experience. The continuous random phase fluctuations commonly make deciphering the exact origins of specific optical aberrations challenging. The generation of eddies is a major contributor to atmospheric turbulence, similar in geometric structure to optical vortices that sit at the centre of OAM beams. Decomposing the received optical fields into OAM provides a unique spatial similarity that can be used to analyse turbulent channels. In this work, we present a novel mode decomposition assisted machine learning approach that reveals trainable features in the distortions of vortex beams that allow for effective environmental monitoring. This novel technique can be used reliably with Support Vector Machine regression models to measure temperature variations of 0.49C and wind speed variations of 0.029 m/s over a 36m experimental turbulent free-space channels with controllable and verifiable temperature and wind speed with short 3s measurement. The predictable nature of these findings could indicate the presence of an underlying physical relationship between environmental conditions that lead to specific eddy formation and the OAM spiral spectra.</description>
