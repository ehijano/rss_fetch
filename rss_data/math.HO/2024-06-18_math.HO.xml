      <title>The Mathematics of Dots and Pixels: On the Theoretical Foundations of Image Halftoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution of image halftoning, from its analog roots to contemporary digital methodologies, encapsulates a fascinating journey marked by technological advancements and creative innovations. Yet the theoretical understanding of halftoning is much more recent.
  In this article, we explore various approaches towards shedding light on the design of halftoning approaches and why they work. We discuss both halftoning in a continuous domain and on a pixel grid.
  We start by reviewing the mathematical foundation of the so-called electrostatic halftoning method, which departed from the heuristic of considering the back dots of the halftoned image as charged particles attracted by the grey values of the image in combination with mutual repulsion. Such an attraction-repulsion model can be mathematically represented via an energy functional in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space allowing for a rigorous analysis of the resulting optimization problem as well as a convergence analysis in a suitable topology.
  A second class of methods that we discuss in detail is the class of error diffusion schemes, arguably among the most popular halftoning techniques due to their ability to work directly on a pixel grid and their ease of application. The main idea of these schemes is to choose the locations of the black pixels via a recurrence relation designed to agree with the image in terms of the local averages. We discuss some recent mathematical understanding of these methods that is based on a connection to Sigma-Delta quantizers, a popular class of algorithms for analog-to-digital conversion.</description>

      <title>Alternative ways to initiate students' intuition, and hence internalization, of why zero factorial is equal to one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.10777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.10777v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Zero factorial, defined to be one, is often counterintuitive to students but nonetheless an interesting concept to convey in a classroom environment. The challenge is to delineate the concept in a simple and effective way through the practice of justification, a familiar concept in mathematics and science education. In this regard two algebraic and one statistical justification using the squeeze theorem are presented. To assess the effectiveness of the justifications, a student survey was conducted at a comprehensive university incorporating the analysis of the pre- and post-presentation statements. They clearly present that the justifications are useful in giving credence to zero factorial equals one. Overall, the results from the online survey supports that the students preferred Justification 1. The justifications provide instructors alternative ways to initiate exploration of students' intuitive set up of comprehending unobvious facts like zero factorial equals one.
  For a range of learners with their varied abilities to perform various mental activities most closely associated with learning and problem-solving, the justifications as simple alternative methods offer the potential to raise the current level of cognitive skills to inspire differentiated paths of learning. These are evident from survey results noting the role of statistical thinking and techniques.</description>

      <title>Buffon-Laplace Needle Problem with objects of arbitrary size in two and three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Buffon-Laplace Needle Problem considers a needle of a length $l$ randomly dropped on a large plane with vertically parallel lines with distances $a$ and $b$ ($a \geqslant b$), respectively. As a classical problem in stochastic probability, it serves as a mathematical basis of various physical literature. Yet its potential application is limited by previous focus on its original form of the `short' needle case of $l &lt; b$. Here, rather than a `short' two-dimensional needle, we analytically solve the problems with two- and three-dimensional needles and spherocylinders of arbitrary length and radius dropped on a grid with any rectangular shape. We further confirm our analytical theory with Monte Carlo simulation. Our framework here helps to extend the analytical power of the needle problem into unexplored parameter regions for various physical problems involving stochastic processes.</description>
