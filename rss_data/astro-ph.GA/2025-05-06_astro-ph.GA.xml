      <title>A XRISM Observation of the Archetypal Radio-Mode Feedback System Hydra-A: Measurements of Atmospheric Motion and Constraints on Turbulent Dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present XRISM Resolve observations centered on Hydra-A, a redshift z = 0.054 brightest cluster galaxy which hosts one of the largest and most powerful FR-I radio sources in the nearby Universe. We examine the effects of its high jet power on the velocity structure of the cluster's hot atmosphere. Hydra-A's central radio jets have inflated X-ray cavities with energies upward of $10^{61}~\rm erg$. They reach altitudes of 225 kpc from the cluster center, well beyond the atmosphere's central cooling region. Resolve's $3\times3$ arcmin field-of-view covers $190\times190$ kpc, which encompasses most of the cooling volume. We find a one dimensional atmospheric velocity dispersion across the volume of $164\pm10\,\rm{km\,s}^{-1}$. The fraction in isotropic turbulence or unresolved bulk velocity is unknown. Assuming pure isotropic turbulence, the turbulent kinetic energy is $2.5\,\%$ of the thermal energy radiated away over the cooling timescale, implying that kinetic energy must be supplied continually to offset cooling. While Hydra-A's radio jets are powerful enough to supply kinetic energy to the atmosphere at the observed level, turbulent dissipation alone would struggle to offset cooling throughout the cooling volume. The central galaxy's radial velocity is similar to the atmospheric velocity, with an offset of $-37 \pm 23\,$ km s$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>An extremely metal-poor Lyman-$\alpha$ emitter candidate at $z=6$ revealed through absorption spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a Lyman $\alpha$ emitter (LAE) candidate in the immediate foreground of the quasar PSO J158-14 at $z_{\rm QSO}=6.0685$ at a projected distance $\sim29\ {\rm pkpc}$ that is associated with an extremely metal-poor absorption system. This system was found in archival observations of the quasar field with the Very Large Telescope/Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (VLT/MUSE) and was previously missed in searches of absorption systems using quasar absorption line spectroscopy as it imparts no detectable metal absorption lines on the background quasar spectrum. The detected Ly$\alpha$ emission line at a redshift of $z_{\rm LAE}=6.0323$ is well aligned with the outer edge of the quasar's proximity zone and can plausibly cause its observed damping wing if it is associated with a proximate sub-damped Ly$\alpha$ absorption system with a column density of $\log {N_{\rm HI} / {\rm cm}^{-2}} \approx 19.8$. A $&gt;10$ hour medium-resolution spectrum of the quasar observed with the Magellan/Folded-port InfraRed Echellette (FIRE) and VLT/X-Shooter spectrographs reveals a metallicity constraint of ${\rm [Z/H]} &lt; -3$. Such low metallicity makes this system an extremely metal-poor galaxy candidate and provides an exciting site to study possible signatures of Population III stars.</description>

      <title>eROSITA view on the Halo Mass-Temperature relation. From low mass groups to massive clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy groups and clusters are one of the best probes of structure formation and growth in a cosmological context. Most of their baryonic component is dominated by the intracluster medium (ICM), whose thermodynamical properties serve as indicators of the halo's dynamical state and can be used for the halo mass determination in the self-similar scenario. However, baryonic processes, such as AGN feedback and gas cooling, may affect the global properties of the ICM, especially in the group regime. These effects might lead to deviations from self-similar predictions in galaxy groups' scaling relations, while they remain in place for massive galaxy clusters. Additionally, the low-mass end of the scaling relations, ranging from $10^{13}$ to $10^{14} M_\odot$, remains unclear and poorly populated, as current X-ray surveys detect only the brightest groups. Here, we present the Mass-Temperature relation across the full mass range, from massive clusters to low-mass groups ($10^{13}M_\odot$), as observed by eROSITA. Using spectral stacking from eROSITA eRASS1 data for optically selected galaxy groups, we find that, in the lower mass range, galaxy groups follow the power-law relation known for galaxy clusters. We further validate these results by conducting the same stacking procedure on mock eRASS:4 data using the Magneticum hydrodynamical simulation. This indicates that AGN feedback is more likely to affect the distribution of baryons in the intragroup medium rather than the overall halo gas temperature. No significant changes in the Mass-Temperature relation slope suggest that temperature can serve as a reliable mass proxy across the entire mass range. This validates the use of temperature-derived masses, particularly in cosmological studies, significantly broadening the mass range and enabling applications such as improving the cluster mass function studies and cosmological parameter estimates.</description>

      <title>Physical properties and gas kinematics of massive star forming region G328.24$-$0.55</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents the results of ALMA band 6 archival data of G328.24$-$0.55, with the aim to pin down the physical and kinematic properties of young stellar objects (YSOs) in G328.24$-$0.55 star forming region. The dust continuum image reveals 5 protostellar objects (MM1a, MM1b, MM1c, MM2 and MM3), with MM1a dominating the region. The dust continuum peaks do not coincide with the strongest radio continuum peak previously detected in the region in a MeerKAT observation, but coincide with the weaker MeerKAT peak. The dust continuum objects are associated with faint unresolved infrared emission. We detected 70, 49, 26, 7 and 8 molecular transitions toward MM1a, MM1b, MM1c, MM2 and MM3, respectively. This variation in the number of detected molecular transitions supports different excitation conditions in these objects. The excitation temperatures estimated toward MM1a, MM1b and MM1c are $\sim$ 183, 168 and 110\,K, respectively. MM2 and MM3 lack multiple transitions of molecular lines to determine their excitation temperatures. The masses of MM1a, MM1b, MM1c, MM2 and MM3 were calculated to be 23.2, 16.1, 12.0, 9.8 and 14.9$M_{\odot}$, respectively. The velocity gradient of CH$_{3}$OH ($10_{2,8}-9_{3,7}$) emission traces a rotating structure, probably an envelope of gas around MM1a. Bipolar outflow traced by CO emission is seen towards MM1a. The properties of MM1a clearly point to the existence of a massive protostellar object that is still undergoing accretion and outflow in its early formative stage.</description>

      <title>The mass-morphology relation of TNG50 galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation TNG50 to study the galaxy mass-morphology relation, as measured by the rotational support of the stellar component of simulated galaxies. For isolated galaxies with stellar mass in the range $8&lt;\log(M_{*}/M_{\odot}) &lt; 11$, rotational support increases with $M_*$, from dispersion-supported spheroidal dwarfs to massive galaxies with prominent rotationally supported discs. Our results indicate that this correlation arises from the spatial distribution of star formation in TNG50 galaxies, which occurs primarily in two distinct regions: an unresolved, non-rotating central baryonic clump $(r \lesssim 1~\mathrm{kpc})$ and a rotationally supported outer disc, separated by a quiescent region. The importance of the inner clump increases with decreasing $M_*$; it makes up more than 80\% of all stars in dwarfs. This explains why dwarfs have less rotational support than massive galaxies, as well as why all dwarfs have similar stellar half-mass radii regardless of $M_*$. It also explains why dwarfs in TNG50 appear to form outside-in, as star formation in the dominant inner clump moves progressively inward. The clump-disc segregation of star formation in TNG50 galaxies is probably numerical in origin. Inner clumps are formed by the accumulation of low-angular momentum gas supported by the equation of state introduced to prevent artificial fragmentation. The decoupled-wind feedback implementation in TNG50 helps to preserve the clumps but disrupts disc formation in its immediate surroundings. This hinders the formation of discs in (dwarf) galaxies whose sizes are not substantially larger than the clump, but has little effect on the larger discs of more massive systems. Our results argue for caution when interpreting the dependence on stellar mass of TNG50 galaxy morphologies, or the evolution of galaxy sizes, especially at the dwarf end.</description>

      <title>Identifying Doppelganger Active Galactic Nuclei across redshifts from spectroscopic surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) are among the most luminous objects in the universe, making them valuable probes for studying galaxy evolution. However, understanding how AGN properties evolve over cosmic time remains a fundamental challenge. This study investigates whether AGNs at low redshift (nearby) can serve as proxies for their high-redshift (distant) counterparts by identifying spectral 'doppelg\"angers', AGNs with remarkably similar emission line properties despite being separated by vast cosmic distances. We analyze key spectral features of bona fide AGNs using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey's Data Release 16, including continuum and emission lines: Nitrogen (N V), Carbon (C IV), Magnesium (Mg II), Hydrogen-beta (H$\beta$), and Iron (Fe II - optical and UV) emission lines. We incorporated properties such as equivalent width, velocity dispersion in the form of full width at half maximum (FWHM), and continuum luminosities (135nm, 300nm, and 510nm) closest to these prominent lines. Our initial findings suggest the existence of multiple AGNs with highly similar spectra, hinting at the possibility that local AGNs may indeed share intrinsic properties with high-redshift ones. We showcase here one of the better candidate pairs of AGNs resulting from our analyses.</description>

      <title>High-resolution radio observations of massive protostars in the SARAO MeerKAT Galactic Plane Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present high-resolution observations made with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) at 5.5 GHz and 9.0 GHz of a sample of twenty-eight massive protostars. These protostars were initially detected at radio wavelengths in the MeerKAT Galactic Plane Survey at 1.3 GHz, where they were unresolved with an angular resolution of approximately 8 arcseconds. The resolution of the ATCA observations at 5.5 GHz and 9.0 GHz are significantly higher at, 2.0 and 1.2 arc seconds, respectively. The highest angular resolution corresponds to a linear resolution of 1920 AU for our nearest object. This improvement in resolution enabled us to resolve the components of extended emission and to more accurately determine the nature of the objects. Approximately 80% of the detections were classified as jets with 68% of the jets found to be associated with non-thermal emission.</description>

      <title>Non-thermal Radio Emission from Massive Protostars in the SARAO MeerKAT Galactic Plane Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an investigation of the L-band emission from known massive young stellar objects (MYSOs) in the SARAO MeerKAT Galactic Plane Survey to search for non-thermal radio emitters in the sample. A total of 398 massive protostars, identified from the Red MSX Source (RMS) survey, are located within the survey region. Among these, 162 fields that host the protostars are isolated from nearby bright HII regions, allowing for the study of any ionized jets present. Seventy-one of these fields have jets with five-sigma detections or higher, corresponding to a detection rate of 44%. The MeerKAT fluxes of the detections, together with the upper limits of the non-detections and any other fluxes from previous observations, were used to estimate the spectral indices of the jets, and to search for the presence of non-thermal radiation. In cases where a source manifests as single in a given observation but is resolved into multiple components in observations of higher resolutions, the sum of the fluxes of the resolved components was used in estimating the indices. Any e!ects from missing flux in higher-resolution observations were incorporated into the index uncertainties. The spectral indices of the sample show that at least 50% of the jets emit non-thermal radiation. Additionally, the spectral energy distribution (SED) of some of the sources, as well as their radio luminosities exhibit evidence of non-thermal emission, especially in extended sources.</description>

      <title>Mapping Nearby Galaxies with Apache Point Observatory: Group and field galaxies' morphologies in the colour-magnitude plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study involves the use of integral field spectroscopy (IFS) data from Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) to investigate whether the morphology influences the environmental dependence of galaxies' colours and the colour-magnitude planes. The galaxies are classified into six morphologies (Elliptical, Lenticular, Early-type, Intermediate-type, Late-type spirals and Irregular) and further in field and group environments. The distributions of colours ($B-V, B-R, u-g, g-r, r-i$ and $i-z$) are compared between field and group environments and then the colour-magnitude planes are analysed. It is observed that Intermediate and Late-types spirals preferentially exist in field environments while Early-type spirals exist in groups. The colours and colour-magnitude planes of Elliptical, Lenticular, Early-type and Intermediate-type spirals depend on the environment while for the Late-type and Irregular galaxies, their dependence on the environment is very weak. The study concludes that the dependence of colours and colour-magnitude planes on the environment is influenced by morphology.</description>

      <title>Revisited parameters for the twin bulge globular clusters NGC 6528 and NGC 6553</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NGC 6528 and NGC 6553 are among the most metal-rich globular clusters in the Galactic bulge. They represent the upper end of the chemical enrichment in the Galaxy, and can inform on the processes of cluster formation and enrichment. We aim to refine the fundamental parameters of NGC 6528 and NGC 6553, based on proper motion-corrected Hubble Space Telescope WFC3 and ACS photometries. Methods. In order to derive the fundamental parameters age, distance, reddening, and the total-to-selective absorption coefficient, we employed a Bayesian isochrone fitting. Age and metallicity are mainly constrained by the turn-off morphology, thanks to the unprecedented quality of the proper-motion cleaned photometry. The two clusters show remarkably similar Colour-Magnitude Diagrams. We derived an age of 11+-0.5 Gyr with a solar metallicity for both clusters. The reddening for NGC 6528 and NGC 6553 is E(B-V) = 0.63 and 0.76 and the distances from the Sun are d = 7.85 and 5.1 kpc, respectively, recalling that distances strictly depend on the adopted total-to-selective absorption parameter. The age of these metal-rich clusters is about 2 Gyr younger than the moderately metal-poor bulge clusters. The ages and metallicities are remarkably identical to that of the bulk of bulge field stars.</description>

      <title>Mass-dependent chemical enrichment sequences of SDSS star-forming galaxies out to z~0.3 revealed by direct O &amp; Ar abundances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Individual stars in the Milky Way (MW) and its satellites have been shown to trace galaxy stellar mass dependent sequences in the $\alpha$-abundance ([$\alpha$/Fe]) vs metallicity ([Fe/H]) plane. Testing the universality of such sequences has been elusive as deep absorption-line spectra required for [$\alpha$/Fe] and [Fe/H] measurements beyond the local group are mostly limited to integrated light from nearby, relatively high-mass, early-type galaxies. However, analogous to [$\alpha$/Fe] vs [Fe/H] for stars, we now have log(O/Ar) vs 12+log(Ar/H) for the integrated nebular light of star-forming galaxies (SFGs). From Sloan-Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) observations of $\sim3000$ SFGs out to z$\sim0.3$, where we directly determined O &amp; Ar abundances, we obtain for the first time the distribution of an ensemble of SFGs in the log(O/Ar) vs 12+log(Ar/H) plane. We show that higher (&lt;M$\rm_{*}$&gt;$\sim2.6\times10^9$M$_{\odot}$) and lower mass (&lt;M$\rm_{*}$&gt;$\sim1.7\times10^7$M$_{\odot}$) SFGs clearly trace distinct mass dependent sequences in this plane, qualitatively consistent with the mass dependence of chemical enrichment sequences observed for the stars in the MW and its satellites. Such sequences are consistent with expectations from galaxy chemical evolution (GCE) models that are driven primarily by the interplay of core-collapse and Type Ia supernovae.</description>

      <title>Supermassive Black Holes with High Accretion Rates in Active Galactic Nuclei. XII. Reverberation Mapping Results for 15 PG Quasars from a Long-Duration High-Cadence Campaign</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first results from long-term high-cadence spectroscopic monitoring of 15 PG quasars with relatively strong Fe II emission as a part of a broader reverberation mapping campaign performed with the Calar Alto Observatory 2.2m telescope. The $V$-band, 5100 \r{A} continuum, and H$\beta$ broad emission line light curves were measured for a set of quasars for between dozens to more than a hundred epochs from May 2017 to July 2020. Accurate time lags between the variations of the H$\beta$ broad line fluxes and the optical continuum strength are obtained for all 15 quasars, ranging from $17.0_{-3.2}^{+2.5}$ to $95.9_{-23.9}^{+7.1}$ days in the rest frame. The virial masses of the central supermassive black holes are derived for all 15 quasars, ranging between $0.50_{-0.19}^{+0.18}$ and $19.17_{-2.73}^{+2.98}$ in units of $10^7 M_\odot$. For 11 of the objects in our sample, this is the first reverberation analysis published. Of the rest, two objects have been the subject of previous reverberation studies, but we determine time lags for these that are only half as long as found in the earlier investigations, which had only been able to sample much more sparsely. The remaining two objects have previously been monitored with high sampling rates. Our results here are consistent with the earlier findings in the sense that the time lag and the line width vary inversely consistent with virialization.</description>

      <title>Supermassive Black Holes with High Accretion Rates in Active Galactic Nuclei. XIV. Long-Duration High-Cadence Reverberation Mapping Results for 11 PG Quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the results of a long-duration high-cadence reverberation mapping campaign of a second batch of 11 PG quasars using the 2.2m telescope at the Calar Alto Observatory. This follows a similar earlier study of another sample of 15 objects reported by Hu et al. (2021). Among the 11 PG quasars, 8 objects have the H$\beta$ time lags measured for the first time, while the other 3 objects were observed in previous campaigns, but only had highly uncertain H$\beta$-lag measurements. Long-term light curves are presented of photometric $V$-band, spectroscopic 5100 \r{A} continuum, and the H$\beta$ emission line, lasting for $\sim$3--6 years with a cadence of $\sim$6--14 days. Accurate H$\beta$ time lags ranging from $\sim$20 to 150 days in the rest frame are obtained. The estimated virial masses of the central supermassive black holes range from $\sim$(3--300)$\times10^7 M_\odot$. Combining these results with those reported in Hu et al. (2021), we now have 26 PG quasars, with representative properties, having reliable H$\beta$ time-lag measurements from our long-duration high-cadence campaign. A tentative fit to the relation between the H$\beta$ time lag and the continuum luminosity for these 26 objects gives a slope of 0.53.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Accuracy of Non-parametric Galaxy Morphological Indicator Measurements in the CSST Imaging Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST) is China's upcoming next-generation ultraviolet and optical survey telescope, with imaging resolution capabilities comparable to the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). In this study, we utilized a comprehensive sample of 3,679 CSST realistic mock galaxies constructed from HST CANDELS/GOODS-North deep imaging observations, with stellar masses $\log\left(M_{*} / M_{\odot}\right) &gt; 9.0$ and redshifts $z &lt; 2$. We evaluate the detection capabilities of CSST surveys and the accuracy in measuring the non-parametric morphological indicators ($C$, $A$, $Gini$, $M_{\rm 20}$, $A_{\rm O}$, $D_{\rm O}$) of galaxies. Our findings show that in terms of galaxy detection capabilities, CSST's deep field surveys can achieve the same level as HST's deep field observations; however, in wide-field surveys, CSST exhibits a significant deficiency in detecting high-redshift, low-mass, low-surface-brightness galaxies. Regarding the measurement of galaxy morphology, CSST's deep field surveys achieve high accuracy across all indicators except for the asymmetry indicator ($A$), whereas its wide-field surveys suffer from significant systematic biases. We thus provide simple correction functions to adjust the non-parametric morphological indicators obtained from CSST's wide-field and deep-field observations, thereby aligning CSST measurements with those from HST. This adjustment enables the direct application of non-parametric morphological classification methods originally developed for HST data to galaxies observed by CSST.</description>

      <title>Toward A General Theory of Grain Alignment and Disruption by Radiative Torques and Magnetic Relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize the magnetically enhanced radiative torque (MRAT) alignment theory for general astrophysical environments described by a dimensionless parameter $U/(n_{1}T_{2})$ with $U$ local radiation strength, $n_{1}=n_{\rm H}/(10{\rm cm}^{-3})$ the hydrogen density, and $T_{2}=T_{\rm gas}/100{\rm K}$ the gas temperature. We first derive the critical magnetic relaxation $\delta_{\rm mag,cri}$ required to produce high-J attractors for different RAT models and local conditions and find that $\delta_{\rm mag,cri}$ must be larger for stronger radiation fields. We then numerically study the grain alignment and rotational disruption by the MRAT mechanism taking into account gas collisions and magnetic fluctuations. We find that, for the collision-dominated (CD) regime ($U/(n_{1}T_{2})\leq 1$), collisional and magnetic excitations can slowly transport large grains from low-J rotation to high-J attractors, leading to the perfect {\it slow alignment} within $\sim 10-100$ damping times due to MRATs. However, for the radiation-dominated (RD) regime ($U/(n_{1}T_{2})&gt;1$), only a fraction of grains can be fast aligned at high-J attractors by MRATs, and the majority of grains are trapped at low-J rotation due to strong radiative torques, a new effect we term {\it radiative torque (RAT) trapping}. For extreme radiation fields of $U/(n_{1}T_{2})&gt;10^{4}$, the efficiency of magnetic relaxation on grain alignment is suppressed, and grains only have fast alignment and disruption purely determined by RATs. We quantified the fraction of grains with fast alignment at high-J attractors, $f_{\rm high-J}^{\rm fast}$, for different RAT models, magnetic relaxation, and $U/(n_{1}T_{2})$, and found that the maximum $f_{\rm high-J}^{\rm fast}$ can reach $45\%$ by MRATs and $22\%$ by RATs.</description>

      <title>Intermediate-mass black holes and contribution to extragalactic background light from Population III stars in Milky Way-like galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mass range of observed black holes extends from stellar-mass to supermassive scales, yet the existence of objects in the intermediate-mass range of $10^{2} - 10^{5} \text{M}_{\odot}$ remains unconfirmed. Black holes are suspected to compress the surrounding dark matter distribution, forming a ``spike''. If dark matter is self-annihilating, the spike could produce gamma-ray emission sufficiently luminous to be detected. This work aims to estimate the number of expected unmerged intermediate-mass black holes in a Milky Way-like galaxy that could form such spikes. These intermediate-mass black holes are assumed to have formed from the collapse of high-mass Population III stars, such that the resulting merger rate is constrained by observations of gravitational wave emission. It is furthermore estimated to what extent the progenitor Population III stars contribute to the extragalactic background light. The Population III stars are simulated and tracked using the A-SLOTH semi-analytical simulation code and the resulting number of intermediate-mass black holes is constrained by applying the Population III binary black hole merger rate to an effective volume determined from the Population III star formation rate. In this framework, $\sim 130$ unmerged IMBHs from Population III stars are expected to reside in a Milky Way-like galaxy. The contribution of their progenitors to the EBL in the near-infrared is less than $10^{-3} \text{nW} \text{m}^{-2} \text{sr}^{-1}$, well below previous estimates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We utilized the Edelson and Malkan (2012) and Stern et al. (2012) selection techniques and other methods to identify AGN candidates that were monitored during the Kepler prime and K2 missions. Subsequent to those observations, we obtained 125 long-slit optical spectra with the Lick 3-m telescope, 58 spectra with the Palomar 5-m telescope, and three with the Keck 10-m telescope to test these identifications. Of these 186 AGN candidates, 105 were confirmed as Type 1 AGN and 35 as Type 2 AGN, while the remaining 46 were found to have other identifications (e.g., stars and normal galaxies). This indicated an overall reliability of about 75%, while the two main methods had much higher reliability, 87%-96%. The spectra indicated redshifts out to z = 3.4. Then, we examined the AGN sample properties through the Baldwin, Phillips &amp; Terlevich diagram and compared the AGN's spectral energy distributions (SEDs) with those from the literature. We found that our sample yielded the same AGN population as those identified through other methods, such as optical spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>A comparison of dust content and properties in GAMA/G10-COSMOS/3D-HST and SIMBA cosmological simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The abundance of dust within galaxies directly influences their evolution. Contemporary models attempt to match this abundance by simulating the processes of dust creation, growth, and destruction. While these models are accurate, they require refinement, especially at earlier epochs. This study aims to compare simulated and observed datasets and identify discrepancies between the two, providing a basis for future improvements. We utilise simulation data from the SIMBA cosmological simulation suite and observed data from the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA), a subset of the Cosmic Evolution Survey (G10-COSMOS), and the Hubble Space Telescope (3D-HST). We selected galaxies in the observed and simulated data in a stellar mass range of $(10^{8.59} &lt; M_\odot &lt; 10^{11.5})$ and at redshift bins centering around $(z = 0.0)$, $(z = 0.1)$, $(z = 0.5)$, $(z = 1.0)$, and $(z = 1.5)$ in a homogeneous dust mass range $((10^{6} &lt; M_D [M_\odot] &lt; 10^{9}))$. Our results show notable deviations between SIMBA and observed data for dust-poor and rich galaxies, with strong indications that differences in galaxy populations and SIMBA limitations are the underlying cause rather than the dust physics implemented in SIMBA itself.</description>

      <title>Computational Insights into the Chemical Reaction Networks of C3H6O3,C3H7O3 and C2H5O2: Implications for the Interstellar Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of complex organic molecules in the interstellar medium (ISM) is central to astrochemistry and prebiotic chemistry, as these species may act as precursors to biomolecules essential for life. Although glyceraldehyde (HOCH2CH(OH)C(O)H, GCA) has not yet been detected in the ISM, the presence of structurally related compounds in various astronomical environments suggests that it may form under interstellar conditions. In this study, we employed the automated reaction discovery tool AutoMeKin to systematically explore the gas-phase chemical reaction networks (CRNs) of C3H6O3 (GCA), C3H7O3 (a hydrogenated analog), and C2H5O2. Reaction pathways were characterized at the wB97XD/Def2-TZVPP level of theory, and rate coefficients for key processes were computed using the competitive canonical unified statistical (CCUS) model, which accounts for multiple dynamic bottlenecks. Our analysis revealed several barrierless pathways leading to GCA or to GCA and a leaving group. Notably, the reaction between glyoxal (HCOHCO) and the HOCHCH2OH radical, though neither has yet been detected in the ISM, was found to efficiently produce GCA and a formyl radical. However, aside from the aforementined exception, most GCA formation channels result in highly vibrationally excited intermediates that are more likely to undergo rapid unimolecular decomposition than to be stabilized by radiative emission under typical ISM conditions. These results suggest that while gas-phase GCA formation is chemically feasible, it is likely transient and difficult to detect directly. In contrast, alternative products such as formaldehyde, glycolaldehyde, and (Z)-ethene-1,2-diol dominate many pathways and align better with current astronomical observations.</description>

      <title>The circumstellar environment around the extreme Galactic red supergiant NML Cygni: Dense, dusty, and asymmetric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supernova observations imply the presence of a dense and asymmetric circumstellar environment around SN Type II progenitors, whereas the mass loss from these progenitors, namely, red supergiants, is still poorly constrained. We aim to characterise the dust and gas in the circumstellar environment of the extreme Galactic red supergiant \nmlcyg in terms of mass, morphology, and kinematics. Based on interferometric observations with NOEMA at 230 GHz we estimated dust masses and temperatures, and measured the extent and morphological complexity of the circumstellar environment. We detected two strong continuum components, amounting to an estimated total dust mass of $\sim2\times10^{-3}M_{\odot}$ located out to ~2000 AU from the star, largely beyond the dust detected at optical/infrared wavelengths. The extent of the detected CO emission supports the notion that the outflow is formed by a mass-loss rate of several $10^{-4}\,M_{\odot}$/year and that it is not primarily shaped by extreme irradiation from the Cyg OB2 cluster it has been associated with. We have detected, but not resolved, previously unseen high-velocity components close to the star. The observations reveal a very complex circumstellar morphology and we propose that some of the detected components could be the imprint of a hitherto unknown binary companion.</description>

      <title>A random walk model for the evolution of the halo spin vector</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We follow the spin vector evolutions of well resolved dark matter haloes (containing more than 300 particles) in merger tree main branches from the Millennium and Millennium-II N-body simulations, from z about 3.3 to z = 0. We find that there seems to be a characteristic plane for the spin vector evolution along each main branch. In the direction perpendicular to it, spin vectors oscillate around the plane, while within the plane, spin vectors show a coherent direction change as well as a diffusion in direction (possibly corresponds to a Gaussian white noise). This plane may reflect the geometry of surrounding large-scale structures. We also construct a simple stochastic model in which halo spin vector evolution is assumed to be driven by accretion of halo mass and angular momentum. This model can reproduce major features of the results from N-body simulations.</description>

      <title>Exploring the IR-radio correlation in massive galaxy clusters at the end of cosmic noon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of the environment on the infrared and radio emission of cluster galaxies during the transition epoch at 1 &lt; z &lt; 2 when they first start to quench consistently in the majority of galaxy clusters. We considered a sample of 129 cluster member galaxies from 11 massive clusters at a confirmed redshift of 1.0-1.8 from the IRAC Shallow Cluster Survey (ISCS), the IRAC Distant Cluster Survey (IDCS), and new 3 GHz images from the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA). We calculated the IR-radio correlation slope parameter, q, in order to identify differences in the ratios of IR to radio of cluster galaxies and field galaxy comparison samples at different redshifts. Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) were identified and analyzed to search for any effect on the IR-radio correlation. The correlation parameter values were also compared by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test with field galaxies. Our comparison of the IR-radio correlation in cluster galaxies to the control sample of field galaxies reveals a marginally to modestly significant difference in the correlation slope parameter at the ~2sigma-3sigma level. A split of the clusters into low-redshift (1 &lt; z &lt; 1.37) and high-redshift (1.37 &lt; z &lt; 1.8) bins indicates a more significant difference in the correlation parameter in the lower redshift cluster subsample, where widespread quenching begins. We find no difference in the IR-radio correlation between galaxies that host AGNs and non-active star-forming galaxies either. This suggests that our AGNs are overwhelmingly radio quiet and therefore do not affect the results we described above. We conclude that further investigations based on larger datasets are needed to constrain the impact of the cluster environment on the IR-radio correlation better.</description>

      <title>Measuring Interstellar Carbon Abundance via 158 um [CII] Absorption with SOFIA -- A Potential Detection, and Proof-of-Concept for Depletion Studies with Future Far-IR Facilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carbon plays key roles in the InterStellar Medium (ISM) -- as a constituent of dust, as the carrier of the dominant far-infrared cooling line, and as a component of various important molecules. But despite this, there are very few measurements of the abundance and depletion of carbon in the diffuse ISM. As with other elements, these measurements are traditionally performed in the ultraviolet. But for carbon, such measurements are extremely difficult, and less than 20 have been reported in the literature to date. Here, we present a novel method of measuring the abundance and depletion of carbon in the diffuse ISM: by observing absorption of the 158 $\mu$m [CII] line in the far-infrared. We present a catalog of 432 candidate sightlines that use bright nearby galaxies as background sources, and predict the [CII] absorption expected towards each. We conducted a pilot study using SOFIA, targeting sightlines towards the galaxies IC342 and Circinus. We report a potential detection of Galactic [CII] absorption along the IC342 sightline, although it requires disentangling [CII] emission from IC342 itself. The Circinus sightline had an insufficiently stable instrumental baseline to allow a detection. This SOFIA study informs the prospects for [CII] absorption measurements with future facilities. To that end, we explore the potential for four proposed future FIR telescopes -- PRIMA, FIRSST, SALTUS, and Origins -- to detect [CII] absorption. We find that all four facilities would be able to detect [CII] absorption along a significant number of sightlines.</description>

      <title>Molecular gas excitation and outflow properties of obscured quasars at z$\sim$0.1</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To investigate the impact of winds and low-to-moderate power jets on the cold molecular gas reservoirs of AGN, we present high angular resolution ALMA CO(2-1) and CO(3-2) observations of a sample of six type-2 quasars (QSO2s) at z$\sim$0.1 from the Quasar Feedback (QSOFEED) sample. Spatially resolved molecular line ratio maps, defined as $R_{32}=L'_{CO(3-2)}/L'_{CO(2-1)}$, and kinematic modelling were used to constrain changes in gas excitation and to identify gas outflows, respectively. We find that the molecular outflows are co-spatial with regions with $R_{32}$&gt;1, indicating enhanced temperature relative to the discs and the presence of optically thin gas in the outflows. We find mass outflow rates of 5$&lt;\dot{M}_{out}&lt;$150$M_\odot$/yr, much lower than those expected from their AGN luminosities of $10^{45.5-46}$erg/s. The outflow kinetic energies might be driven by the combined action of jets and winds/radiation pressure, with radiative coupling efficiencies ($\epsilon_{AGN}=\dot{E}_{out}/L_{bol}$) ranging from $10^{-6}&lt;\epsilon_{AGN}&lt;10^{-4}$ and jet coupling efficiencies ($\epsilon_{jet}=\dot{E}_{out}/P_{jet}$) from $10^{-3}&lt;\epsilon_{AGN}&lt;10^{-2}$. A linear regression including the six QSO2s follows the locus of $\epsilon_{jet}\sim$0.1\%. Our results provide evidence that AGN-driven jets/winds disturb the molecular gas kinematics and excitation within the central kpc of the galaxies. The coupling between compact jets and the ISM might be relevant to AGN feedback, even in the case of radio-quiet galaxies, which are more representative of the AGN population. Finally, we find that the warm and cold molecular gas phases seem to be tracing the same outflow, with the main distinction between them being the mass they carry, while the warm ionized outflows do not seem to be another face of the same outflow, as they show different orientation, velocity, and radius.</description>

      <title>The Rapidly--Changing Period of the QPE Source 1ES~1927+654</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several low--mass galaxy nuclei are observed to produce quasiperiodic eruptions (QPEs). Recently one of these systems, 1ES~1927+654, changed its quasiperiod drastically, from $\sim 18$ minutes to $\sim 7.1$ minutes, over a span of just two years. I suggest that this is an effect of von Zeipel -- Lidov -- Kozai (ZLK) cycles, where a more distant star orbits the QPE `binary' in which a white dwarf orbits a moderately massive central black hole. I show that in 1ES~1927+654 the white dwarf's orbital plane oscillates with angular amplitude $\simeq 71^{\circ}$ each side of the orbital plane of the distant star. This causes correlated changes of the orbital eccentricity and quasiperiod, and of the accretion luminosity driven by gravitational radiation losses. The GR luminosity has the characteristic property that it is inversely proportional to the instantaneous binary quasiperiod in all cases. The QPE system is probably just one of the effects produced by a complex infall event involving several stars. The whole system is likely to evolve rapidly, and will repay further monitoring.</description>

      <title>Gaia search for stellar companions of TESS Objects of Interest V</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present the latest results of our ongoing multiplicity survey of (Community) TESS Objects of Interest, using astrometry and photometry from the latest data release of the ESA Gaia mission to detect stellar companions of these stars and to characterize their properties. A total of 92 binary and two hierarchical triple star systems are identified among the 745 target stars whose multiplicity is explored in this study, all at distances of less than 500pc around the Sun. As expected for components of gravitationally bound star systems, the targets and the detected companions are at the same distance and share a common proper motion, as shown by their accurate Gaia astrometry. The companions have masses of about 0.12 to 1.6$M_\odot$. and are most frequently found in the mass range up to 0.6$M_\odot$. The companions have projected separations from the targets between about 110 and 9600au. Their frequency is highest and constant from about 300 to 800au, decreasing at larger projected separations. In addition to main sequence stars, five white dwarf companions are detected in this study, whose true nature is unveiled by their photometric properties.</description>

      <title>Investigating episodic mass loss in evolved massive stars: III. Spectroscopy of dusty massive stars in three northern galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mass loss in massive stars is crucial to understanding how these stars evolve and explode. Despite increasing evidence indicating its importance, episodic mass loss remains poorly understood. Here we report the results of an optical spectroscopic survey of evolved massive stars in NGC 6822, IC 10, and IC 1613, conducted by the ASSESS project (Episodic Mass Loss in Evolved Massive Stars: Key to Understanding the Explosive Early Universe), which aimed to investigate the role of episodic mass loss, by targeting stars with infrared excesses indicating a dusty circumstellar environment. We assigned a spectral class to 122 unique sources, the majority of which are dusty. The rate of evolved massive stars was over 60% for the highest-priority targets. We discovered 2 blue supergiants, 1 yellow supergiant, 1 emission-line object, and confirmed 2 supernova remnant candidates, a Wolf-Rayet star, and 2 H II regions. Twenty-eight unique sources were classified as red supergiants, 21 of which are new discoveries. In IC 10, we increased the sample of spectroscopically confirmed RSGs from 1 to 17. We used the MARCS models to obtain their surface properties, most importantly the effective temperature, and spectral energy distribution fitting to obtain the stellar luminosity for 17 of them. The dusty RSGs are cooler, more luminous, more extinguished, and more evolved than the non-dusty ones, in agreement with previous findings. Investigating the optical photometric variability of the RSGs from light curves covering a period over a decade revealed that the dusty RSGs are more variable. We further highlight the very extinguished emission-line object, two RSGs that display a significant change in spectral type between two observed epochs, and four dusty K-type RSGs as candidates for having undergone episodic mass loss.</description>

      <title>SHAPE: cosmology with cluster halo intrinsic alignments from subhalo distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galaxy clusters trace the most massive dark matter haloes, whose shapes and orientations reflect the imprint of the cosmic large-scale tidal field. This paper introduces the Subhalo-based Halo Alignment and Projected Ellipticity (SHAPE) technique, which reconstructs cluster halo shapes from the projected distribution of subhaloes, providing a novel approach to investigate intrinsic alignment (IA) correlations between cluster halo shapes and the surrounding density field. We measure halo shapes and orientations using different line-of-sight projection depths and find that, with modest projection depths, the shapes and orientations recovered by SHAPE show good agreement with those measured directly from the simulation particles. Using these SHAPE-derived shapes, we compute IA correlation functions from N-body simulations in both real and redshift space. The IA correlation multipoles exhibit features consistent with baryon acoustic oscillations around 100 Mpc/h and show redshift-space distortion (RSD) effects that agree well with predictions from a non-linear alignment model incorporating RSD. We further demonstrate that the structure growth rate parameter can be robustly estimated without bias from these IA correlations, providing a new avenue for cosmological parameter estimation. Expanding the IA correlations in an associated Legendre basis yields results consistent with those from the standard Legendre expansion, but with improved statistical significance. These results suggest that SHAPE may enhance cosmological parameter constraints in future galaxy surveys.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the Brief History of Time Stephen Hawking was pessimistic about astronomers detecting primordial black holes (PBHs). He would not be the only distinguished scientist to underestimate the extraordinary power of new technology. In a related area Albert Einstein published the equations for microlensing, but wrote off their practicality. Perhaps they meant "during my lifetime." The amazing properties of PBHs, however, validate heroic efforts to detect them. If they exist, their niches in our current history of time include supplying dark matter to bind galaxies, offering a solution for the Hubble tension, and, as supermassive black holes, giving us quasars as far as the eye can see. This Research Note describes a search for PBHs in the Gaia archive. In spite of the high density of local dark matter, it was unsuccessful. Microlensing with the Rubin telescope is the tool at our disposal to open the asteroid window for PBH.</description>

      <title>Hubble's Variable Nebula I: Ripples on a Big Screen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: NGC2261 is a reflection nebula illuminated by the young star R Monocerotis. Objects moving near the star occasionally cast shadows on the nebula, giving rise to its alternative name: Hubble's Variable Nebula. For 7 years since Spring 2017 robotic telescopes have been used to compile a roughly twice-weekly record of changes in the object. The results, over 1000 images at separate epochs, have been compiled into a movie. This shows that, as well as the large scale but infrequent variability for which it is famous, the nebula is continually traversed by low level `ripples' of light and dark. These record changes in the light output from R Mon and analysis of their progress indicates that the reflecting material takes the form of a thin (&lt;3x10^16cm) screen whose shape resembles a half paraboloid, rooted at the star and bowed towards us. The brightness of the screen in Herschel far-IR maps indicates a density n_H&gt; 1.7x10^5cm^-3 and CO observations show the material is moving towards us at a few km/s relative to the rest cloud, consistent it with being a dense shell of material displaced by R~Mon's outflow. The results demonstrate the value of studying such objects in the time domain, and are a glimpse of what will be achieved by instruments like the Zwicky Transient Facility and Vera Rubin Observatory.</description>

      <title>High optical to X-ray polarization ratio reveals Compton scattering in BL Lacertae's jet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Blazars, supermassive black hole systems (SMBHs) with highly relativistic jets aligned with the line of sight, are the most powerful long-lived emitters of electromagnetic emission in the Universe. We report here on a radio to gamma-ray multiwavelength campaign on the blazar BL Lacertae with unprecedented polarimetric coverage from radio to X-ray wavelengths. The observations caught an extraordinary event on 2023 November 10-18, when the degree of linear polarization of optical synchrotron radiation reached a record value of 47.5%. In stark contrast, the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) found that the X-ray (Compton scattering or hadron-induced) emission was polarized at less than 7.4% (3sigma confidence level). We argue here that this observational result rules out a hadronic origin of the high energy emission, and strongly favors a leptonic (Compton scattering) origin, thereby breaking the degeneracy between hadronic and leptonic emission models for BL Lacertae and demonstrating the power of multiwavelength polarimetry to address this question. Furthermore, the multiwavelength flux and polarization variability, featuring an extremely prominent rise and decay of the optical polarization degree, is interpreted for the first time by the relaxation of a magnetic "spring" embedded in the newly injected plasma. This suggests that the plasma jet can maintain a predominant toroidal magnetic field component parsecs away from the central engine.</description>

      <title>The 2023 outburst of the Gaia alerted EXor Gaia23bab</title>

Abstract: Episodic accretion is a fundamental process in the build-up of the stellar mass. EX Lupi-type eruptive young stars (EXors) represent one of the main types of episodic accretion. We study the recently discovered EXor Gaia23bab during its 2023 outburst. We obtained optical and near-infrared photometry and spectroscopy to probe the variation of the physical properties of Gaia23bab during its recent outburst. We also collected archival photometry to study a previous outburst of the star. We used several accretion tracers, including the Ca II triplet, He I, and various hydrogen lines from the Paschen and Brackett series, to measure the accretion rate during the outburst. The accretion rate is consistent with $\sim 2.0 \times 10^{-7} M_\odot$ $\rm{yr}^{-1}$. Comparing the line fluxes of the hydrogen Brackett series to predictions of Case B theory suggests excitation temperatures of 5000 - 10000 K and electron densities of $10^9$-$10^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$. Comparison to the predictions of a model for T Tauri stars revealed that the fluxes of the Balmer series are consistent with temperatures of 5000 - 12500 K and a hydrogen density of $10^8$ cm$^{-3}$, while the fluxes of the Paschen series are consistent with temperatures in the range between 10000 and 12500 K and a hydrogen density of $10^{11}$ cm$^{-3}$. The derived temperatures and densities confirm that Gaia23bab is a prototypical EXor, not only due to its accretion rate, but also based on the best fit temperatures and densities revealed by the detected hydrogen lines.</description>

      <title>The Secular Periodic Evolution of X-ray Quasi-periodic Eruptions Driven by Star-disc Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the secular periodic evolution of quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) for GSN069 and eRO-QPE2 assuming that they are driven by star-disc collisions. We set up numerical simulations and compared them with the observed periodic decay of $\sim -3160\pm720$ s yr$^{-1}$ in GSN069 and $\sim -370\pm40$ s yr$^{-1}$ in eRO-QPE2. We find that: (1) Stellar mass black holes are unlikely the orbiters in these two sources, as their periodic decay are on the order of $&lt;10$ s yr$^{-1}$; (2) A naked degenerate core (including white dwarf) is unlikely the orbiter in GSN069, as the decay is on the order of $&lt;200$ s yr$^{-1}$. However, it is possible in eRO-QPE2, although the required surface density of the accretion disc is relatively high (e.g., $\Sigma\gtrsim10^7\sim 10^8$ g cm$^{-2}$); (3) Both the orbiters in GSN069 and eRO-QPE2 can be solar-like main-sequence stars (MSs). However, each collision can lead to gradual ablation of the stellar envelope in the order of $10^{-5}\sim 10^{-3}M_\odot$. To reproduce the observed decay while surviving for $\gtrsim 3$ yr, the surface density of the disc needs to be within a certain range. For example, given a $1M_\odot$ MS orbiter the surface density of the disc gas should be in the range of $3\times10^5\sim 2\times10^6$g cm$^{-2}$ for GSN069 or $5\times10^4\sim 10^6$ g cm$^{-2}$ for eRO-QPE2. In both of these two sources, the MS can not survive for more than $\sim 12$ yr. We expect that future observations of these two sources can help to distinguish whether the orbiters are degenerated compact objects or gaseous stars.</description>

      <title>Searching for supermassive black holes binaries within SRG/eROSITA-De I: Properties of the X-ray selected candidates</title>

Abstract: Abridged: Supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) separated by (sub)-pc scales represent one of the latest stages of hierarchical galaxy assembly. However, many of these objects are hidden behind large columns of gas and dust at the center of galaxies and are difficult to detect. The X-ray and UV emission in these systems are predicted to vary regularly on timescales comparable to that of the orbital period of the binary. This is the first of a series of papers where we aim to find SMBHB candidates based on quasi-periodic light curves from the soft X-ray instrument eROSITA on board the Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) observatory and X-ray follow-up. We searched the multi-epoch SRG/eROSITA all-sky surveys for extragalactic sources that show an `up-down-up-down' or `down-up-down-up' profile (from scan to scan) in their 0.2--2.3 keV flux light curves. We compiled a sample of 16 sources that are suitable for X-ray follow-up campaigns given their brightness and significant variability between bright and faint SRG/eROSITA flux levels. We triggered extensive Swift-XRT and NICER monitoring campaigns on the best SMBHB candidates to confirm or discard their tentative periodicities. Optical spectroscopic observations confirmed the nuclear and extragalactic nature of 15/16 objects and enabled single-epoch SMBH mass measurements and BPT classifications. Our most promising candidate, eRASSt J0530-4125, shows X-ray quasi-periodic variability with a typical time scale of one year in the observed frame. By stacking the X-ray observations of each source in our sample, we find that 14/15 sources can be modeled by a power law with a photon index ranging from $\Gamma\sim1.8-2.8$. Based on our selection, we estimate an optimistic upper limit on the fraction of SMBHB candidates to be $\sim 0.05$ per galaxy. We emphasize that further observational evidence is needed to confirm the SMBHB nature of our sources.</description>

      <title>Two More Bow Shocks and Off-Center Halpha Nebulae Associated with Nova-like Cataclysmic Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report discoveries of bow-shock nebulae, seen in Halpha and [O III] 5007, around two cataclysmic variables (CVs): LS Pegasi and ASASSN-V J205457.73+515731.9 (hereafter ASASJ2054). Additionally, both stars lie near the edges of faint extended Halpha-emitting nebulae. The orientations of the bow shocks are consistent with the directions of the objects' proper motions. The properties of LS Peg and ASASJ2054, and of their nebulae, are remarkably similar to those of SY Cancri, which we described in a recent paper; SY Cnc is a CV likewise associated with a bow shock and an off-center Halpha nebula. These objects join V341 Arae and BZ Camelopardalis, CVs that are also accompanied by similar nebulae. All five stars belong to the nova-like variable (NLV) subclass of CVs, characterized by luminous optically thick accretion disks that launch fast winds into the surrounding space. We suggest that the bow shocks and nebulae result from chance encounters of the NLVs with interstellar gas clouds, with the stars leaving in their wakes Stromgren zones that are recombining after being photoionized by the CVs' ultraviolet and X-ray radiation. Our discoveries illustrate the power of small telescopes equipped with modern instrumentation, and used to accumulate extremely long exposure times, for the detection of very low-surface-brightness nebulae.</description>

      <title>Properties of 3D HI Filaments in the Smith High Velocity Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09164v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present findings of 3D filamentary structures in the Smith Cloud, a high-velocity cloud (HVC) located at $l=38^{\circ}$, $b=-13^{\circ}$. We use data from the Galactic Arecibo L-Band Feed Array \ion{H}{i} (GALFA-\ion{H}{i}) along with our new filament detection algorithm, \texttt{fil3d}, to characterize these structures. In this paper, we also discuss how different input parameters affect the output of \texttt{fil3d}. We study filaments in the local ISM and compare them to those found in the Smith Cloud. Based on thermal linewidth estimations we find supporting evidence that the Smith Cloud filaments are part of its warm neutral medium. We also find a relationship between thermal linewidth and the $v_{LSR}$ of the filaments. We study the plane-of-sky magnetic field as traced by Planck 353 GHz polarized dust emission along the line of sight and find the HI filaments in this region are not aligned with the magnetic field. This is likely related to their location close to dynamic processes in the Galactic Plane and/or the low column density of the filaments relative to emission in the Plane. The results show the HI filaments are found in a wide range of Galactic environments and form through multiple processes.</description>

      <title>Hidden Population III Descendants in Ultra-Faint Dwarf Galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12960v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The elusive properties of the first (Pop III) stars can be indirectly unveiled by uncovering their true descendants. To this aim, we exploit our data-calibrated model for the best-studied ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxy, Bo\"otes I, which tracks the chemical evolution (from carbon to zinc) of individual stars from their formation to the present day. We explore the chemical imprint of Pop III supernovae (SNe), with different explosion energies and masses, showing that they leave distinct chemical signatures in their descendants. We find that UFDs are strongly affected by SNe-driven feedback resulting in a very low fraction of metals retained by their gravitational potential well ($&lt;2.5\%$). Furthermore, the higher the Pop III SN explosion energy, the lower the fraction of metals retained. Thus, the probability to find descendants of energetic Pair Instability SNe is extremely low in these systems. Conversely, UFDs are ideal cosmic laboratories to identify the fingerprints of less massive and energetic Pop III SNe through their [X/Fe] abundance ratios. Digging into the literature data of Bo\"otes I, we uncover three hidden candidates for Pop III descendants: one mono-enriched and two multi-enriched. These stars show the chemical signature of Pop III SNe in the mass range $[20-65] \rm M_{\odot}$, spanning a wide range in explosion energies $[0.3- 10]10^{51}$ erg. In conclusion, candidates for Pop III descendants are hidden in ancient UFDs but those mono-enriched by a single Pop III SN are extremely rare. Thus, self-consistent models such as the one presented here are required to uncover these precious fossils and probe the properties of the first Pop III supernovae.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Search for Galaxies with Extended Emission Line and Potential Outflows in JADES Medium-Band Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11464v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the first time, we present a systematic search for galaxies with extended emission line and potential outflow features using \textit{JWST} medium-band images in the GOODS-S field. This is done by comparing the morphology in medium-band images to adjacent continuum and UV bands. We look for galaxies that have a maximum extent 50\% larger, an excess area 30\% greater, or an axis ratio difference of more than 0.3 in the medium band compared to the reference bands. After visual inspection, we find 326 candidate galaxies at $1.4 &lt; z &lt; 8.4$, with a peak in the population near cosmic noon, benefiting from the good coverage of the medium-band filters. By fitting their SEDs, we find that the candidate galaxies are at least 20\% more bursty in their star-forming activity and have 50\% more young stellar populations compared to a control sample selected based on the continuum band flux. Additionally, these candidates exhibit a significantly higher production rate of ionizing photons. We further find that candidates hosting known AGN produce extended emission that is more anisotropic compared to non-AGN candidates. A few of our candidates have been spectroscopically confirmed to have prominent outflow signatures through NIRSpec observations, showcasing the robustness of the photometric selection. Future spectroscopic follow-up will better help verify and characterize the kinematics and chemical properties of these systems.</description>

      <title>UNCOVERing the High-redshift AGN Population among Extreme UV Line Emitters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12232v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: JWST has revealed diverse new populations of high-redshift ($z\sim4-11$) AGN and extreme star-forming galaxies that challenge current models. In this paper, we use rest-frame UV emission-line diagnostics to identify AGN candidates and other exceptional ionizing sources, complementing previous studies predominantly focused on broad-line AGN. From a parent sample of 205 $\mathrm{z_{spec}}&gt;3$ UNCOVER galaxies with NIRSpec/PRISM follow-up, we identify 12 C IV, He II, and C III] emitters. Three of these galaxies also exhibit clear N III] and/or N IV] lines. Leveraging the combined rest-optical and UV coverage of PRISM, we limit the emission-line model space using the sample's [O III]/H$\beta$ distribution, significantly decreasing the overlap between AGN and star-formation models in the UV diagnostics. We then find that the five He II emitters are the strongest AGN candidates, with further support from two [Ne V] detections and one X-ray detection from Chandra. Our Balmer line fits also reveal one new broad-line AGN at z=6.87. We cannot robustly quantify the AGN fraction in this sample, but we note that close to 20% of $\mathrm{M_{*}&gt;2\times10^{9}\,M_{\odot}}$ parent sample galaxies are AGN candidates. The lower-mass line emitters, which are consistent with both AGN and star-forming photoionization models, have more compact sizes and higher specific star formation rates than the parent sample. Higher-resolution and deeper data on these UV line emitters should provide much stronger constraints on the obscured AGN fraction at $z &gt; 3$.</description>

      <title>SMILES: Potentially Higher Ionizing Photon Production Efficiency in Overdense Regions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14804v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The topology of reionization and the environments where galaxies efficiently produce ionizing photons are key open questions. For the first time, we investigate the trend between ionizing photon production efficiency, $\xi_{\rm ion}$, and galaxy overdensity, $\log(1+\delta)$. We analyze the ionizing properties of 79 galaxies between $1.0 &lt; z &lt; 5.2$ using JWST NIRSpec medium-resolution spectra from the Systematic Mid-infrared Instrument (MIRI) Legacy Extragalactic Survey (SMILES) program. Among these, 67 galaxies have H$\alpha$ coverage, spanning $1.0 &lt; z &lt; 3.1$. The galaxy overdensity, $\log(1+\delta)$, is measured using the JADES photometric catalog, which covers the SMILES footprint. For the subset with H$\alpha$ coverage, we find that $\log\xi_{\rm ion}$ is positively correlated with $\log(1+\delta)$, with a slope of $0.94_{-0.46}^{+0.46}$. Additionally, the mean $\xi_{\rm ion}$ for galaxies in overdense regions ($\log(1+\delta) &gt; 0.1$) is 2.43 times that of galaxies in lower density regions ($\log(1+\delta) &lt; 0.1$). This strong trend is found to be independent of redshift evolution. Furthermore, our results confirm the robust correlations between $\xi_{\rm ion}$ and the rest-frame equivalent widths of the [O III] or H$\alpha$ emission lines. Our results suggest that galaxies in high-density regions are efficient producers of ionizing photons.</description>

      <title>On the Origin of the High Star-Formation Efficiency in Massive Galaxies at Cosmic Dawn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20530v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the early excess of bright galaxies seen by JWST, we run zoom-in cosmological simulations of a massive galaxy at Cosmic Dawn, in a halo of $10^{11} M_\odot$ at $z = 9$, using the hydro-gravitational code RAMSES at an effective resolution $\sim 10~{\rm pc}$. We investigate physical mechanisms that enhance the star-formation efficiencies (SFEs) at the high gas densities of the star-forming regions in this galaxy ($\sim 3\times 10^3~{\rm cm^{-3}}$, $\sim 10^4~M_\odot/{\rm pc^2}$). Our fiducial star formation recipe uses a physically-motivated, turbulence-based, multi-freefall model, avoiding ad hoc extrapolation from lower redshifts. By $z = 9$, our simulated galaxy is a clumpy, thick, rotating disc with a high stellar mass $\sim 3\times 10^9~M_\odot$ and high star formation rate $\sim 50~M_\odot/{\rm yr}$. The high gas density makes supernova (SN) feedback less efficient, producing a high local SFE $\gtrsim 10\%$. The global SFE is set by feedback-driven outflows and only weakly correlated with the local SFE. Photoionization heating makes SN feedback more efficient, but the integrated SFE always remains high. Intense accretion at Cosmic Dawn seeds turbulence which reduces local SFE, but this only weakly affects the global SFE. The star formation histories of our simulated galaxies are similar to observed massive galaxies at Cosmic Dawn, despite our limited resolution. We set the stage for future simulations which treat radiation self-consistently and use a higher effective resolution $\sim 1~{\rm pc}$ that captures the physics of star-forming clouds.</description>

      <title>Capivara: A Spectral-based Segmentation Method for IFU Data Cubes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present capivara, a fast and scalable spectral-based segmentation package designed to study astrophysical properties within distinct structural components of galaxies. This spectro-segmentation code for integral field unit (IFU) data provides a holistic view of galactic structure, moving beyond conventional radial gradients and the bulge-plus-disk dichotomy. It enables detailed comparisons of stellar ages and metallicities across components, and naturally identifies outliers by grouping spaxels according to dominant spectral features. The algorithm leverages Torch's scalability and GPU acceleration, outputting a masked FITS file that assigns each pixel to its respective group and generates the corresponding one-dimensional spectrum per group, without relying on Voronoi binning. We demonstrate the capabilities of the method using a sample of MaNGA galaxies, combining capivara segmentation with the starlight spectral fitting code to derive stellar population and ionized gas properties. The method effectively identifies regions with similar spectral properties across both continuum and emission lines. By aggregating the spectra of these regions, we enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of the analysis while preserving the spectral coherence within each group. capivara is released under an MIT license and is available at https://github.com/RafaelSdeSouza/capivara.</description>

      <title>On the Orbital Effects of Stellar Collisions in Galactic Nuclei: Tidal Disruption Events and Ejected Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00975v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dense stellar clusters surround the supermassive black holes (SMBH) in galactic nuclei. Interactions within the cluster can alter the stellar orbits, occasionally driving a star into the SMBH's tidal radius where it becomes ruptured, or expelling a star from the nuclear cluster. This proof-of-concept study examines the orbital effects of stellar collisions using a semi-analytic model. Both low and high speed collisions occur in the SMBH's sphere of influence. We find that collisions can place stars on nearly radial orbits. Depositing stars within the tidal radius, collisions may drive the disruption of stars with unusual masses and structures: depending on the nature of the collision, the star could be the product of a recent merger, or it could have lost its outer layers in a previous high speed impact, appearing as a stripped star. We also find that high speed collisions near the periapsis of an eccentric orbit can unbind stars from the SMBH. However, dissipation during these high-speed collisions can substantially reduce the number of unbound stars achieved in our simulations. We conclude that tidal disruption events (TDEs) and ejected stars, even in the hypervelocity regime, are plausible outcomes of stellar collisions, though their frequency in a three-dimensional nuclear star cluster are uncertain. Future work will address the rates and properties of these events.</description>

      <title>Black Holes as Condensation Points of Fuzzy Dark Matter Cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15465v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We simulate the formation of Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM) cores in the presence of a Black Hole (BH) to explore whether BHs can serve as seeds for FDM core condensation. Our analysis is based on the core-condensation via the kinetic relaxation process for random initial conditions of the FDM. In a generic scenario the BH merges with a pre-collapsed mini-cluster formed in a random location, once they share location the core-condensation starts withe the FDM density centered at the black hole that during the process acquires a profile consistent with that of the stationary solution of the FDM+BH eigenvalue problem. These results indicate that BHs can indeed act as focal points for FDM core condensation. Furthermore, we find that the central density of the resulting FDM core depends on the mass of the BH, which due to its permanent motion relative to the FDM core during the evolution, produces a smaller core density for bigger BH masses; in this way the BH mass is a parameter leading to a new diversity of central FDM core densities. As a collateral result, for our analysis we revised the construction of stationary solutions of FDM+BH and found a phenomenological formula for the FDM density that can be used to fit FDM cores around BHs.</description>

      <title>The long road to the Green Valley: Tracing the evolution of the Green Valley galaxies in the EAGLE simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the evolution of the progenitors of the present-day Green Valley (GV) galaxies across redshift $z=10-0$ using data from the EAGLE simulations. We identify the present-day green valley galaxies using entropic thresholding and track the evolution of the physical properties of their progenitors up to $z=10$. Our study identifies three distinct phases in their evolution: (i) an early growth phase ($z=10-6$), where progenitors are gas-rich, efficiently form stars, and experience AGN feedback regulating star formation in massive galaxies, (ii) a transition phase ($z=6-2$), marked by frequent interactions and mergers in higher-density environments, driving starbursts, depleting gas reservoirs, and strengthening correlations between cold gas and halo properties, and (iii) a quenching phase ($z=2-0$), dominated by environmental and mass-dependent processes that suppress star formation and deplete cold gas. Our analysis shows that at $z&lt;1$, environmental factors and cold gas depletion dominate quenching, with tighter correlations between stellar mass, SFR, and cold gas content. The interplay between mass and environmental density during this period drives diverse and distinct evolutionary pathways. Our analysis shows that majority of the main progenitor branches of the present-day GV galaxies entered the green valley at $z&lt;1$. We also find that a small fraction ($\sim 5\%$) of the main progenitor branches had already crossed the green valley and joined the red sequence by $z=0.1$, indicating that some galaxies may undergo late-time rejuvenation, that allows them to reenter the green valley by the present day. Our findings provide a comprehensive view of the mechanisms shaping the GV population across cosmic time.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent Solutions of Evolving Nuclear Star Clusters with Two-Dimensional Monte-Carlo Dynamical Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05016v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We recently developed a Monte-Carlo method (GNC) that can simulate the dynamical evolution of a nuclear stellar cluster (NSC) with a massive black hole (MBH), where the two-body relaxations can be solved by the Fokker-Planck equations in energy and angular momentum space. Here we make a major update of GNC~ by integrating stellar potential and adiabatic invariant theory, so that we can study the self-consistent dynamics of NSCs with increasing mass of the MBH. We perform tests of the self-adaptation of cluster density due to MBH mass growth and Plummer core collapse, both finding consistent results with previous studies, the latter having a core collapse time of $\sim 17t_{\rm rh}$ by GNC, where $t_{\rm rh}$ is the time of half-mass relaxation. We use GNC~ to study the cosmological evolution of the properties of NSC and the mass of MBH assuming that the mass growth of the MBH is due to loss-cone accretion of stars (e.g., tidal disruption of stars) and stellar black holes, and compare the simulation results with the observations of NSCs in Milky-Way or near-by galaxies. Such scenario is possible to produce MBHs with mass $10^5\sim 10^7\,M_\odot$ for NSCs with stellar mass of $10^6\sim 10^9\,M_\odot$. In Milky-Way's NSC, to grow MBH up to $4\times 10^6\,M_\odot$, its size needs to be $\sim 1.7$ times more compact in early universe than the current value. MBHs with current masses $&gt;6\times 10^{7}\,M_\odot$ seem difficult to explain by loss-cone accretion alone, and thus may require other additional accretion channels, such as gas accretion.</description>

      <title>Luminosity and stellar mass functions of faint photometric satellites around spectroscopic central galaxies from DESI Year-1 Bright Galaxy Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We measure the luminosity functions (LFs) and stellar mass functions (SMFs) of photometric satellite galaxies around spectroscopically identified isolated central galaxies (ICGs). The photometric satellites are from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys (DR9), while the spectroscopic ICGs are selected from the DESI Year-1 BGS sample. We can measure satellite LFs down to $r$-band absolute magnitudes of $M_{r,\mathrm{sat}}\sim-7$, around ICGs as small as $7.1&lt;\log_{10}M_{\ast,\mathrm{ICG}}/\mathrm{M_\odot}&lt;7.8$, with the stellar mass of ICGs measured by the DESI Fastspecfit pipeline. The satellite SMF can be measured down to $\log_{10}M_{\ast,\mathrm{sat}}/\mathrm{M_\odot}\sim 5.5$. Interestingly, we discover that the faint/low-mass end slopes of satellite LFs/SMFs become steeper with the decrease in the stellar masses of host ICGs, with smaller and nearby host ICGs capable of being used to probe their fainter satellites.. The steepest slopes are $-2.298\pm0.656$ and $-$2.888$\pm$0.916 for satellite LF and SMF, respectively. Detailed comparisons are performed between the satellite LFs around ICGs selected from DESI BGS or from the SDSS NYU-VAGC spectroscopic Main galaxies over $7.1&lt;\log_{10}M_{\ast,\mathrm{ICG}}/\mathrm{M_\odot}&lt;11.7$, showing reasonable agreements, but we show that the differences between DESI and SDSS stellar masses for ICGs play a role to affect the results. We also compare measurements based on DESI Fastspecfit and Cigale stellar masses used to bin ICGs, with the latter including the modeling of AGN based on WISE photometry, and we find good agreements in the measured satellite LFs by using either of the DESI stellar mass catalogs.</description>

      <title>Gas Transfer Between the Inner 3-kpc Disk and the Galactic Central Molecular Zone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12313v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We uncovered a more tilted molecular gas structure with highly negative velocities located near the dust lane. Our observations also show that the approaching gas flows from the overshoot process are captured by the bar gravitational and then flows towards the Galactic central molecular zone (CMZ) through the bar channel. The recycling gas from the overshoot effect, in conjunction with freshly accreted gas from the inner 3-kpc disk, accumulates significantly near R_GC~1/2R_bar and R_GC~2/3R_bar regions by adopting a bar length of ~3.2--3.4kpc. Importantly, within these regions, there are frequent collisions and substantial angular momentum exchanges between gas flows with different trajectories. In this scenario, the DISSIPATION processes arising from interactions between colliding flows, together with the varying torques induced by the nonaxisymmetric bar, effectively transfer the angular momentum of viscous gas outward, thereby driving the molecular gas to settle into the CMZ within ~3 orbital periods. A long-term gas inflow with an average rate of &gt;1.1Msun/yr, coupled with intense transient accretion events that exceed the average rate by several times due to the overshoot effect, significantly regulates the gas distribution, physical properties, and dynamical evolution of the CMZ. These findings provide robust observational evidence for elucidating the intricate dynamics of molecular gas flows towards the CMZ. Our results show that gas dynamics has a significant impact on the secular evolution of both the Milky Way and the extragalactic gas-rich galaxies.</description>

      <title>A characteristic optical variability time scale in jetted active galactic nuclei: a large gamma-ray emission sample</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The variability mechanisms from jetted AGNs are still under debate. Here the damped random walk (DRW) model, implemented through Gaussian Processe (GPs), is used to fit the $ZTF$ long-term optical light curves of 1684 $\gamma$-ray emission jetted AGNs. This analysis yields one of the largest samples with characteristic optical variability timescales for jetted AGNs. A single DRW model from GPs can fit the optical light curve of most jetted AGNs well/potentially well, while there are still some jetted AGNs whose light curve can not be fitted well by a single DRW model. After the jet power, proxied by gamma-ray luminosity, is introduced as a new parameter, new relationships among intrinsic variability time scales, black hole mass and jet power are discovered for efficient accretion AGNs ($\tau^{\rm in} \propto M_{\rm BH}^{0.29^{+0.06}_{-0.06}}P_{\rm jet}^{-0.3^{+0.03}_{-0.03}}$ with scatter of approximately 0.09~dex) and for inefficient accretion AGNs ($\tau^{\rm in} \propto M_{\rm BH}^{0.06^{+0.07}_{-0.07}}P_{\rm jet}^{0.37^{+0.11}_{-0.11}}$ with scatter of approximately 0.14~dex), respectively. Our results support that the optical variability of jetted AGNs with efficient accretion may originate within the standard accretion disk at UV emitting radii similar to non-jetted AGNs, and is directly related to the acceleration of shock in the jet and then enhanced through the beaming effect in beamed AGNs. For the jetted AGNs with inefficient accretion, the intrinsic timescale is consistent with the escape timescale of electrons.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Lagrangian bias estimators and the cumulant bias expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01950v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spatial distribution of galaxies is a highly complex phenomenon currently impossible to predict deterministically. However, by using a statistical $\textit{bias}$ relation, it becomes possible to robustly model the average abundance of galaxies as a function of the underlying matter density field. Understanding the properties and parametric description of the bias relation is key to extract cosmological information from future galaxy surveys. Here, we contribute to this topic primarily in two ways: (1) We develop a new set of probabilistic estimators for bias parameters using the moments of the Lagrangian galaxy environment distribution. These estimators include spatial corrections at different orders to measure bias parameters independently of the damping scale. We report robust measurements of a variety of bias parameters for haloes, including the tidal bias and its dependence with spin at a fixed mass. (2) We propose an alternative formulation of the bias expansion in terms of "cumulant bias parameters" that describe the response of the logarithmic galaxy density to large-scale perturbations. We find that cumulant biases of haloes are consistent with zero at orders $n &gt; 2$. This suggests that: (i) previously reported bias relations at order $n &gt; 2$ are an artefact of the entangled basis of the canonical bias expansion; (ii) the convergence of the bias expansion may be improved by phrasing it in terms of cumulants; (iii) the bias function is very well approximated by a Gaussian -- an avenue which we explore in a companion paper.</description>

      <title>Lensing and wave optics in the strong field of a black hole</title>

Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) are lensed by matter, offering a unique probe of both the large-scale structure of the Universe and the fundamental properties of GW propagation. GWs can also be affected by wave optics effects when their wavelength is comparable to the size of the lens. While this regime has been well studied in the Newtonian approximation, the role of strong gravitational fields remains largely unexplored. This is particularly relevant for lensing by intermediate and supermassive black holes (BHs), which can occur near active galactic nuclei or in compact triple systems. In this work, we analyze the lensing of GWs by a non-rotating BH and compare our results to the Newtonian point-mass approximation. We construct frequency-dependent amplification factors that incorporate strong-field effects, revealing explicit polarization mixing and absorption by the event horizon. Using a fiducial GW event, we explore key phenomenological signatures of BH lensing, highlighting new observational opportunities to probe strong gravitational fields through GW lensing.</description>

Abstract: We present a new rotating black hole solution to the Einstein equations as an extension of the Kerr spacetime. To derive this solution, we use the Newman-Janis algorithm and results from the non-complexification procedure. Interestingly, the solution we find may not be uniquely characterized by asymptotic parameters such as mass, angular momentum, and charge, thereby challenging the no-hair theorem. We also analyze in detail how this additional characteristics (``hair") affects the thermodynamic properties of the black hole.</description>

      <title>High energy extragalactic multimessenger backgrounds from starburst and dead galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18721v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Starburst galaxies are $\gamma$-ray sources. Canonically, their emission is driven by hadronic cosmic rays (CRs) interacting with interstellar gas, forming $\gamma$-rays via the decay of neutral pions. Charged pions are also formed in this process. They decay into secondary leptons, including electrons and neutrinos. Starburst galaxies are therefore also expected to be neutrino sources, and their high-energy $\gamma$-ray emission may include a secondary leptonic component. Leptonic $\gamma$-rays may also originate from electrons directly energized by shocks within the interstellar medium of galaxies, or from pulsars and their surrounding halos. In the Milky Way, pulsars/pulsar halos are the dominant $\gamma$-ray source class. They are associated with stellar remnants or old stellar populations, and are presumably abundant in old galaxies. In this work, we show that the collective high-energy emission from galaxies can account for only a fraction of extragalactic neutrinos, but can form a major component of the extragalactic $\gamma$-ray background. Contrary to the traditional view, a substantial fraction of this radiation may originate from leptonic processes, including from old, quiescent galaxies.</description>
