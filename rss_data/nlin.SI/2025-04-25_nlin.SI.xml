      <title>Long-time asymptotics of the Sawada-Kotera equation on the line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sawada-Kotera (SK) equation is an integrable system characterized by a third-order Lax operator and is related to the modified Sawada-Kotera (mSK) equation through a Miura transformation. This work formulates the Riemann-Hilbert problem associated with the SK and mSK equations by using direct and inverse scattering transforms. The long-time asymptotic behaviors of the solutions to these equations are then analyzed via the Deift-Zhou steepest descent method for Riemann-Hilbert problems. It is shown that the asymptotic solutions of the SK and mSK equations are categorized into four distinct regions: the decay region, the dispersive wave region, the Painlev\'{e} region, and the rapid decay region. Notably, the Painlev\'{e} region is governed by the F-XVIII equation in the Painlev\'{e} classification of fourth-order ordinary differential equations, a fourth-order analogue of the Painlev\'{e} transcendents. This connection is established through the Riemann-Hilbert formulation in this work. Similar to the KdV equation, the SK equation exhibits a transition region between the dispersive wave and Painlev\'{e} regions, arising from the special values of the reflection coefficients at the origin. Finally, numerical comparisons demonstrate that the asymptotic solutions agree excellently with results from direct numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Top on a smooth plane</title>

Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of a sliding top that is a rigid body with an ideal sharp tip moving in a perfectly smooth horizontal plane, so no friction forces act on the body. We prove that this system is integrable only in two cases analogous to the Euler and Lagrange cases of the classical top problem. The cases with the constant gravity field with acceleration $g\neq0$ and without external field $g=0$ are considered. The non-integrability proof for $g\neq0$ based on the fact that the equations of motion for the sliding top are a perturbation of the classical top equations of motion. We show that the integrability of the classical top is a necessary condition for the integrability of the sliding top. Among four integrable classical top cases the corresponding two cases for the sliding top are also integrable, and for the two remaining cases, we prove their non-integrability by analyzing the differential Galois group of variational equations along a certain particular solution. In the absence of constant gravitational field $g=0$ the integrability is much more difficult. At first, we proved that if the sliding top problem is integrable, then the body is symmetric. In the proof, we applied one of the Ziglin theorem concerning the splitting of separatrices phenomenon. Then we prove the non-integrability of the symmetric sliding top using differential Galois group of variational equations except two the same as for $g\neq0$ cases. The integrability of these cases is also preserved when we add to equations of motion a gyrostatic term.</description>

      <title>Higher-Spin Currents and Flows in Auxiliary Field Sigma Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study local, higher-spin conserved currents in integrable $2d$ sigma models that have been deformed via coupling to auxiliary fields. These currents generate integrability-preserving flows introduced by Smirnov and Zamolodchikov. For auxiliary field (AF) deformations of a free boson, we prove that local spin-$n$ currents exist for all $n$ and give recursion relations that characterize Smirnov-Zamolodchikov (SZ) flows driven by these currents. We then show how to construct spin-$2n$ currents in a unified class of auxiliary field sigma models with common structure -- including AF theories based on the principal chiral model (PCM), its non-Abelian T-dual, (bi-)Yang-Baxter deformations of the PCM, and symmetric space models -- for interaction functions of one variable, and describe SZ flows driven by any function of the stress tensor in these cases. Finally, we give perturbative solutions for spin-$3$ SZ flows in any member of our unified class of AF models with underlying $\mathfrak{su}(3)$ algebra. Part of our analysis shows that the class of AF deformations can be extended by allowing the interaction function to depend on a larger set of variables than has previously been considered.</description>

      <title>On soliton resolution to Cauchy problem of the spin-1 Gross-Pitaevskii equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Cauchy problem for the spin-1 Gross-Pitaevskii(GP) equation, which is a model instrumental in characterizing the soliton dynamics within spinor Bose-Einstein condensates. Recently, Geng $etal.$ (Commun. Math. Phys. 382, 585-611 (2021)) reported the long-time asymptotic result with error $\mathcal{O}(\frac{\log t}t)$ for the spin-1 GP equation that only exists in the continuous spectrum. The main purpose of our work is to further generalize and improve Geng's work. Compared with the previous work, our asymptotic error accuracy has been improved from $\mathcal{O}(\frac{\log t}t)$ to $\mathcal{O}(t^{-3/4})$. More importantly, by establishing two matrix valued functions, we obtained effective asymptotic errors and successfully constructed asymptotic analysis of the spin-1 GP equation based on the characteristics of the spectral problem, including two cases: (i)coexistence of discrete and continuous spectrum; (ii)only continuous spectrum which considered by Geng's work with error $\mathcal{O}(\frac{\log t}t)$. For the case (i), the corresponding asymptotic approximations can be characterized with an $N$-soliton as well as an interaction term between soliton solutions and the dispersion term with diverse residual error order $\mathcal{O}(t^{-3/4})$. For the case (ii), the corresponding asymptotic approximations can be characterized with the leading term on the continuous spectrum and the residual error order $\mathcal{O}(t^{-3/4})$. Finally, our results confirm the soliton resolution conjecture for the spin-1 GP equation.</description>

      <title>Three-local Charge Conservation Implies Quantum Integrability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is shown that the existence of a local conserved charge supported by three neighboring sites, or its local version, Reshetikhin's condition, suffices to guarantee the existence of all higher conserved charges and hence the integrability of a quantum spin chain. This explains the ``coincidence'' that no counterexample is known to Grabowski and Mathieu's long-standing conjecture despite the folklore that the conservation of local charges of order higher than 4 imposes additional constraints not implied by the conservation of the three-local charge.</description>

      <title>The $q$-deformed Calogero's Goldfish Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Searching for integrable models is a central theme in theoretical and mathematical physics, as such systems offer valuable insights into the underlying structure and symmetries of complex physical phenomena. In this work, we contribute to this pursuit by proposing a new class of one-dimensional many-body integrable systems, which we refer to as the $q$-deformed Calogero's Goldfish system. Our construction employs $q$-deformation of logarithmic and exponential functions inspired by Tsallis' formalism in non-extensive statistical mechanics. Notably, the model satisfies the double-zero condition on its solutions, underscoring its integrable nature and offering a novel perspective on deformation techniques within exactly solvable systems.</description>
