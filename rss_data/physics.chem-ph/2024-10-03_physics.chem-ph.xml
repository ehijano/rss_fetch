      <title>Noise Tolerant Force Calculations in Density Functional Theory: A Surface Integral Approach for Wavelet-Based Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a method for computing quantum mechanical forces through surface integrals over the stress tensor within the framework of density functional theory. This approach avoids the inaccuracies of traditional force calculations using the Hellmann-Feynman theorem when applied to multiresolution wavelet representations of orbitals. By integrating the quantum mechanical stress tensor over surfaces that enclose individual nuclei, we achieve highly accurate forces that exhibit superior consistency with the potential energy surface. Extensive benchmarks show that surface integrals over the stress tensor offer a robust and reliable alternative to the direct use of the Hellmann-Feynman theorem for force computations in DFT with discontinuous basis sets, particularly in cases where wavelet-based methods are employed. In addition, we integrate this approach with machine learning techniques, demonstrating that the forces obtained through surface integrals are sufficiently accurate to be used as training data for machine-learned potentials. This stands in contrast to forces calculated using the Hellmann-Feynman theorem, which do not offer this level of accuracy.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of mixtures with strong negative deviations from Raoult's law. XVIII: Excess molar enthalpies for the (1-alkanol + cyclohexylamine) systems at 298.15 K and modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excess molar enthalpies, $H_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$, have been measured using a Tian-Calvet microcalorimeter for the systems CH$_3$(CH$_2$)$_{u-1}$OH ($u$ = 1,2,3,4,7,10) + cyclohexylamine at 298.15 K and 0.1 MPa. The $H_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$ values are large and negative, indicating the existence of strong interactions between unlike molecules, which is consistent with the also large and negative excess molar volumes, $V_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$, of these solutions, previously measured by us. The contribution from the equation of state term to $H_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$ has been evaluated for the 1-alkanol + cyclohexylamine, or + 1-hexylamine, or + aniline mixtures, and the corresponding excess molar internal energies at constant volume, $U_{\text{m,}V}^{\text{E}}$, have been determined. It is shown that such contribution is particularly important for the methanol + aniline system, in such a way that the excess functions $H_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$ and $U_{\text{m,}V}^{\text{E}}$ have different sign at $x_1$ = 0.5. The DISQUAC and ERAS models have been applied to the cyclohexylamine systems, and the interaction parameters have been reported. DISQUAC improves ERAS results on $H_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$. The latter model describes correctly the $V_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$ curves. The variation of of CH$_3$(CH$_2$)$_{u-1}$OH + cyclohexylamine, or + 1-hexylamine, or + aniline mixtures with $u$ along a homologous series with a given amine, or with the amine in mixtures with a given 1-alkanol is discussed in terms of the different interactional contributions to $H_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Electrochemical Limits Preceding Dendrite Penetration in Ceramic Electrolytes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solid-state electrolytes have the potential to stabilize lithium metal anodes, which hold the promise to increase the energy density of lithium-ion batteries. However, lithium metal dendrites that occur locally at the solid-solid interface plague the solid-state lithium metal cells during charging, limiting the cycle life, and rendering high safety risks in practical applications. While multiple explanations have been proposed, understandings of the dynamics preceding and causing the metal penetration in solid electrolytes are still not conclusive. Here, by testing many highly consistent Ta-doped Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZTO) samples and utilizing an improved operando technique on symmetrical cells, we observed a consistent and statistically significant trend of current-dependent dendrite initiation time, which coincides with the Sand's time scaling in liquid electrolytes. This new understanding offers an electrochemical origin of dendritic initiation but also provides future insight into optimal all-solid-state battery design.</description>

      <title>Solvent-cosolvent attraction is sufficient to induce polymer collapse in good solvent mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cononsolvency occurs when two miscible, competing good solvents for a polymer are mixed, resulting in a loss of solubility. In this study, we demonstrate through simulations, supported by theory, that cononsolvency can be driven solely by solvent-cosolvent attraction ($\epsilon_{sc}$). The primary mechanism underlying this behavior is the emergent depletion effect, which is amplified by solvent-cosolvent interactions. The polymer reaches a compact state when the solvent and cosolvent fractions are equal ($x_s = x_c = 0.5$), a finding that aligns with predictions from Flory-Huggins theory and the random phase approximation. We show that this cononsolvency behavior is observed for different cosolvent sizes, provided the cosolvent density remains below the depletion threshold and the sizes of solvent and cosolvent particles are not smaller than the monomer size. Additionally, we investigate the role of temperature and find that cononsolvency weakens as temperature increases, due to a reduction in the depletion effect. Finally, we show that when preferential cosolvent attraction is introduced in this simple model, it leads to cononsolvency driven by bridging interactions, occurring at lower cosolvent fractions ($x_c &lt; 0.5$).</description>

      <title>Learning classical density functionals for ionic fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient theoretical techniques for describing ionic fluids are highly desirable for many applications across the physical, biological and materials sciences. With a rigorous statistical mechanical foundation, classical density functional theory (cDFT) is an appealing approach, but the competition between strong Coulombic interactions and steric repulsion limits the accuracy of current approximate functionals. Here, we extend a recently presented machine learning (ML) approach [Samm\"uller et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 120, e2312484120 (2023)] designed for systems with short-ranged interactions to ionic fluids. By adopting ideas from local molecular field theory, the framework we present amounts to using neural networks to learn the local relationship between the one-body direct correlation functions and inhomogeneous density profiles for a "mimic'' short-ranged system, with effects of long-ranged interactions accounted for in a mean-field, yet well-controlled, manner. By comparing to results from molecular simulations, we show that our approach accurately describes the structure and thermodynamics of the prototypical model for electrolyte solutions and ionic liquids: the restricted primitive model. The framework we present acts as an important step toward extending ML approaches for cDFT to systems with accurate interatomic potentials.</description>

      <title>Accurate calculation of low energy scattering phase shifts of charged particles in a harmonic oscillator trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Considering the elastic scattering of two charged particles, we present two methods for numerically solving the generalized Coulomb-corrected BERW formula with high accuracy across the entire energy spectrum. We illustrate these methods using p-alpha scattering, employing a phenomenological p-alpha short-range interaction. Our results reproduce the phase shifts computed with the Numerov method for all l=0 and l=1 channels. We also provide full access to the Python script used to obtain these results, which can be readily applied to a wide range of core-fragment scattering problems in nuclear and atomic physics.</description>

      <title>Electronic dynamics created at conical intersections and its dephasing in aqueous solution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A dynamical rearrangement in the electronic structure of a molecule can be driven by different phenomena, including nuclear motion, electronic coherence or electron correlation. Recording such electronic dynamics and identifying their fate in aqueous solution has remained a challenge. Here, we reveal the electronic dynamics induced by electronic relaxation through conical intersections in pyrazine molecules using X-ray spectroscopy. We show that the ensuing created dynamics corresponds to a cyclic rearrangement of the electronic structure around the aromatic ring. Furthermore, we find that such electronic dynamics are entirely suppressed when pyrazine is dissolved in water. Our observations confirm that conical intersections can create electronic dynamics that are not directly excited by the pump pulse and that aqueous solvation can dephase them in less than 40 fs. These results have implications for the investigation of electronic dynamics created during light-induced molecular dynamics and shed light on their susceptibility to aqueous solvation.</description>

      <title>A static quantum embedding scheme based on coupled cluster theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09078v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a static quantum embedding scheme that utilizes different levels of approximations to coupled cluster (CC) theory for an active fragment region and its environment. To reduce the computational cost, we solve the local fragment problem using a high-level CC method and address the environment problem with a lower-level M{\o}ller-Plesset (MP) perturbative method. This embedding approach inherits many conceptual developments from the hybrid MP2 and CC works by Nooijen and Sherrill (J. Chem. Phys. 111, 10815 (1999), J. Chem. Phys. 122, 234110 (2005)). We go beyond those works here by primarily targeting a specific localized fragment of a molecule and also introducing an alternative mechanism to relax the environment within this framework. We will call this approach MP-CC. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MP-CC on several potential energy curves, and a set of thermochemical reaction energies, using CC with singles and doubles as the fragment solver, and MP2-like treatments of the environment. The results are substantially improved by the inclusion of orbital relaxation in the environment. Using localized bonds as the active fragment, we also report results for \ce{N=N} bond breaking in azomethane and for the central \ce{C-C} bond torsion in butadiene. We find that when the fragment Hilbert space size remains fixed (e.g., when determined by an intrinsic atomic orbital approach), the method achieves comparable accuracy with both a small and a large basis set. Additionally, our results indicate that increasing the fragment Hilbert space size systematically enhances the accuracy of observables, approaching the precision of the full CC solver.</description>

      <title>Nano-Scale Manipulation of Single-Molecule Conformational Transition Through Vibrational Excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03195v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On-demand control of molecular actions is essential for realizing single-molecule functional devices. Such a control can be achieved by manipulating interactions between individual molecules and their nanoscale environment. In this study, we manipulate the conformational transition of a single pyrrolidine molecule on a Cu(100) surface by exciting its vibra-tions with tunneling electrons using scanning tunneling microscopy. Multiple transition pathways between two structural states are identified to be driven by distinct vibrational modes, whose corresponding nuclear motions are determined by density functional theory calculations. Tip-induced van der Waals forces and intermolecular interactions enable precise tuning of molecule-environment interactions, allowing modulation of vibrational energies, alteration of transition probabilities, and selection of the lowest energy transition pathway. This work reveals how external force fields in a tunable nanocavity can modulate molecular conformational transitions, offering an approach to deliberately engineer molecule-environment interactions for specific molecular functions.</description>

      <title>Electron rescollisional excitation of OCS$^+$ in phase-locked $\omega + 2\omega$ intense laser fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14148v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photoelectron-photoion coincidence momentum imaging has been performed to investigate excitation processes on dissociative ionization of OCS, OCS $\to$ OCS$^+$ + e$^-$ $\to$ OC + S$^+$ + e$^-$, in phase-locked $\omega + 2\omega$ intense laser fields. The electron kinetic energy spectra depend on coincidentally produced ion species, OCS$^+$ or S$^+$. The observed electron momentum distribution shows clear asymmetry along the laser polarization direction with a 2$\pi$-oscillation period as a function of the phase difference between the $\omega$ and $2\omega$ laser fields. The asymmetry of electron emission in the OCS$^+$ channel flips at the electron kinetic energy of 8.2 eV where the dominant scattering direction switches from forward to backward. In the S$^+$ channel, the asymmetry flips at the lower kinetic energy of 4.2 eV. %, and this shift corresponds to an inelastic scattering process. In comparison with a classical trajectory Monte Carlo simulation, it has been clarified that this energy shift between the OCS$^+$ and S$^+$ channels corresponds to the excitation energy of the parent ion and that electron recollisional excitation takes place to form the fragment ion in intense laser fields.</description>
