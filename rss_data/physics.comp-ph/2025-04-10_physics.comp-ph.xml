      <title>Elimination of spurious oscillations on photoemission spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method for accurately computing transition probabilities in one-dimensional photoionization problems. Our approach involves solving the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation and projecting its solution onto scattering states that satisfy the correct incoming or outgoing boundary conditions. Conventionally, the photoelectron emission spectrum is obtained by projecting the time-evolved wavefunction onto the stationary continuum eigenstates of the unperturbed, time-independent Hamiltonian. However, when the spatial potential is symmetric, both the initial bound state and the final continuum states exhibit well-defined parity. The propagated wavefunction retains structural features of the initial bound state, including its parity. As a result, changes in the parity of the continuum states can introduce substantial variations in the projections, leading to spurious oscillations in the computed electron emission spectrum. Our method circumvents this issue by employing scattering states without defined parity. Furthermore, it enables the calculation of directional emission, making it possible to study emission asymmetries. To illustrate the capabilities of our scattering projection method, we analyze the partial differential photoionization probabilities of Al(111) metallic surfaces under short laser pulses at grazing incidence.</description>

      <title>A modified-residue prescription to calculate dynamical correlation functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the challenges in using numerical methods to address many-body problems is the multi-dimensional integration over poles. More often that not, one needs such integrations to be evaluated as a function of an external variable. An example would be calculating dynamical correlations functions that are used to model response functions, where the external variable is the frequency. The standard numerical techniques rely on building an adaptive mesh, using special points in the Brillouin zone or using advanced smearing techniques. Most of these techniques, however, suffer when the grid is coarse. Here we propose that, if one knows the nature of the singularity in the integrand, one can define a residue and use it to faithfully estimate the integral and reproduce all the resulting singular features even with a coarse grid. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method for different scenarios of calculating correlation functions with different resulting singular features, for calculating collective modes and densities of states. We also present a quantitative analysis of the error and show that this method can be widely applicable.</description>

      <title>Wave propagation and scattering in time dependent media: Lippmann-Schwinger equations, multiple scattering theory, Kirchhoff Helmholtz integrals, Green's functions, reciprocity theorems and Huygens' principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wave scattering plays a central role for the modeling of complex wave propagation across all corners of science and engineering applications, including electromagnetic, acoustics, seismic and scattering physics. Wave control using time interfaces, where the properties of the medium through with the wave travels rapidly change in time, has opened further opportunities to control wave propagation in both space and time. For acoustic waves, studies on time modulated media have not been reported. In this context, full numerical solution of the wave equation using time interfaces is key to fully understand their potential. When applying time interfaces, the underlying physics of acoustic wave propagation and scattering and their similar roles on time and space, are still being explored. In this work, we introduce a mathematical formulation of the Lippmann-Schwinger integral equations for acoustic wave scattering when time interfaces are induced via a change of the velocity of the medium. We demonstrate that space-time duality for acoustic wave propagation with time interfaces and derive the Lippmann-Schwinger integral equations for wave scattering in time-dependent media, multiple scattering theory, Kirchhoff Helmholtz integrals, Green's functions, reciprocity theorems. We experimentally verify our theoretical derivation by studying and measuring the acoustic wave scattering in strongly scattering media. We illustrate the proposed framework and present results of acoustic wave scattering without prior knowledge of the background wave-fields. This improves the understanding of the generation and wave scattering and opens previously inaccessible research directions, potentially facilitating practical applications for acoustic, geophysical and optical imaging.</description>

      <title>Screening of material defects using universal machine-learning interatomic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06993v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finding new materials with previously unknown atomic structure or materials with optimal set of properties for a specific application greatly benefits from computational modeling. Recently, such screening has been dramatically accelerated by the invent of universal machine-learning interatomic potentials that offer first principles accuracy at orders of magnitude lower computational cost. Their application to the screening of defects with desired properties or to finding new stable compounds with high density of defects, however, has not been explored. Here, we show that the universal machine-learning interatomic potentials have reached sufficient accuracy to enable large-scale screening of defective materials. We carried out vacancy calculations for 86 259 materials in the Materials Project database and analyzed the formation energies in terms of oxidation numbers. We further demonstrate the application of these models for finding new materials at or below the convex hull of known materials and for simulated etching of low-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Walking on Spheres and Talking to Neighbors: Variance Reduction for Laplace's Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17692v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Walk on Spheres algorithms leverage properties of Brownian Motion to create Monte Carlo estimates of solutions to a class of elliptic partial differential equations. We propose a new caching strategy which leverages the continuity of paths of Brownian Motion. In the case of Laplace's equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions, our algorithm has improved asymptotic runtime compared to previous approaches. Until recently, estimates were constructed pointwise and did not use the relationship between solutions at nearby points within a domain. Instead, our results are achieved by passing information from a cache of fixed size. We also provide bounds on the performance of our algorithm and demonstrate its performance on example problems of increasing complexity.</description>

      <title>Fast and accurate evaluation of Biot-Savart integrals over spatial curves in periodic domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Biot-Savart law is relevant in physical contexts including electromagnetism and fluid dynamics. In the latter case, when the rotation of a fluid is confined to a set of very thin vortex filaments, this law describes the velocity field induced by the spatial arrangement of these objects. The Biot-Savart law is at the core of vortex methods used in the simulation of classical and quantum fluid flows. Naive methods are inefficient when dealing with large numbers of vortex elements, which makes them inadequate for simulating turbulent vortex flows. Here we exploit a direct analogy between the Biot-Savart law and electrostatics to adapt Ewald summation methods, routinely used in molecular dynamics simulations, to vortex filament simulations in three-dimensional periodic domains. In this context, the basic idea is to split the induced velocity onto (i) a coarse-grained velocity generated by a Gaussian-filtered vorticity field, and (ii) a short-range correction accounting for near-singular behaviour near the vortices. The former component can be accurately and efficiently evaluated using the nonuniform fast Fourier transform algorithm. Analytical accuracy estimates are provided as a function of the parameters entering the method. We also discuss how to properly account for the finite vortex core size in kinetic energy estimations. Using numerical experiments, we verify the accuracy and the conservation properties of the proposed approach. Moreover, we demonstrate the $O(N \log N)$ complexity of the method over a wide range of problem sizes $N$, considerably better than the $O(N^2)$ cost of a naive approach.</description>

      <title>Towards Signed Distance Function based Metamaterial Design: Neural Operator Transformer for Forward Prediction and Diffusion Model for Inverse Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The inverse design of metamaterial architectures presents a significant challenge, particularly for nonlinear mechanical properties involving large deformations, buckling, contact, and plasticity. Traditional methods, such as gradient-based optimization, and recent generative deep-learning approaches often rely on binary pixel-based representations, which introduce jagged edges that hinder finite element (FE) simulations and 3D printing. To overcome these challenges, we propose an inverse design framework that utilizes a signed distance function (SDF) representation combined with a conditional diffusion model. The SDF provides a smooth boundary representation, eliminating the need for post-processing and ensuring compatibility with FE simulations and manufacturing methods. A classifier-free guided diffusion model is trained to generate SDFs conditioned on target macroscopic stress-strain curves, enabling efficient one-shot design synthesis. To assess the mechanical response of the generated designs, we introduce a forward prediction model based on Neural Operator Transformers (NOT), which accurately predicts homogenized stress-strain curves and local solution fields for arbitrary geometries with irregular query meshes. This approach enables a closed-loop process for general metamaterial design, offering a pathway for the development of advanced functional materials.</description>

      <title>asKAN: Active Subspace embedded Kolmogorov-Arnold Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04669v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) has emerged as a promising neural network architecture for small-scale AI+Science applications. However, it suffers from inflexibility in modeling ridge functions, which is widely used in representing the relationships in physical systems. This study investigates this inflexibility through the lens of the Kolmogorov-Arnold theorem, which starts the representation of multivariate functions from constructing the univariate components rather than combining the independent variables. Our analysis reveals that incorporating linear combinations of independent variables can substantially simplify the network architecture in representing the ridge functions. Inspired by this finding, we propose active subspace embedded KAN (asKAN), a hierarchical framework that synergizes KAN's function representation with active subspace methodology. The architecture strategically embeds active subspace detection between KANs, where the active subspace method is used to identify the primary ridge directions and the independent variables are adaptively projected onto these critical dimensions. The proposed asKAN is implemented in an iterative way without increasing the number of neurons in the original KAN. The proposed method is validated through function fitting, solving the Poisson equation, and reconstructing sound field. Compared with KAN, asKAN significantly reduces the error using the same network architecture. The results suggest that asKAN enhances the capability of KAN in fitting and solving equations in the form of ridge functions.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning solutions to singular ordinary differential equations: from special functions to spherical accretion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20150v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Singular regular points often arise in differential equations describing physical phenomena such as fluid dynamics, electromagnetism, and gravitation. Traditional numerical techniques often fail or become unstable near these points, requiring the use of semi-analytical tools, such as series expansions and perturbative methods, in combination with numerical algorithms; or to invoke more sophisticated methods. In this work, we take an alternative route and leverage the power of machine learning to exploit Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) as a modern approach to solving ordinary differential equations with singular points. PINNs utilize deep learning architectures to approximate solutions by embedding the differential equations into the loss function of the neural network. We discuss the advantages of PINNs in handling singularities, particularly their ability to bypass traditional grid-based methods and provide smooth approximations across irregular regions. Techniques for enhancing the accuracy of PINNs near singular points, such as adaptive loss weighting, are used in order to achieve high efficiency in the training of the network. We exemplify our results by studying four differential equations of interest in mathematics and gravitation -- the Legendre equation, the hypergeometric equation, the solution for black hole space-times in theories of Lorentz violating gravity, and the spherical accretion of a perfect fluid in a Schwarzschild geometry.</description>

      <title>Learning Equivariant Non-Local Electron Density Functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07972v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The accuracy of density functional theory hinges on the approximation of non-local contributions to the exchange-correlation (XC) functional. To date, machine-learned and human-designed approximations suffer from insufficient accuracy, limited scalability, or dependence on costly reference data. To address these issues, we introduce Equivariant Graph Exchange Correlation (EG-XC), a novel non-local XC functional based on equivariant graph neural networks (GNNs). Where previous works relied on semi-local functionals or fixed-size descriptors of the density, we compress the electron density into an SO(3)-equivariant nuclei-centered point cloud for efficient non-local atomic-range interactions. By applying an equivariant GNN on this point cloud, we capture molecular-range interactions in a scalable and accurate manner. To train EG-XC, we differentiate through a self-consistent field solver requiring only energy targets. In our empirical evaluation, we find EG-XC to accurately reconstruct `gold-standard' CCSD(T) energies on MD17. On out-of-distribution conformations of 3BPA, EG-XC reduces the relative MAE by 35% to 50%. Remarkably, EG-XC excels in data efficiency and molecular size extrapolation on QM9, matching force fields trained on 5 times more and larger molecules. On identical training sets, EG-XC yields on average 51% lower MAEs.</description>

      <title>The Kratos Framework for Heterogeneous Astrophysical Simulations: Ray Tracing, Reacting Flow and Thermochemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04941v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thermochemistry, ray-tracing radiation, and radiation-matter interactions are important processes which are computationally difficult to model in astrophysical simulations, addressed by introducing novel algorithms optimized for heterogeneous architectures in the Kratos framework. Key innovations include a stoichiometry-compatible reconstruction scheme for consistent chemical species advection, which ensures element conservation while avoiding matrix inversions, and a LU decomposition method specifically designed for multi-thread parallelization in order to solve stiff thermochemical ordinary differential equations with high efficiency. The framework also implements efficient ray-tracing techniques for radiation transport for radiation-matter interactions. Various verification tests, spanning from chemical advection, combustion, Str\"omgren spheres, and detonation dynamics, are conducted to demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of Kratos, with results closely matching semi-analytic solutions and benchmarks such as Cantera and the Shock and Detonation Toolbox. The modular design and performance optimizations position it as a versatile tool for studying coupled microphysical processes in the diverse environments of contemporary astrophysical studies.</description>
