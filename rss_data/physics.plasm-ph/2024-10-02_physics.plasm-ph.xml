      <title>A Magnetic Analog of Pressure-Strain Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the evolution equation for magnetic energy density for a non-relativistic magnetized plasma in the (Lagrangian) reference frame comoving with the electron bulk velocity. Analyzing the terms that arise due to the ideal electric field, namely perpendicular electron compression and magnetic field line bending, we recast them to reveal a quantity with a functional form analogous to the often-studied pressure-strain interaction term that describes one piece of internal energy density evolution of the species in a plasma, except with the species pressure tensor replaced by the magnetic stress tensor. We dub it the "magnetic stress-strain interaction." We discuss decompositions of the magnetic stress-strain interaction analogous to those used for pressure-strain interaction. These analogies facilitate the interpretation of the evolution of the various forms of energy in magnetized plasmas, and should be useful for a wide array of applications including magnetic reconnection, turbulence, collisionless shocks, and wave-particle interactions. We display and analyze all the terms that can change magnetic energy density in the Lagrangian reference frame using a particle-in-cell simulation of magnetic reconnection.</description>

      <title>Radiated energy fraction of SPI-induced disruptions at ASDEX Upgrade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future large tokamaks will operate at high plasma currents and high stored plasma energies. To ensure machine protection in case of a sudden loss of plasma confinement (major disruption), a large fraction of the magnetic and thermal energy must be radiated to reduce thermal loads. The disruption mitigation system for ITER is based on massive material injection in the form of shattered pellet injection (SPI). To support ITER, a versatile SPI system was installed at the tokamak ASDEX Upgrade (AUG). The AUG SPI features three independent pellet generation cells and guide tubes, and each was equipped with different shatter heads for the 2022 experimental campaign. We dedicated over 200 plasma discharges to the study of SPI plasma termination, and in this manuscript report on the results of bolometry (total radiation) analysis. The amount of neon inside the pellets is the dominant factor determining the radiated energy fraction (frad). Large and fast fragments, produced by the $12.5^\circ$ rectangular shatter head, lead to somewhat higher values of frad compared to the $25^\circ$ circular or rectangular heads. This effect is strongest for neon content of $&lt; 4\times10^{20}$ neon atoms injected, where a higher normal velocity component (larger fragments) seems slightly beneficial. While full-sized, 8 mm diameter, pure deuterium (D2) pellets lead to a disruption, the 4 mm or shortened 8 mm pellets of pure D2 did not lead to a disruption. The disruption threshold for pure D2 is found to be around $1\times10^{22}$ deuterium molecules inside the pellet. While the radiated energy fraction of non-disruptive SPI is below 20%, this is increased to 40% during the TQ and VDE phase of the disruptive injections. For deuterium-neon-mix pellets, frad values of $&lt; 90$% are observed, and the curve saturates around 80% for 10% neon mixed into the 8 mm pellets ($2\times10^{21}$ neon atoms).</description>

      <title>The impact of non-local parallel electron transport on plasma-impurity reaction rates in tokamak scrape-off layer plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasma-impurity reaction rates are a crucial part of modelling tokamak scrape-off layer (SOL) plasmas. To avoid calculating the full set of rates for the large number of important processes involved, a set of effective rates are typically derived which assume Maxwellian electrons. However, non-local parallel electron transport may result in non-Maxwellian electrons, particularly close to divertor targets. Here, the validity of using Maxwellian-averaged rates in this context is investigated by computing the full set of rate equations for a fixed plasma background from kinetic and fluid SOL simulations. We consider the effect of the electron distribution as well as the impact of the electron transport model on plasma profiles. Results are presented for lithium, beryllium, carbon, nitrogen, neon and argon. It is found that electron distributions with enhanced high-energy tails can result in significant modifications to the ionisation balance and radiative power loss rates from excitation, on the order of 50-75% for the latter. Fluid electron models with Spitzer-H\"arm or flux-limited Spitzer-H\"arm thermal conductivity, combined with Maxwellian electrons for rate calculations, can increase or decrease this error, depending on the impurity species and plasma conditions. Based on these results, we also discuss some approaches to experimentally observing non-local electron transport in SOL plasmas.</description>

      <title>2D electron density profile evolution during detachment in Super-X divertor L-mode discharges on MAST-U</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 2D electron density profiles obtained from coherence imaging spectroscopy in different MAST-U divertor conditions are compared. The data includes variations of strike point position, core electron density, and heating power. The improved performance of the long-legged divertors results in a lower electron density and particle flux at the target compared to configurations with smaller strike point major radius, while also being characterized by lower temperatures and deeper detachment. Comparisons against SOLPS simulations generally show good agreement in profile shape along and across the separatrix. The peaking of the electron density downstream of the detachment front is associated with significant neutral drag acting on the plasma flow.</description>

      <title>The implications of collisions on the spatial profile of electric potential and the space-charge limited current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The space-charge limited current (SCLC) in a vacuum diode is given by the Child-Langmuir law (CLL), whose electric potential $\varphi(x) = (\it{x/D})^{4/3}$, where x is the spatial coordinate across the gap and D is the gap separation distance. For a collisional diode, SCLC is given by the Mott-Gurney law (MGL) and $\varphi(x) = (x/D)^{3/2}$. This Letter applies a capacitance argument for SCLC and uses the transit time from a recent exact solution for collisional SCLC to show that $\varphi(x) = (x/D)^{\xi}$ for a general collisional gap, where $4/3 \leqslant \xi \leqslant 3/2$. Furthermore, $\xi$ is strictly a function of $\nu T$, where $\nu$ is the collision frequency and T is the electron transit time. Using this definition of $\xi$, we estimate the spatial dependence of the electron velocity and use the capacitance to derive an analytic equation for collisional SCLC that agrees within $\sim5-6\%$ of the exact solution that requires solving parametrically through T. We derive equations in the limits of $\nu \longrightarrow 0$ and $\nu\longrightarrow \infty$ for general $\xi$ that asymptotically recover the CLL as $\nu \longrightarrow 0$ and the MGL as $\nu \longrightarrow \infty$. Matching these limits shows that $\xi \simeq 1.40$ and $V \propto D^2\nu^2$ at the transition from a vacuum to collisional diode for any device condition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on recent papers, we discuss the formulation of the first-order relativistic spin magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) with the totally antisymmetric spin current and properties of the anisotropic linear waves awaken near an equilibrium configuration. We show that there appears a critical angle in the momentum direction of the linear waves, where a pair of propagating modes turns into purely diffusive modes. Due to this critical behavior, polynomial solutions do not fully capture the angle dependence of the linear waves.</description>

      <title>Ion-acoustic solitons in a relativistic Fermi plasma at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.03785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The theory of ion-acoustic solitons in nonrelativistic fully degenerate plasmas and nonrelativistic and ultra-relativistic degenerate plasmas at low temperatures is known. We consider a multi-component relativistic degenerate electron-positron-ion plasma at finite temperatures. Specifically, we focus on the intermediate region where the particle's thermal energy $(k_BT)$ and the rest-mass energy $(mc^2)$ do not differ significantly, i.e., $k_BT\sim mc^2$. However, the Fermi energy $(k_BT_F)$ is larger than the thermal energy and the normalized chemical energy ($\xi=\mu/k_BT$) is positive and finite. Two different parameter regimes with $\beta\equiv k_BT/mc^2&lt;1$ and $\beta&gt;1$, relevant for astrophysical plasmas, are defined, and the existence of small amplitude ion-acoustic solitons in these regimes are studied, including the critical cases where the known KdV (Korteweg-de Vries) theory fails. We show that while the solitons with both the positive (compressive) and negative (rarefactive) potentials coexist in the case of $\beta&lt;1$, only compressive solitons can exist in the other regime $(\beta&gt;1)$. Furthermore, while the rarefactive solitons within the parameter domains of $\beta$ and $\xi$ can evolve with increasing amplitude and hence increasing energy, the energy of compressive solitons reaches a steady state.</description>

      <title>Mechanism of circular polarization in giant pulses and fast radio bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13559v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Some giant pulses and fast radio bursts exhibit notable circular polarization, which remains unexplained and carries significant implications for their emission mechanisms. In this study, we identify multiple nanoshot pairs uniformly spaced by approximately 21 $\mu$s within a giant pulse emitted by the Crab pulsar. Among these pairs, a subset displays left-hand and right-hand circular polarization in two distinct nanoshots. We propose that the occurrence of such nanoshot pairs with dual circular polarizations arises from the fragmentation of a linearly-polarized nanoshot along the magnetic field lines under the extreme Faraday effect, leveraging highly-asymmetrical pair plasma and the ultra-intense field of nanoshots. The asymmetry in pair plasmas is likely linked to discharge activities in pulsars. Moreover, the intense field of nanoshots induces cyclotron resonance within the magnetosphere, effectively slowing down the propagation velocity of the circularly polarized mode. Our findings suggest that Crab giant pulses composing nanoshots originate in its polar cap region and escape the magnetosphere along the polar magnetic field. This mechanism can also elucidate the origin of circular polarization in some fast radio bursts and thus lends support to their magnetospheric origin.</description>

      <title>From Density Response to Energy Functionals and Back: An ab initio perspective on Matter Under Extreme Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20356v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Energy functionals serve as the basis for different models and methods in quantum and classical many-particle physics. Arguably, one of the most successful and widely used approaches in material science at both ambient and extreme conditions is density functional theory (DFT). Various flavors of DFT methods are being actively used to study material properties at extreme conditions, such as in warm dense matter, dense plasmas, and nuclear physics applications. In this review, we focus on the warm dense matter regime, which occurs in the core of giant planets and stellar atmospheres, and as a transient state in inertial confinement fusion experiments. We discuss the connection between linear density response functions and free energy functionals as well as the utility of the linear response formalism for the construction of advanced functionals. As a new result, we derive the stiffness theorem linking the change in the intrinsic free energy to the density response properties of electrons. We review and summarize recent works that assess various exchange-correlation (XC) functionals for an inhomogeneous electron gas that is perturbed by a harmonic external field and for warm dense hydrogen using exact path integral quantum Monte Carlo data as an unassailable benchmark. This constitutes a valuable guide for selecting an appropriate XC functional for DFT calculations in the context of investigating the inhomogeneous electronic structure of warm dense matter. We stress that correctly simulating the strongly perturbed electron gas necessitates the correct UEG limit of the XC and non-interacting free-energy functionals.</description>

      <title>Modulational instability of Geodesic-Acoustic-Mode packets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01243v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Isolated, undamped geodesic-acoustic-mode (GAM) packets have been demonstrated to obey a (focusing) nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLSE) [E. Poli, Phys. Plasmas 2021]. This equation predicts susceptibility of GAM packets to the modulational instability (MI). The necessary conditions for this instability are analyzed analytically and numerically using the NLSE model. The predictions of the NLSE are compared to gyrokinetic simulations performed with the global particle-in-cell code ORB5, where GAM packets are created from initial perturbations of the axisymmetric radial electric field $E_r$. An instability of the GAM packets with respect to modulations is observed both in cases in which an initial perturbation is imposed and when the instability develops spontaneously. However, significant differences in the dynamics of the small scales are discerned between the NLSE and gyrokinetic simulations. These discrepancies are mainly due to the radial dependence of the strength of the nonlinear term, which we do not retain in the solution of the NLSE, and to the damping of higher spectral components. The damping of the high-$k_r$ components, which develop as a consequence of the nonlinearity, can be understood in terms of Landau damping. The influence of the ion Larmor radius $\rho_i$ as well as the perturbation wavevector $k_{\text{pert}}$ on this effect is studied. For the parameters considered here the aforementioned damping mechanism hinders the MI process significantly from developing to its full extent and is strong enough to stabilize some of the (according to the undamped NLSE model) unstable wavevectors.</description>

      <title>Design and First Tests of the Trapped Electrons Experiment T-REX</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gyrotrons are essential for electron cyclotron resonance heating (ECRH) in fusion reactors, making efficient operation crucial for advancing fusion energy. Past experiments revealed instability issues due to trapped electrons in the magnetron injection gun (MIG) region, causing undesired currents and operational failures. To address this, tight manufacturing tolerances are required for the MIG geometry [1]. We present initial findings of the TRapped Electrons eXperiment (T-REX) developed at the Swiss Plasma Center, designed to understand the physics of electron clouds in gyrotron MIGs. T-REX replicates MIG geometries, as well as their typical electric and magnetic fields, and it is supported by 2D Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations with the FENNECS code [2, 3]. The setup includes two coaxial electrodes in a vacuum chamber atop a superconducting magnet, with a central electrode biased to negative DC voltages and an outer one at ground, creating a radial electric field (1 to 2 MV/M) and an axial magnetic field (B &lt; 0.4 T). This setup mimics Penning-Malmberg traps. We present the experimental device and first findings on current distribution and also qualitative comparison with FENNECS simulations [4]. Planned diagnostics include optical emission spectroscopy, phosphor screen imaging, Streak camera imaging, and potentially electric field distribution via the Stark effect. This research aims to enhance gyrotron performance and reliability in fusion energy systems.</description>
