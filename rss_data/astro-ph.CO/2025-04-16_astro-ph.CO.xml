      <title>Probing Primordial Power Spectrum and Non-Gaussianities With Fast Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the precision measurements of the arrival time differences of the same fast radio burst (FRB) source along multiple sightlines to measure the primordial power spectrum and Non-Gaussianities. The anticipated experiment requires a sightline separation of 100 AU, achieved by sending three or more radio telescopes to the outer solar system. The Shapiro time delays, measured relatively between different telescopes, are sensitive to the gradient field of the gravitational potential between different sightlines. Since the arrival time difference is independent of when the transient signal is emitted from the source, every measurement of the detected FRB source can be correlated. With enough FRB sources discovered, we can map the gravitational potential across the sky. We further calculate the two-point and three-point correlation function of the arrival time difference between telescopes for different FRB sources in the sky. If $10^4$ FRBs were to be detected, our results suggest that this technique can test the inflationary scale-invariant power spectrum down to $\sim 10^3\,\rm Mpc^{-1}$ and primordial Non-Gaussianities at a level of $f_{\rm NL}\sim 1$.</description>

      <title>Do We Know How to Model Reionization?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I compare the power spectra of the radiation fields from two recent sets of fully-coupled simulations that model cosmic reionization: "Cosmic Reionization On Computers" (CROC) and "Thesan". While both simulations have similar power spectra of the radiation sources, the power spectra of the photoionization rate are significantly different at the same values of cosmic time or the same values of the mean neutral hydrogen fraction. However, the power spectra of the photoionization rate can be matched at large scales for the two simulations when the matching snapshots are allowed to vary independently. I.e., on large scales, the radiation field in two simulations proceeds through the same evolutionary stages, but the timing of these stages is different in different simulations and is not parameterized by an easily interpretable physical quantity like the mean neutral fraction or the mean free path. On small scales, large differences are present and remain partially unexplained.
  Both CROC and Thesan use the Variable Eddington Tensor approximation for modeling radiative transfer, but adopt different closure relations (optically thin OTVET versus M1). The role of this key difference is tested by using smaller simulations with a new cosmological simulation code that implements both closure relations in a controlled environment (the same hydro, cooling, and gravity solvers and the star formation recipe). In these controlled tests, both the M1 closure and the OTVET ansatz follow the expected behavior from a simple analytical approximation, demonstrating that the differences in the 2-point function of the radiation field induced by the choice of the Eddington tensor are not dominant.</description>

      <title>Smooth sailing or ragged climb? -- Increasing the robustness of power spectrum de-wiggling and ShapeFit parameter compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The baryonic features in the galaxy power spectrum offer tight, time-resolved constraints on the expansion history of the Universe but complicate the measurement of the broadband shape of the power spectrum, which also contains precious cosmological information. In this work we compare thirteen methods designed to separate the broadband and oscillating components and examine their performance. The systematic uncertainty between different de-wiggling procedures is at most $2$%, depending on the scale. The ShapeFit parameter compression aims to compute the slope $m$ of the power spectrum at large scales, sensitive to matter-radiation equality and the baryonic suppression. We show that the de-wiggling procedures impart large (50%) differences on the obtained slope values, but as long as the theory and data pipelines are set up consistently, this is of no concern for cosmological inference given the precision of existing and on-going surveys. However, it still motivates the search for more robust ways of extracting the slope. We show that post-processing the power spectrum ratio before taking the derivative makes the slope values far more robust. We further investigate eleven ways of extracting the slope and highlight the two most successful ones. We derive a systematic uncertainty on the slope $m$ of $\sigma_{m,\mathrm{syst}} = 0.023|m| + 0.001$ by studying the behavior of the slopes in different cosmologies within and beyond $\Lambda$CDM and the impact in cosmological inference. In cosmologies with a feature in the matter-power spectrum, such as in the early dark energy cosmologies, this systematic uncertainty estimate does not necessarily hold, and further investigation is required.</description>

      <title>Cross terms and monochromatic gravitational wave sources in our Galactic Centre</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gravitational capture of a small compact object by a supermassive black hole is one of the most intriguing sources of gravitational waves to be detected by space-borne observatories. Modeling gravitational waves is a challenging task. However, various approximations exist that enable us to claim detection and perform parameter extraction with high accuracy on synthetic data. The first numerical implementation of relativistic corrections for an astrophysical system was conducted in a post-Newtonian (PN) framework, and since then, most comparable programmes have followed a similar approach. Nevertheless, the PN approach has been developed for two particles in a vacuum. Here, we present the first results on the impact of cross-terms in the PN scheme for ``monochromatic'' sources (meaning that the peak frequency does not evolve over the observational time), which account for the interplay between different bodies. We present a conceptual and illustrative study of the cross-terms on the first PN term in a group of three bodies representing asymmetric binaries (X-MRIs, E-EMRIs, and X-MRIs with E-EMRIs). We find that these cross-terms can lead to a complete phase shift of the gravitational wave by a few times $2\pi$ over periods of time of less than one year for the close binaries. Ignoring the cross-terms in the relativistic semi-Keplerian system can significantly complicate parameter extraction for monochromatic sources.</description>

      <title>Testing redshift variation of the X-ray and ultraviolet luminosity relations of quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasars serve as important cosmological probes and constructing accurate luminosity relations for them is essential for their use in cosmology. If the coefficients of quasar's luminosity relation vary with redshift, it could introduce biases into cosmological constraints derived from quasars. In this paper, we conduct a detailed analysis of the redshift variation in the X-ray luminosity and ultraviolet (UV) luminosity ($L_\mathrm{X}$-$L_\mathrm{UV}$) relations of quasars. For the standard $L_\mathrm{X}$-$L_\mathrm{UV}$ relation, we find that the relation coefficients exhibit a strong and linear correlation with redshift, which is not attributable to the selection effect. Additionally, we examine two three-dimensional, redshift-evolving $L_\mathrm{X}$-$L_\mathrm{UV}$ relations and find that the inclusion of a redshift-dependent term does not eliminate the impact of redshift evolution, as the relation coefficients continue to evolve with redshift. Finally, we construct a new $L_\mathrm{X}$-$L_\mathrm{UV}$ relation in which the redshift evolution of the relation coefficients is nearly eliminated. Calibrating the luminosity relations using Hubble parameter measurements, we demonstrate that quasars utilizing our new relation yield effective constraints on cosmological parameters that are consistent with results from Planck CMB data, unlike constraints derived from the standard relation.</description>

      <title>More fields are different: Stochastic view of multi-field inflationary scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-energy physics often motivates multi-field inflationary scenarios where stochastic effects play a crucial role. Peculiar to multi-field models, the noise-induced centrifugal force results in a longer duration of inflation depending on the number of fields, even when the stochastic noises themselves are small. We show that, in such small-noise regimes, the number of fields generically discriminates whether inflation successfully terminates or lasts forever. Our results indicate that inflation with an extremely large number of fields may fail to realise our observable Universe.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Generalized Gravity-Thermodynamic Cosmology from DESI DR2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the cosmological implications of generalized entropic models within the framework of Gravity-Thermodynamics (GT) approaches. These models, characterized by three or four additional free parameters, are designed to capture deviations from the standard Bekenstein-Hawking entropy and can reproduce well-known entropic formulations, including Tsallis, R\'enyi, Sharma-Mittal, Barrow, Kaniadakis, and Loop Quantum Gravity entropies in various analytical limits. We implement the corresponding cosmological models using a fully numerical GT approach to constrain the model parameters and to study the evolution of the dark energy equation of state as a function of the scale factor. Our Bayesian analysis, which incorporates the Pantheon+ and DESy5 supernovae data alongside the recently released DESI-DR2/DR1 Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements, shows that the data favor the standard Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, leading to a $\Lambda$CDM-like late-time behavior. In this context, the three-parameter ($\mathcal{S}_3$) entropic model appears to be sufficient to capture the observed dark energy phenomenology. Furthermore, a direct comparison of the Bayesian evidence indicates that the three-parameter model is preferred over the four-parameter ($\mathcal{S}_4$) variant by a factor of $\Delta\log\mathcal{B} \sim -6$, while the GT approach as a whole is significantly disfavored relative to the $\Lambda$CDM model with at least $\Delta\log\mathcal{B} \sim -8$ ($\mathcal{S}_3$) to $\Delta\log\mathcal{B} \sim -13$ ($\mathcal{S}_4$), when using the DESy5 and DESI-DR2 datasets.</description>

      <title>Probing Binary Lens Caustics with Gravitational Waves: A Uniform Approximation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new framework for modeling gravitational wave diffraction near fold caustics using the Uniform Approximation (UA), focusing on binary mass lenses-axially asymmetric systems with complex caustic structures. Full-wave methods based on the Kirchhoff integral become impractical in this regime due to highly oscillatory integrands. The UA provides a robust and accurate description of the wave field near folds, resolving the breakdown of Geometrical Optics at caustics and improving upon Transitional Asymptotics-based on Airy function approximations-which lack global validity. Central to our approach is the concept of the caustic width, $d_c$, a characteristic length scale defining the region where diffraction significantly alters wave propagation. We find that $d_c$ scales universally with the gravitational wavelength as ~ $ \lambda^{2/3}$ and inversely with the redshifted lens mass as ~ $ M_{Lz}^{-2/3}$. The wave amplification near the fold grows as ~ $ d_c^{-1/4}$, substantially enhancing the signal and potentially playing a key role in the detection of gravitational waves lensed near caustics. Notably, for lens masses below the galactic scale, the caustic width for gravitational waves is not negligible compared to the Einstein radius-as it is in electromagnetic lensing-making the UA essential for accurately capturing wave effects.</description>

      <title>A possible wave-optical effect in lensed FRBs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are enigmatic extragalactic bursts whose properties are still largely unknown, but based on their extremely small time duration, they are proposed to have a compact structure, making them candidates for wave-optical effects if gravitational lensed. If an FRB is lensed into multiple-images bursts at different times by a galaxy or cluster, a likely scenario is that only one image is detected, because the others fall outside the survey area and time frame. Aims: In this work we explore the FRB analog of quasar microlensing, namely the collective microlensing by stars in the lensing galaxy, now with wave optics included. The eikonal regime is applicable here. Methods. We study the voltage (rather than the intensity) in a simple simulation consisting of (a) microlensing stars, and (b) plasma scattering by a turbulent interstellar medium. Results: The auto-correlation of the voltage shows peaks (at order-microsecond separations) corresponding to wave-optical interference between lensed micro-images. The peaks are frequency dependent if plasma-scattering is significant. While qualitative and still in need of more realistic simulations, the results suggest that a strongly-lensed FRB could be identified from a single image. Conclusions: Microlensing could sniff out macro-lensed FRBs</description>

      <title>Inferring the Hubble Constant Using Simulated Strongly Lensed Supernovae and Neural Network Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strongly lensed supernovae are a promising new probe to obtain independent measurements of the Hubble constant (${H_0}$). In this work, we employ simulated gravitationally lensed Type Ia supernovae (glSNe Ia) to train our machine learning (ML) pipeline to constrain $H_0$. We simulate image time-series of glSNIa, as observed with the upcoming Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, that we employ for training an ensemble of five convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The outputs of this ensemble network are combined with a simulation-based inference (SBI) framework to quantify the uncertainties on the network predictions and infer full posteriors for the $H_0$ estimates. We illustrate that the combination of multiple glSN systems enhances constraint precision, providing a $4.4\%$ estimate of $H_0$ based on 100 simulated systems, which is in agreement with the ground truth. This research highlights the potential of leveraging the capabilities of ML with glSNe systems to obtain a pipeline capable of fast and automated $H_0$ measurements.</description>

      <title>Modeling Dust in Galaxy Evolution Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dust grains play a fundamental role in galaxies, influencing both their evolution and observability. As a result, incorporating dust physics into galaxy evolution simulations is essential. This is a challenging task due to the finite resolution of such simulations and the uncertainties on dust grain formation in stellar envelopes and their evolution in the Interstellar Medium (ISM). This report reviews some of the most commonly used techniques for modeling dust in galaxy evolution simulations, with a particular emphasis on developments from the past $\sim$10 years in both hydrodynamic and semi-analytic approaches. Key findings from these simulations are presented, discussed, and compared to the most recent available observations. These include the dust-to-gas vs metallicity relation, the abundance of dust within and outside galaxies, and predictions on the relative importance of various processes affecting dust. The analysis presented here highlights significant achievements as well as the limitations in our current modeling of dust evolution in galaxies.</description>

      <title>Chemical enrichment of ICM within the A3266 cluster I: radial profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed study of the elemental abundances distribution of the intracluster medium (ICM) within the A3266 cluster using {\it XMM-Newton} observations. This analysis uses EPIC-pn data, including a new energy scale calibration, which allows us to measure velocities with uncertainties down to $\Delta v \sim 80$ km/s, and MOS observations. We measured radial O, Mg, Si, S, Ar, Ca, and Fe profiles. This is the first study of elemental abundances beyond Fe using X-ray observations within the A3266 cluster. The abundance profiles display discontinuities similar to those obtained for the temperature. We modeled the X/Fe ratio profiles with a linear combination of type~Ia supernovae (SNIa) and core-collapse supernovae (SNcc) models. We found that the SNIa ratio over the total cluster enrichment tends to be uniform, with a $42\pm 5\%$ contribution. Such a trend supports an early ICM enrichment scenario, with most metals produced before clustering.</description>

      <title>Dark matter phase-in: producing feebly-interacting particles after a first-order phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The freeze-in mechanism describes the out-of-equilibrium production of dark matter (DM) particles via feeble couplings or non-renormalisable interactions with large suppression scales. In the latter case, predictions suffer from a strong sensitivity to the initial conditions of the universe, such as the details of reheating. In this work, we investigate how this sensitivity is altered in the presence of a cosmological first-order phase transition. We show that freeze-in via non-renormalisable interactions is not always dominated by the highest temperatures of the Standard Model (SM) thermal bath, but instead may be governed by the period immediately after the phase transition, during which the decaying scalar field transfers its energy density to the SM radiation. We refer to this alternative production regime as DM $\textit{phase-in}$. Using numerical and approximate analytical solutions of the relevant Boltzmann equations, we determine the conditions that under which phase-in or conventional freeze-in production dominates the final DM abundance in terms of the type of interaction between the DM and SM particles, the amount of supercooling before and the evolution of the scalar field after the phase transition. In the phase-in regime, the DM abundance is correlated with the peak frequency of the gravitational wave signal associated with the phase transition, opening up new observational possibilities.</description>

Abstract: This report, summarising work achieved in the context of the LHC Dark Matter Working Group, investigates the phenomenology of $t$-channel dark matter models, spanning minimal setups with a single dark matter candidate and mediator to more complex constructions closer to UV-complete models. For each considered class of models, we examine collider, cosmological and astrophysical implications. In addition, we explore scenarios with either promptly decaying or long-lived particles, as well as featuring diverse dark matter production mechanisms in the early universe. By providing a unified analysis framework, numerical tools and guidelines, this work aims to support future experimental and theoretical efforts in exploring $t$-channel dark matter models at colliders and in cosmology.</description>

      <title>Searching for the QCD Dark Matter Axion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proposed half a century ago, the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) axion explains the lack of charge and parity violation in the strong interactions and is a compelling candidate for cold dark matter. The last decade has seen the rapid improvement in the sensitivity and range of axion experiments, as well as developments in theory regarding consequences of axion dark matter. We review here the astrophysical searches and theoretical progress regarding the QCD axion. We then give a historical overview of axion searches, review the current status and future prospects of dark matter axion searches, and then discuss proposed dark matter axion techniques currently in development.</description>

      <title>Unveiling faint X-ray AGN populations in the NewAthena era: Insights from cosmological simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations expanded our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution, yet key challenges persist in the X-ray regime, crucial for studying Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). These limitations drive the development of next-generation observatories such as ESA's NewAthena. Now in phase B (preliminary design), the mission requires extensive testing to ensure compliance with its scientific goals, particularly given the uncertainties surrounding high redshift AGN. This work leverages the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulation to build an X-ray AGN mock catalogue and assess the performance of NewAthena's WFI. We created a Super Massive Black Hole (SMBH) light cone, spanning 10 deg2, with corrections to account for the limited resolution of the simulation and X-ray properties derived in post-processing. The resulting catalogue reveals a 5* overabundance of faint AGN compared to current X-ray constraints, an inconsistency potentially resolved by invoking a higher Compton-thick (CTK) fraction and intrinsic X-ray weakness, as suggested by recent JWST findings. An end-to-end survey simulation using SIXTE predicts 250000 AGN detections, including 20,000 at z &gt; 3 and 35 in the Epoch of Reionization (z &gt; 6); notably, only AGN with LX &gt; 43.5 erg/s are detectable at z &gt; 6. The analysis also forecasts a significant population of detectable CTK AGN, even beyond z &gt; 4. These findings suggest X-ray observations will, for the first time, probe a significant AGN population in the EoR, offering new insights into SMBH growth. They also provide key input for refining NewAthena's mission design and optimizing its survey strategy.</description>

      <title>Testing Non-Coincident $f(Q)$-gravity with DESI DR2 BAO and GRBs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the $f\left( Q \right) $-theory for the description of dark energy with a non-trivial connection defined in the non-coincident gauge. The resulting field equations form a two-scalar-field, quintom-like gravitational model. For the power-law model $f\left( Q \right) \simeq Q^{\frac{n}{n-1}}$, we construct an analytic expression for the dynamical evolution of dark energy, which depends on the parameter $n$. We constrain this dark energy model using the the baryon acoustic oscillations from DESI DR2, and gamma-ray bursts. The cosmological data provides $n \simeq0.33 $. The $f\left( Q \right) $-model challenges the $\Lambda$CDM by providing a smaller value for $\chi_{\min}^{2}$, while there is weak evidence in favor of the $f\left( Q \right) $-theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A large primordial density perturbation of the Hubble scale will gravitationally collapse, generating an outgoing sound shell whether or not a primordial black hole (PBH) is formed. In this Letter, we report a new source of the stochastic gravitational wave background induced by the collision of sound shells in the early Universe. The peak frequency and amplitude in the GW spectrum depend on the Hubble horizon and the abundance of sound shells. Abundant density perturbations would lead to GW backgrounds potentially detectable for future pulsar timing arrays and ground-based/space-borne detectors. For those perturbations that collapse into PBHs, future null detection of the corresponding high-frequency GW background could put new observational constraints on those PBHs that have already evaporated.</description>

      <title>Role of Matter Inhomogeneity on Fast Flavor Conversion of Supernova Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigated the impact of a spatially varying matter potential $\lambda$, coming from neutrino-electron forward scattering, on the emergence of fast neutrino flavor conversion (FFC) triggered by the presence of zero crossings in the angular distribution of the neutrino electron lepton number (ELN). We find that FFC can be significantly affected as the spatial variation rate of $\lambda$ increases, and strong spatial variations can completely stabilize initially unstable systems. Using stability analysis based solely on initial conditions, we identified for the first time a critical variation rate above which no FFC occurs even if the flavor instability exists. By analyzing several representative matter profiles based on an 18 $M_{\odot}$ SN model, we show that spatially inhomogeneous $\lambda$ can suppress the occurrence of FFC associated with shallow ELN zero crossings in most of the SN's radial region, especially during the accretion phase. Our finding highlights the need to consider the impact of matter inhomogeneity in the development of improved SN models that aim to include the effect of neutrino flavor conversions.</description>

      <title>Fast detection and reconstruction of merging Massive Black Hole Binary signals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will detect gravitational waves from the population of merging massive black holes binaries (MBHBs) throughout the Universe. The LISA data stream will feature many superposed signals from different astrophysical sources, requiring a global fit procedure. Most of the MBHB signals will be loud enough to be detected days or even weeks before the merger; and for those sources LISA will be able to predict the time of the merger well in advance of the coalescence, as well as an approximate position in the sky. In this paper, we present a fast detection and signal reconstruction scheme for massive black hole binaries in the LISA observation band. We propose: (i) a detection scheme for MBHB mergers allowing a first subtraction of these signals for the purpose of a global fit, and (ii) an efficient early detection scheme providing a time-of-merger estimate for a pre-merger signal, that will allow to trigger a protection period, placing LISA in ``do not disturb'' mode and enabling more detailed analysis that will facilitate multi-messenger observations. We highlight the effect of confusion of several overlapping in time MBHB signals in the pre-merger detection.</description>

      <title>Domain wall evolution beyond quartic potentials: The Sine-Gordon and Christ-Lee potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Domain walls are the simplest type of topological defects formed at cosmological phase transitions, and one of the most constrained. Their studies typically assume a quartic double well potential, but this model is not fully representative of the range of known or plausible particle physics models. Here we study the cosmological evolution of domain walls in two other classes of potentials. The Sine-Gordon potential allows several types of walls, interpolating between different pairs of minima (which demands specific numerical algorithms to separately measure the relevant properties of each type). The Christ-Lee potential parametrically interpolates between sextic and quartic behavior. We use multiple sets of simulations in two and three spatial dimensions, for various cosmological epochs and under various choices of initial conditions, to discuss the scaling properties of these networks. In the Sine-Gordon case, we identify and quantify deviations from the usual scaling behavior. In the Christ-Lee case, we discuss conditions under which walls form (or not), and quantify how these outcomes depend on parameters such as the energy difference between the false and true vacua and the expansion rate of the Universe. Various biased initial conditions are also addressed in appendices. Finally, we briefly comment on the possible cosmological implications of our results.</description>

      <title>Flat-sky Angular Power Spectra Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13768v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the flat-sky approximation for evaluating the angular power spectra of projected random fields by retaining information about the correlations along the line of sight. With broad, overlapping radial window functions, these line-of-sight correlations are suppressed and are ignored in the Limber approximation. However, retaining the correlations is important for narrow window functions or unequal-time spectra but introduces significant computational difficulties due to the highly oscillatory nature of the integrands involved. We deal with the integral over line-of-sight wave-modes in the flat-sky approximation analytically, using the FFTlog expansion of the 3D power spectrum. This results in an efficient computational method, which is a substantial improvement compared to any full-sky approaches. We apply our results to galaxy clustering (with and without redshift-space distortions), CMB lensing and galaxy lensing observables. For clustering, we find excellent agreement with the full-sky results on large (percent-level agreement) and intermediate or small (subpercent agreement) scales, dramatically out-performing the Limber approximation for both wide and narrow window functions, and in equal- and unequal-time cases. In the case of lensing, we show on the full sky that the angular power spectrum of the convergence can be very well approximated by projecting the 3D Laplacian (rather than the correct angular Laplacian) of the gravitational potential, even on large scales. Combining this approximation with our flat-sky techniques provides an efficient and accurate evaluation of the CMB lensing angular power spectrum on all scales.</description>

      <title>Holographic and Gravity-Thermodynamic Approaches in Entropic Cosmology: Bayesian Assessment using late-time Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07446v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the cosmological implications of entropy-based approaches in the context of Holographic Dark Energy (HDE) and Gravity-Thermodynamics (GT) formalisms. We utilise the extended Barrow entropy form, with the index parameter $\Delta$, representing the fractal dimension of the horizon. We also test implementing different parameter ranges for $\Delta$, which can be extended to Tsallis' interpretation within the same formal cosmology. We perform a Bayesian analysis to constrain the cosmological parameters using the Pantheon+, more recent DESy5, DESI, and, as a supplement, Quasar datasets. We find that the HDE model within almost all data combinations performs extremely well in comparison to the GT approach, which is usually strongly disfavored. Using the combination of DESy5+DESI alone, we find that the GT approaches are disfavored at $|\log \mathcal{B}| \sim 5.8$ and $|\log \mathcal{B}| \sim 6.2$ for the Barrow and Tsallis limits on $\Delta$, respectively, wrt $\Lambda$CDM model. While the HDE approach is statistically equivalent to $\Lambda$CDM when comparing the Bayesian evidence. We also investigate the evolution of the dark energy equation of state and place limits on the same, consistent with quintessence-like behaviour in the HDE approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply the Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structure (EFTofLSS) to non-standard models of dark matter with suppressed small-scale structure imprinted by early-time physics, here exemplified by interacting dark matter (IDM) coupled to standard model neutrinos, and cross-check that the EFTofLSS has no trouble replicating the real-space halo-halo power spectrum from N-body simulations. We perform forecasts for a DESI ELG-like experiment using the redshift-space power spectrum and find that, under very conservative priors on these parameters, the EFTofLSS is not expected to yield strong constraints on dark matter interactions. However, with a better understanding of the evolution of counterterms and stochastic terms with redshift, realistic IDM models could in principle be detected using the full-shape power spectrum analysis of such a spectroscopic galaxy survey.</description>

      <title>Inference of morphology and dynamical state of nearby $Planck$-SZ galaxy clusters with Zernike polynomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse the maps of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) signal of local galaxy clusters ($z&lt;0.1$) observed by the $Planck$ satellite in order to classify their dynamical state through morphological features. To study the morphology of the cluster maps, we apply a method recently employed on mock SZ images generated from hydrodynamical simulated galaxy clusters in THE THREE HUNDRED (THE300) project. Here, we report the first application on real data. The method consists in modelling the images with a set of orthogonal functions defined on circular apertures, the Zernike polynomials. From the fit we compute a single parameter, $\mathcal{C}$, that quantifies the morphological features present in each image. The link between the morphology of 2D images and the dynamical state of the galaxy clusters is well known, even if not obvious. We use mock $Planck$-like Compton parameter maps generated for THE300 clusters to validate our morphological analysis. These clusters, in fact, are properly classified for their dynamical state with the relaxation parameter, $\chi$, by exploiting 3D information from simulations. We find a mild linear correlation of $\sim 38\%$ between $\mathcal{C}$ and $\chi$ for THE300 clusters, mainly affected by the noise present in the maps. In order to obtain a proper dynamical-state classification for the $Planck$ clusters, we exploit the conversion from the $\mathcal{C}$ parameter derived in each $Planck$ map in $\chi$. A fraction of the order of $63\%$ of relaxed clusters is estimated in the selected $Planck$ sample. Our classification is then compared with those of previous works that have attempted to evaluate, with different indicators and/or other wavelengths, the dynamical state of the same $Planck$ objects. The agreement with the other works is larger than $58\%$.</description>

      <title>Field-level inference of $H_0$ from simulated type Ia supernovae in a local Universe analogue</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08385v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two particular challenges face type Ia supernovae (SNeIa) as probes of the expansion rate of the Universe. One is that they may not be fair tracers of the matter velocity field, and the second is that their peculiar velocities distort the Hubble expansion. Although the latter has been estimated at $\lesssim1.5\%$ for $z&gt;0.023$, this is based either on constrained linear or unconstrained (random) non-linear velocity simulations. In this paper, we address both challenges by incorporating a physical model for the locations of supernovae, and develop a Bayesian Hierarchical Model that accounts for non-linear peculiar velocities in our local Universe, inferred from a Bayesian analysis of the 2M++ spectroscopic galaxy catalogue. With simulated data, the model recovers the ground truth value of the Hubble constant $H_0$ in the presence of peculiar velocities including their correlated uncertainties arising from the Bayesian inference, opening up the potential of including lower redshift SNeIa to measure $H_0$. Ignoring peculiar velocities, the inferred $H_0$ increases minimally by $\sim 0.4 \pm 0.5$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ in the range $0.023&lt;z&lt;0.046$. We conclude it is unlikely that the $H_0$ tension originates in unaccounted-for non-linear velocity dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12015v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adding a sine-type interaction to inflationary models with two fields can evoke a classical trajectory with many turns in field space. Under conditions we discuss, the enhancement of the spectrum of adiabatic fluctuations resulting from each turn adds up. A special range of scales away from the CMB-constrained region can then be enhanced by several orders of magnitude, allowing for interesting phenomenological possibilities, such as induced gravitational waves or primordial black holes. A localized version of this interaction can also be used as an add-on to conventional inflationary models, thus allowing the injection of the large peak in their power spectra. The intuition and the conclusions drawn from this simple model remain relevant for more complicated applications that usually include extra terms that obscure the simplicity of the mechanism.</description>

      <title>Preference for evolving dark energy in light of the galaxy bispectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04602v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse pre-DESI clustering data using a dark energy equation of state $w(z)$ parametrised by $(w_0, w_a)$, finding a $2.8-3.9\sigma$ preference for evolving dark energy over the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ when combined with cosmic microwave background data from Planck and supernova data from Pantheon+, Union3, or DESY5. Our constraints, consistent with DESI Y1 results, are derived from the power spectrum and bispectrum of SDSS/BOSS galaxies using the Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structure (EFTofLSS) at one loop. The evidence remains robust across analysis variations but disappears without the one-loop bispectrum. When combining DESI baryon acoustic oscillations with BOSS full-shape data, while marginalising over the sound horizon in the latter to prevent unaccounted correlations, the significance increases to $3.7-4.4\sigma$, depending on the supernova dataset. Using a data-driven reconstruction of $w(z)$, we show that the evidence arises from deviations from $\Lambda$ at multiple redshifts. In addition, our findings are interpreted within the Effective Field Theory of Dark Energy (EFTofDE), from which we explicitly track the non-standard time evolution in EFTofLSS predictions. For perturbatively stable theories in the $w &lt; -1$ regime, the evidence persists in the clustering limit $(c_s^2 \rightarrow 0)$ when higher-derivative corrections are present, as well as in the quasi-static limit $(c_s^2 \rightarrow 1)$ when additional EFTofDE parameters are considered.</description>

      <title>Joint Analysis of Constraints on f(R) Parametrization from Recent Cosmological Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04118v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we present constraints on the parameters of three well-known $f(R)$ gravity models, viz. (i) Hu-Sawicki, (ii) Starobinsky, and (iii) ArcTanh by using a joint analysis of recent cosmological observations. We perform analytical approximations for the Hubble parameter, $H(z)$, and cosmological distances in terms of the Hubble constant $(H_0)$, matter density $(\Omega_{m0})$, and a deviation parameter $b$ for each model. Our analysis uses data from four cosmological observations: (a) Hubble parameter measurements (Cosmic Chronometers), (b) Type Ia Supernovae (Union 3.0), (c) Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (DESI-2024), and (d) Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs). We first optimize the models using each dataset independently, and subsequently, we perform a comprehensive joint analysis combining all four datasets. Our results show that the Hu-Sawicki and ArcTanh models do not deviate significantly from the $\Lambda$CDM model at 68\% confidence level for individual datasets and remain consistent at 99\% confidence level in the joint analysis. In contrast, the Starobinsky model shows a strong deviation and appears as a viable alternative to $\Lambda$CDM. We also constrain the transition redshift parameter ($z_t$), and check that the obtained value agrees with the values inferred from both early-time measurement (Planck) and late-time data from Type Ia Supernovae. These results support the potential support of $f(R)$ gravity to explain the late-time cosmic acceleration effectively.</description>

      <title>Holographic complexity and the Hubble tension: a quantum gravity portrayal for the large scale structure of the cosmos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05267v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we propose a relationship between the so-called Hubble-Lema\^{i}tre constant $H_{0}$ and holographic complexity related to the emergence of spacetime in quantum gravity. Such a result can represent an important step to understanding the Hubble tension by introducing a quantum gravity perspective for cosmological observations: regarding the degree of quantum complexity we measure around us.</description>

      <title>Observational Signatures of Highly Magnified Gravitational Waves from Compact Binary Coalescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17547v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing has empowered telescopes to discover astronomical objects that are otherwise out of reach without being highly magnified by foreground structures. While we expect gravitational waves (GWs) from compact binary coalescences to also experience lensing, the phenomenology of highly magnified GWs has not been fully exploited. In this Letter, we fill this gap and explore the observational signatures of these highly magnified GWs. We find that these signatures are robust against modeling details and can be used as smoking-gun evidence to confirm the detection of lensing of GWs without any electromagnetic observation. Additionally, diffraction becomes important in some cases, which limits the maximum possible magnification and gives waveform signatures of lensing that can only be observed by GW detectors. Even with current-generation observatories, we are already sensitive to these rare, highly magnified GWs and could use them to probe the high-redshift Universe beyond the usual horizon.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Polarized Dust Emission Using Data from the First Flight of SPIDER</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20982v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using data from the first flight of SPIDER and from Planck HFI, we probe the properties of polarized emission from interstellar dust in the SPIDER observing region. Component separation algorithms operating in both the spatial and harmonic domains are applied to probe their consistency and to quantify modeling errors associated with their assumptions. Analyses of diffuse Galactic dust emission spanning the full SPIDER region demonstrate i) a spectral energy distribution that is broadly consistent with a modified-blackbody (MBB) model with a spectral index of $\beta_\mathrm{d}=1.45\pm0.05$ $(1.47\pm0.06)$ for $E$ ($B$)-mode polarization, slightly lower than that reported by Planck for the full sky; ii) an angular power spectrum broadly consistent with a power law; and iii) no significant detection of line-of-sight polarization decorrelation. Tests of several modeling uncertainties find only a modest impact (~10% in $\sigma_r$) on SPIDER's sensitivity to the cosmological tensor-to-scalar ratio. The size of the SPIDER region further allows for a statistically meaningful analysis of the variation in foreground properties within it. Assuming a fixed dust temperature $T_\mathrm{d}=19.6$ K, an analysis of two independent sub-regions of that field results in inferred values of $\beta_\mathrm{d}=1.52\pm0.06$ and $\beta_\mathrm{d}=1.09\pm0.09$, which are inconsistent at the $3.9\,\sigma$ level. Furthermore, a joint analysis of SPIDER and Planck 217 and 353 GHz data within one sub-region is inconsistent with a simple MBB at more than $3\,\sigma$, assuming a common morphology of polarized dust emission over the full range of frequencies. This evidence of variation may inform the component-separation approaches of future CMB polarization experiments.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Machine Learning for Classifying CHIME Fast Radio Bursts and Investigating Empirical Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14040v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are highly energetic millisecond-duration astrophysical phenomena typically categorized as repeaters or non-repeaters. However, observational limitations may result in misclassifications, potentially leading to a higher proportion of repeaters than currently identified. In this study, we leverage unsupervised machine learning techniques to classify FRBs using data from the CHIME/FRB catalogs, including both the first catalog and a recent repeater catalog. By employing Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection for dimensionality reduction and clustering algorithms (k-means and Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise), we successfully segregate repeaters and non-repeaters into distinct clusters, identifying over 100 potential repeater candidates. Our analysis reveals several empirical relations within the clusters, including the ${\rm log \,}\Delta t_{sc}-{\rm log \,}\Delta t_{rw}$, ${\rm log \,}\Delta t_{sc}-{\rm log \,}T_B$, and $r - \gamma$ correlations, where ${\Delta t_{sc}, \Delta t_{rw}, T_B, r, \gamma}$ represent scattering time, rest-frame width, brightness temperature, spectral running, and spectral index, respectively. The Chow test results reveal that while some repeaters and non-repeaters share similar empirical relationships, the overall distinctions between the two groups remain significant, reinforcing the classification of FRBs into repeaters and non-repeaters. These findings provide new insights into the physical properties and emission mechanisms of FRBs. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of unsupervised learning in classifying FRBs and identifying potential repeaters, paving the way for more precise investigations into their origins and applications in cosmology. Future improvements in observational data and machine learning methodologies are expected to further enhance our understanding of FRBs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10277v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We anticipate that the data acquired by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will be dominated by the gravitational wave signals from several astrophysical populations. The analysis of these data is a new challenge and is the main focus of this paper. Numerous gravitational wave signals overlap in the time and/or frequency domain, and the possible correlation between them has to be taken into account during their detection and characterization. In this work, we present a method to address the LISA data analysis challenge; it is flexible and scalable for a number of sources and across several populations. Its performance is demonstrated on the simulated data LDC2a.</description>

      <title>Axion Stabilization in Modular Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14904v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ invariant $\alpha$-attractor models have plateau potentials with respect to the inflaton and axion fields. The potential in the axion direction is almost exactly flat during inflation, hence, the axion field remains nearly massless. In this paper, we develop a generalized class of such models, where the $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ symmetry is preserved, but the axion acquires a large mass and becomes strongly stabilized during inflation, which eliminates isocurvature perturbations in this scenario. Inflation in such two-field models occurs as in the single-field $\alpha$-attractors and leads to the same cosmological predictions.</description>

      <title>False and genuine decoherence in the early universe: a local observer and time-averaged observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10472v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study quantum decoherence of curvature perturbations at superhorizon scales caused by the gravitational nonlinearities. We show that cubic gravitational couplings, constrained by the spatial diffeomorphism invariance, lead to infrared (IR) and ultraviolet (UV) divergences in the decoherence rate at one loop. These divergences arise from fluctuations of deep IR modes which look like a background mode for a local observer and violent zero-point fluctuations in the deep UV, respectively. We argue that these divergences are unobservable, as they vanish when considering proper observables. We consider correlators defined using the geodesic distance for IR divergences and time-averaged correlators for UV divergences. To account for these observer's perspectives, we propose to consider an effective quantum state, defined in terms of actual observables, as a more appropriate probe of the quantum coherence of the system measured by an observer. We then evaluate the finite decoherence rate induced by superhorizon environment during inflation and at late universe.</description>
