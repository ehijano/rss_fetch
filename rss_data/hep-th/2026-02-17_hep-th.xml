      <title>Towards 3D CFT Cartography with the Stress Tensor Bootstrap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new numerical results on the space of local, unitary, parity-preserving conformal field theories (CFTs) in three dimensions from the stress tensor bootstrap. In bounds maximizing certain OPE coefficients, we find a plethora of sharp features, such as kinks and ridges, as a function of scaling dimensions. We show that some of these features correspond to known theories, but there are many others that are equally strong but do not match known CFTs. We argue that these features are robust to raising numerical order and could then correspond to numerous as yet unknown CFTs. We conclude in proposing a program of "CFT cartography": the systematic exploration of the landscape of CFTs without individual theory targets in mind.</description>

      <title>Physical Predictions in Closed Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent developments in gravitational path integrals indicate that the nonperturbative physical Hilbert space of a closed universe is one-dimensional within each superselection sector. This raises a basic puzzle: how can a unique quantum-gravity state give rise to semiclassical physics, measurement outcomes, and classical probabilities? In this paper, we develop a framework in which nontrivial and statistically stable predictions emerge despite the one-dimensionality of the fully constrained Hilbert space. The key idea is to extract physical predictions in an enlarged, unconstrained Hilbert space by conditioning on observational data. We show that partial observability -- reflecting the limited access of observers to the degrees of freedom of the universe -- suppresses ensemble fluctuations associated with microscopic structure in the gravitational path integral, thereby restoring semiclassical predictability with exponential accuracy. We formulate the construction explicitly including contributions from the Hartle--Hawking no-boundary state, define a gauge-invariant Hilbert space for observations via a density operator, and generalize the formalism to conditioning on histories, clarifying the emergence of classical probabilities and an effective arrow of time. Finally, we explore whether this framework can support a realistic cosmology and identify assumptions that the underlying theory of quantum gravity must satisfy.</description>

      <title>Holographic Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cold dark matter may be a fluid (or plasma) residing in a strongly-interacting hidden sector, rather than a population of weakly-coupled particles. Such a scenario admits a holographic description in terms of a cosmological braneworld embedded in the linear dilaton five-dimensional (5D) spacetime. In this framework, dark matter originates from the linear dilaton bulk black hole, whose phase we show to be thermodynamically favored at all temperatures. We present a natural freeze-in mechanism for the production of holographic dark matter, in which the bulk black hole is fed by energy leaking from the brane after inflation. Our model is characterized by two free parameters, one of which, the position of the black hole horizon, is fixed by the observed dark matter abundance. The remaining parameter, the 5D Planck scale $M_5$, is consistent with all current experimental bounds provided that $M_5\gtrsim 3\times 10^5$ TeV.</description>

      <title>Holographic observables in TsT deformations of confining theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct new families of type-IIB supergravity solutions by employing TsT transformations on the ten-dimensional geometry that arises after the uplift of the five-dimensional soliton solution of Anabal\'on, Nastase, and Oyarzo. In particular, we identify two marginal and two dipole deformations of the uplifted geometry. We then analyse a plethora of holographic observables -- including Wilson loops, `t~Hooft loops, Page charges, entanglement entropy, and central charge -- and compare their behaviour across the different deformed backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Fixing EFT equations with a reservoir model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective Field Theories with higher derivatives often yield equations of motion which define ill-posed problems. We present a method for enhancing control on such theories by coupling them to a field living in one extra dimension. The resulting action principle helps to define a well-posed problem introducing a mechanism to control UV behavior. Physically this is achieved by dissipating the energy in the short-wavelength modes into the extra dimension. We examine the resulting dynamics and compare it to alternative proposals for studying such theories in the non-linear regime.</description>

      <title>Braneworlds in Constant and Accelerated Motion and Their Causal Characteristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize prior work on the signatures of bulk signals detected by brane-based observers in a spacetime with a compactified dimension. When such braneworlds move with constant velocities or constant proper accelerations in the extra dimension, the observers may witness apparent superluminal signaling. Our analysis includes tilted branes that are partially wrapped along the compact dimension. We identify parameters that help characterize various scenarios. Despite the apparent superluminality of bulk signals, we show that anisotropies in their propagation relative to the brane-based observer preserve causality. Some of the effects studied here could be the basis for alternative cosmological models, as well as observable signatures of braneworld scenarios.</description>

      <title>A Convergent Kinetic-Term Perturbation Expansion for $\phi^4$ Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit scalar $\phi^4$ theory and construct a reorganized perturbative expansion in which the kinetic operator, rather than the quartic interaction, is treated as the perturbation. Starting from the exactly solvable $0$-dimensional model, we show that the resulting series is convergent for positive coupling and can be written as an expansion in negative powers of the quartic coupling $\lambda$. We extend the construction to higher-dimensional field theory using an auxiliary field, and we formulate a discrete lattice version in which multi-site contributions are systematically organized. We explicitly compute the leading terms in the expansion, study their continuum limit, and compare against brute-force numerical evaluations of the partition function. We discuss the relation of this expansion to standard weak-coupling perturbation theory, strong-coupling expansions, and resummation techniques, and we outline possible applications to nonperturbative studies of scalar field theories.</description>

      <title>Defect Approach to Giant Graviton Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a framework of zero dimensional defects for analyzing light-light-heavy-heavy (LLHH) correlators in conformal field theories. We specifically apply this formalism to correlators of giant gravitons in $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills to probe the nontrivial physics beyond planarity. By combining this framework with bootstrap techniques, we compute all four-point functions at strong coupling involving two maximal giant gravitons and two supergravitons of arbitrary dimensions. We identify a partially broken, higher-dimensional hidden symmetry -- a defect extension of 10d hidden conformal symmetry -- present at both strong and weak coupling, which allows these correlators to be packaged into a single generating function. Furthermore, we perform a systematic OPE analysis of the strong-coupling correlators, extracting the complete spectrum of anomalous dimensions for the defect-channel double-particle operators. Finally, we argue that the defect perspective provides the natural nonperturbative description for any LLHH correlator by showing that four-point conformal blocks reduce to defect two-point blocks in the heavy limit.</description>

      <title>Higher Connection in Open String Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define a 2-form connection in the space of classical solutions of the bosonic open string field theory, using the open string star product and integration. The corresponding higher holonomies and the 3-form curvature are new observables invariant under the infinite-dimensional gauge algebra of open string field theory. The definition is analogous to that of Berry phase in quantum mechanics and is motivated by recent studies on higher Berry phase in condensed matter physics and quantum field theory. We suggest identifying this 2-form connection with the Kalb-Ramond $B$-field of the closed string background at least in favorable situations. Also discussed are sigma models whose target space is the moduli space of conformal boundary conditions of a two-dimensional CFT with the $B$-field given by a cousin of this 2-form connection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.13661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate gravitational interactions of massive fields with arbitrary integer and half-integer spin, trying to construct a vertex that contains both standard minimal and non-minimal interaction terms necessary to make the vertex gauge invariant. We propose an ansatz for these non-minimal terms and show that it leads to a unique solution that correctly reproduces our previous results for spins 5/2, 3 and 7/2, including all possible partially massless limits.</description>

      <title>Black holes from the gravitational path integral: supersymmetric indices and precision holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The counting of microstates of supersymmetric black holes with anti-de Sitter or flat asymptotics is obtained by computing a supersymmetric index in a weakly coupled string theory or a dual superconformal field theory. These indices are protected observables, whose value can be reliably extrapolated from weak to strong coupling, where the gravitational description applies. In this Thesis, after a broad introductory review, we discuss recent progress in formulating such protected observables directly within the gravitational theory, via the Euclidean path integral. In the semiclassical limit the index reduces to a sum over complex Euclidean saddles. These saddles are supersymmetric but ''non-extremal'', and arise in both anti-de Sitter and flat spaces. In the holographic setting, we investigate four-derivative corrections to the thermodynamics of AdS$_5$ black holes. Using off-shell methods, we construct the corrected action of five-dimensional gauged supergravity. We then evaluate the corrected on-shell action of supersymmetric AdS$_5$ black holes and find exact agreement with a Cardy-like limit of the superconformal index of the dual conformal field theory. By a Legendre transform of the action, we obtain the corrected black hole entropy, and we confirm this result by applying Wald's formula to the corrected near-horizon geometry. We then turn to the gravitational index with asymptotically flat boundary conditions. We uncover a broad family of novel saddles and present a general classification based on their rod structure, which characterizes their topology. These solutions may feature multiple horizons or three-dimensional bubbles with lens space topology, and allowing for conical singularities yields further geometries, involving spindles and branched spheres. For the simpler geometries, the on-shell action is computed using an odd-dimensional version of equivariant localization.</description>

      <title>Defect relative entropy in symmetric orbifold CFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we compute the defect relative entropy between topological defects in the symmetric product orbifold CFT $\mathrm{Sym}^N(M) = M^{\otimes N}/S_N$. Our analysis covers two distinct classes of defects: universal defects, which realize the $\mathrm{Rep}(S_N)$ non-invertible symmetry, and non-universal defects.
  We show that the defect relative entropy reduces to a Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence. The resulting expression decomposes naturally into two contributions: one governed by characters of the symmetric group $S_N$, and the other controlled by modular $S$-matrix elements of the seed RCFT. Remarkably, both sets of data appear as probability distributions, yielding an information-theoretic interpretation of permutation group data and modular data within the symmetric orbifold.
  The structure of the divergence depends sensitively on the defect class. For universal defects, only the permutation group data contributes; for maximally fractional defects, both permutation and modular data enter and together define the relevant probability distributions. This feature suggests that the maximally fractional defect can be understood as a kind of product of the RCFT defect and the symmetric orbifold defect.</description>

      <title>Jackiw-Teitelboim Gravity from Holonomies: Discrete BF Formulation and Boundary Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a fully discrete and non-perturbative formulation of two-dimensional Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity within the BF framework. Using group-valued holonomies and Lie-algebra--valued dilatons, the bulk theory is shown to be purely topological, with all physical information encoded at the boundary. We analyze admissible discrete boundary conditions and derive the corresponding asymptotic symmetry algebras directly at the lattice level, including an affine Kac-Moody symmetry and its Brown-Henneaux reduction to a Virasoro algebra, together with the associated Virasoro-dilaton structure. A precise operator product expansion (OPE) dictionary is established by taking the controlled continuum limit of the discrete Poisson brackets. Beyond asymptotic symmetries, we provide an effective boundary description and a representation-theoretic quantization organized by monodromy sectors. Within this discrete framework, black hole entropy follows from gauge-invariant holonomy data and is expressed in terms of the dilaton Casimir, reproducing the Bekenstein--Hawking result without invoking a fundamental Schwarzian action.</description>

      <title>Resummation of small-spin singularities in anomalous dimensions of twist-two operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anomalous dimensions of leading-twist operators in QCD play an important role in precision predictions for high-energy processes, since they govern the scale evolution of parton distributions. Their analytic structure as a function of spin is particularly important due to the complexity of higher-loop computations. In these proceedings, we discuss the resummation of the certain type of such singularities that share common features with those appearing in the quark flavor-nonsinglet sector of QCD. Our main focus is on the interplay between Gross-Neveu-Yukawa model in $\epsilon$ expansion and Gross-Neveu in $1/N$ expansion. Such resummation allows one to predict the higher-loop singular behavior and reveals connections with the conformal Regge theory and recent studies of detector operators in QCD and various conformal field theories.</description>

      <title>Integral Transformations for Conformally Invariant Celestial Gluon Amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an integral transformation for celestial gluon amplitudes that maps the celestial coordinates \((z_i,\bar z_i)\) to a new set of complex variables \((s_i,\bar s_i)\), inspired by the structure of closed string scattering amplitudes. A consistent inverse transformation is constructed by regulating a divergence associated with translational redundancy and absorbing it into an overall normalization. Applying this transformation to celestial MHV amplitudes, we derive constraints on \((s_i,\bar s_i)\) for three-, four-, and general \(n\)-point amplitudes, and show that these conditions are necessary for invariance under global conformal transformations.</description>

      <title>Quantum criticality and mixed-state entanglement in holographic superconductor--insulator transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study quantum criticality in a holographic Einstein--Maxwell--Dilaton--Axion (EMDA) p-wave superconductor exhibiting a superconductor--insulator transition (SIT). By tracking the superconducting energy gap, we show that approaching the quantum critical point (QCP) closes the gap and induces incipient insulating features, indicating that enhanced quantum fluctuations suppress superconducting order and trigger the SIT. To probe the transition, we employ two holographic indicators: holographic entanglement entropy (HEE) and the entanglement wedge cross-section (EWCS), the latter being a mixed-state entanglement measure. In contrast to HEE, which for sufficiently large configuration is dominated by the thermal entropy and is therefore largely insensitive to entanglement along the temperature direction, EWCS displays pronounced critical scaling and provides a robust diagnostic of the quantum phase transition (QPT). We attribute this contrast to the fact that HEE at large scales is controlled by the infrared (IR) geometry, whereas EWCS is governed by deformations of the entire bulk. Our results establish EWCS as a robust probe of holographic quantum criticality in mixed states.</description>

      <title>Holographic Subregion Complexity and Fidelity Susceptibility in Noncommutative Yang--Mills Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the behavior of holographic subregion complexity (HSC) and holographic fidelity susceptibility (HFS) in noncommutative Yang--Mills theory. The emergence of a minimum length scale, dictated by the degree of noncommutativity, induces a behavioral transition in the HSC and establishes a lower bound. In the large noncommutativity regime, the qualitative features of the complexity deviate significantly from the commutative case. The HFS is shown to provide an effective measure of the degree of noncommutativity. Although the HSC generally satisfies strong subadditivity, this property fails abruptly when the subregion size approaches the minimum length scale. At finite temperature, the long-range behavior of the HSC is modified, and its lower bound scales positively with temperature. Furthermore, temperature enhances the sensitivity of the fidelity susceptibility to the degree of noncommutativity. Within the AdS soliton background, a competition between connected and disconnected configurations arises in the HSC, signaling a phase-transition-like behavior. Finally, the compactification scale is found to diminish the sensitivity of the HFS to the degree of noncommutativity.</description>

      <title>Flavor dependence of chiral symmetry breaking and the conformal window</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the phase structure of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) in the vacuum as a function of quark flavor number $N_f$ within the chiral limit. By self-consistently solving the coupled DSEs for the quark and gluon propagators in a minimal QCD scheme, we elucidate the nonperturbative dynamics governing dynamical chiral symmetry breaking. Our calculations determine a critical flavor number of $N_f^c=6.81$ which marks the chiral symmetry restoration of quarks. Further analysis reveals the critical exponents of the chiral condensate as $ -\langle\bar{\psi} {\psi}\rangle\sim |N_f-N_f^c|^{0.53(9)}$, characterized the second order feature of this phase transition of chiral symmetry. Additionally, we discuss the implications for the walking regime towards the conformal window at larger flavor.</description>

      <title>Resurgent structure of the 't Hooft-Polyakov monopole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter we present a comprehensive analysis of the differential equations governing the spatial profile of the 't Hooft-Polyakov monopole from the viewpoint of resurgence theory. We note that the special shape of the gauge-component asymptotics, together with the simplicity of its Borel transform and the Green's kernels in the Volterra equations, provides a complete control over the proliferation of the Borel-plane singularities to all orders and for any $\lambda/e^2&gt;0$, along with full information about the relevant logarithmic discontinuities. Hence, the resurgent structure of the non-BPS solutions turns out to be unexpectedly simple, and its resonance at the origin of the Borel plane even admits an analytic calculation of the normalization coefficients of their asymptotic forms to an arbitrary level of precision.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically determine the S-matrix by using connection formulae in the modular linear differential equation (MLDE) approach to the holomorphic modular bootstrap. We then determine exact formulae using the fact that entries in the $S$-matrix are integer entries in a cyclotomic extension of the field of rational numbers. This provides a method that is intrinsic to the MLDE setup and does not require inputs outside this framework. The method is illustrated with a selection of examples.</description>

      <title>Light dilaton from top-down holographic confinement with magnetic fluxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A two-parameter class of higher-dimensional, strongly coupled, confining field theories in the presence of magnetic fluxes for two Abelian gauge groups admits a top-down, holographic dual description. The corresponding two-parameter family of regular background solutions of the classical equations of maximal supergravity in seven dimensions descends from maximal supergravity in eleven dimensions. We study the global and local stability properties of these solutions. We identify lines of zero-temperature first-order phase transitions, describing a polygon (a square) in the space of parameters, identified with the two fluxes. In the spectrum of fluctuations of the supergravity equations, interpreted as bound states of the dual, confining field theories, we find no evidence of local instabilities (tachyons). Over a significant portion of parameter space, that extends far away from the proximity to the transition, we identify an approximate dilaton, the mass of which is one order of magnitude smaller than the scale set by confinement. Our findings complement those emerging in other holographic models discussed in the literature, in which either the dilaton mass is only mildly lower than the confinement scale (when approaching a first-order transitions), or parametrically suppressed (when reaching the proximity to a second-order one).</description>

      <title>On the Unitarity of the Gravitational S-Matrix in High Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We argue that for finite energy windows, the final states in gravitational scattering in dimension $d &gt; 4$ are normalizable coherent states in Fock space. However, as the center of the energy window goes to infinity, black hole physics predicts that these states become orthogonal to every state with a finite number of particles. Given that the spectral measure in energy is determined by Poincare invariance, the S-matrix cannot be a unitary operator in Fock space, despite having finite matrix elements in Fock space, and satisfying perturbative unitarity, to all orders in string perturbation theory. We identify regimes in the BFSS matrix model\cite{bfss} and the definition of the S-matrix as the limit of CFT correlators\cite{polchsuss}, which point to the same conclusion. We review a scattering theory based on the quantum mechanics of a finite number of fermionic oscillators, whose algebra formally converges to the Super-Poincare covariant Awada-Gibbons-Shaw\cite{ags} algebra, and argue that a certain class of limiting states on that algebra satisfy all the properties required by physical unitarity in the algebraic formulation of quantum mechanics. The only missing ingredient for a consistent theory is a proof that the S matrix amplitudes themselves are Poincare invariant. We provide suggestive arguments, but no real proof, that this is so.</description>

      <title>Symmetric teleparallel gravitational effects on solar neutrino oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutrino oscillations probe the quantum gravity interface in unique ways. While gravitational effects on neutrinos are well studied in general relativity and torsion based geometries, the symmetric teleparallel regime where gravity stems solely from non-metricity, with zero curvature and torsion has remained uncharted. In this work, we perform the first analysis of neutrino oscillations in such a spacetime. Using the reduced Kerr metric in coincident gauge for the slowly rotating and weakly gravitating spherical Sun, we derive the Dirac Hamiltonian from the generalized Dirac equation and compute the accumulated phase of neutrino mass eigenstates. There are six free coupling constants in our model. Based on certain observational inputs, we inferred upper bounds on our arbitrary coupling constants. This allowed us to simplify the otherwise cumbersome calculations to some extent. Ultimately, we computed the phase differences that play a crucial role in solar neutrino oscillations and analyzed the contributions arising from our arbitrary coupling constants. Our results establish neutrino oscillations as a novel probe of non-metricity and open a new avenue for testing symmetric teleparallel gravity through astrophysical observations.</description>

      <title>Optical effects in modified Maxwell electrodynamics under a uniform electromagnetic background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate optical effects in modified Maxwell electrodynamics (ModMax) in the presence of an external electromagnetic field. Considering uniform and constant magnetic and electric backgrounds, the solutions for the refractive indices are revisited. Using these results, we obtain the propagating modes and the phase shift (birefringence) for plane wave solutions in the presence of a pure magnetic background field. Afterwards, we investigate the Goos-H\"anchen effect considering the interface between a simple dielectric and a medium whose electromagnetic response tensors are ruled by the ModMax electrodynamics. Further, based on the general reflection problem, we discuss the complex Kerr rotation with both the electric $(E)$ and magnetic $(B)$ background fields, considering two main cases: i) $B&gt;E$ and ii) $E&gt;B$. Our findings indicate that the $\gamma$ parameter and ratios $(B/E)$ and $(E/B)$ play a central role in describing the Kerr signals (rotation and ellipticity) of systems with optical effects induced by non-linear electromagnetic effects.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Formation of Self-Similar Wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study spherically symmetric, self-similar wormhole solutions supported by colliding streams of negative-energy null dust, and their dynamical formation. Under the assumption of self-similarity, the Einstein equations reduce to a system of ordinary differential equations, which we solve numerically under boundary conditions enforcing the existence of a minimal areal radius (the throat) on constant-time hypersurfaces. For a sufficiently large throat radius, the resulting geometries remain regular at both spatial and future null infinity, while a singularity is retained in the past direction. We then construct a dynamical formation scenario by patching together three regions: a Schwarzschild black hole, negative-energy Vaidya spacetimes, and the self-similar wormhole geometry. These regions are joined across null shells using the Barrabes--Israel formalism, which provides explicit relations among the throat radius, the black hole's mass and the energy injection by the shell, demonstrating that an initial black hole can evolve into a wormhole. Our analysis generalizes the formation model for static wormhole solutions proposed by Hayward and Koyama in 2004 to non-static wormhole solutions, offering a novel perspective on the formation of regular traversable wormholes.</description>

      <title>Probing Rotational Dynamics of Quark Gluon Plasma via Global Vorticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The findings on the spin polarization of $\Lambda$, $\Xi$, and $\Omega$ hyperons and spin alignment of $K^{*0}$, $\phi$, and $D^{*+}$ mesons in relativistic heavy-ion collision experiments at the RHIC and LHC facilities propose the emergence of a strong vorticity field produced in these collisions. Contemplating the potential impact of vorticity on the space-time evolution of deconfined QCD matter and its freeze-out properties, we aim to investigate its characteristics within the medium. We introduce a complementary and data-driven approach to quantify the global vorticity field by extracting it directly from the transverse momentum spectra of produced hadrons. Employing the experimental data for $\Lambda$, $\Xi$, $\Omega$, $K^{*0}$, $K^{*\pm}$, $\phi$, $\rho$, and $D^{*+}$ at mid-rapidity in Au+Au and Pb+Pb collisions over a wide range of beam energies, $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=7.7$ GeV-5.02 TeV, and centrality classes, we systematically examine spin-vorticity coupling in the medium. Our finding on the magnitude of the extracted vorticity is consistent with values deduced from $\Lambda$ and $\bar{\Lambda}$ polarization measurements using statistical thermal models under the non-relativistic limit. Notably, we observe a prominent particle-species dependence of the vorticity, as well as a non-trivial variation with collision centrality and beam energy. These results indicate that vorticity-driven spin phenomena are sensitive to hadron structure and freeze-out dynamics, providing new constraints on the rotational properties of the QCD matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.13694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate static and dynamical spherically symmetric black hole solutions within the Gravity from Entropy (GfE) framework. We derive and solve the modified vacuum field equations for a static, spherically symmetric spacetime, revealing that the classical Schwarzschild geometry receives perturbative corrections scaling as $r^{-4}$. We establish that the GfE framework is consistent with current strong-field astrophysical observations. Higher-order geometric stresses inherent to the GfE vacuum drive a consistent mass-evolution profile. In the limit of large black hole mass, the theory predicts a constant background evaporation rate $ -\beta/24$, suggesting an inherent "entropic leakage" of the vacuum. At intermediate scales, the framework replicates the standard Hawking radiation mass-loss law as $\dot{M} \propto M^{-2}$ through a purely classical response of the modified background.</description>

      <title>Torsion-Induced Quantum Fluctuations in Metric-Affine Gravity using the Stochastic Variational Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This review paper comprehensively examines the influence of spatial torsion on quantum fluctuations from the perspectives of Metric-Affine Gravity (MAG) and the Stochastic Variational Method (SVM). We first outline the fundamental framework of MAG, a generalized theory that includes both torsion and non-metricity, and discuss the geometrical significance of torsion within this context. Subsequently, we summarize SVM, a powerful technique that facilitates quantization while effectively incorporating geometrical effects. By integrating these frameworks, we evaluate how the geometrical structures originating from torsion affect quantum fluctuations, demonstrating that they induce non-linearity in quantum mechanics. Notably, torsion, traditionally believed to influence only spin degrees of freedom, can also affect spinless degrees of freedom via quantum fluctuations. Furthermore, extending beyond the results of previous work [Koide and van de Venn, Phys. Rev. A112, 052217 (2025)], we investigate the competitive interplay between the Levi-Civita curvature and torsion within the non-linearity of the Schr\"odinger equation. Finally, we discuss the structural parallelism between SVM and information geometry, highlighting that the splitting of time derivatives in stochastic processes corresponds to the dual connections in statistical manifolds. These insights pave the way for future extensions to gravity theories involving non-metricity and are expected to deepen our understanding of unresolved cosmological problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formulation of a consistent measurement theory for relativistic quantum fields has become a problem of growing foundational and practical significance. Standard non-relativistic measurement models fail to incorporate the essential relativistic principles of locality, causality, and Lorentz covariance, and are therefore inadequate for quantum field theoretic settings. While most existing work focuses on scalar fields, realistic particles possess spin, polarization, and internal degrees of freedom that introduce new conceptual and operational challenges. To this end, we employ the Quantum Temporal Probabilities (QTP) framework for relativistic measurements to describe electromagnetic, Dirac, and internally structured scalar fields. Our results include probabilities for the time-of-arrival that take spin/polarization into account, generalized photodetection formulas beyond Glauber's theory, an unambiguous derivation of the particle oscillation formula together with its limitations, and a first-principles analysis of relativistic qudits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: After distinguishing the role of classical and quantum inhomogeneities in cosmological backgrounds, we constrain the initial states of the relic gravitons as soon as the different wavelengths of the spectrum cross the comoving Hubble radius, without any reference to earlier timescales. According to this pragmatic perspective the quantum states with finite energy density at the crossing time consistently affect the two-point functions and the related power spectra. An initial state different from the vacuum turns out to be marginally permitted in the low frequency range (associated with the largest observable wavelengths that crossed the comoving Hubble radius) while the intermediate and high frequency domains of the spectrum are populated by the gravitons produced from the vacuum. The non classical correlations are expected to dominate between the kHz and the THz since in this region gravitons are produced quantum mechanically with a negligible contribution from the initial state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transversal Pauli Z rotations provide a natural route to fault-tolerant logical diagonal gates in quantum CSS codes, yet their capability is fundamentally constrained. In this work, we formulate the refinement problem of realizing a logical diagonal gate by a transversal implementation with a finer discrete rotation angle and show that its solvability is completely characterized by the Bockstein homomorphism in homology theory. Furthermore, we prove that the linear independence of the X-stabilizer generators together with the commutativity condition modulo a power of two ensures the existence of transversal implementations of all logical Pauli Z rotations with discrete angles in general CSS codes. Our results identify a canonical homological obstruction governing transversal implementability and provide a conceptual foundation for a formal theory of transversal structures in quantum error correction.</description>

      <title>Local Short-Time Acceleration and deSitter Spacetime induced Extra Spectral Broadening: a Simple Interpretation of Modified Inertial in MOND</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel quantum effect wherein particle spectra show extra broadening due to local short-time acceleration (as well as in a deSitter spacetime background). This effect provides a simple interpretation for the acceleration interpolation relation required to modify the kinematics of a test particle in the Modified Inertial interpretation of Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND). This effect can be regarded as a generalization of the thermal blackbody spectrum generated by the Unruh effect (which arises from long-time uniform acceleration in a flat background) to the scenario of local short-time non-uniform acceleration. This effect offers a unified framework for understanding the accelerated expansion of the universe and the anomalies in galactic rotation curves or radial acceleration. It is worth emphasizing that this modified kinematic interpretation of MOND necessitates a quantum equivalence principle as its physical foundation, that is, extending the equivalence at the level of expectation values (first-order moments) in the classical equivalence principle to the equivalence at the level of second-order moment quantum fluctuations. Therefore, the role of this effect within the frameworks of quantum reference frames and quantum gravity is also discussed to some extent.</description>

      <title>The initial data of effective field theories of relativistic viscous fluids and gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There has been recent progress in developing well-posed theories of relativistic viscous hydrodynamics and of gravitational effective field theories. These have in common the feature that they introduce unphysical degrees of freedom. We address the problem of how these should be treated. We propose a ''reduction of order'' approach which is applied not at the level of equations of motion but only to initial data. This specifies uniquely the data for the unphysical modes in terms of the data for the physical modes. We argue that the apparent breaking of Lorentz invariance associated with this approach is not a problem provided one restricts to Lorentz frames for which the assumptions of effective field theory are manifestly valid.</description>

      <title>Exploring Non-minimal coupling using ultra-diffuse galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate whether a non-minimal coupling between dark matter and gravity can influence the internal dynamics of ultra-diffuse galaxies. Within this framework, the gravitational potential is modified by an additional term that captures the interaction between spacetime curvature and the dark matter with a coupling constant determined by a length scale $L$. Using spherical Jeans modeling, we analyze the kinematic data of three ultra-diffuse galaxies namely: NGC\;1052-DF2, NGC\;1052-DF4, and Dragonfly\;44, which span the observational extremes from dark matter deficient to dark matter dominated systems. For each galaxy we explore several dark matter halo profiles, two orbital anisotropy models, and both with and without Stellar-to-Halo Mass Relation scenarios, and we perform a Bayesian parameter inference. Our results show that across all the considered configurations, the constrained astrophysical parameters are consistent with standard ones from General Relativity. The posterior distributions of $L$ show no preference for non-zero values and result only in upper limits, suggesting that any non-minimal coupling contribution must be small and perturbative on this scales. Future high precision velocity measurements will be essential to determine whether non-minimal coupling effects can become observationally distinguishable in low-acceleration systems.</description>

      <title>Improved frequency hierarchy treatment for anisotropic spectral distortions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectral distortion anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) provide a new probe of the early Universe that can be accessed using traditional CMB imaging techniques. It is possible to compute the creation and evolution of anisotropic signals for various scenarios using the frequency hierarchy method recently developed for CosmoTherm. However, the current treatment is not perfect and some approximations had to be made. Here, we carefully construct a modified form for the evolution equations that has the full equilibrium solutions built into the formulation. We improve the formalism to account for i) additional stimulated scattering effects, ii) kinematic corrections to the thermalization terms, iii) corrections to the standard perturbation variables and iv) direct photon sources. These effect could not be captured with the original formulation of the frequency hierarchy method but are indeed important for cleanly separating real distortions from temperature signals. However, we show that previous results are not altered significantly when compared to the improved formulation presented here. As a new worked example, which could indeed not be treated before, we also illustrate how possible changes in the temperature-redshift relation would create spectral distortion anisotropies in the pre-recombination era. The theoretical methods presented here are also an important step towards being able to consistently predict the CMB spectral distortion anisotropies in photon-dark photon and photon-axion conversion scenarios.</description>

      <title>Controlled Theory of Skyrmion Chern Bands in Moir\'e Quantum Materials: Quantum Geometry and Collective Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments in moir\'e quantum materials exhibit quantized Hall states without an external magnetic field, motivating continuum mechanisms based on smooth moir\'e-periodic pseudospin textures. We present a controlled theory of skyrmion Chern bands generated by such textures. An exact local $SU(2)$ transformation reveals an emergent non-Abelian gauge field; for large branch splitting we perform an operator-level Schrieffer-Wolff expansion, yielding a single-branch Hamiltonian together with systematically dressed physical operators that define the projected interacting theory beyond strict adiabaticity. The leading dynamics is governed by a $U(1)$ Berry connection whose flux is set by the skyrmion density, while controlled non-adiabatic corrections are fixed by the texture's real-space quantum geometric tensor. In a Landau-level representation built from the averaged emergent field, moir\'e-periodic modulations induce Umklapp-resolved deformations of Girvin-MacDonald-Platzman kinematics and microscopic sources of excess optical quantum weight above the topological lower bound. Assuming a gapped Hall phase, we further derive a skyrmion-crystal effective field theory with a universal Berry-phase term and a noncommutative magnetophonon. Our results provide experimentally accessible signatures for twisted transition-metal dichalcogenide homobilayers and rhombohedral graphene aligned with hexagonal boron nitride.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Echoes of the First Order Phase Transition in a Kination-Induced Big Bang</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) produced during first-order phase transitions (FOPTs) in the early universe provide a powerful probe of nonstandard cosmological histories. We study GW production from a FOPT ending a kination-dominated epoch in the Kination-Induced Big Bang scenario, in which a period of kination domination terminates through a phase transition that reheats the universe into radiation domination. A rolling scalar field drives the kination epoch. In the specific model we consider, its derivative coupling to a second scalar (tunneling field) dynamically traps the latter in a false vacuum, with the phase transition triggered as the kination field slows due to Hubble friction. We compute the resulting stochastic GW background from bubble nucleation and collisions, presenting analytic estimates and numerical results for the peak amplitude and frequency. In all cases we find an upper bound $\Omega_{\rm GW} h^2\lesssim 2\times10^{-7}$ from the bubble percolation condition. In the case where the false vacuum energy dominates at the transition (yet the kination field drives the FOPT), we find $\Omega_{\rm GW}h^2\gtrsim 10^{-12}$. We further find that the Hubble scale during the phase transition across a broad set of model parameters is bounded by $\mathscr{O}(10^{-13})M^2/M_{\rm Pl}\lesssim H_* \lesssim \mathscr{O}(0.1)M^2/M_{\rm Pl}$, where $M$ is the mass-scale controlling the strength of the interaction between the kination and tunneling fields. The predicted signal spans frequencies from nHz to MHz, allowing the model to explain the signal reported by Pulsar Timing Array experiments and to be constrained or probed by interferometers such as LISA, Advanced LIGO, Cosmic Explorer, and BBO. Interestingly, a FOPT can occur even if the bare tunneling potential has a single minimum, as metastability is generated dynamically by the coupling between the tunneling and the kination field.</description>

      <title>3d Conformal Field Theories via Fuzzy Sphere Algebra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.15025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fuzzy sphere models conjecturally realize 3d CFTs in small systems of spinful fermions, but why they work so well is still not fully understood. Their Hamiltonians are built from electron density operators projected to the lowest Landau Level. We analyze the algebra of the density modes and verify that it satisfies the Jacobi identity. The fuzzy sphere geometry admits two thermodynamic limits: a local planar limit yielding the fuzzy plane, and a commutative limit yielding an ordinary sphere. In the planar limit, high-angular-momentum modes recover the Girvin-MacDonald-Platzman algebra, whereas in the commutative limit the low-angular-momentum modes become semiclassical. We further find an explicit representation of the conformal algebra so(3,2) in the minimal two-electron system and extend it to larger systems via an so(3) equivariant coproduct. Because the coproduct splits one so(3) representation into a tensor product, it is structurally mismatched with the thermodynamic limit of critical fuzzy sphere Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Fate of false vacuum in non-perturbative regimes: Gravity effects</title>

Abstract: A recent analysis of the false-vacuum decay in non-perturbative regimes is here extended in the presence of Einstein gravity, computing the corresponding effective potential and decay rate. We consider a $\lambda \phi^4$ scalar field theory and we observe that, in comparison to the usual perturbative decay rate, the higher the coupling $\lambda$, the greater the decay probability. We evaluate the running of the self-interaction coupling and obtain a weakly coupled theory at lower energies, proving that Einstein gravity grants an even more reliable weak coupling approximation with the universe cooling down. We also provide an extended study of a non-minimal coupling $\xi$ of the scalar field with gravity showing how this term makes the false-vacuum decay more difficult. Minima can also disappear at large coupling $\xi$. We discuss possible applications of these results to cosmological phase transitions, gravitational-wave astronomy, and condensed matter systems.</description>

Abstract: Relativistic, charged, superheated bubbles may play an important role in neutron star mergers if first-order phase transitions are present in the phase diagram of Quantum Chromodynamics. We describe the properties of these bubbles in the hydrodynamic regime. We find two qualitative differences with supercooled bubbles. First, the pressure at the center of an expanding superheated bubble can be higher or lower than the pressure in the asymptotic, metastable phase. Second, some fluid flows develop metastable regions behind the bubble wall for any choice of the equation of state. We consider the possible role of a conserved charge akin to baryon number. The fluid flow profiles are unaffected by this charge if the speed of sound is constant in each phase, but they are modified for more general equations of state. We compute the efficiency factor relevant for gravitational wave production.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Lagrangian Formulation for Quantum and Classical Gravity at High Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04428v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a systematic Lagrangian approach for quantum gravity in the super-Planckian limit where $s\gg M_{pl}^2\gg t$. The action can be used to calculate to arbitrary accuracy in the quantum and classical expansion parameters $\alpha_Q= \frac{t}{M_{pl}^2}$ and $\alpha_C= \frac{st}{M_{pl}^4}$, respectively, for the scattering of massless particles. The perturbative series contains powers of $\log(s/t)$ which can be resummed using a rapidity renormalization group equation (RRGE) that follows from a factorization theorem which allows us to write the amplitude as a convolution of a soft and collinear jet functions. We prove that the soft function is composed of an infinite tower of operators which do not mix under rapidity renormalization. The running of the leading order (in $G$) operator leads to the graviton Regge trajectory while the next to leading operator running corresponds to the gravitational BFKL equation. For the former, we find agreement with one of the two results previously presented in the literature, while for the ladder our result agrees (up to regulator dependent pieces) with those of Lipatov. We find that the convolutive piece of the gravitational BFKL kernel is the square of that of QCD. The power counting simplifies considerably in the classical limit where we can use our formalism to extract logs at any order in the PM expansion. The leading log at any order in the PM expansion can be calculated without going beyond one loop. The log at $(2N+1)$ order in the Post-Minkowskian expansion follows from calculating the one loop anomalous dimension for the $N+1$th order piece of the soft function and perturbatively solving the RRGE $N-1$ times. The factorization theorem implies that the classical logs which arise alternate between being real and imaginary in nature as $N$ increases.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Phases of Higher Dimensional Floquet CFTs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00099v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the dynamical phases of Floquet Conformal Field Theories (CFTs) in space-time dimensions greater than two. Building upon our previous work [1] which introduced quaternionic representations for studying Floquet dynamics in higher dimensional CFTs, we now explore more general square pulse drive protocols that go beyond a single SU(1,1) subgroup. We demonstrate that, for multi-step drive protocols, the system exhibits distinct dynamical phases characterized by the nature of the eigenvalues of the quaternionic matrix representing time evolution in a single cycle, leading to different stroboscopic responses. Our analysis establishes a fundamental geometric interpretation where these dynamical phases directly correspond to the presence or absence of Killing horizons in the base space of the CFT and in a higher dimensional AdS space on which a putative dual lives. The heating phase is associated with a non-extremal horizon, the critical phase with an extremal horizon which disappears in the non-heating phase. We develop perturbative approaches to compute the Floquet Hamiltonians in different regimes and show, how tuning drive parameters can lead to horizons, providing a geometric framework for understanding heating phenomena in driven conformal systems.</description>

      <title>Geometry of Chord Intertwiner, Multiple Shocks and Switchback in Double-Scaled SYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19013v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the bulk Hilbert space interpretation of chords in the double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) model and introduce a notion of intertwiner that constructs bulk states from states with fixed boundary conditions. This leads to an isometric map that factorizes the one-particle bulk Hilbert space into a tensor product of two boundary Hilbert spaces without particle insertion. The map enables a systematic derivation of a family of correlation functions with arbitrary finite amount of matter insertions, relevant for capturing the switchback effect-a feature of holographic complexity. We further develop a path integral framework that describes multiple shockwave configurations in the semiclassical limit. For the two-body scattering processes in semi-classical regime, we show it exhibits sub-maximal chaos at finite temperature, consistent with the scramblon dynamics associated with the "fake disk" geometry. The effective "fake temperature" governing this behavior emerges from the semiclassical limit of the quantum $6 j$-symbol associated with the out-of-time-order correlator. We further analyze multi-shockwave configurations and derive precise conditions under which the switchback effect is realized, both in terms of the total chord number and the Krylov complexity of precursor operators. Our results clarify the structure of correlation functions with multiple operator insertions, their bulk interpretation in terms of shockwave geometries in the semiclassical regime, and provide a microscopic derivation of the switchback effect in the DSSYK model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that hyperbolic monopoles, with a particular value of the curvature, can be obtained from ADHM instanton data that satisfies additional constraints. Here this data is reformulated in terms of a triplet of real matrices that satisfy a set of quartic equations, with solutions associated with representations of su(2). Many of the known examples of hyperbolic monopoles can easily be recovered in this formulation by evaluating Nahm data for Euclidean monopoles at the centre of its domain. Toda reductions of Nahm's equation correspond to cyclic Euclidean monopoles, and this is adapted to the hyperbolic setting to obtain solutions, even when the corresponding Nahm data is not tractable. A new family of charge 4 hyperbolic monopoles with square symmetry is presented as an example.</description>

      <title>Form factors of composite branch-point twist operators in the sinh-Gordon model on a multi-sheeted Riemann surface: semiclassical limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12878v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum sinh-Gordon model in 1+1 dimensions is one of the simplest and best-studied massive integrable relativistic quantum field theories. We consider this theory on a multi-sheeted Riemann surfaces with a flat metric, which can be seen as a pile of planes connected to each other along cut lines. The cut lines end at branch points, which are represented by a twist operator ${\cal T}_n.$ Operators of such kind are interesting in the framework of the problem of computing von Neumann and Renyi entanglement entropies in the original model on the plane. The composite branch-point twist operators (CTO) are a natural generalization of the twist operators, obtained by placing a local operator to a branch point by means of a certain limiting procedure. Correlation function in quantum field theory can be, in principle, found by means of the spectral decomposition. It allows one to express them in terms of form factors of local operators, i.e. their matrix elements in the basis of stationary states. In integrable models complete sets of exact form factors of all operators can be found exactly as solutions of a system of bootstrap equations. Nevertheless, identification of these solution to the operators in terms of the basic fields remains problematic. In this work, we develop a technique of computing form factors of a class of CTO determined in terms of the basic field in the semiclassical approximation.</description>

      <title>Splitting and gluing in sine-dilaton gravity: matter correlators and the wormhole Hilbert space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01680v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sine-dilaton gravity has been proposed as the holographic dual of the double scaled SYK (DSSYK) model. In this work, we examine this duality by deriving general matter correlation functions directly from the bulk perspective. A novel technique we develop is to treat matter lines in the bulk as end-of-the-world (EOW) branes, allowing us to implement a splitting and gluing procedure on the bulk spacetime. This geometric procedure gives rise to the structure of two-sided multi-particle wormhole Hilbert space. In contrast to previous Hilbert space constructions in DSSYK, the length basis in our case factorizes across the subregions, whereas the energy basis acquires a non-local, state-dependent structure determined by the EOW brane quantization in each subregion. Different choices of splitting correspond to distinct representations of the same Hilbert space, all of which are equivalent for physical observables. Based on this framework, we compute general correlation functions, including the OTOC, and show that they exactly reproduce the DSSYK results obtained from chord diagrams. By calculating the OTOC in different representations, we uncover a new identity for the 6j-symbol of the quantum group $\mathcal{U}_q(su(1,1))$. Finally, the resulting wormhole Hilbert space enables us to go beyond the disk to compute matter correlation functions on the double trumpet and to include bulk matter loops.</description>

      <title>Coarse-Grained Fixed-Point Tensor Networks and Holographic Reflected Entropy in 3D Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the framework of $\textit{fixed-point BCFT tensor networks}$ to present a microscopic CFT derivation of the correspondence between reflected entropy (RE) and entanglement wedge cross section (EW) in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$, for both bipartite and multipartite settings. These fixed-point tensor networks, obtained by triangulating Euclidean CFT path integrals, allow us to explicitly construct the canonical purification via cutting-and-gluing CFT path integrals. Employing modular flow in the large-$c$ limit, we demonstrate that these intrinsic CFT manipulations reproduce bulk geometric prescriptions, without assuming the AdS/CFT dictionary. The emergence of bulk geometry is traced to coarse-graining over heavy states in the large-$c$ limit. Universal coarse-grained BCFT data for compact 2D CFTs, through the relation to Liouville theory with ZZ boundary conditions, yields hyperbolic geometry on the Cauchy slice. The corresponding averaged replica partition functions reproduce all candidate EWs, arising from different averaging patterns, with the dominant one providing the correct RE and EW. In this way, many heuristic tensor-network intuitions in toy models are made precise and established directly from intrinsic CFT data.</description>

      <title>Krylov complexity and Wightman power spectrum with positive chemical potential in Schr\"odinger field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14742v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Krylov complexity in Schr\"odinger field theory in the grand canonical ensemble with chemical potential $\mu$, with an emphasis on the qualitatively new features that arise for $\mu&gt;0$. In this regime the fermionic Wightman power spectrum is effectively single-sided and sharply truncated at $\omega=\mu$, which induces a crossover in the Lanczos coefficients {and signals a dynamical transition from a bulk-dominated regime to a spectral-edge-dominated regime}: $b_n$ displays a two-stage linear growth (from an early-time slope $\pi/\beta$ to an asymptotic slope $2/\beta$), while $a_n$ bends from near-zero values to a linear descent with slope $-4/\beta$. We provide analytic support for the resulting complexity growth from three complementary viewpoints: (i) using an $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ algebraic construction matched to the asymptotic Lanczos data, we show that the late-time Krylov complexity must grow quadratically, $K(t)\propto t^{2}$; (ii) by analyzing engineered Wightman spectra with controlled decay and truncation, we identify single-sided exponential decay as the key spectral feature responsible for the quadratic asymptotics, while an approximately even two-sided exponential spectrum explains the early-time $K(t)\sim\sinh^{2}(\pi t/\beta)$ behavior at large $\mu$; (iii) we formulate the problem in terms of orthogonal polynomials and estimate the crossover scale separating the early- and late-stage regimes. Overall, our results help clarify the role of chemical potential and spectral truncation in shaping operator growth and Krylov complexity in this non-relativistic quantum field theory setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16099v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symmetry under a particular class of non-strictly canonical transformation may be used to identify, and subsequently excise degrees of freedom which do not contribute to the closure of the algebra of dynamical observables. Such redundant degrees of freedom may physically be identified with empirically-inaccessible measures of global scale. In this article, we present a mathematical framework which extends the symmetry reduction procedure to theories of classical fields, in both the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian settings. In order to maintain Lorentz covariance, while simultaneously working with a finite-dimensional phase space, we employ the De-Donder Weyl formalism, for which the natural description is formulated in terms of the fibered manifolds of multisymplectic geometry. We subsequently analyse a number of simple examples, and provide a discussion of the broader implications of our construction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is aimed at improving thermal bootstrapping methods for matrix quantum mechanics. The thermal energies of the large-$N$ one-matrix anharmonic oscillator and large-$N$ two-matrix anharmonic oscillator were bounded without logarithmic relaxation using the Quantum Information Conic Solver. For the one-matrix model, which can be interpreted using an effective theory of ``long strings'' in the low temperature limit, stricter bootstrap bounds yield a value of the first long string excited energy within $0.001\%$ of the physical value and the first estimation from symmetry and self-consistency equations alone of the first long string coupling coefficient.</description>

      <title>Generalizing fusion rules by shuffle: Symmetry-based classifications of nonlocal systems constructed from similarity transformations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02139v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study fusion rings, or symmetry topological field theories (SymTFTs), which lie outside the non-negative integer matrix representation (NIM-rep), by combining knowledge from generalized symmetry and that from pseudo-Hermitian systems. By applying the Galois shuffle operation to the SymTFTs, we reconstruct fusion rings that correspond to nonlocal CFTs constructed from the corresponding local nonunitary CFTs by applying the similarity transformations. The resultant SymTFTs are outside of NIM-rep, whereas they are ring isomorphic to the NIM-rep of the corresponding local nonunitary CFTs. We study the consequences of this correspondence between the nonlocal unitary model and local nonunitary models. We demonstrate the correspondence between their classifications of massive or massless renormalization group flows and the discrepancies between their boundary or domain wall phenomena. Our work reveals a new connection between ring isomorphism and similarity transformations, providing the fundamental implications of ring-theoretic ideas in the context of symmetry in physics.</description>

      <title>Non-hermitian Density Matrices from Time-like Entanglement and Wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13800v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extensively explore the connections between time-like entanglement and non-hermitian density matrices in quantum many-body systems. We classify setups where we encounter non-hermitian density matrices into two types: one is due to causal influences under unitary evolutions, and the other is due to non-unitary evolutions in non-hermitian systems. We provide various examples of these setups including interacting harmonic oscillators, two dimensional conformal field theories and holographic dualities. In them, we compute the time-like entanglement entropy and imagitivity, which measures how much density matrices are non-hermitian. In both two classes, typical holographic examples are given by traversable AdS wormholes. We explain how causal influences in a wormhole dual to a pair of non-hermitian quantum systems is possible even without interactions between them. We argue that to realize a traversable wormhole we need not only ordinary quantum entanglement but also time-like entanglement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ Chern--Simons matter theories describing the R-twisted $S^1$-reduction of Argyres--Douglas theories of $(A_{M-1},A_{N-1})$ type with $\text{gcd}(M,N)=1$, via a recently-proposed 4d/3d correspondence. In particular, for the $(A_2,A_{N-1})$ and $(A_3,A_{N-1})$ theories, we identify a series of Chern--Simons matter theories with monopole superpotentials consistent with an $\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetry enhancement in the infrared. As a by-product, we also find a novel Nahm sum formula for the vacuum character of $(3,8)$ $W_3$ minimal model, from which we find another Chern--Simons matter theory describing the R-twisted $S^1$-reduction of the $(A_2,A_4)$ theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The holographic product formula is used to determine the general form taken by holographic spectral functions in the near-extremal hydrodynamic regime, with energy $\omega$, momentum $k$ and temperature $T$ much smaller than a hard scale $\mu$. The resulting expressions simplify in the extremal limit $T \ll \omega,k\ll \mu$, for which the low-temperature gapless modes and the IR conformal behavior factorize. In some cases, this factorization extends to the general near-extremal regime $\omega,k,T\ll\mu$ at leading order in $T/\mu$. Several examples are discussed with different types of gapless modes and IR CFTs, including new numerical results for low temperature quasi-normal modes. We end with a concrete application that shows how the inclusion of the IR conformal behavior improves the description of the spectral function at low energies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.06150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the Krylov distribution $\mathcal{D}(\xi)$, a static Krylov-space diagnostic that characterizes how inverse-energy response is organized in Hilbert space. The central object is the resolvent-dressed state $(H-\xi)^{-1}|\psi_0\rangle$, whose decomposition in the Krylov basis generated from a reference state defines a normalized distribution over Krylov levels. Unlike conventional spectral functions, which resolve response solely along the energy axis, the Krylov distribution captures how the resolvent explores the dynamically accessible subspace as the spectral parameter $\xi$ is varied. Using asymptotic analysis, exact results in solvable models, and numerical studies of an interacting spin chain, we identify three universal regimes: saturation outside the spectral support, extensive growth within continuous spectra, and sublinear or logarithmic scaling near spectral edges and quantum critical points. We further show that fidelity susceptibility and the quantum geometric tensor admit natural decompositions in terms of Krylov-resolved resolvent amplitudes.</description>

Abstract: Light traveling through the vacuum interacts with vacuum fluctuations similarly to the way that light traveling through a dielectric interacts with ordinary matter. And just as the permittivity of a dielectric can be calculated, the permittivity $\epsilon_0$ of the vacuum can be calculated, yielding an equation for the fine-structure constant $\alpha$. The most important contributions to the value of $\alpha$ arise from the interaction of photons with charged lepton-antilepton vacuum fluctuations that appear in the vacuum as on-shell, bound states. Considering these contributions only to first order in alpha, the fully screened $\alpha \cong 1/(8^2\sqrt{3\pi/2}) \cong 1/139$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07890v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spin-1 particles, is a fundamental bound state for the two quarks, and play a crucial role in elucidating the electromagnetic properties within the realm of hadronic physics. Their intrinsic relativistic nature mandates a quantum field theory (QFT) framework for a comprehensive analysis. In this investigation, we employ both the instant form of QFT and light-front quantum field theory (LFQFT) as our theoretical tools. While conventional LFQFT approaches predominantly focus on the plus component of the electromagnetic current to extract the properties of spin-1 vector particles, our study extends this analysis by systematically incorporating the minus component as well. Our findings demonstrate that achieving a rigorous equivalence between these distinct current components necessitates the inclusion of nonvalence terms within the electromagnetic current operator. This crucial inclusion serves to restore manifest covariance and ensures a robust consistency with the results independently
  derived from the more conventional instant form of quantum field theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08241v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate the induced potential in a finite temperature cold atomic medium between two heavy impurities, or polarons, which is shown to be \textit{complex-valued} in general. The imaginary part of the complex-valued potential describes a decoherence effect, and thus, the resulting Schr\"odinger equation for the two polarons acquires a non-Hermitian term. We apply the developed formulation to two representative cases of polarons interacting with medium particles through the $s$-wave contact interaction: (i) the normal phase of single-component (i.e., spin-polarized) fermions using the fermionic field theory, and (ii) a superfluid phase using the superfluid effective field theory, which is valid either for a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of a single-component Bose gas or for the BEC-BCS crossover in two-component fermions at a low-energy regime. Computing the leading-order term, the imaginary part of the potential in both cases is found to show a universal $r^{-2}$ behavior at long distance. We propose three experimental ways to observe the effects of the universal imaginary potential in cold atoms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06009v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On October 9, 2022, the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) reported the observation of the very early TeV afterglow of the brightest-of-all-time GRB 221009A, recording the highest photon statistics in the TeV band ever from a gamma-ray burst. We use this unique observation to place stringent constraints on an energy dependence of the speed of light in vacuum, a manifestation of Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) predicted by some quantum gravity (QG) theories. Our results show that the 95% confidence level lower limits on the QG energy scales are $E_{\mathrm{QG},1}&gt;10$ times of the Planck energy $E_\mathrm{Pl}$ for the linear, and $E_{\mathrm{QG},2}&gt;6\times10^{-8}E_\mathrm{Pl}$ for the quadratic LIV effects, respectively. Our limits on the quadratic LIV case improve previous best bounds by factors of 5--7.</description>

      <title>Multi-partite entanglement monotones</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17447v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If we want to transform the quantum state of a system to another using local measurement processes, what is the probability of success? This probability is bounded by quantifying entanglement in both the states. In this paper, we construct a family of local unitary invariants of multipartite states that are monotonic under local operations and classical communication on average. These monotones are constructed from local unitary invariant polynomials of the state and its conjugate, and hence are easy to compute for pure states. Using these measures we bound the success probability of transforming a given state into another state using local quantum operations and classical communication.</description>

      <title>Theories of flavour from the Planck scale to the electroweak scale</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The flavour puzzle remains as one of the most intriguing enigmas of particle physics. In this thesis, we propose and study theories of flavour which generically hint to a multi-scale origin of flavour. First we explore the idea of fermiophobic models and messenger dominance, where the chiral fermions of the Standard Model are uncharged under (part of) an extended gauge symmetry, which also forbids Yukawa couplings for chiral fermions. These are generated effectively due to the presence of hierarchically heavy messengers, including vector-like fermions and/or heavy Higgs doublets. Simultaneously, this mechanism generates effective couplings of chiral fermions to the gauge bosons of the extended symmetry, leading to a predictive phenomenology connected to the origin of flavour hierarchies. We present two models of this kind, based on gauge $U(1)$ and twin Pati-Salam symmetries, that have implications for low energy flavour anomalies. Secondly, we study the framework of flavour deconstruction, where the Standard Model emerges from a non-universal gauge theory that contains a separate gauge factor for each fermion family. We argue that one of the most simple ways to achieve this is by assigning a separate gauge hypercharge to each fermion family, denoted as the "tri-hypercharge" theory. If the SM Higgs only carries third family hypercharge, then only the third family is massive at renormalisable level, and light families get their mass from higher dimensional operators. Finally, we propose a gauge unified origin for gauge non-universal frameworks such as the aforementioned tri-hypercharge theory. The model assigns a separate $SU(5)$ group to each fermion family. However, assuming that the three $SU(5)$ groups are related by a cyclic permutation symmetry $\mathbb{Z}_{3}$, then the model is described by a single gauge coupling in the ultraviolet, despite $SU(5)^{3}$ being a non-simple group.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Generation via the Einstein-Langevin Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04562v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detections of gravitational waves (GWs) since GW150914 has gained a contemporary interest in a potential quantum-classical correspondence between GWs and hypothetical gravitons. One such correspondence theory is stochastic gravity, whereby graviton fluctuations are treated as the stochastic noise embedded in globally-flat manifolds and local gravitational interactions. Utilizing the Einstein-Langevin equation that describes graviton fluctuations, in attempt to form a correlation with GW generation, we utilize the hollow mass-shell model of coalescing compact binaries. This is to explore the second Newtonian postulate of neutralized internal gravitational fields, i.e. the stochastic noise of an enclosed, internal Minkowski manifold. This stochatic picture of GW formation implies the treatment of the enclosed gravitons as a Brownian bath. From the Einstein-Langevin equation, we establish a scaling relation where quanta dissipation depends inversely with the contracting volume (i.e., emission increases during coalescence). Using an Euler iteration scheme, we simulate the graviton fluctuations from inspiral to merger as a Wiener process, revealing a signal that qualitatively resembles macroscopic GW waveforms. While inherently heuristic and phenomenological, this approach provides a computational framework for exploring graviton-scale perturbations in GW formation. We discuss furthermore analytical waveform matching with the iteration scheme, as well as the justification of a Brownian analogy amidst current and state-of-the-art effective field theory frameworks.</description>

      <title>Semi-Classical Spin Hydrodynamics in Flat and Curved Spacetime: Covariance, Linear Waves, and Bjorken Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19854v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore various aspects of semi-classical spin hydrodynamics, where hydrodynamic currents are derived from an expansion in the reduced Planck constant $\hbar$, incorporating both flat and curved spacetimes. After establishing covariant definitions for angular momentum currents, we demonstrate that the conservation of the energy-momentum tensor requires modifications involving the Riemann curvature and the spin tensors. We also revise pseudo-gauge transformations to ensure their applicability in curved spacetimes. Key assumptions for semi-classical spin hydrodynamics are introduced, enabling studies without explicitly invoking quantum kinetic theory. We derive and analyze the linearized semi-classical spin hydrodynamic equations, proving that spin and fluid modes decouple in the linear regime. As a concrete example, we study the ideal-spin approximation in a dissipative fluid with shear viscosity. This analysis confirms our general result: the damping of spin waves is governed solely by spin relaxation time coefficients, independent of linear fluid perturbations. We also examine the Gibbs stability criterion and reveal its limitations at first order in $\hbar$, signaling the inherent anisotropy of the equilibrium state, which remains unaddressed in current semi-classical spin hydrodynamics formulations. Finally, within a conformal Bjorken flow background and using the slow-roll approximation attractor for the fluid sector, we show that the relaxation of the spin potential is governed by spin relaxation time coefficients, mirroring the damping behavior of spin waves in the linear regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22972v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe spatiotemporally chaotic (or turbulent) field theories discretized over d-dimensional lattices in terms of sums over their multi-periodic orbits. `Chaos theory' is here recast in the language of statistical mechanics, field theory, and solid state physics, with the traditional periodic orbits theory of low-dimensional, temporally chaotic dynamics a special, one-dimensional case.
  In the field-theoretical formulation, there is no time evolution. Instead, treating the temporal and spatial directions on equal footing, one determines the spatiotemporally periodic orbits that contribute to the partition sum of the theory, each a solution of the system's defining deterministic equations, with sums over time-periodic orbits of dynamical systems theory replaced here by sums of d-periodic orbits over d-dimensional spacetime geometries, the weight of each orbit given by the Jacobian of its spatiotemporal orbit Jacobian operator. The weights, evaluated by application of the Bloch theorem to the spectrum of periodic orbit's Jacobian operator, are multiplicative for spacetime orbit repeats, leading to a spatiotemporal zeta function formulation of the theory in terms of prime orbits.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Landscapes: black holes with linear equations of state in asymptotically safe gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23193v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study black holes with linear equation of state within the framework of asymptotically safe gravity. This study extends previous work on gravitational collapse in asymptotically safe gravity (that has been done for a dust fluid) by considering into account the pressure of stellar matter. We derive modified field equations containing the running gravitational coupling and the cosmological constant as functions of energy density. The interior space-time of collapsing star is modeled by the Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker metric, while the exterior is described by a static spherically symmetric space-time. Different equations of state from ordinary matter to exotic phantom energy are considered to investigate their impact on black hole structure and horizon formation. Our results illustrate that asymptotically safe gravity can introduce non-singular black hole solutions under specific conditions. These results provide new insights into black hole physics and the avoidance of singularities within the asymptotically safe gravity framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute photon emission rate enhancement near the QCD critical point using an effective theory of dynamic critical phenomena and derive a universal photon spectrum. The emission rate scales similarly to conductivity, increasing with the correlation length ($\xi$), diverging at the critical point. The spectrum exhibits $\omega dN_{\gamma}/d^3k \propto \omega^{-1/2}$ in the scaling regime, with the transition occurring at a frequency comparable to shear damping rate $\omega \sim \gamma_{\eta}/\xi^2$, reflecting the nonequilibrium properties of the near-critical liquid.</description>

      <title>Non-minimally coupled scalar field dark sector of the universe: in-depth (Einstein frame) case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07456v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, motivated by recent results from DESI DR2 suggesting the existence of evolving/interacting dark energy, we analyze spatially flat FLRW interacting scalar-tensor cosmological models with non-minimal coupling (NMC) between the scalar field (SF) and matter/cosmological dust in the Einstein conformal frame. By using modified expansion normalized variables that account for negative values of the scalar field potential, we derive cosmological dynamical system equations and expressions for physical variables. Five specific scalar field models (axions/ALPs, cyclic ekpyrotic, exponential with a constant, quintessence, and SFDM) are examined in depth to determine how they evolve, as they are thought to represent evolving dark energy in the late Universe. Using appropriate mathematical methods (e.g. linear stability, center manifold and Poincar\'e sphere), we present critical points along with their character and physical interpretation with respect to the possible evolution of the Universe. Considering both positive and negative values of the coupling parameter allows us to examine the transfer of energy from the scalar sector to dust and from matter to the scalar field. Considering four different values of this parameter provides a comprehensive analysis that incorporates all significant types of dynamical system evolution (from mathematical and physical perspectives). The initial conditions for the in-depth numerical analysis were calculated analytically from Planck 2018 and DESI DR2 CPL parametrizations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23900v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The superfluid dark matter model offers an elegant solution to reconcile discrepancies between the predictions of the cold dark matter paradigm and observations on galactic scales. In this scenario, dark matter is composed of ultralight bosons with self-interactions that can undergo a superfluid phase transition in galactic environments. In this review, we explore the theoretical foundations of dark matter superfluidity, detailing the conditions required for the formation and stability of superfluid cores of astrophysical size. We examine the phenomenological consequences for galactic dynamics, including the impact on galaxy mergers, the formation of vortices, the behavior near supermassive black holes, modifications to dynamical friction, and the emergence of long-range interactions. By synthesizing theoretical developments with observational constraints, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the current status and future prospects of dark matter superfluidity as a viable extension of the standard cosmological model.</description>

      <title>About electroweak domain walls in Majoron models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02910v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Some time ago it was claimed in "Spontaneous Breaking of Lepton Number and Cosmological Domain Wall Problem" (Phys. Rev. Lett. 122, 151301 (2019)) that non perturbative instantons of the weak interaction $\text{SU}(2)_\text{W}$ lead to the formation of domain walls in Majoron models owing to the anomaly of the spontaneously broken global lepton number $L$ symmetry $\text{U}(1)_L$ with respect to $\text{SU}(2)_\text{W}$. We point out that it has long been known, that this effect can be completely rotated away unless there is a source of explicit $B+L$ breaking present, where $B$ denotes baryon number. We further estimate the tiny instanton induced Majoron mass from $B+L$ breaking and analyze the cosmological impact of such domain walls including possible finite temperature effects. In general this scenario does not lead to a cosmological catastrophe and we demonstrate that the tiny instanton induced mass can act as a bias term to collapse walls induced by a larger source of lepton number breaking. Alternatively this electroweak Majoron could act as dynamical dark energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19772v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the relationship between computation and scattering both operationally (hence phenomenologically) and formally. We show how topological quantum neural networks (TQNNs) enable universal quantum computation, using the Reshetikhin-Turaev and Turaev-Viro models to show how TQNNs implement quantum error-correcting codes. We then exhibit a formal correspondences between TQNNs and amplituhedra to support the existence of amplituhedra for representing generic quantum processes. This construction shows how amplituhedra are geometric representations of underlying topological structures. We conclude by pointing to applications areas enabled by these results.</description>

      <title>Exploring the landscape of black hole mimickers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03879v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We identify a general class of spacetime metrics that mimic the properties of black holes without possessing a true event horizon. These metrics are constrained by the requirements of being singularity-free and geodesically complete. Specifically, we study metrics that do not possess $Z_2$ symmetry and may deviate slightly or significantly from the symmetric case. Focusing on scalar perturbations propagating on such backgrounds, we analyze the resulting effective radial potentials and their dependence on different corners of the mimicker landscape. We further investigate the corresponding quasinormal modes and explore their characteristic features. Finally, we survey the landscape for potential observational signatures, including shadow properties and the possible presence or absence of echo effects.</description>

      <title>Ladder Symmetry: The Necessary and Sufficient Condition for Vanishing Love Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09670v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Black holes in four-dimensional, asymptotically flat general relativity have vanishing static tidal Love numbers (TLNs), a property tied to a hidden symmetry of the perturbation equations. Within the Konoplya-Rezzolla-Zhidenko (KRZ) parametrization, a subclass of spacetimes was previously shown to admit such Ladder symmetry, which enforces the absence of static scalar TLNs. In this work, we introduce parametric deformations to such Ladder-symmetric spacetimes and analyze the resultant linear tidal response. Using the parametrized formalism for TLNs, we show that any deviation from a Ladder-symmetric background leads to non-zero static scalar TLNs. This establishes Ladder symmetry as a necessary, as well as sufficient condition, for the vanishing of static TLNs in static, spherically symmetric black holes and in rotating black holes of the KRZ class.</description>

      <title>Finite-rank conformal quantum mechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06501v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the simplest example of the landscape of conformal field theories: one-dimensional CFTs with finite-dimensional state space. Following the definition of quantum field theory given by G. Segal, we formulate the condition under which a one-dimensional QFT (quantum mechanics) possesses conformal symmetry, and we give a complete classification of conformal Hamiltonians with finite rank. It turns out that correlation functions in such theories are polynomial functions of the underlying geometric data. Moreover, the one-dimensional conformal Ward identities determine their scaling behavior, so that the correlators of the conformal observables are, in fact, homogeneous polynomials.</description>

      <title>The Nontrivial Vacuum Structure of an Extended $t\bar{t}$ BEH (Higgs) Bound State</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16527v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recent reformulation of top-quark condensation for the Brout-Englert-Higgs boson we introduced an extended internal wave-function, $\phi(r)$. We show how this leads to a manifestly Lorentz invariant formalism, where the absence of ``relative time'' is a gauge invariance of the bilocal field theory. This dictates a novel and nontrivial Lorentz invariant vacuum structure for the BEH boson, the relativistic generalization of a condensed matter state analogous to a BCS condensate.</description>

      <title>Entropy of matter on the Carroll geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20304v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two prescriptions for the construction of Carroll geometries, the expansion of geometric variables near horizon and the expansion of metric with zero limit of the expansion parameter $c$ (speed of light in vacuum), are known to complement each other. The entropy of an ideal gas, confined in a box and kept very close to the horizon, depends on the transverse area of the container. We show this by using the Carroll geometry constructed through the expansion of the metric and then taking the zero limit of the expansion parameter $c$. Therefore, the present analysis assures the complementing nature of two ways of finding the Carroll geometry from the thermodynamical point of view.</description>

      <title>Functional Determinants for Constrained Path Integrals in Minisuperspace Jackiw-Teitelboim Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21549v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed evaluation of constrained minisuperspace path integrals in Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity and in biaxial Bianchi IX quantum cosmology, employing the Gelfand-Yaglom theorem to compute the relevant functional determinants. In both settings, integrating out the dilaton or a minisuperspace variable produces a functional delta that enforces the classical constraint equation, thereby localizing the remaining path integral onto classical configurations. The associated Jacobian, equivalently, the functional determinant of the operator obtained by linearizing the constraint about the classical solution, fixes the semiclassical prefactor and the correct measure. We evaluate this determinant exactly via the Gelfand-Yaglom method and obtain the fully normalized fixed-lapse propagators. We further extend the JT analysis to a quadratic dilaton potential $U(\phi)=m^{2}\phi^{2}$ and comment on the corresponding saddle-point structure of the lapse integral. Finally, we apply the same approach to Bianchi IX quantum cosmology and derive the fixed-lapse propagator, including its prefactor. Our results provide a systematic and broadly applicable prescription for treating constraint structures in gravitational path integrals using functional determinant techniques, with potential applications to a wider class of minisuperspace quantum cosmology and quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Generalized cluster states in 2+1d: non-invertible symmetries, interfaces, and parameterized families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08615v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct 2+1-dimensional lattice models of symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases with non-invertible symmetries and investigate their properties using tensor networks. These models, which we refer to as generalized cluster models, are constructed by gauging a subgroup symmetry $H \subset G$ in models with a finite group 0-form symmetry $G$. By construction, these models have a non-invertible symmetry described by the group-theoretical fusion 2-category $\mathcal{C}(G; H)$. After identifying the tensor network representations of the symmetry operators, we study the symmetry acting on the interface between two generalized cluster states. In particular, we will see that the symmetry at the interface is described by a multifusion category known as the strip 2-algebra. By studying possible interface modes allowed by this symmetry, we show that the interface between generalized cluster states in different SPT phases must be degenerate. This result generalizes the ordinary bulk-boundary correspondence. Furthermore, we construct parameterized families of generalized cluster states and study the topological charge pumping phenomena, known as the generalized Thouless pump. We exemplify our construction with several concrete cases, and compare them with known phases, such as SPT phases with $2\mathrm{Rep}((\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{[1]}\times\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{[1]})\rtimes\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{[0]})$ symmetry.</description>

      <title>Elliptic Ruijsenaars-Toda and elliptic Toda chains: classical r-matrix structure and relation to XYZ chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08143v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the classical elliptic Toda chain introduced by Krichever and the elliptic Ruijsenaars-Toda chain introduced by Adler, Shabat and Suris. It is shown that these models can be obtained as particular cases of the elliptic Ruijsenaars chain. We explain how the classical $r$-matrix structures are derived for these chains. Also, as a by-product, we prove that the elliptic Ruijsenaars-Toda chain is gauge equivalent to discrete Landau-Lifshitz model of XYZ type. The elliptic Toda chain is also gauge equivalent to XYZ chain with special values of the Casimir functions at each site.</description>

      <title>Statistical isotropy of the universe and the look-elsewhere effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10178v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Jones et al. [arXiv:2310.12859] claimed strong evidence for the statistical anisotropy of the universe. The claim is based on a joint analysis of four different anomaly tests of the cosmic microwave background data, each of which is known to be anomalous, with a lower level of significance. They reported a combined $p$-value of about $3\times 10^{-8}$, which is more than a $5\sigma$ level of significance. We observe that statistical anisotropy is not even relevant for two of the four considered tests, which seems sufficient to invalidate the authors' claim. Furthermore, even if one reinterprets the claim as evidence against $\Lambda$CDM rather than statistical anisotropy, we argue that this result significantly suffers from the look-elsewhere effect. Assuming a set of independent (i.e., uncorrelated) tests, we show that if the four tests with the smallest $p$-values are cherry-picked from 10 independent tests, the $p$-value reported by Jones et al. corresponds to only $3\sigma$ significance. If there are 27 independent tests, the significance falls to $2\sigma$. These numbers, however, overstate our argument, since the four tests used by Jones et al. are slightly correlated. Determining the correlation of Jones et al.'s tests by comparing their joint $p$-value with the product of the four separate $p$-values, we find that about 16 or 50 tests are sufficient to reduce the significance of Jones et al.'s results to 3$\sigma$ or 2$\sigma$ significance, respectively. We also provide a list of anomaly tests discussed in the literature (and propose a few generalizations), suggesting that very plausibly 16 (or even 50) independent tests have been published, and possibly many more have been considered but not published. We conclude that the current data is consistent with the $\Lambda$CDM model and, in particular, with statistical isotropy.</description>

      <title>Remarks on non-invertible symmetries on a tensor product Hilbert space in 1+1 dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12053v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an index of non-invertible symmetry operators in 1+1 dimensions and discuss its relation to the realizability of non-invertible symmetries on the tensor product of finite dimensional on-site Hilbert spaces on the lattice. Our index generalizes the Gross-Nesme-Vogts-Werner index of invertible symmetry operators represented by quantum cellular automata (QCAs). Assuming that all fusion channels of symmetry operators have the same index, we show that the fusion rules of finitely many symmetry operators on a tensor product Hilbert space can agree, up to QCAs, only with those of weakly integral fusion categories. We also discuss an attempt to establish an index theory for non-invertible symmetries within the framework of tensor networks. To this end, we first propose a general class of matrix product operators (MPOs) that describe non-invertible symmetries on a tensor product Hilbert space. These MPOs, which we refer to as topological injective MPOs, include all invertible symmetries, non-anomalous fusion category symmetries, and the Kramers-Wannier symmetries for finite abelian groups. For topological injective MPOs, we construct the defect Hilbert spaces and the corresponding sequential quantum circuit representations. We also show that all fusion channels of topological injective MPOs have the same index if there exist fusion and splitting tensors that satisfy appropriate conditions. The existence of such fusion and splitting tensors has not been proven in general, although we construct them explicitly for all examples of topological injective MPOs listed above.</description>
