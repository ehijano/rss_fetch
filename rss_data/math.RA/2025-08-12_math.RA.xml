      <title>On the dimension of affine subspaces of nilpotent matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The focus of the paper is on the maximal dimension of affine subspaces of nilpotent $n \times n $ matrices with fixed rank. In particular we obtain two results in the "border" cases rank equal to $n-1$ and rank equal to $1$.</description>

      <title>On Rings with the 2-UNJ Property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new class of rings calling them {\it 2-UNJ rings}, which generalize the well-known 2-UJ, 2-UU and UNJ rings. Specifically, a ring $R$ is called 2-UNJ if, for every unit $u$ of $R$, the inclusion $u^2 \in 1 + Nil(R) + J(R)$ holds, where $Nil(R)$ is the set of nilpotent elements and $J(R)$ is the Jacobson radical of $R$. We show that every 2-UJ, 2-UU or UNJ ring is 2-UNJ, but the converse does {\it not} necessarily hold, and we also provide counter-examples to demonstrate this explicitly. We, moreover, investigate the connections between these rings and other algebraic properties such as being potent, tripotent, regular and exchange rings, respectively. In particular, we thoroughly study some natural extensions, like matrix rings and Morita contexts, obtaining new characterizations that were not addressed in previous works. Furthermore, we establish conditions under which group rings satisfy the 2-UNJ property. These results not only provide a better understanding of the structure of 2-UNJ rings, but also pave the way for future intensive research in this area.</description>

      <title>Deformations theory and minimal model of operads for Nijenhuis algebras morphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nijenhuis operators are very useful in the deformation theory of algebras. In this paper, we introduce a new cohomology theory related to deformation of Nijenhuis algebra morphisms, this notion involves simultaneous deformation of two Nijenhuis algebras and a morphism between them. As a consequence, we define a cohomology theory of Nijenhuis algebra morphisms to interpret the lower degree cohomology groups as formal deformation. We also prove a cohomology comparison Theorem of Nijenhuis algebra morphisms, i.e. the cohomology of a morphism of Nijenhuis algebras is isomorphic to the cohomology of an auxiliary Nijenhuis algebra. Finally, we construct a minimal model for the operad governing Nijenhuis algebras morphisms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify all Mal'cev clones over a three-element set up to minion homomorphisms. This is another step toward the complete classification of three-element relational structures up to pp-constructability. We furthermore provide an alternative proof of Bulatov's result that all Mal'cev clones over a three-element set have an at most 4-ary relational basis.</description>

      <title>Semilinear spaces of matrices with transitivity, rank or spectral constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{D}$ be a division ring with finite degree over a central subfield $\mathbb{F}$. Under mild cardinality assumptions on $\mathbb{F}$, we determine the greatest possible dimension for an $\mathbb{F}$-linear subspace of $M_n(\mathbb{D})$ in which no matrix has a nonzero fixed vector, and we elucidate the structure of the spaces that have the greatest dimension. The classification involves the associative composition algebras over $\mathbb{F}$ and requires the study of intransitive spaces of operators between finite-dimensional vector spaces. These results are applied to solve various problems of the same flavor, including the determination of the greatest possible dimension for an $\mathbb{F}$-affine subspace of $M_{n,p}(\mathbb{D})$ in which all the matrices have rank at least $r$ (for some fixed $r$), as well as the structure of the spaces that have the greatest possible dimension if $n=p=r$; and finally the structure of large $\mathbb{F}$-linear subspaces of $\mathbb{F}$-diagonalisable matrices is elucidated.</description>

      <title>Jordan homomorphisms and T-ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A$ and $B$ be associative algebras over a field $F$ with {\rm char}$(F)\ne 2$. Our first main result states that if $A$ is unital and equal to its commutator ideal, then every Jordan epimorphism $\varphi:A\to B$ is the sum of a homomorphism and an antihomomorphism. Our second main result concerns (not necessarily surjective) Jordan homomorphisms from $H(A,*)$ to $B$, where $*$ is an involution on $A$ and $H(A,*)=\{a\in A\,|\, a^*=a\}$. We show that there exists a ${\rm T}$-ideal $G$ having the following two properties: (1) the Jordan homomorphism $\varphi:H(G(A),*)\to B$ can be extended to an (associative) homomorphism, subject to the condition that the subalgebra generated by $\varphi(H(A,*))$ has trivial annihilator, and (2) every element of the ${\rm T}$-ideal of identities of the algebra of $2\times 2$ matrices is nilpotent modulo $G$. A similar statement is true for Jordan homomorphisms from $A$ to $B$. A counter-example shows that the assumption on trivial annihilator cannot be removed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A division ring $D$ is Amitsur-Small if for every $n$ and every maximal left ideal $I$ in $D[x_1,\dots,x_n]$, $I \cap D[x_1,\dots,x_{n-1}]$ is maximal in $D[x_1,\dots,x_{n-1}]$. The goal of this note is to prove that cyclic division algebras of odd prime degree over their center are never Amitsur-Small.</description>

      <title>On $(\delta,f)$-derivations and Jordan $(\delta,f)$-derivations on modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a ring with identity, $M,N$ right modules over $R$. An additive mapping $\delta$ from $R$ to $R$ is called derivation on ring $R$ if it satisfies the Leibniz condition. If $\delta$ is a derivation on $R$ and $f:M \rightarrow N$ is a module homomorphism over $R$, then an additive mapping $d:M \rightarrow N$ is called a $(\delta,f)$-derivation if it satisfies $d(xa)=d(x)a+f(x)\delta(a)$ for all $x \in M$ and $a \in R$. An additive mapping $\delta: R \rightarrow R$ is called Jordan derivation on ring $R$ if $\delta(x^2)=\delta(x)x+x\delta(x)$ for all $x \in R$, which is the generalization of derivation This paper presents generalization of Posner's First Theorem of $(\delta,f)$-derivation on $2$-torsion prime modules. It also provides a generalization of some results in case of $2$-torsion free prime modules from ring situation. Moreover, we introduce a Jordan $(\delta,f)$-derivation on modules and prove that every Jordan $(\delta,f)$-derivation on modules is a $(\delta,f)$-derivation on modules.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given $d_1,\ldots,d_k$ in the field $F$, there is a weighted trace function $F^k\rightarrow F$ given by $tr(x_1,\ldots,x_k)=\sum d_ix_i$. We prove that $F^k$ satisfies trace identities of the forms $\alpha(d_1,\ldots,d_k) x^N=$ a linear combination of terms with lower powers of $x$; and $tr(y_1)\cdots tr(y_n)=$ a linear combination of terms with fewer traces. The approach uses specialized symmetric functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the $\frac{1}{3}$-derivations and transposed Poisson structures of the Nambu 3-Lie algebras $A_\omega^\delta $ and $ A_{f,k} $. Specifically, we first present that $A_\omega^\delta $ is finitely generated and graded. Then we find that $A_\omega^\delta $ has non-trivial $\frac{1}{3}$-derivations and admits only trivial transposed Poisson structures. The 3-Lie algebra $A_{f,k}$ admits non-trivial transposed Poisson structures.</description>

      <title>Cholesky decomposition for symmetric matrices over finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04657v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the seminal work of Andr\'e-Louis Cholesky -- whose contributions remain crucial in broader sciences even after more than a century -- Cooper, Hanna and Whitlatch (2024) developed a theory of positive matrices over finite fields, and Khare and Vishwakarma (2025) described a general Cholesky factorization for a dense sub-family of the cone of Hermitian matrices over real/complex fields, whose leading principal minors (LPM) are nonzero. Building on this, we develop a parallel theory within the finite field setting. Specifically $(i)$ we extend the general Cholesky factorization to the LPM cone over finite fields which has asymptotic density $1$. We show that $(ii)$ this factorization is compatible with the entrywise Frobenius map, recently studied in the context of positivity preservers by Guillot, Gupta, Vishwakarma, and Yip [J. Algebra, 2025]. We also $(iii)$ leverage the Cholesky-structures to define meaningful group operations on the matrix cone, and as an application $(iv)$ enumerate sub-cones of LPM matrices using our general Cholesky factorizations.</description>

      <title>When isometry and equivalence for skew constacyclic codes coincide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the notions of $(n,\sigma)$-isometry and $(n,\sigma)$-equivalence introduced by Ou-azzou et al coincide for most skew $(\sigma,a)$-constacyclic codes of length $n$. To prove this, we show that all Hamming-weight-preserving homomorphisms between their ambient algebras must have degree one when those algebras are nonassociative. We work in the general setting of commutative base rings $S$. As a consequence, we propose new definitions of equivalence and isometry of skew constacyclic codes that exactly capture all Hamming-preserving isomorphisms, and lead to tighter classifications. In the process we determine homomorphisms between nonassociative Petit algebras, prioritizing the algebras $S[t;\sigma]/S[t;\sigma](t^n-a)$, which give rise to skew constacyclic codes.</description>

      <title>Duality on group algebras over finite chain rings: applications to additive group codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a finite group $G$ and an extension of finite chain rings $S|R$, one can consider the group rings $\mathscr{S} = S[G]$ and $\mathscr{R} = R[G]$. The group ring $\mathscr{S}$ can be viewed as an $R$-bimodule, and any of its $R$-submodules naturally inherits an $R$-bimodule structure; in the framework of coding theory, these are called \emph{additive group codes}, more precisely a (left) additive group code of is a linear code which is the image of a (left) ideal of a group algebra via an isomorphism which maps $G$ to the standard basis of $S^n$, where $n=|G|$. In the first part of the paper, the ring extension $S|R$ is studied, and several $R$-module isomorphisms are established for decomposing group rings, thereby providing a characterization of the structure of additive group codes. In the second part, we construct a symmetric, nondegenerate trace-Euclidean inner product on $\mathscr{S}$. Two additive group codes $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{D}$ form an \emph{additive complementary pair} (ACP) if $\mathcal{C} + \mathcal{D} = \mathscr{S}$ and $\mathcal{C} \cap \mathcal{D} = \{0\}$. For two-sided ACPs, we prove that the orthogonal complement of one code under the trace-Euclidean duality is precisely the image of the other under an involutive anti-automorphism of $\mathscr{S}$, linking coding-theoretical ACPs with module orthogonal direct-sum decompositions, representation theory, and the structure of group algebras over finite chain rings.</description>

      <title>Quantum Metric Structures on Iwahori-Hecke Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Iwahori-Hecke algebras are $q$-deformations of group algebras of Coxeter groups. In this article, we initiate a systematic study of quantum metric structures on Iwahori-Hecke algebras by establishing that, for finite rank right-angled Coxeter systems, the canonical filtrations of the corresponding Iwahori-Hecke algebras satisfy the Haagerup-type condition introduced by Ozawa and Rieffel if and only if the Coxeter diagram's complement contains no induced squares. As a consequence, these algebras naturally inherit compact quantum metric space structures in the sense of Rieffel. Additionally, we investigate continuity phenomena in this framework by demonstrating that, as the deformation parameter $q$ approaches $1$, the deformed Iwahori-Hecke algebras converge to the group algebra of the Coxeter group in Latr\'emoli\`ere's quantum Gromov-Hausdorff propinquity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A description of finitely generated left nilpotent braces of class at most two is presented in this paper. The description heavily depends on the fact that if $B$ is left nilpotent of class at most $2$, that is $B^3 = 0$, then $B$ is right nilpotent of class at most $3$, that is $B^{(4)} = 0$. In addition, we construct a free object in the category of finitely generated left nilpotent braces of class at most $2$.</description>

      <title>Holonomy of the Obata connection on 2-step hypercomplex nilmanifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the holonomy of the Obata connection on 2-step hypercomplex nilmanifolds. By explicitly computing the curvature tensor, we determine the conditions under which the Obata connection is flat, showing that this depends on the nilpotency step of each complex structure. In particular, we show that the holonomy algebra of the Obata connection is always an abelian subalgebra of $\mathfrak{sl}(n, \mathbb{H})$: to establish this, we prove the $\mathbb{H}$-solvable conjecture for 2-step hypercomplex nilmanifolds. Furthermore, we provide new examples of $k$-step nilpotent hypercomplex nilmanifolds, with arbitrary $k$, which are not Obata flat.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07021v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any CDG-ring $B^\bullet=(B^*,d,h)$, we show that the homotopy category of graded-projective (left) CDG-modules over $B^\bullet$ is equivalent to the quotient category of the homotopy category of graded-flat CDG-modules by its full triangulated subcategory of flat CDG-modules. The contraderived category (in the sense of Becker) $\mathsf D^{\mathsf{bctr}}(B^\bullet{-}\mathbf{Mod})$ is the common name for these two triangulated categories. We also prove that the classes of cotorsion and graded-cotorsion CDG-modules coincide, and the contraderived category of CDG-modules is equivalent to the homotopy category of graded-flat graded-cotorsion CDG-modules. Assuming the graded ring $B^*$ to be graded right coherent, we show that the contraderived category $\mathsf D^{\mathsf{bctr}}(B^\bullet{-}\mathbf{Mod})$ is compactly generated and its full subcategory of compact objects is anti-equivalent to the full subcategory of compact objects in the coderived category of right CDG-modules $\mathsf D^{\mathsf{bco}}(\mathbf{Mod}{-}B^\bullet)$. Specifically, the latter triangulated category is the idempotent completion of the absolute derived category of finitely presented right CDG-modules $\mathsf D^{\mathsf{abs}}(\mathbf{mod}{-}B^\bullet)$.</description>

      <title>Automorphisms of free metabelian Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that every automorphism of a free metabelian Lie algebra $M_n$ of rank $n\geq 4$ over an arbitrary field $K$ is almost tame, that is, it is a product of so-called Chein automorphisms (or one-row transformations). Moreover, we show that the group of all automorphisms $\mathrm{Aut}(M_n)$ of $M_n$ of rank $n\geq 4$ over a field $K$ of characteristic $\neq 3$ is generated by all linear automorphisms, as well as one quadratic and one cubic automorphism. The same result holds for fields of any characteristic if $n\geq 5$.
  We also show that all Chein automorphisms of lower degree $\geq 4$ and all exponential automorphisms of lower degree $\geq 5$ are tame, which contradicts the results of \cite{BN,OE}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper is devoted to the classification problem of associative algebras over any base field. We provide a list of three-dimensional associative algebras with canonical representatives of the isomorphism classes over a base field of the characteristic is not two and three. Comparisons of our lists with the most recent lists over the field of complex number in dimensions three, with some comments, are given.</description>

      <title>On the classification of centralizers of ODOs: An effective differential algebra approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03429v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The correspondence between commutative rings of ordinary differential operators and algebraic curves has been extensively and deeply studied since the seminal works of Burchnall-Chaundy in 1923. This paper is an overview of recent developments to make this correspondence computationally effective, by means of differential algebra and symbolic computation.
  The centralizer of an ordinary differential operator $L$ is a maximal commutative ring, the affine ring of a spectral curve $\Gamma$. The defining ideal of $\Gamma$ is described, assuming that a finite set of generators of the centralizer is known. In addition, the factorization problem of $L-\lambda$ over a new coefficient field, defined by the coefficient field of $L$ and $\Gamma$, allows the computation of spectral sheaves on $\Gamma$. The ultimate goal is to develop Picard-Vessiot theory for spectral problems $L(y)=\lambda y$, for a generic $\lambda$.</description>

      <title>Finite-dimensional Jacobian algebras: Finiteness and tameness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04570v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finite-dimensional Jacobian algebras are studied from the perspective of representation types. We establish that (like other representation types) the notions of $E$-finiteness and $E$-tameness are invariant under mutations of quivers with potentials. Consequently, by applying our results on laminations on marked surfaces, and the results of Plamondon and the second author, we classify $E$-finite and $E$-tame finite-dimensional Jacobian algebras. More precisely, we demonstrate that (resp., except for a few cases,) a finite-dimensional Jacobian algebra $\mathcal{J}(Q,W)$ is $E$-finite (resp., $E$-tame) if and only if it is $\operatorname{g}$-finite (resp., $\operatorname{g}$-tame), if and only if it is representation-finite (resp., representation-tame), and this holds exactly when $Q$ is of Dynkin type (resp., finite mutation type), as shown by Geiss, Labardini and Schr\"{o}er.
  Futhermore, we provide an application of our results in the theory of cluster algebras. More precisely, the converse of Reading's theorem is established: if the $\operatorname{g}$-fan of the cluster algebra associated with a connected quiver $Q$ is complete, then $Q$ must be of Dynkin type.</description>
