      <title>Development of new ultra-low-background particle detectors based on Micromegas technology for the search of Dark Matter at the low-mass frontier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) are one of the best motivated candidates to compose the Dark Matter of the Universe. The lack of experimental confirmation by direct detection experiments or collider searches has ruled out canonical WIMP scenarios (masses $\sim$ GeV-TeV), making a case for the largely unexplored sub-GeV frontier. This PhD thesis is focused on the evolution and latest developments of TREX-DM, a gaseous Time Projection Chamber (TPC) designed to detect low-mass WIMPs through their low-energy nuclear recoils. TREX-DM is equipped with microbulk Micromegas readout planes, a technology well-suited for rare event searches due to its intrinsic radiopurity, potential for low energy thresholds and background discrimination capabilities through 3D event reconstruction.
  A central focus of the thesis is background reduction in TREX-DM: through 222Rn mitigation and surface contamination control, background levels have been reduced from $\sim$ 1000 to 80-100 dru. Surface contamination, primarily from 222Rn progeny, has prompted the development of novel screening tools such as AlphaCAMM, a high-sensitivity surface contamination detector.
  The most significant result is the implementation of a Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) pre-amplification stage on top of the microbulk Micromegas detectors. This yields extra gain factors up to $\sim$ 100, substantially reducing the energy threshold. A calibration with a 37Ar source (low-energy peaks at 0.27 keV and 2.82 keV) validated this reduction, demonstrating energy thresholds at the level of single-ionisation energies (26 eV in argon).
  Future improvements target further background reduction through a modified cathode design, enhanced detector stability via a more robust field cage, and gas mixture optimisation to enhance sensitivity to low-energy nuclear recoils.</description>

      <title>COSINUS -- a model-independent challenge of the DAMA/LIBRA dark matter claim with cryogenic NaI detectors operated in a new low-background facility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-temperature detectors are a powerful technology for dark matter search, offering excellent energy resolution and low energy thresholds. COSINUS is the only experiment that combines scintillating sodium iodide (NaI) crystals with an additional phonon readout at cryogenic temperatures, using superconducting sensors (remoTES), alongside the conventional scintillation light signal. Via the simultaneous phonon and scintillation light detection, a unique event-by-event particle identification is enabled. This dual-channel approach allows for a model-independent cross-check of the long-standing DAMA/LIBRA signal with a moderate exposure of a few hundred kg d, while completely avoiding key systematic uncertainties inherent to scintillation-only NaI-based searches. COSINUS built and commissioned a dedicated low-background cryogenic facility at the LNGS underground laboratories. Data taking with eight NaI detector modules (COSINUS1$\pi$ Run1) is planned to begin in late 2025.</description>

      <title>Optimisation of amplification and gas mixture for directional Dark Matter searches with the CYGNO/INITIUM project</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astrophysical and cosmological observations suggest the existence of beyond standard model ingredient known as dark matter (DM). One of the most supported class of theories suggests that DM is composed of weakly interactive massive particles (WIMPs), possibly detectable via weak interaction with standard matter resulting in the recoil of the latter. The motion of the Sun and Earth with respect to the Galactic Centre is expected to induce a strong directional dependence in the recoil spectrum. Direct detection experiments capable of measuring the angular features of the recoils gain access to a wide range of advantages such as the possibility to positively claim a discovery of DM. The CYGNO project sets into this context, with the aim of deploying a large directional detector for rare event searches as DM. It exploits a gaseous time projection chamber filled with a He:CF4 gas mixture with a segmented amplification stage and granular optical readout. In this thesis, it is presented the work carried out with small CYGNO prototypes to maximise the light yield without degrading spatial and energy resolution, the addition of highly electronegative gases to induce a reduction of the electron cloud diffusion while drifting towards the amplification stage, very relevant to precisely measure the topological information of the recoil tracks. Moreover, the potential performances of directional detectors in the context of a direct DM search are analysed with the use of rigorous statistical tools both in the improvement in setting limits in the WIMP to nucleon sensitivity and in the capability of discerning two different DM models exploiting a directional detector.</description>

      <title>ML-based muon identification using a FNAL-NICADD scintillator chamber for the MID subsystem of ALICE 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ALICE Collaboration is planning to construct a new detector (ALICE 3) aiming at exploiting the potential of the high-luminosity Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The new detector will allow ALICE to participate in LHC Run 5 scheduled from 2036 to 2041. The muon-identifier subsystem (MID) is part of the ALICE 3 reference detector layout. The MID will consist of a standard magnetic iron absorber ($\approx4$ nuclear interaction lengths) followed by muon chambers. The baseline option for the MID chambers considers plastic scintillation bars equipped with wave-length shifting fibers and readout with silicon photomultipliers. This paper reports on the performance of a MID chamber prototype using 3 GeV/$c$ pion- and muon-enriched beams delivered by the CERN Proton Synchrotron (PS). The prototype was built using extruded plastic scintillator produced by FNAL-NICADD (Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory - Northern Illinois Center for Accelerator and Detector Development). The prototype was experimentally evaluated using varying absorber thicknesses (60, 70, 80, 90, and 100 cm) to assess its performance. The analysis was performed using Machine Learning techniques and the performance was validated with GEANT 4 simulations. Potential improvements in both hardware and data analysis are discussed.</description>

      <title>Probing Earth's core using atmospheric neutrino oscillations with NSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutrinos can serve as a complementary and independent tool to gravitational and seismic studies in exploring the interior of Earth, thanks to their unique properties: extremely low interaction cross sections and flavor oscillations. With the precise measurements of neutrino oscillation parameters and observation of the non-zero value of mixing angle $\theta_{13}$, it has become feasible to detect the forward scattering of GeV-energy atmospheric neutrinos passing through Earth with ambient electrons in the form of matter effects on neutrino oscillation probabilities. These matter effects depend on both the neutrino energy and electron density distribution along their path, making them ideally suited for exploring the inner structure of Earth. Furthermore, in the presence of non-standard interactions (NSI) of neutrinos with matter, oscillation patterns undergo additional modifications. In this study, we quantify the capability of an atmospheric neutrino experiment, such as a magnetized iron calorimeter detector, to validate the Earth's core and measure the position of the core-mantle boundary in the presence of NSI. We perform this study considering a three-layered density profile of Earth. Our analysis demonstrates that neutrino non-standard interactions impact these Earth tomography measurements in comparison to standard interactions.</description>

      <title>Experimental demonstration of the clock asynchrony model in space-borne gravitational wave detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Space-borne gravitational wave detection will open the observation window in the 0.1 mHz$-$1 Hz bandwidth, playing a crucial role in the development of cosmology and physics. Precise clock synchronization among satellites is essential for the accurate detection of gravitational wave signals. However, the independent clock counting mechanisms of each satellite pose a significant challenge. This work reports the mathematical model of clock asynchrony, which is mainly dominated by the constant term factor and the linear term factor. Moreover, it experimentally verifies the clock asynchronization technique based on a dual-phasemeter system. Through experimentation, the impacts of these two aspects of clock asynchrony were confirmed, and post-processing techniques were employed to reduce these impacts to as low as $\rm 2\pi \times 10^{-6} rad/Hz^{1/2}@ 3mHz$. Specifically, the constant term factor is measured by Time-delay Interferometry Ranging (TDIR), while the linear term factor can be gauged by clock transmission link. This study provides a reference for understanding the clock asynchrony mechanism and processing clock synchronization issues. Additionally, a low additional noise clock synchronization test system is introduced to support such measurements.</description>

      <title>Particle production and identification for the T10 secondary beamline of the CERN East Area</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The particle composition of the T10 beam line in the renovated East Hall at CERN has been measured using several experimental techniques and detectors: pressure scans on a threshold Cherenkov counter, a lead-glass calorimeter, time-of-flight, and finally using two separate threshold Cherenkov counters. For the pressure scans, at a given beam momentum, the count rate in the Cherenkov counters is measured as a function of pressure in the counter. The count rate normalized to the rate of beam particles allows computation of the fraction of a specific particle type in the beam. For the method using two threshold Cherenkov counters, one set above and one set below the threshold for the particle species to be identified, with the difference relative to a beam trigger giving the particle fraction for that species. The measurement was proposed in the context of the ``Beamline For Schools'' competition by team Particular Perspective and carried out in 2023. This data was expanded with pressure scans in 2023 and 2025. Overlapping data is compared, leading to a comprehensive overview of the particle content of the T10 beam.</description>

      <title>Calibration of a $\Delta$E-E telescope based on CeBr$_3$ scintillator for secondary charged particles measurements in hadron therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05050v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hadrontherapy is an established cancer treatment method that enables a more localized dose deposition compared to conventional radiotherapy, potentially reducing the dose to surrounding healthy tissues in certain clinical cases. However, a key limitation in current treatment planning lies in the limited experimental data available for the characterization of secondary particles generated by nuclear interactions of the primary beam with tissues, which directly impacts the accuracy of Monte Carlo tools and analytical models used in dose calculations. Indeed, this leads to the adoption of larger safety margins and can limit the use of hadrontherapy for treating certain complex or sensitive tumor locations.
  This work is part of the context of the characterization of secondary charged particles generated by ion beams in the energy range relevant for particle therapy applications, using a $\Delta E-E$ telescope comprising a CeBr$_3$ crystal scintillator and a plastic scintillator. The calibration and response of this telescope to ions commonly used in clinical settings is presented in this work, highlighting adherence to Birks' law for accurate energy measurements.
  This study is the first to optimize a $\Delta E-E$ telescope combining CeBr$_3$ and plastic scintillators specifically for secondary particle detection in hadrontherapy. It represents an essential step toward the experimental acquisition of nuclear data, enabling accurate measurement and identification of secondary charged particles generated by therapeutic beams in tissue-equivalent materials. The system is designed for use in controlled experimental setups that reproduce clinical conditions, with the goal of improving the predictive accuracy of treatment planning software through enhanced Monte Carlo simulation inputs.</description>

      <title>Assembly, testing, and installation of mPMT photosensor for the Water Cherenkov Test Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07216v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The multi-Photomultiplier Tube (mPMT) photosensors will be used in the Water Cherenkov Test Experiment (WCTE) to efficiently detect the photons produced in the whole detector. One of the aims behind the development of WCTE is to test the technology and implement it in future water Cherenkov experiments such as the Hyper-Kamiokande experiment and its Intermediate Water Cherenkov Detector. Each mPMT is built using nineteen 3-inch PMTs arranged on a semi-spherical support matrix. In this paper, we describe the design and manufacture of the mechanical components, the procedures for casting an optical gel between PMTs and acrylic cover, and the overall assembly procedure of the mPMTs. Details of the electronics used in the mPMT modules are not included in this paper and will be presented in a separate publication. We also report on the R&amp;D performed on the selection of the optical gel ratio along with transmittance measurements and the reflectance measurements performed on the aluminium reflector. We also present the optical tests performed on the mPMT module using a 405 nm LED and the resulting increase in the effective photosensitive area by surrounding the PMTs with a reflector. A summary of the production and installation of the mPMTs for the WCTE is also presented in this paper.</description>
