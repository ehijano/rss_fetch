      <title>Simulating cosmic ray electron spectra and radio emission from an AGN jet outburst in a cool-core cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active galactic nucleus (AGN) powered jets can accelerate cosmic ray electrons, leading to the observed radio synchrotron emission. To simulate this emission, jet dynamics in galaxy clusters must be coupled to electron spectral modelling. We run magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of a single AGN jet outburst in a Perseus-like galaxy cluster and adopt a sub-grid model for the acceleration of cosmic ray protons and electrons at unresolved internal shocks in the jet. We evolve cosmic ray electron spectra along Lagrangian trajectories using the Fokker-Planck solver Crest and compute the non-thermal emission using Crayon+. The resulting total electron spectrum reaches a steady-state slope at high momenta, with a gradually decreasing normalization over time, while the lower-momentum portion continues to resemble a freely cooling spectrum. The interaction of the jets with the turbulent cluster environment inflates lobes which rise buoyantly, induce amplification of the magnetic fields and uplift old cosmic ray populations in the wake of the bubbles. We connect radio spectral indices to electron injection ages: at a given radio frequency, weaker magnetic fields are illuminated by higher momenta electrons, whose age is determined by the last injection event. On the other hand, stronger magnetic fields are illuminated by lower momenta electrons, whose age is determined by the maximum energy injection event in the past. This powerful approach allows us to relate the underlying MHD properties to electron spectra and the resulting radio synchrotron emission, thereby enabling us to infer the underlying physics from observed radio properties.</description>

      <title>The impact of ram pressure on the radio spectral index and magnetic field of NGC 4522: A high-resolution VLA continuum study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present high-resolution Very Large Array (VLA) continuum observations at S-band ($3$ GHz, $560$ pc scale) and X-band ($10$ GHz, $200$ pc scale) of the ram-pressure-stripped Virgo galaxy NGC 4522, to investigate the characteristics of its radio continuum, spectral index, and magnetic field under the influence of the intracluster medium (ICM). The total radio continuum shows an asymmetry that extends northwest, mirroring the HI gas distribution, but showing distinct features in the extraplanar regions. The spectral index steepens systematically from $\alpha\sim-0.6$ in the main disk to $\alpha\sim-1.1$ in the outer disk. We find that the spectral index behavior of the outer disk is mainly due to an ICM shock that can re-accelerate electrons and a significant reduction of thermal emission. Intriguingly, extraplanar clouds exhibit exceptionally flat spectral indices ($\alpha\sim-0.2$ to $0$), resulting from a combination of significantly enhanced thermal emission and pronounced spectral aging of the non-thermal component. Although some of these regions correlate with H$\alpha$, others do not. We propose that the mixing between the ICM and interstellar medium (ISM) is an alternative mechanism that enhances thermal emission independently of star formation. Polarized continuum emissions are highly asymmetric, preferentially distributed along the ICM wind side, and the polarization fraction increases radially outward from the galactic midplane, indicating that the polarized emission is strongly influenced by the ICM wind. Our results show how and where the ICM substantially affects the ISM, and also demonstrate that high-frequency observations are crucial for analyzing the radio continuum of ram pressure stripping galaxies.</description>

      <title>How To Use Thermal Dust Continuum Emission To Measure The Physical Properties Of Dusty Astrophysical Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dust grains in the interstellar medium interact with photons across the electromagnetic spectrum. They are generally photon energy converters, absorbing short wavelength radiation and emitting long wavelength radiation. Sixty years ago in 1965, thermal emission from dust grains in the interstellar medium was discovered. This tutorial is a summary of the physics of thermal dust continuum emission and how to use observations of the intensity and flux density of dusty objects to calculate physical properties such as mass, column density, luminosity, dust temperature, and dust opacity spectral index. Equations are derived, when feasible, from first principles with all limits and assumptions explicitly stated. Properties of dust opacities appropriate for different astrophysical environments (e.g. diffuse ISM, dense cores, protoplanetary disks) are discussed and tabulated for the wavelengths of past, current, and future bolometer cameras. Corrections for observations at high redshift as well as the effects of telescope measurement limitations are derived. We also update the calculation of the mean molecular weight in different ISM environments and find that it is 1.404 per H atom, 2.809 per H2 molecule, and 2.351 per gas particle assuming protosolar metallicity and the latest values of the ISM gas phase abundances of metals.</description>

      <title>CHILES XI: Resolved HI morphologies and the evolution of the H2/HI ratio over the last five billion years</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the neutral gas morphology of four galaxies from z = 0.22 to 0.47 obtained with the COSMOS HI Large Extragalactic Survey (CHILES). The HI is resolved at the highest redshift with the 7.5 arcsec beam of CHILES and 43 kpc linear scale, with all four galaxies having extended HI. Three are massive galaxies (Mstellar &gt; 3 e10 Mo), with HI masses of 1.6 - 6.7 e10 Mo, and active star formation (3 - 30 Mo/yr). The morphology and kinematics of the galaxies vary from regular to disturbed, including an asymmetric HI disk surrounding the fourth smaller galaxy (Mstellar ~ e9 Mo). CO(1-0) observations of the sample, obtained with the LMT, confirm the redshifts of three of the four galaxies and we derive H2 masses of 0.4 - 5.2 e10 Mo. JWST imaging with four combined NIRCam filters reveals disturbed stellar components with compact knots in two of the galaxies. We combine our new higher-redshift galaxies with previously published observations to conduct a more complete study of HI and H2 evolution in the redshift range 0 - 0.5. With our HI flux-limited observations compared to similar lower redshift galaxies with high stellar mass (Mstellar &gt; e10 Mo), the results show the mean H2/HI ratio at the highest redshift is 10.3 +- 3.4 larger than the mean H2/HI ratio in the local Universe.</description>

      <title>Searching for Galaxy Cluster-Scale Strong lenses from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy cluster-scale strong gravitational lensing systems are rare yet valuable tools for investigating the properties of dark matter and dark energy, as well as providing the opportunity to study the distant universe at flux levels and spatial resolutions that would otherwise be unavailable. Large-scale imaging surveys present unprecedented opportunities to expand the sample of cluster lenses. In this study, we adopt a deep learning-based approach to identify cluster lenses from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys, utilizing the catalog of galaxy cluster candidates identified by Zou et al. (2021). Our lens-finder employs a ResNet-18 architecture, trained with mock images of cluster lenses as positives and observational images of cluster scale non-lenses as negatives. We do an iterative operation to increase the completeness of our work, namely adding the found true positive samples back to the training set and training again for several times. Human inspection is conducted to further refine the candidates, categorizing them into grades (A, B, C) according to the significance of the strongly lensed arcs. Reviewing all 540,432 objects in Zou's catalog, we discover 485 high-confidence cluster lens candidates with a cluster $M_{500}$ range of $10^{13.67\sim14.97}M_{\odot}$ and a Brightest Central Galaxy (BCG) redshift range of $0.04\sim0.89$. After excluding the lens candidates listed in previous studies, we identify 247 newly discovered cluster lens candidates, including 16 grade A, 90 grade B, and 141 grade C. This catalog of cluster lens candidates is publicly available online, and follow-up observations are encouraged to confirm and conduct thorough investigations of these systems.</description>

      <title>Emission-line Diagnostics at $z\gtrsim 2$: A Probe of the Ionizing Spectrum and $\alpha$ Enhancement Beyond Cosmic Noon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze several key rest-optical emission-line ratios in a sample of 763 galaxies as well as composite spectra from JADES DR3 in the range $1.4 &lt; z &lt; 7$. These emission-line ratios include: [O III]$\lambda5008$/H$\beta$, [N II]$\lambda 6585$/H$\alpha$, [S II]$\lambda\lambda 6718,6733$/H$\alpha$, [O I]$\lambda 6302$/H$\alpha$, O32, R23, Ne3O2, and RO2Ne3. We find evidence for a harder ionizing spectrum at $z\sim 3.5$ compared to $z\sim 2$ at fixed gas-phase metallicity, resulting in a pronounced shift in the star-forming galaxy locus on the [N II]/H$\alpha$ BPT diagram and the O32 vs. R23 diagram. At $z\gtrsim 3.5$, star-forming galaxies occupy a common locus, indicating that ISM ionizing conditions at fixed gas-phase metallicity do not evolve strongly at these early cosmic times. There is a connection between ISM ionizing conditions and the chemical abundance patterns (i.e., $\alpha$/Fe) in massive stars providing the ionizing radiation field. Therefore, the lack of evolution in ISM ionizing conditions at $z\gtrsim 3.5$, followed by evolution towards a softer ionizing spectrum at fixed nebular metallicity as cosmic time proceeds to $z\sim 2$ and lower redshift mirrors the chemical abundance patterns in Milky Way stars as a function of iron abundance. Our results highlight the diagnostic power of emission-line diagrams in the era of JWST to further our understanding of the ISM conditions into the Epoch of Reionization.</description>

      <title>ALMA Polarization Study of the Magnetic Fields in Two Massive Clumps in the 20 km s$^{-1}$ Cloud of the Central Molecular Zone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of linearly polarized 870 $\mu$m continuum emission at a resolution of $\sim$0.2$^{\prime\prime}$ (2000 au) toward the two massive clumps, Clump 1 and Clump 4, in the 20 km s$^{-1}$ cloud. The derived magnetic field strengths for both clumps range from $\sim$0.3 to 3.1 mG using the Angular Dispersion Function (ADF) method. The magnetic field orientations across multiple scales suggests that the magnetic field dominates at the cloud scale, whereas gravity likely governs the structures at the core (0.01$-$0.1 pc) and condensation ($\le$ 0.01 pc) scales. Furthermore, the study on the angular difference between the orientations of the local gravity gradient and the magnetic field suggests that the magnetic field predominantly governs the dynamics in the diffuse regions, while gravity and star formation feedback become increasingly significant within the dense regions. The ratio of the magnetic field tension force $F_\textrm{B}$ to the gravitational force $F_\textrm{G}$ suggests that the magnetic field may provide some support against gravity, but it is insufficient to prevent gas from infalling toward the dense cores.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a gas-enshrouded broad-line AGN at z $\sim$ 7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lyman-alpha (Ly$\alpha$) absorption profile in star-forming galaxies serves as a powerful tracer of the extended, dense neutral hydrogen in their surroundings during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). We report a unique galaxy, A2744-z7DLA, at $z\approx 6.87$ gravitationally lensed by the foreground galaxy cluster Abell 2744, which exhibits both moderate Ly$\alpha$ emission and damped Ly$\alpha$ absorption, suggesting the presence of a dense neutral hydrogen environment. Our analysis suggests that the UV continuum turnover near Ly$\alpha$ is more likely shaped by a damped Ly$\alpha$ system rather than nebular continuum from two photon process. We analyze the physical properties of A2744-z7DLA with spectroscopic and photometric data from the JWST and the HST. The galaxy shows a compact morphology ($r_e \sim 0.3\ {\rm kpc}$) and a broadened H$\alpha$ emission line, suggesting possible AGN activity. The broad component of H$\alpha$ has a FWHM of $2721 \pm 200\ {\rm km\ s^{-1}}$, corresponding to a black hole mass of $M_{\rm BH}=2.90^{+2.35}_{-1.28}\times 10^7 M_\odot$ and a black hole-to-stellar mass ratio of $\log (M_{\rm BH}/M_{\rm stellar}) = -1.58^{+0.45}_{-0.34}$. The Balmer decrement ($\rm H\alpha/H\beta$) yields a dust attenuation of $\rm A_V \approx 1.15 \pm 0.23$, indicating that this system is less dust-rich than some "little red dots". Furthermore, we perform SED fitting using both stellar and AGN models. The results show that the UV and optical wavelengths are dominated by star-forming regions, while the AGN component contributes primarily at longer wavelengths. This work provides new insights into the interplay between star formation, neutral gas, and potential AGN activity in galaxies during the EoR.</description>

      <title>Molecular gas and star formation in central rings across nearby galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nearby galaxies exhibit a variety of structures, including central rings, similar to the MW Central Molecular Zone (CMZ). These rings are common in barred galaxies and can be gas-rich and highly star-forming. We aim to study molecular gas content and star formation rate of central rings within nearby galaxies and link them to global galaxy properties (e.g. bar morphology). We utilize $1\,$'' resolution CO(2-1) PHANGS-ALMA observations, visually identify 20 central rings and determine their properties. For $14$ rings, SFR surface density maps are available. We derive ring geometry, integrated molecular gas masses, SFRs, depletion times, and compare them to host galaxy and bar properties. Molecular gas is a good tracer for central rings: Previous studies used ionized gas and dust tracers to identify central rings in galaxies of similar morphological types as this study. In comparison, we find similar fractions of galaxies hosting central rings and similar radii distributions. The gaseous central rings have typical radii of $400_{-150}^{+250}\,$pc, molecular gas masses of $\log(M_\text{mol}/M_\odot){\sim}8.1_{-0.23}^{+0.17}$, and SFRs of $0.21_{-0.16}^{+0.15}\,M_\odot/\text{yr}$, thus contributing $5.6_{-2.1}^{+4.5}\,\%$ and $13_{-5}^{+10}\,\%$ to their host galaxies' molecular gas mass and SFR. The MW CMZ sits at the lower end of the radius, molecular gas mass, and SFR distribution, but it has a similar molecular gas mass and SFR fraction, and depletion time. Longer bars contain more massive molecular central rings, but we find no correlation between bar strength and the ring's molecular gas content. Although absolute central ring properties likely depend on host galaxy properties, the similarities between the MW CMZ and PHANGS central rings in relative parameters suggest that the processes of gas inflow and star formation are similar for central rings across nearby galaxies.</description>

      <title>Deep Submillimeter and Radio Observations in the SSA22 Field. IV. Spectral Energy Distributions, Star Formation Histories, and the Infrared-Radio Correlation of the 850 $\mu$m-selected SMGs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the spectral energy distributions (SEDs), star formation histories (SFHs), and infrared-radio correlation (IRRC) of 221 850 $\mu$m-selected submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) in the SSA22 deep field. The median mass-weighted age is 567 Myr. Most galaxies in our sample began forming $\sim$ 1.68 Gyr after the Big Bang, entered the `SMG phase' after $\sim$ 1 Gyr of evolution -- when they are predominantly observed -- and largely transitioned out of the `SMG phase' to become quiescent within an additional $\sim$ 0.2 Gyr. A subset of massive galaxies shows rapid early assembly with high star formation efficiencies ($\sim$0.2-0.8). The majority of SMGs reside at the high-mass end of the star-forming main sequence, with a characteristic stellar mass of $M_{star} \sim 10^{11}$ M$_\odot$, above which galaxies are predominantly either on the main sequence or already quenched. We observe a downsizing trend: more massive galaxies tend to ``mature" earlier, completing their major episodes of star formation at higher redshifts compared to lower-mass systems. Our sample contributes $\sim$ 21% (28%) to the cosmic star formation rate density (stellar mass density), including the overdensity, with its relative contribution peaking at 50-60% in the redshift range $z=2.5-3.5$. We suggest that 850 $\mu$m surveys may miss a population of faint, warm galaxies at $z \geq 1$-2. The median infrared-radio correlation parameter $q_{IR}$ is 2.37, evolving as $(1+z)^{-0.11}$, likely due to AGN contributions at high redshift and intrinsic differences between low- and high-redshift populations.</description>

      <title>Deep Submillimeter and Radio Observations in the SSA22 Field. III. Multiwavelength Identifications and Properties of the 850 $\mu$m-selected Submillimeter Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a multiwavelength analysis of 850 $\mu$m-selected SMGs (deblended S$_{\rm 850}\gtrsim$ 1mJy) in the SSA22 field, where our deepest JCMT/SCUBA-2 observations reach a sensitivity of $\sigma_{850}\sim$ 0.80mJy beam$^{-1}$. Using multiple identification methods, we have identified 248 deblended SMG candidates for 192 SCUBA-2 sources. The average multiplicity of SCUBA-2 sources is $\sim$26%, with brighter sources exhibiting higher multiplicity. After applying quality cuts based on SED fitting reliability, our final sample comprises 221 SMGs associated with 186 SCUBA-2 sources. The SSA22 SMGs have a median infrared luminosity of (2.25$\pm$0.25) $\times$10$^{12}$ L$_{\odot}$, with $\sim$ 63% ($\sim$ 8%) of the sample classified as ULIRGs (HLIRGs). The median redshift of the sample is $z = 2.00 \pm 0.08$, while optically faint galaxies exhibit higher median redshift ($\sim 2.20 \pm 0.17$). The comoving volume density of SMGs increases by a factor of $\sim 6$ at $z \lesssim 4$, plateauing at $\sim$ 1.78-3.16 $\times$ 10$^{-5}$ cMpc$^{-3}$ over $z \sim$ 1-3 (including the overdensity). The significant overdensity of SMGs within large-scale structures demonstrates their reliability as tracers of cosmic structure formation at high redshift. The median stellar mass and SFR of our SMG sample are $(1.55 \pm 0.22) \times 10^{11}$ M$_\odot$ and $166 \pm 25$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, respectively. We observe a clear ``downsizing" signature: after cosmic noon ($z \lesssim 2$), massive SMGs exhaust their gas reservoirs and transition to quiescence, while lower-mass SMGs continue forming stars and dominate the cosmic SFR density. The sample has a median dust mass of (1.95 $\pm$ 0.14) $\times$ 10$^{9}$ M$_{\odot}$. The dust fraction ($ M_{\text{dust}}/M_{\text{star}}$) has a median value of (1.4 $\pm$ 0.2) $\times$ 10$^{-2}$. The median $A_V$ of SMGs is 3.09$\pm$0.07mag.</description>

      <title>Extragalactic planetary nebulae -- tracers of kinematics and stellar populations out to 100 Mpc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extragalactic planetary nebulae (xPNe) in galaxies beyond the Local Universe serve as discrete tracers for studying the element abundances and kinematics of galaxies covering a wide range of morphologies and masses at a variety of angular distances, from the centre well out into their haloes. They are direct stellar probes to identify the galaxy progenitors of haloes and the intracluster light. Even with new facilities, reaching higher angular resolution and sensitivity, xPNe are the only stellar tracers that can be directly and singularly detected and characterised out to 100 Mpc distance, making them crucial for tracing halo and intracluster light assembly. New wide-field spectroscopic instruments at 10+meter-class telescopes will allow the unprecedented characterisation of xPN populations from galaxy centres to their diffuse outskirts. Panoramic integral-field spectroscopy will enable the simultaneous study of xPN and stellar population properties, establishing their use as age- and metallicity-tracers while also improving post-AGB stellar evolution models.</description>

      <title>Star-forming compact groups: Tracing the early evolutionary stages of compact group environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of pre-processing -- a scenario in which galaxies quench their star formation within substructures before falling into clusters -- we investigate the impact of environment on the physical and morphological properties of galaxies in Compact Groups (CGs), focusing specifically on a sample of Star-Forming Compact Groups (SFCGs). Our aim is to characterize the physical and morphological properties of galaxies in SFCGs, analogues of the Blue Infalling Group, and to understand how the environment influences their evolution. We use photometric techniques to derive stellar masses and star formation rates (SFRs). Morphological parameters are extracted from DECaLS images, obtaining parametric properties such as the S\'ersic index ($n$) and effective radius ($R_{\mathrm{e}}$) using GALFITM, as well as non-parametric indices -- including the Gini coefficient, $M_{20}$, and asymmetry -- from the same data. These indicators allow us to classify galaxies into E/S0/Sa, Sb/Sc/Ir, and merger types. All measurements are compared to a control sample of field galaxies to assess environmental effects. We find no significant differences in $n$ and $R_{\mathrm{e}}$ between SFCG and field galaxies, in contrast to results reported for other CG samples. However, SFCG galaxies exhibit higher specific star formation rates (sSFRs) than their field counterparts. Approximately $16\%$ of SFCG galaxies show merger features and elevated asymmetry. These mergers also present enhanced SFRs compared to both other SFCG types and the field population. We propose that SFCGs represent an earlier evolutionary phase of CGs, supported by their lower velocity dispersions and moderate crossing times, in addition to the observed SFR enhancement and the absence of pronounced morphological transformation. Galaxy mergers in this phase appear to enhance, rather than suppress, star formation.</description>

      <title>FEAST: Probing Hierarchical Star Formation with the Spatial Distributions of Young Star Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the angular two-point correlation function (TPCF) to the spatial distribution of young star clusters (YSCs) in four nearby star forming galaxies (NGC 628, NGC 4449, M51, and M83) in order to investigate their underlying hierarchical structuring. Using newly constructed catalogs of YSCs in the emerging phase (eYSCs), identified in the infrared with JWST, and optical YSCs detected in archival HST data, we compute TPCFs for various cluster samples and age bins across the four galaxies as part of the FEAST (Feedback in Emerging extrAgalactic Star ClusTers) program. We find clear evidence of hierarchical structuring, especially in eYSCs and YSCs with ages &lt; 10 Myr (referred to as oYSCs), which show similar TPCFs within each galaxy. NGC 628 exhibits a clear distinction between the TPCFs of eYSCs and oYSCs, implying a shorter randomization timescale. In contrast, clusters aged 10 to 300 Myr exhibit progressively more random spatial distributions, becoming effectively random after $\sim$ 100 Myr, consistent with earlier studies. The two-dimensional fractal index $D_2$ of the YSCs underlying distribution is calculated from model fits to TPCFs. Our values of $D_2$ derived from the youngest YSC populations align better with the expected value of $D_2 \sim $1.3 for a universal star formation process compared to previous findings.</description>

      <title>Impact of baryons on the population of Galactic subhalos and implications for dark matter searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have used Auriga -- a set of state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of Milky Way-size systems -- to study the impact of baryons on the Galactic subhalo population. A DM-only run counterpart of Auriga allows us to compare results with and without baryons. We repopulate the original suites with low-mass subhalos orders of magnitude lighter than the mass resolution limit, starting from a detailed characterization of Auriga data in the well-resolved subhalo mass range. The survival of low-mass subhalos to tidal forces is unclear and under debate nowadays, thus in our study we stay agnostic and consider two different levels of subhalo resilience to tidal stripping ('fragile' and 'resilient' subhalos). We find baryons to alter the Galactic substructure significantly, by decreasing its overall abundance by a factor $\sim2.4$ (fragile) and $\sim1.9$ (resilient) and subhalo concentration -- here defined in terms of maximum circular velocity -- by $\sim1.5$ with respect to the DM-only scenario. This has important consequences for indirect searches of DM. As an example, we investigated the case of using unidentified gamma-ray sources to set constraints on the DM particle properties, assuming some of them may be dark satellites. We find the DM annihilation cross-section constraints to worsen by a factor $\sim3.6$ in the most realistic scenario of including baryons, compared to DM-only simulations in the 'fragile' setup. Yet, a stronger resilience of subhalos to tidal stripping improves these DM limits by a factor $\sim4.5$ and $\sim10$ compared to the DM-only and hydrodynamical 'fragile' cases, respectively. Our results show the importance of including baryons to properly characterize the Galactic subhalo population, as well as to propose the most optimal subhalo search strategies, not only via its potential DM annihilation products but also through their gravitational signatures.</description>

      <title>Pseudo Little Red Dot: an Active Black Hole Embedded in a Dense and Dusty, Metal-Poor Starburst Galaxy at z=5.96</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of Pseudo-LRD-NOM (Pseudo little red dot with no metal lines), a highly magnified low-mass galaxy behind the lensing cluster Abell 370 at z=5.96. We classify this object as a pseudo-LRD because its red rest-frame optical colour is mainly driven by a prominent Halpha line (with EW0 &gt;~ 800 Angstroms) present in its JWST NIRSpec spectrum. Halpha is dominated by a narrow component and also has a minor broad component indicative of an active black hole with M_BH = 2.9x10^6 Msun. A narrow Hbeta emission line is also detected (with S/N = 8), producing a Balmer decrement (narrow) Halpha/Hbeta = 11. The rest-frame UV spectral slope is beta_UVspec = -1.2. All these features can be ascribed to high dust attenuation. However, no [OIII]5007 or any other metal lines are detected in the spectrum, so [OIII]5007/Hbeta &lt; 0.25, at odds with a simple dust-attenuation explanation. Accounting for all the spectral properties requires the model of a starburst with moderate colour excess E(B-V)=0.18-0.45, high gas density (n_H &gt;~ 10^6 cm^{-3}) and extremely low gas/stellar metallicities (Z = 0.01-0.1 Zsun). The demagnified stellar mass is 1.62^{+1.54}_{-0.79} x10^7 Msun and the stellar-mass surface density is Sigma* = 418^{+725}_{-310} Msun/pc^2, similar to that of massive/nuclear star clusters. Pseudo-LRD-NOM provides evidence of massive black-hole growth occurring in a high-density, dusty starburst which is at the early stages of its chemical enrichment, and is likely a precursor to a real LRD.</description>

      <title>Galactic core-tail structure in BEC dark matter with Kapitza potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the experimental realization of a Kapitza potential in a Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC) has been reported for the first time in literature, motivating further theoretical investigations of such system. At the same time, in the astrophysical context, BEC dark matter models have been widely studied as a possible phenomenological explanation for the dark matter phenomena. We model the galactic structure with an inner cored profile obtained from the ground state equilibrium solution of the Schroedinger-Poisson together with a Kapitza-BEC like interaction for the tail region. We find reasonable agreement of the model with representative galaxy rotation curves available in the SPARC catalogue.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic confirmation of a large and luminous galaxy with weak emission lines at $\mathbf{z = 13.53}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present JWST/NIRSpec PRISM observations of a robust galaxy candidate at $z\simeq14$, selected from pure-parallel NIRCam imaging; PAN-z14-1. The NIRSpec spectrum allows confirmation of this source at $z_{\rm spec}=13.53^{+0.05}_{-0.06}$ through modeling of the Lyman-$\alpha$ break. PAN-z14-1 is the fourth most distant galaxy known to date and is extremely luminous ($M_{\rm UV}=-20.6\pm0.2$), with a blue UV-continuum slope ($\beta=-2.26\pm0.08$) and a large physical size ($r_{\rm c}=233\pm10\, \rm pc$). We fail to detect any rest-frame UV emission lines at $\geq 2\sigma$ significance, with upper limits sufficiently constraining to exclude the possibility of strong line emission. In terms of its physical properties, PAN-z14-1 is remarkably similar to the previously confirmed $z_{\rm spec}=14.18$ galaxy GS-z14-0. The lack of strong emission lines and large physical size is consistent with an emerging picture of two potentially distinct galaxy populations at $z&gt;10$, distinguished by star-formation rate surface density. In this scenario, PAN-z14-1 is a second example of a ``normal'', extended, luminous, star-forming galaxy at $z \simeq 14$, and differs markedly from the other class of extremely compact galaxies with strong emission lines recently uncovered at extreme redshifts with JWST. These results highlight the importance of further spectroscopic confirmation of $z&gt;10$ galaxy candidates in order to fully understand the diversity of properties displayed by the first galaxies.</description>

      <title>Astrometric microlensing probes of the isolated neutron star population with Roman</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Notoriously hard to detect and study, isolated neutron stars (NS) could provide valuable answers to fundamental questions about stellar evolution and explosion physics. With the upcoming Roman Space Telescope, scheduled for launch in 2026, a new and powerful channel for their detection - astrometric microlensing - will become available. We set out to create a realistic sample of simulated gravitational microlensing events as observed by Roman with the Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey. We focus in particular on the population of NS lenses, which has until now been largely understudied. We use state-of-the-art Galactic models tailored for application to microlensing by compact objects. We simulate four different NS populations with Maxwellian natal kick distributions: $\bar{v} = (150, \ 250, \ 350, \ 450)$ km/s. We apply projected Roman precision, cadence, and detectability criteria. We find the parameter space $\log_{10} t_{\rm E}$ - $\log_{10} \theta_{\rm E}$, which will be accessible to Roman observations, to be maximally efficient for classification of stellar remnants. We find a feature in this space that is characteristic to NS; using this feature, optimal samples of NS candidates can be constructed from Roman-like datasets. We describe the dependence of observable parameter distributions on the assumed mean kick velocities. As the effects of natal kicks are very complex and mutually counteracting, we suggest more detailed studies focused on the dynamics of NS are needed in anticipation of Roman and future surveys. We estimate Roman will observe approximately $11\,000$ microlensing events - including $\sim100$ with NS lenses - whose both photometric and astrometric signal are detectable; the event yield decreases by $38\%$ if gap-filling low-cadence observations are not included. We make all simulated microlensing event datasets publicly available in preparation for Roman data.</description>

      <title>Euclid: Galaxy SED reconstruction in the PHZ processing function: impact on the PSF and the role of medium-band filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weak lensing surveys require accurate correction for the point spread function (PSF) when measuring galaxy shapes. For a diffraction-limited PSF, as arises in space-based missions, this correction depends on each galaxy SED. In the Euclid mission, galaxy SED reconstruction, a tasks of the photometric-redshift processing function (PHZ PF), relies on broad- and medium-band ancillary photometry. The limited wavelength sampling of the Euclid VIS passband and signal-to-noise ratio may affect the reconstruction accuracy and translate into biases in the weak lensing measurements. In this study, we present the methodology, which is employed in the Euclid PHZ PF, for reconstructing galaxy SEDs at 55 wavelengths, sampling the VIS passband every 10 nm, and we assess whether it fulfils the accuracy requirements imposed on the Euclid PSF model. We employ both physics- and data-driven methods, focusing on a new approach of template-based flux correction and Gaussian processes, and we introduce an SED metric whose bias propagates into PSF quadrupole moment errors. Our findings demonstrate that Gaussian processes and template fitting meet the requirements only in specific, but complementary, redshift intervals. We therefore propose a hybrid approach, which leverages both methods. This solution proves to be effective in meeting the Euclid accuracy requirements for most of the redshift range of the survey. Finally, we investigate the impact on the SED reconstruction of a new set of 16 evenly-spaced medium-band filters for the Subaru telescope, providing quasi-spectroscopic coverage of the VIS passband. This study shows promising results, ensuring accurate SED reconstruction and meeting the mission PSF requirements. This work thus provides not only the methodological foundation of galaxy SED reconstruction in the Euclid PHZ PF, but also a roadmap for future improvements using a new medium-band survey.</description>

      <title>Checking It Twice: Using [C/N]-Masses and Asteroseismic Masses as a Diagnostic of Mass Loss and Transfer on the RGB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The surface [C/N] of red giants is correlated with birth mass, but not directly impacted by mass loss. Exploiting this, we compare asteroseismic masses of red giants with the same [C/N] and but different evolutionary states. We find bulk differences between stars at the beginning of the red giant branch and in the subsequent evolutionary phase, the red clump, providing a direct constraint on the strength of net RGB mass loss in field stars. We find that net mass loss decreases with metallicity and mass, matching recent studies for field giants, but contradicting expectations from the widely used Reimers' mass loss formula. We propose a mass- and metallicity-dependent Reimers' $\eta$ calibration that reproduces the empirical trends that we see. In addition, we identify 207 stars (3.33% of our sample) that are clear outliers from their population in these birth mass bins, which we believe are likely candidates for mass transfer events. These stars do not show any obvious discrepancies in abundances or binary properties from their counterparts. This population should be accounted for in Galactic archaeological studies. Further follow-up is required to quantify their occurrence rate and origin.</description>

      <title>Rotation Period of 3I/ATLAS After Perihelion from Jet Position Angle Wobble and Photometric Variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine the post-perihelion rotation period of 3I/ATLAS using two independent diagnostics: the temporal modulation of the position angle (PA) of a persistent jet-like feature, and a time-series photometric light curve in the Gr (R) band. For the jet morphology, we measure the PA at multiple epochs by applying the Larson-Sekanina Rotational Gradient filter to Hubble Space Telescope images between November 20, 2025 and December 27, 2025, and model the phase-folded PA curve with weighted least-squares Fourier series up to two harmonics while scanning trial periods P to identify minima in \c{hi}2(P). For the photometry, we adopt the best-fit period from an independent 30-minute binned analysis (from a 0.25 meter telescope MPC L92) based on a refined \c{hi}2(P) profile for a sinusoidal model with nightly offsets. We find that the jet-PA modulation gives a period Pjet = 7.20 +/-0.05 h (adopting a conservative uncertainty dominated by sparse sampling and systematics), while the photometry yields Pphot = 7.136+/-0.001 h (formal 1{\sigma} uncertainty). Although the periods differ slightly, the offset is plausibly attributable to non-Gaussian systematics and aliasing. The combined data supports a post-perihelion rotation period of 7.1 h associated with precession of the jet structure around the rotation axis by 20{\deg}. The rotation axis is aligned with the sunward direction to within 20{\deg}</description>

      <title>The Deeper, Wider, Faster programme's first DECam optical data release</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transient and variable optical sky is relatively poorly characterised on fast ($&lt;$1$\,$hr) timescales. With the Dark Energy Camera (DECam), the Deeper, Wider, Faster programme (DWF) probes a unique parameter space with its deep (median of $g\sim22.2$ AB mag), minute-cadence imaging. In this work, we present DWF's first data release which comprises high cadence photometry extracted from $\sim$12000 images and 166 hours of telescope time. We present a novel data processing pipeline, $\texttt{dwf-postpipe}$, developed to identify sources and extract their light curves. The accuracy of the photometry is assessed by cross-matching to public catalogues. In addition, we injected a population of synthetic GRB afterglows into a subset of the DWF DECam imaging to compare the efficiency of our pipeline with a standard difference imaging approach. Both pipelines show performance and reliably recover injected transients with peak magnitudes $g&lt;22$ AB mag with an efficiency of $97.24^{+0.7}_{-1.0}$ percent for \texttt{dwf-postpipe} and $96.14^{+0.9}_{-1.1}$ percent for a difference imaging approach. However, we find that $\texttt{dwf-postpipe}$ is less likely to recover transients appearing in galaxies that are brighter or comparable in brightness to the transient itself. To demonstrate the power of the data in this release, we conduct a search for uncatalogued variable stars in a single night of DWF DECam imaging and find ten pulsating variables, two eclipsing binaries and one ZZ ceti. We also conduct a search for variable phenomena in the Chandra Deep Field South, a Rubin deep drilling field, and identify two flares from likely UV ceti type stars.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Ionized Jet Morphologies: Sub-arcsecond VLA Observations of Compact Radio Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present sub-arcsecond ($\theta\sim0.1^{\prime\prime}$) resolution VLA 1.3 cm continuum and 22.2 GHz H$_2$O maser observations toward 15 compact radio continuum sources with rising spectral index and 8 string-like radio continuum structures in the Rosero et al. (2016, 2019) survey. Three different morphologies are observed: elongated or double-peak string-like structure (6 out of 23 cases), a collection of distinct continuum peaks (4 out of 23 cases), and single compact sources (13 out of 23 cases). The majority of H$_2$O maser spots detected are within a sky-projected distance of $\sim5,000$ au from the radio continuum peaks and tend to be well aligned and distributed in an elongated structure when more than three spots are observed. We generally recover less emission than Rosero et al. (2016, 2019), which together with the fact that more than half of the jet candidates in our survey appear mostly compact, suggest core/halo shock structures even on small scales. We also detected proper motion in 10 cases and measured an average projected velocity of approximately 120 km s$^{-1}$. Radio brightness variability is detected in at least two cases, possibly due to weak accretion bursts. This work, together with our previous molecular jet study, provides further evidence that support the main source of ionization in the studied sources is shocks, yet collimation is only observed in 4 cases. We conclude that the available data supports the thermal jet classification of 7 sources, and the ionized jet interpretation is further supported in 16 sources.</description>

      <title>Rescaling Transforms for Local Models of Spherical Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Previously we developed a local model for a spherically contracting/expanding gas cloud that can be used to study turbulence and small scale instabilities in such flows. In this work we generalise the super-comoving variables used in studies of cosmological structure formation to our local spherical flow model, which make it significantly easier to derive analytical solutions and analyse the interactions of more complex flows with the background. We show that a wide class of solutions to the local spherical flow model can be obtained via a mapping from the corresponding solutions in regular Cartesian flows. The rescaling of time in the transformation results in a modification of the linear instabilities that can occur in spherical flows, causing them to have a time dependent growth rate in the physical time coordinate, and can prevent slower instabilities from operating. Finally, we show that the small scale flows in isotropic contraction/expansion can be mapped directly to Cartesian, inviscid, incompressible hydrodynamics, meaning that one expects a form of rescaled Kolmogorov-turbulence at the small scale of isotropically contracting/expanding flows.</description>

      <title>KMT-2025-BLG-1616Lb: First Microlensing Bound Planet From DREAMS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present observations and analysis of the bound planetary microlensing event KMT-2025-BLG-1616. The planetary signal was captured by the Korea Microlensing Telescope Network (KMTNet) and the DECam Rogue Earths and Mars Survey (DREAMS). DREAMS's minute-cadence observations break the central/resonant degeneracy in the binary-lens models. The color of the faint source star ($I=22$) is measured from the DREAMS's $r - z$ color. The planetary system has a planet-host mass ratio of $q \sim 5 \times 10^{-4}$. A Bayesian analysis yields a host-star mass of $\sim 0.3\,M_\odot$, a planetary mass of $\sim 40\,M_{\oplus}$, a projected planet-host separation of $\sim 1.6~\mathrm{au}$, and a lens distance of $\sim 7.5~\mathrm{kpc}$. Based on the photometric precision achieved by DREAMS for this event, we simulate free-floating planet (FFP) detections and find that DREAMS is sensitive to Mars-mass FFPs in the Galactic bulge and Moon-mass FFPs in the Galactic disk.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Properties of Novae in M31</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The peak luminosities and rates of decline for a large sample of novae recently published by Clark et al. have been analyzed using the Yaron et al. nova models to estimate fundamental properties of the M31 nova population. The apparent white dwarf (WD) mass distribution is approximately Gaussian with a mean $\langle M_\mathrm{WD} \rangle = 1.16\pm0.14~M_{\odot}$. When corrected for recurrence-time bias, the mean drops to $\langle M_\mathrm{WD} \rangle = 1.07~M_\odot$. The average WD mass of the M31 nova sample is found to be remarkably similar to that found by Shara et al. in their study of 82 Galactic novae, but $\sim0.15~M_\odot$ more massive than the mean recently determined by Schaefer in his comprehensive study of more than 300 systems. As expected, the average WD mass for the recurrent novae included in the M31 sample, $\langle M_\mathrm{WD} \rangle = 1.33\pm0.08~M_{\odot}$, is significantly higher than that for novae generally. Other parameters of interest, such as the accretion rate, velocity of the ejecta, and the predicted recurrence time, are characterized by skewed distributions with large spreads about means of $\langle \log \dot M ~(M_\odot~\mathrm{yr}^{-1}) \rangle \simeq -9.27$, $\langle V_\mathrm{max} \rangle \simeq 1690~\mathrm{km~s}^{-1}$, and $\langle \log P_\mathrm{rec}~\mathrm{(yr)} \rangle \simeq 4.39$, respectively. The role of hibernation in affecting the $\dot M$ and $P_\mathrm{rec}$ distributions is briefly discussed. Finally, the nova properties were studied as a function of apparent position (isophotal radius) in M31, with the preponderance of evidence failing to establish any clear dependence on stellar population.</description>

      <title>Ultra High-Redshift or Closer-by, Dust-Obscured Galaxies? Deciphering the Nature of Faint, Previously Missed F200W-Dropouts in CEERS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is revolutionizing our understanding of the Universe by unveiling faint, near-infrared dropouts previously beyond our reach, ranging from exceptionally dusty sources to galaxies up to redshift $z \sim 14$. In this paper, we identify F200W-dropout objects in the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) survey which are absent from existing catalogs. Our selection method can effectively identify obscured low-mass ($\log \text{M}_* \leq 9$) objects at $z \leq 6$, massive dust-rich sources up to $z \sim 12$, and ultra-high-redshift ($z &gt; 15$) candidates. Primarily relying on NIRCam photometry from the latest CEERS data release and supplementing with Mid-Infrared/(sub-)mm data when available, our analysis pipeline combines multiple SED-fitting codes, star formation histories, and CosMix - a novel tool for astronomical stacking. Our work highlights three $2&lt;z&lt;3$ dusty dwarf galaxies which have larger masses compared to the typical dusty dwarfs previously identified in CEERS. Additionally, we reveal five faint sources with significant probability of lying above $z&gt;15$, with best-fit masses compatible with $\Lambda$CDM and a standard baryons-to-star conversion efficiency. Their bi-modal redshift probability distributions suggest they could also be $z&lt;1.5$ dwarf galaxies with extreme dust extinction. We also identify a strong line emitter galaxy at $z \sim 5$ mimicking the near-infrared emission of a $z \sim 13$ galaxy. Our sample holds promising candidates for future follow-ups. Confirming ultra high-redshift galaxies or lower-z dusty dwarfs will offer valuable insights into early galaxy formation, evolution with their central black holes and the nature of dark matter, and/or cosmic dust production mechanisms in low-mass galaxies, and will help us to understand degeneracies and contamination in high-z object searches.</description>

      <title>Amaryllis: a digital twin of the earliest galaxies in the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07935v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synergies between JWST and ALMA are unveiling a population of bright, super-early ($z&gt;10$) galaxies, including systems like GS-z14-0 ($z=14.2$) and GHZ2 ($z=12.3$) with extreme FIR line ratios ([OIII] 88$\,$um / [CII] 158$\,$um $&gt;3$) that challenge galaxy formation models. To address this, we identify a synthetic analog of these sources, "Amaryllis", within the SERRA zoom-in simulations, and track its evolution from $z=16$ to $z=7$. During this period, Amaryllis grows from $\log(M_\star/M_{\odot}) \sim 7.4$ to $10.3$, linking super-early progenitors to the massive galaxy population at the end of reionization. At $z \sim 11.3$, Amaryllis closely matches the observed properties of GS-z14-0, including $M_\star$, SFR, and the luminosity of FIR ([OIII] 88$\,$um) and UV (e.g. CIII]$\,1908$) lines. We find that high [OIII]/[CII] ratios appear during short, merger-driven starburst episodes, when low metallicity ($Z \sim 0.1\,Z_{\odot}$) and high ionization conditions ($U_{\mathrm{ion}} \sim 0.3$) push the ISM far from equilibrium. These extreme FIR line ratios are thus transient and linked to major mergers that ignite strong ionized gas outflows. Strikingly, despite this dynamical activity, Amaryllis develops a rotation-supported gaseous disk ($V/\sigma \sim 4$-6) by $z \sim 11$, while stars remain dispersion-dominated. This coexistence of ordered gas rotation and merger-driven disturbances occurs within a massive yet typical $\Lambda$CDM halo, enabling disk formation even at cosmic dawn.</description>

Abstract: We present new VLT/MUSE observations of a 3 $\times$ 8 arcmin$^2$ mosaic along the southern major axis of the Local Group galaxy M33. These data provide an unprecedented view of the galaxy's interstellar medium (ISM) and allow us to resolve ionised nebulae at a spatial scale of $\approx$5 pc. We identified and catalogued 131 HII regions, down to H\alpha luminosities of $\approx 5\times$10$^{35}$ erg s$^{-1}$, one order of magnitude fainter than previous surveys on nearby galaxies beyond the Local Group, and we compared these regions with the spatial distribution of ionising stars and embedded star clusters. For each region, we extracted the corresponding integrated optical spectra and measured the intensity of key optical emission lines (H\beta, [OIII], [NII], H\alpha, [SII], [SIII]), other weaker optical lines when detectable, and Paschen lines to characterise the physical properties of the ioinised gas, such as density, dust attenuation, and metallicity. Our spatially resolved line ratio and flux maps reveal a remarkable diversity in ionisation properties, from dust-obscured regions hosting young stellar objects to highly ionised bubbles exhibiting high [OIII]/H\beta ratios. Our data reveal a diversity of ionisation fronts, ranging from well-defined to partial to absent. The radial profiles we obtained indicate the presence of both optically thin (density-bounded) HII regions permitting the escape of ionising photons and fully ionised, optically thick (ionisation-bounded) HII regions. The richness of this MUSE mosaic offers an unprecedented view of the ionised ISM at $\approx$5 pc resolution, providing direct insight into how stellar feedback shapes its environment.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic characterization of a remarkable temporally varying, triple-lensed quasar at z=2.67</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10811v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitationally lensed quasars are viable cosmic tools for constraining a diversity of fundamental astrophysical phenomena; They enable identification of faint, low-mass supermassive black holes, provide unique constraints on the intervening intergalactic or interstellar medium in their sightlines, and can be used to determine key cosmological quantities such as the Hubble constant, $H_0$. However, they are rare phenomena, and it has proven difficult to define efficient, unbiased selection methods.} In this study, we report the independent spectroscopic identification of a remarkable triple-lensed quasar at $z=2.67$, identified based on astrometric measurements from the {\em Gaia} mission, previously identified in Pan-STARRS. Furthermore, a larger spectroscopic follow-up survey of {\em Gaia}-detected candidate lensed quasars. We characterize in detail the three mirror images of the quasar and their spatial and temporal spectroscopic coverage, with focus on the emission-line properties which shows variation across sigthlines and temporal evolution over the $\sim 11$months spectroscopic campaign. We construct a lens model of the foreground source from a combination of the multiple spectra and deep optical imaging, providing a robust halo mass of $M_{\rm h} = (2.78 \pm 0.05)\times 10^{10}M_\odot$. Based on the lens model, the time delay between each sightline is translated into an intrinsic quasar time, allowing us to construct a quasar timeseries over $\sim18$months with monthly cadence. Over months timescales the broad emission lines vary in both velocity offset and equivalent width (EW) as well as an overall increase in ionization. This exemplary triple-lensed quasars demonstrates the viability of identifying such rare lens configurations based purely on the astrometric measurements from the {\em Gaia} mission, which we here provide optimized selection criteria for, for future studies.</description>

Abstract: We estimate key parameters for the Galactic globular clusters NGC1904 and NGC4372 and update the parameters for NGC288, NGC362, NGC5904, NGC6205, and NGC6218, which were analysed in our previous papers. We fit various colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of the clusters using isochrones from the DSED and BaSTI. The CMDs are constructed from data sets provided by the HST, Gaia, SMSS, a large compilation of Stetson, and other sources, using multiple filters for each cluster. Our cross-identification of almost all the data sets with those from Gaia or HST allows us to use their astrometry to precisely select cluster members in all the data sets. We obtain the following estimates for NGC288, NGC362, NGC1904, NGC4372, NGC5904, NGC6205 and NGC6218, respectively: metallicities [Fe/H]$=-1.28$, $-1.26$, $-1.64$, $-2.28$, $-1.33$, $-1.56$, and $-1.27$ dex; ages $12.94$, $10.33$, $13.16$, $12.81$, $11.53$, $12.75$, and $13.03$ Gyr; distances $8.83$, $9.00$, $12.66$, $5.17$, $7.24$, $7.39$, and $4.92$ kpc; reddenings $E(B-V)=0.022$, $0.029$, $0.031$, $0.545$, $0.045$, $0.024$, and $0.210$ mag; extinctions $Av=0.09$, $0.09$, $0.11$, $1.58$, $0.13$, $0.09$, and $0.67$ mag; and extinction-to-reddening ratio $Rv=3.9$, $3.0$, $3.8$, $2.9$, $2.9$, $3.6$, and $3.2$. We confirm that the differences in horizontal branch morphology among the 16 Galactic globular clusters analysed in our studies can be explained by variations in their metallicity, age, mass-loss efficiency, and the loss of low-mass members during cluster evolution. Accordingly, most clusters indicate a relatively high mass-loss efficiency, consistent with the Reimers mass-loss law with $\eta&gt;0.3$.</description>

      <title>The influence of magnetic fields in Cloud-Cloud Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cloud-cloud collisions are expected to trigger star formation by compressing gas into dense, gravitationally unstable regions. However, the role of magnetic fields in this process is unclear. We use SPH to model head-on collisions between two uniform density clouds, each with mass $500 \,$M$_{\odot}$, initial radius 2 pc, and embedded in a uniform magnetic field parallel to the collision velocity. As in the nonmagnetic case, the resulting shock-compressed layer fragments into a network of filaments. If the collision is sufficiently slow, the filaments are dragged into radial orientations by non-homologous gravitational contraction, resulting in a $\textit{Hub Filament}$ morphology, which spawns a centrally concentrated monolithic cluster with a broad mass function shaped by competitive accretion and dynamical ejections. If the collision is faster, a $\textit{Spiders Web}$ of intersecting filaments forms, and star-systems condense out in small subclusters, often at the filament intersections; due to their smaller mass reservoirs, and the lower probability of dynamical ejection, the mass function of star-systems formed in these subclusters is narrower. Magnetic fields affect this dichotomy quantitatively by delaying collapse and fragmentation. As a result, the velocity threshold separating $\textit{Hub Filament}$ and $\textit{Spiders Web}$ morphologies is shifted upward in magnetised runs, thereby enlarging the parameter space in which $\textit{Hub Filament}$ morphologies form, and enhancing the likelihood of producing centrally concentrated clusters. Consequently, magnetic fields regulate both the morphology and timing of star formation in cloud-cloud collisions: they broaden filaments, delay the onset of star formation, and promote the formation of $\textit{Hub Filament}$ morphologies, monolithic clusters and high-mass star-systems.</description>

      <title>The Properties of Little Red Dot Galaxies in the ASTRID Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20439v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present simulated counterparts of the ``Little Red Dot'' (LRD) galaxies observed with JWST, using the large cosmological hydrodynamic simulation, ASTRID. We create mock observations of the galaxies ($5 \leq z \leq 8$) in ASTRID, and find seventeen which fit the color and size criteria of LRDs. These LRDs are galaxies with high stellar masses ($\rm log(M_*/M_{\odot}) \geq 9.7$), and massive black holes ($\rm log(M_{BH}/M_{\odot}) \geq 6.8$). The host galaxies are dense, with stellar half mass radii ($\rm 325\,pc \leq r_{{\rm half},*} \leq 620\,pc$), and dust attenuation in the F444W band above 1.25. Their star formation has been recently quenched. They host relatively bright AGN that are dust-obscured and contribute significantly to the rest-frame optical red slope and have relatively low luminosity in the rest-frame ultraviolet, where the host galaxy's stars are more dominant. These LRDs are in an evolutionary phase of miniquenching that is the result of AGN feedback from their massive black holes. The LRDs in ASTRID are bright with F444W magnitudes of $23.5-25.5$. The less massive and fainter galaxies in ASTRID lack the dust concentration necessary to produce the red slope of an LRD, though this could be an effect of limited resolution. Most of the highest Eddington black holes are not LRDs due to insufficient dust attenuation from their host galaxies, which are also experiencing relatively high star formation rates. This results in their spectra being too flat, despite their highly accreting black holes.</description>

      <title>Critical Metallicity of Cool Supergiant Formation. II. Physical Origin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01753v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the physical origin of the critical metallicity required for the formation of cool supergiants, as revealed by stellar evolution models. Using grids of stellar models, we show that the terminal-age main-sequence (TAMS) radius, $R_{\rm TAMS}$, defines a threshold that determines whether a star of a given mass can evolve into the red supergiant (RSG) phase. Metallicity influences the supergiant outcome because it modifies $R_{\rm TAMS}$ through its effects on opacity and nuclear energy generation, as demonstrated by our stellar models and dimensional analysis based on homology relations. The value of $R_{\rm TAMS}$ sets the initial radius for post-main-sequence expansion and therefore controls the envelope radius reached at subsequent core-evolution stages. Higher-metallicity stars develop larger $R_{\rm TAMS}$ and rapidly expand into the stable RSG regime during core helium burning. In contrast, lower-metallicity stars have smaller $R_{\rm TAMS}$ and advance to more evolved core helium or carbon-burning stages while retaining compact envelopes, thereby preventing expansion into the RSG regime during core helium burning. Our results explain the origin of the critical metallicity and offer insight into the evolution of metal-poor massive stars in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Simulation-calibrated Bayesian inference for progenitor properties of the microquasar SS 433</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20811v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: SS$\,$433 is one of the most extreme Galactic X-ray binaries, launching semi-relativistic jets and showing clear signs of super-critical accretion onto what is likely a black hole. Yet the properties of the binary system that produced it remain uncertain. To solve the inverse problem of inferring the progenitor properties of binaries that evolve into SS$\,$433-like systems, we use an iterative, simulation-based calibration framework that combines Bayesian inference with the isolated binary-evolution code COSMIC. Using six measured properties of SS$\,$433 and the dynamic nested sampler $\texttt{dynesty}$, we explore a ten-dimensional space of possible progenitor masses, orbits, mass-transfer histories, and natal-kick velocities. This approach identifies the regions of parameter space most consistent with SS$\,$433 and allows us to iteratively refine the resulting progenitor distributions. We find 90% confidence intervals for the progenitor initial primary mass of (8, 11) M$_\odot$, secondary mass of (32, 40) M$_\odot$, orbital period of (136, 2259) days, eccentricity of (0.26, 0.6), common-envelope efficiency of (0.44, 0.76), accreted fraction during stable mass transfer of (0.22, 0.6), and black-hole natal-kick magnitude of (5, 68) km/s. These results show that direct probabilistic inference of X-ray binary progenitors can yield new constraints on the formation of extreme accretion systems like SS$\,$433, which has important implications for theoretical expectations of the population of SS$\,$433-like systems in the Galaxy and their connection with cosmic ray observations.</description>

      <title>Water Production of Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS from SOHO/SWAN Observations after Perihelion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22354v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Solar Wind ANisotropies (SWAN) all-sky hydrogen Lyman-alpha camera on the Solar and Heliosphere Observatory (SOHO) observed the hydrogen coma of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, also called C/2025 N1 (ATLAS), beginning on November 6, 2025, 9 days after perihelion. Water production rates were calculated from each image of 3I/ATLAS using the methodology of Makinen &amp; Combi (2005, Icarus 177, 217) and fluorescence rates, g-factors, calculated using the daily solar Lyman-alpha fluxes from the LASP database (https://lasp.colorado.edu/lisird/data) corrected for solar rotation and for the comet heliocentric velocity. The method has been used for over 90 comet apparitions (Combi 2022; Combi et al. 2019). A water production rate of 3.17 x 10^29 s^-1 was found on November 6 when the comet was at a heliocentric distance of 1.40 au and at a sufficient solar elongation angle. It decreased over time after that, down to 1-2 x 10^28 s^-1 around 40 days post-perihelion (December 9).</description>

      <title>The steep redshift evolution of the hierarchical binary black hole merger rate may cause the $z$-$\chi_{\rm eff}$ correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03456v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is growing evidence from gravitational-wave observations that some merging black holes are created from previous mergers. Using the prediction that these hierarchically-merged black holes have dimensionless spin magnitudes of $\chi \approx 0.69$, we identify a subpopulation in the gravitational-wave data consistent with a hierarchical-merger origin in dense star clusters. This subpopulation's primary mass distribution peaks at $16.7^{+3.1}_{-4.6},\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$, which is approximately twice as large as its secondary mass distribution's mode ($8.0^{+29.7}_{-2.3},\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$), and its spin tilt distribution is consistent with isotropy. Our inferred secondary mass distributions imply that isolated binary evolution may still be needed to explain the entirety of the $9\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ peak. Surprisingly, we find that the rate of hierarchical mergers may evolve more steeply with redshift than the rest of the population ($98.5\%$ credibility): the fraction of all binary black holes that are hierarchically formed at $z=0.1$ is $0.05^{+0.05}_{-0.04}$, compared to $0.17^{+0.13}_{-0.12}$ at $z=1$. This provides an explanation for the previously-discovered broadening of the effective spin distribution with redshift. Our results have implications for star cluster formation histories, as they suggest the potential existence of a high-redshift population of massive, compact clusters.</description>

      <title>The maximum mass ratio of hierarchical binary black hole mergers may cause the $q$-$\chi_{\rm eff}$ correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03457v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Regardless of their initial spins, the merger of two roughly equal mass black holes (BHs) produces a remnant BH of dimensionless spin $0.69$. Such remnants can merge with other black holes in dense stellar environments and produce hierarchical mergers. Analyzing the latest catalog binary black hole (BBH) mergers from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detectors, we identify a subpopulation with primary spins consistent with such hierarchical mergers. Consistent with astrophysical expectations for mergers of second generation BHs with first generation BHs, we find that this subpopulation has mass ratios below $0.59^{+0.18}_{-0.23}$. We also infer that $19$-$88\%$ of the BBH population below this mass ratio is consistent with belonging to the hierarchically-merged population. Our results offer a natural explanation for the narrowing of the effective inspiral spin distribution with mass ratio observed in other studies.</description>
