      <title>Symmetry adaptation for self-consistent many-body calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exploitation of space group symmetries in numerical calculations of periodic crystalline solids accelerates calculations and provides physical insight. We present results for a space-group symmetry adaptation of electronic structure calculations within the finite-temperature self-consistent GW method along with an efficient parallelization scheme on accelerators. Our implementation employs the simultaneous diagonalization of the Dirac characters of the orbital representation. Results show that symmetry adaptation in self-consistent many-body codes results in substantial improvements of the runtime, and that block diagonalization on top of a restriction to the irreducible wedge results in additional speedup.</description>

      <title>Response Matching for generating materials and molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning has recently emerged as a powerful tool for generating new molecular and material structures. The success of state-of-the-art models stems from their ability to incorporate physical symmetries, such as translation, rotation, and periodicity. Here, we present a novel generative method called Response Matching (RM), which leverages the fact that each stable material or molecule exists at the minimum of its potential energy surface. Consequently, any perturbation induces a response in energy and stress, driving the structure back to equilibrium. Matching to such response is closely related to score matching in diffusion models. By employing the combination of a machine learning interatomic potential and random structure search as the denoising model, RM exploits the locality of atomic interactions, and inherently respects permutation, translation, rotation, and periodic invariances. RM is the first model to handle both molecules and bulk materials under the same framework. We demonstrate the efficiency and generalization of RM across three systems: a small organic molecular dataset, stable crystals from the Materials Project, and one-shot learning on a single diamond configuration.</description>

      <title>Floquet engineering of quantum thermal machines: A gradient-based procedure to optimize their performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A procedure to find optimal regimes for quantum thermal engines (QTMs) is described and demonstrated. The QTMs are modelled as the periodically-driven non-equilibrium steady states of open quantum systems, whose dynamics is approximated in this work with Markovian master equations. The action of the external agent, and the couplings to the heat reservoirs can be modulated with control functions, and it is the time-dependent shape of these control functions the object of optimisation. Those functions can be freely parameterised, which permits to constrain the solutions according to experimental or physical requirements.</description>

      <title>Spin Symmetry in Thermally-Assisted-Occupation Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For electronic systems with multi-reference (MR) character, Kohn-Sham density functional theory (KS-DFT) with the conventional exchange-correlation (xc) energy functionals can lead to incorrect spin densities and related properties. For example, for H2 dissociation, the spin-restricted and spin-unrestricted solutions obtained with the same xc energy functional in KS-DFT can be distinctly different, yielding the unphysical spin-symmetry breaking effects in the spin-unrestricted solutions. Recently, thermally-assisted-occupation density functional theory (TAO-DFT) has been shown to resolve the aforementioned spin-symmetry breaking, when the fictitious temperature is properly chosen. In this work, a response theory based on TAO-DFT is developed to demonstrate that TAO-DFT with a sufficiently large fictitious temperature can always resolve the unphysical spin-symmetry breaking in MR systems. To further support this, TAO-DFT calculations with various fictitious temperatures are performed for the dissociation of H2, N2, He2, and Ne2 as well as the twisted ethylene.</description>

      <title>Polydisperse versus monodisperse microbubbles: A simulation study for contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) presents distinct advantages in diagnostic echography. Utilizing microbubbles (MBs) as conventional contrast agents enhances vascular visualization and organ perfusion, facilitating real-time, non-invasive procedures. There is a current tendency to replace the traditional polydisperse MBs by novel monodisperse formulations in an attempt to optimize contrast enhancement and guarantee consistent behavior and reliable imaging outcomes. This study investigates the contrast enhancement achieved by monodisperse MBs of different sizes, and their influence on nonlinear imaging artifacts observed in traditional CEUS. To explore the differences between monodisperse and polydisperse populations without excessive experimentation, numerical simulations are employed for delivering precise, objective and expeditious results. The Iterative Nonlinear Contrast Source (INCS) method has previously demonstrated its efficacy in simulating ultrasound propagation in large populations in which each bubble has individual properties and several orders of multiple scattering are significant. Our findings in CEUS imaging indicate that scattering from resonant monodisperse microbubbles is 11.8 dB stronger than scattering from the polydisperse population. Furthermore, the amplitude of nonlinear imaging artifacts downstream of the monodisperse population is 19.4 dB stronger compared to polydisperse suspension. Investigating the impact of multiple scattering on polydisperse populations compared to various monodisperse suspensions reveals that monodisperse MBs are more effective contrast agents, especially when on resonance. Despite the strong signal to noise ratio of monodisperse populations, the imaging artifacts due to nonlinear wave propagation are also enhanced, resulting in more missclassification of MBs as tissue.</description>

      <title>Revisiting first-principles thermodynamics by quasiharmonic approach: Application to study thermal expansion of additively-manufactured Inconel 625</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An innovative method is developed for accurate determination of thermodynamic properties as a function of temperature by revisiting the density functional theory (DFT) based quasiharmonic approach (QHA). The present methodology individually evaluates the contributions from static total energy, phonon, and thermal electron to free energy for increased efficiency and accuracy. The Akaike information criterion with a correction (AICc) is used to select models and model parameters for fitting each contribution as a function of volume. Using the additively manufactured Inconel alloy 625 (IN625) as an example, predicted temperature-dependent linear coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) agrees well with dilatometer measurements and values in the literature. Sensitivity and uncertainty are also analyzed for the predicted IN625 CTE due to different structural configurations used by DFT, and hence different equilibrium properties determined.</description>

      <title>Advanced surrogate model for electron-scale turbulence in tokamak pedestals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive an advanced surrogate model for predicting turbulent transport in the edge of tokamaks driven by electron temperature gradient (ETG) modes. Our derivation is based on a recently developed sensitivity-driven sparse grid interpolation approach for uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis at scale, which informs the set of parameters that define the surrogate model as a scaling law. Our model reveals that ETG-driven electron heat flux is influenced by the safety factor $q$, electron beta $\beta_e$, and normalized electron Debye length $\lambda_D$, in addition to well established parameters such as the electron temperature and density gradients. To assess the trustworthiness of our model's predictions beyond training, we compute prediction intervals using bootstrapping. The surrogate model's predictive power is tested across a wide range of parameter values, including within-distribution testing parameters (to verify our model) as well as out-of-bounds and out-of-distribution testing (to validate the proposed model). Overall, validation efforts show that our model competes well with, or even outperforms, existing scaling laws in predicting ETG-driven transport.</description>

      <title>A dissipative extension to ideal hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a formulation of special relativistic, dissipative hydrodynamics (SRDHD) derived from the well-established M\"uller- Israel-Stewart (MIS) formalism using an expansion in deviations from ideal behaviour. By re-summing the non-ideal terms, our approach extends the Euler equations of motion for an ideal fluid through a series of additional source terms that capture the effects of bulk viscosity, shear viscosity and heat flux. For efficiency these additional terms are built from purely spatial derivatives of the primitive fluid variables. The series expansion is parametrized by the dissipation strength and timescale coefficients, and is therefore rapidly convergent near the ideal limit. We show, using numerical simulations, that our model reproduces the dissipative fluid behaviour of other formulations. As our formulation is designed to avoid the numerical stiffness issues that arise in the traditional MIS formalism for fast relaxation timescales, it is roughly an order of magnitude faster than standard methods near the ideal limit.</description>

      <title>Bi-Hamiltonian in Semiflexible Polymer as Strongly Coupled System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When many body system in Classical Mechanics is described using bi-Hamiltonian for its group of particles which forms a coarse grained bead, the damping energy from the heat bath perturbs the motion of a particle which is along the trajectory of multiple Hamiltonian system simultaneously. As managing the coarse grained modeling of the suspended semiflexible polymer like single walled carbon nanotubes(SWCNT) in vacuum, the authors discovered that such interconnection between Hamiltonian systems as sharing a heat bath builds a strongly coupled system. The consequence of this interconnection is revealed to form certain form of cross correlated momentum in coarsed grained system as well as in the original atomic scales. In this paper, we adapt the framework of Stochastic Thermodynamics to describe the cross correlation of bi-Hamiltonian system which replicates the macroscopic behaviour of SWCNT under the Smoluchowski picture for cross correlation between Hamiltonian systems. The numerical experiments using collision between tubes confirms the derivation and the justification of the usage of the heat diffusion to compensate the abnormaly from cross correlated momentum.</description>

      <title>Multem 3: An updated and revised version of the program for transmission and band calculations of photonic crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present here Multem 3, an updated and revised version of Multem 2, which syntax has been upgraded to Fortran 2018, with the source code being divided into modules. Multem 3 is equipped with LAPACK, the state-of-the art Faddeeva complex error function routine, and the Bessel function package AMOS. The amendments significantly improve both the speed, convergence, and precision of Multem 2. Increased stability allows to freely increase the cut-off value LMAX on the number of spherical vector wave functions and the cut-off value RMAX controlling the maximal length of reciprocal vectors taken into consideration. An immediate bonus is that Multem 3 can be reliably used to describe bound states in the continuum (BICs). To ensure convergence of the layer coupling scheme, it appears that appreciably larger values of convergence paramaters LMAX and RMAX are required than those reported in numerous published work in the past using Multem 2. We hope that Multem 3 will become a reliable and fast alternative to generic commercial software, such as COMSOL Multiphysics, CST Microwave Studio, or Ansys HFSS, and that it will become the code of choice for various optimization tasks for a large number of research groups. The improvements concern the core part of Multem 2, which is common to the extensions of Multem 2 for acoustic and elastic multiple scattering and to the original layer-Kohn-Korringa-Rostocker (LKKR) code. Therefore, the enhancements presented here can be readily applied to the above codes as well.</description>

      <title>Active learning of effective Hamiltonian for super-large-scale atomic structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08929v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first-principles-based effective Hamiltonian scheme provides one of the most accurate modeling technique for large-scale structures, especially for ferroelectrics. However, the parameterization of the effective Hamiltonian is complicated and can be difficult for some complex systems such as high-entropy perovskites. Here, we propose a general form of effective Hamiltonian and develop an active machine learning approach to parameterize the effective Hamiltonian based on Bayesian linear regression. The parameterization is employed in molecular dynamics simulations with the prediction of energy, forces, stress and their uncertainties at each step, which decides whether first-principles calculations are executed to retrain the parameters. Structures of BaTiO$_3$, Pb(Zr$_{0.75}$Ti$_{0.25}$)O$_3$ and (Pb,Sr)TiO$_3$ system are taken as examples to show the accuracy of this approach, as compared with conventional parametrization method and experiments. This machine learning approach provides a universal and automatic way to compute the effective Hamiltonian parameters for any considered complex systems with super-large-scale (more than $10^7$ atoms) atomic structures.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear interaction of two cross-propagating plane waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00445v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An ideal contrast-enhanced ultrasound image should display microbubble-induced nonlinearities while avoiding wave propagation nonlinearities. One of the most successful ultrasound pulse sequences to disentangle these nonlinear effects relies on the transmission of cross-propagating plane waves. However, theory describing the noncollinear nonlinear interaction of two finite plane waves has not been fully developed and a better understanding of these effects would improve contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging further. Here, local nonlinear interactions at the intersection of two plane-waves are investigated by extending the Westervelt equation with a term including the Lagrangian density. The Iterative Nonlinear Contrast Source (INCS) method is employed to numerically solve this full nonlinear wave equation for two 3D finite cross-propagating pulsed plane waves. In addition, analytical expressions for the cross-propagation of two infinite continuous plane waves are derived. Numerical results obtained with INCS show good agreement with the analytical expressions. Overall, the generated results show that the pressure associated with local nonlinear effects is two orders of magnitude lower than the pressure associated with global nonlinear effects. Local nonlinear effects are therefore expected to be negligible in the context of single-shot ultrasound imaging, but they may influence approaches that subtract pressure fields such as amplitude modulation or pulse inversion.</description>

      <title>The atomizing pulsed jet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01959v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Direct Numerical Simulations of the injection of a pulsed round liquid jet in a stagnant gas are performed. The Reynolds and Weber numbers and the density ratio are sufficiently large for reaching a complex high-speed atomization regime. The Weber number based on grid size is small, an indication that the simulations are very well resolved. Computations are performed using octree adaptive mesh refinement using the Basilisk free-code platform, down to a specified minimum grid size $\Delta$. Qualitative analysis of the flow and its topology reveal a complex structure of ligaments, sheets, droplets and bubbles that evolve and interact through impacts, ligament breakup, sheet rupture and engulfment of air bubbles in the liquid. A rich gallery of images of entangled structures is produced. Most processes occurring in this type of atomization are reproduced in detail, except at the instant of thin sheet perforation or breakup. We analyze drop statistics, showing that as the grid resolution is increased, the small-scale part of the distribution does not converge, and contains a large number of droplets close in order of magnitude to the minimum grid size with a significant peak at $d = 3\Delta$ . This non-convergence arises from the numerical sheet breakup effect, in which the interface becomes rough just before it breaks. The rough appearance of the interface is associated to a high-wavenumber oscillation of the curvature. To recover convergence, we apply the controlled "manifold death" numerical procedure, in which thin sheets are detected, and then pierced by fiat before they reach a set critical thickness $h_c$ that is always larger than $6 \Delta$. This allows convergence of the droplet frequency above a certain critical diameter $d_c$ above and close to $h_c$. A unimodal distribution is observed in the converged range.</description>

      <title>An Unstructured Body-of-Revolution Electromagnetic Particle-in-Cell Algorithm with Radial Perfectly Matched Layers and Dual Polarizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07396v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A novel electromagnetic particle-in-cell algorithm has been developed for fully kinetic plasma simulations on unstructured (irregular) meshes in complex body-of-revolution geometries. The algorithm, implemented in the BORPIC++ code, utilizes a set of field scalings and a coordinate mapping, reducing the Maxwell field problem in a cylindrical system to a Cartesian finite element Maxwell solver in the meridian plane. The latter obviates the cylindrical coordinate singularity in the symmetry axis. The choice of an unstructured finite element discretization enhances the geometrical flexibility of the BORPIC++ solver compared to the more traditional finite difference solvers. Symmetries in Maxwell's equations are explored to decompose the problem into two dual polarization states with isomorphic representations that enable code reuse. The particle-in-cell scatter and gather steps preserve charge-conservation at the discrete level. Our previous algorithm (BORPIC+) discretized the E and B field components of TE-phi and TM-phi polarizations on the finite element (primal) mesh. A cylindrical perfectly matched layer is implemented as a boundary condition in the radial direction to simulate open space problems, with periodic boundary conditions in the axial direction. We investigate effects of charged particles moving next to the cylindrical perfectly matched layer. We model azimuthal currents arising from rotational motion of charged rings, which produce TM-phi polarized fields. Several numerical examples are provided to illustrate the first application of the algorithm.</description>
