      <title>Solving combinatorial optimization problems through stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method to approximately solve general instances of combinatorial optimization problems using the physical dynamics of 3d rotors obeying Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert dynamics. Conventional techniques to solve discrete optimization problems that use simple continuous relaxation of the objective function followed by gradient descent minimization are inherently unable to avoid local optima, thus producing poor-quality solutions. Our method considers the physical dynamics of macrospins capable of escaping from local minima, thus facilitating the discovery of high-quality, nearly optimal solutions, as supported by extensive numerical simulations on a prototypical quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem. Our method produces solutions that compare favorably with those obtained using state-of-the-art minimization algorithms (such as simulated annealing) while offering the advantage of being physically realizable by means of arrays of stochastic magnetic tunnel junction devices.</description>

      <title>Spin glasses and percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The description of thermodynamic phase transitions in terms of percolation transitions of suitably defined clusters has a long tradition and boasts a number of important successes, the most prominent ones being in ferromagnetic lattice models. Spin glasses and other frustrated systems are not among them as the clusters of aligned spins usually considered in this context start to percolate in the disordered phase and hence fail to indicate the onset of ordering. In this mini-review we provide an overview of the state of the art in this field, including recent advances, and outline the main open questions in the area.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric transfer matrix analysis of Lyapunov exponents in one-dimensional non-reciprocal quasicrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lyapunov exponent, serving as an indicator of the localized state, is commonly utilized to identify localization transitions in disordered systems. In non-Hermitian quasicrystals, the non-Hermitian effect induced by non-reciprocal hopping can lead to the manifestation of two distinct Lyapunov exponents on opposite sides of the localization center. Building on this observation, we here introduce a comprehensive approach for examining the localization characteristics and mobility edges of non-reciprocal quasicrystals, referred to as asymmetric transfer matrix analysis. We demonstrate the application of this method to three specific scenarios: the non-reciprocal Aubry-Andr\'e model, the non-reciprocal off-diagonal Aubry-Andr\'e model, and the non-reciprocal mosaic quasicrystals. This work may contribute valuable insights to the investigation of non-Hermitian quasicrystal and disordered systems.</description>

      <title>Representing Arbitrary Ground States of Toric Code by Restricted Boltzmann Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically analyze the representability of toric code ground states by Restricted Boltzmann Machine with only local connections between hidden and visible neurons. This analysis is pivotal for evaluating the model's capability to represent diverse ground states, thus enhancing our understanding of its strengths and weaknesses. Subsequently, we modify the Restricted Boltzmann Machine to accommodate arbitrary ground states by introducing essential non-local connections efficiently. The new model is not only analytically solvable but also demonstrates efficient and accurate performance when solved using machine learning techniques. Then we generalize our the model from $Z_2$ to $Z_n$ toric code and discuss future directions.</description>

      <title>Bethe $M$-layer construction for the percolation problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The major difference between percolation and other phase transition models is the absence of an Hamiltonian and of a partition function. For this reason it is not straightforward to identify the corresponding field theory to be used as starting point of Renormalization Group computations. Indeed, it could be identified with the field theory of $n+1$ states Potts model in the limit of $n \to 0$ only by means of the mapping discovered by Kasteleyn and Fortuin for bond percolation. In this paper we show that it is possible to recover the epsilon expansion for critical exponents in finite dimension directly using the $M$-layer expansion, without the need to perform any analytical continuation. Moreover, we also show explicitly that the critical exponents for site and bond percolation are the same. This computation provides a reference for applications of the $M$-layer method to systems where the underlying field theory is unknown or disputed.</description>

      <title>Pairing by disorder of dopants in a magnetic spin ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I demonstrate a pairing mechanism of dopants in a magnetic lattice, emerging from the underlying \emph{high-temperature disorder} of the spins. The effect is demonstrated in a mixed-dimensional model, where dopants travel along a two-leg ladder, while the spins feature Ising interactions along the rungs and the legs of the ladder. The dynamics following the sudden immersion of two nearest neighbor dopants in an infinite temperature spin lattice shows that thermal spin disorder frustrates the relative motion of the dopants and enforces them to co-propagate. The predictions are shown to be realistically testable in quantum simulation experiments.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian dynamical topological winding in photonic mesh lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological winding in non-Hermitian systems are generally associated to the Bloch band properties of lattice Hamiltonians. However, in certain non-Hermitian models topological winding naturally arise from the dynamical evolution of the system and related to a new form of geometric phase. Here we investigate dynamical topological winding in non-Hermitian photonic mesh lattices, where the mean survival time of an optical pulse circulating in coupled fiber loops is quantized and robust against Hamiltonian deformations. The suggested photonic model could provide an experimentally accessible platform for the observation of non-Hermitian dynamical topological windings.</description>

      <title>Shear-induced diffusivity in supercooled liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18412v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Taylor-Aris theory of shear diffusion predicts that the effective diffusivity of a tracer molecule in a sheared liquid is enhanced by a term quadratic in the shear rate. In sheared supercooled liquids, instead, the observed enhancement is linear in the shear rate. This is a fundamental observation for the physics of nonequilibrium liquids for which no theory or fundamental understanding is available. We derive a formula for the effective molecular diffusivity in supercooled liquids under shear flow based on the underlying Smoluchowski equation with shear (Smoluchowski diffusion-convection equation) with an energy barrier representing a crowded energy landscape. The obtained formula correctly recovers the effective diffusivity with a correction term linear in the shear rate, in agreement with results from numerical simulations of different liquids as well as with earlier experimental results on shear melting of colloidal glass. The theory predictions are supported by comparisons with molecular simulations of supercooled water and supercooled Lennard-Jones liquids, which confirm that the predicted enhancement of diffusivity is inversely proportional to temperature and directly proportional to the zero shear viscosity.</description>
