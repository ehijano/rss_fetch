      <title>Testing network clustering algorithms with Natural Language Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of online social networks has led to the development of an abundant literature on the study of online social groups and their relationship to individuals' personalities as revealed by their textual productions. Social structures are inferred from a wide range of social interactions. Those interactions form complex -- sometimes multi-layered -- networks, on which community detection algorithms are applied to extract higher order structures. The choice of the community detection algorithm is however hardily questioned in relation with the cultural production of the individual they classify. In this work, we assume the entangled nature of social networks and their cultural production to propose a definition of cultural based online social groups as sets of individuals whose online production can be categorized as social group-related. We take advantage of this apparently self-referential description of online social groups with a hybrid methodology that combines a community detection algorithm and a natural language processing classification algorithm. A key result of this analysis is the possibility to score community detection algorithms using their agreement with the natural language processing classification. A second result is that we can assign the opinion of a random user at &gt;85% accuracy.</description>

      <title>Modularity Based Community Detection in Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a scalable community detection algorithm using hypergraph modularity function, h-Louvain. It is an adaptation of the classical Louvain algorithm in the context of hypergraphs. We observe that a direct application of the Louvain algorithm to optimize the hypergraph modularity function often fails to find meaningful communities. We propose a solution to this issue by adjusting the initial stage of the algorithm via carefully and dynamically tuned linear combination of the graph modularity function of the corresponding two-section graph and the desired hypergraph modularity function. The process is guided by Bayesian optimization of the hyper-parameters of the proposed procedure. Various experiments on synthetic as well as real-world networks are performed showing that this process yields improved results in various regimes.</description>

      <title>Fairness in Social Influence Maximization via Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study fairness in social influence maximization, whereby one seeks to select seeds that spread a given information throughout a network, ensuring balanced outreach among different communities (e.g. demographic groups). In the literature, fairness is often quantified in terms of the expected outreach within individual communities. In this paper, we demonstrate that such fairness metrics can be misleading since they ignore the stochastic nature of information diffusion processes. When information diffusion occurs in a probabilistic manner, multiple outreach scenarios can occur. As such, outcomes such as "in 50% of the cases, no one of group 1 receives the information and everyone in group 2 receives it and in other 50%, the opposite happens", which always results in largely unfair outcomes, are classified as fair by a variety of fairness metrics in the literature. We tackle this problem by designing a new fairness metric, mutual fairness, that captures variability in outreach through optimal transport theory. We propose a new seed selection algorithm that optimizes both outreach and mutual fairness, and we show its efficacy on several real datasets. We find that our algorithm increases fairness with only a minor decrease (and at times, even an increase) in efficiency.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models for Link Stealing Attacks Against Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph data contains rich node features and unique edge information, which have been applied across various domains, such as citation networks or recommendation systems. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are specialized for handling such data and have shown impressive performance in many applications. However, GNNs may contain of sensitive information and susceptible to privacy attacks. For example, link stealing is a type of attack in which attackers infer whether two nodes are linked or not. Previous link stealing attacks primarily relied on posterior probabilities from the target GNN model, neglecting the significance of node features. Additionally, variations in node classes across different datasets lead to different dimensions of posterior probabilities. The handling of these varying data dimensions posed a challenge in using a single model to effectively conduct link stealing attacks on different datasets. To address these challenges, we introduce Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform link stealing attacks on GNNs. LLMs can effectively integrate textual features and exhibit strong generalizability, enabling attacks to handle diverse data dimensions across various datasets. We design two distinct LLM prompts to effectively combine textual features and posterior probabilities of graph nodes. Through these designed prompts, we fine-tune the LLM to adapt to the link stealing attack task. Furthermore, we fine-tune the LLM using multiple datasets and enable the LLM to learn features from different datasets simultaneously. Experimental results show that our approach significantly enhances the performance of existing link stealing attack tasks in both white-box and black-box scenarios. Our method can execute link stealing attacks across different datasets using only a single model, making link stealing attacks more applicable to real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>An information-geometric approach for network decomposition using the q-state Potts model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex networks are critical in many scientific, technological, and societal contexts due to their ability to represent and analyze intricate systems with interdependent components. Often, after labeling the nodes of a network with a community detection algorithm, its modular organization emerges, allowing a better understanding of the underlying structure by uncovering hidden relationships. In this paper, we introduce a novel information-geometric framework for the filtering and decomposition of networks whose nodes have been labeled. Our approach considers the labeled network as the outcome of a Markov random field modeled by a q-state Potts model. According to information geometry, the first and second order Fisher information matrices are related to the metric and curvature tensor of the parametric space of a statistical model. By computing an approximation to the local shape operator, the proposed methodology is able to identify low and high information nodes, allowing the decomposition of the labeled network in two complementary subgraphs. Hence, we call this method as the LO-HI decomposition. Experimental results with several kinds of networks show that the high information subgraph is often related to edges and boundaries, while the low information subgraph is a smoother version of the network, in the sense that the modular structure is improved.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Explainability of Knowledge Learning Paths: Causal Knowledge Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17518v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A reliable knowledge structure is a prerequisite for building effective adaptive learning systems and intelligent tutoring systems. Pursuing an explainable and trustworthy knowledge structure, we propose a method for constructing causal knowledge networks. This approach leverages Bayesian networks as a foundation and incorporates causal relationship analysis to derive a causal network. Additionally, we introduce a dependable knowledge-learning path recommendation technique built upon this framework, improving teaching and learning quality while maintaining transparency in the decision-making process.</description>

      <title>Detection of Malicious Agents in Social Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12619v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-Bayesian social learning is a framework for distributed hypothesis testing aimed at learning the true state of the environment. Traditionally, the agents are assumed to receive observations conditioned on the same true state, although it is also possible to examine the case of heterogeneous models across the graph. One important special case is when heterogeneity is caused by the presence of malicious agents whose goal is to move the agents toward a wrong hypothesis. In this work, we propose an algorithm that allows discovering the true state of every individual agent based on the sequence of their beliefs. In so doing, the methodology is also able to locate malicious behavior.</description>

      <title>Optimal Verification of Rumors in Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.01830v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the diffusion of a true and a false message when agents are biased and able to verify messages. As a recipient of a rumor who verifies it becomes informed of the truth, a higher rumor prevalence can increase the prevalence of the truth. We uncover conditions such that this happens and discuss policy implications. Specifically, a planner aiming to maximize the prevalence of the truth should allow rumors to circulate if: verification overcomes ignorance of messages, transmission of information is relatively low, and the planner's budget to induce verification is neither too low nor too high.</description>

      <title>Fine-Grained Detection of Solidarity for Women and Migrants in 155 Years of German Parliamentary Debates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.04359v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solidarity is a crucial concept to understand social relations in societies. In this paper, we explore fine-grained solidarity frames to study solidarity towards women and migrants in German parliamentary debates between 1867 and 2022. Using 2,864 manually annotated text snippets (with a cost exceeding 18k Euro), we evaluate large language models (LLMs) like Llama 3, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4. We find that GPT-4 outperforms other LLMs, approaching human annotation quality. Using GPT-4, we automatically annotate more than 18k further instances (with a cost of around 500 Euro) across 155 years and find that solidarity with migrants outweighs anti-solidarity but that frequencies and solidarity types shift over time. Most importantly, group-based notions of (anti-)solidarity fade in favor of compassionate solidarity, focusing on the vulnerability of migrant groups, and exchange-based anti-solidarity, focusing on the lack of (economic) contribution. Our study highlights the interplay of historical events, socio-economic needs, and political ideologies in shaping migration discourse and social cohesion. We also show that powerful LLMs, if carefully prompted, can be cost-effective alternatives to human annotation for hard social scientific tasks.</description>

      <title>Effects of Research Paper Promotion via ArXiv and X</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11116v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the evolving landscape of scientific publishing, it is important to understand the drivers of high-impact research, to equip scientists with actionable strategies to enhance the reach of their work, and to understand trends in the use of modern scientific publishing tools to inform their further development. Here, we study trends in the use of early preprint publications and revisions on ArXiv and the use of X (formerly Twitter) for promotion of such papers in computer science and physics. We find that early submissions to ArXiv and promotion on X have soared in recent years. Estimating the effect that the use of each of these modern affordances has on the number of citations of scientific publications, we find that peer-reviewed conference papers in computer science that are submitted early to ArXiv gain on average $21.1 \pm 17.4$ more citations, revised on ArXiv gain $18.4 \pm 17.6$ more citations, and promoted on X gain $44.4 \pm 8$ more citations in the first 5 years from an initial publication. In contrast, journal articles in physics experience comparatively lower boosts in citation counts, with increases of $3.9 \pm 1.1$, $4.3 \pm 0.9$, and $6.9 \pm 3.5$ citations respectively for the same interventions. Our results show that promoting one's work on ArXiv or X has a large impact on the number of citations, as well as the number of influential citations computed by Semantic Scholar, and thereby on the career of researchers. These effects are present also for publications in physics, but they are relatively smaller. The larger relative effect sizes, effects of promotion accumulating over time, and elevated unpredictability of the number of citations in computer science than in physics suggest a greater role of world-of-mouth spreading in computer science than in physics.</description>

      <title>Scalable Temporal Motif Densest Subnetwork Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10608v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finding dense subnetworks, with density based on edges or more complex structures, such as subgraphs or $k$-cliques, is a fundamental algorithmic problem with many applications. While the problem has been studied extensively in static networks, much remains to be explored for temporal networks.
  In this work we introduce the novel problem of identifying the temporal motif densest subnetwork, i.e., the densest subnetwork with respect to temporal motifs, which are high-order patterns characterizing temporal networks. This problem significantly differs from analogous formulations for dense temporal (or static) subnetworks as these do not account for temporal motifs. Identifying temporal motifs is an extremely challenging task, and thus, efficient methods are required. To this end, we design two novel randomized approximation algorithms with rigorous probabilistic guarantees that provide high-quality solutions. We perform extensive experiments showing that our methods outperform baselines. Furthermore, our algorithms scale on networks with up to billions of temporal edges, while baselines cannot handle such large networks. We use our techniques to analyze a financial network and show that our formulation reveals important network structures, such as bursty temporal events and communities of users with similar interests.</description>
