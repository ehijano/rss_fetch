      <title>GPS Observables in Newtonian Spacetime or Why We Do Not Need 'Physical' Coordinate Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some authors have defended the claim that one needs to be able to define 'physical coordinate systems' and 'observables' in order to make sense of general relativity. Moreover, in Rovelli (Physical Review D, 65(4), 044017 2002), Rovelli proposes a way of implementing these ideas by making use of a system of satellites that allows defining a set of 'physical coordinates', the GPS coordinates. In this article I oppose these views in four ways. First, I defend an alternative way of understanding general relativity which implies that we have a perfectly fine interpretation of the models of the theory even in the absence of 'physical coordinate systems'. Second, I analyze and challenge the motivations behind the 'observable' view. Third, I analyze Rovelli's proposal and I conclude that it does not allow extracting any physical information from our models that wasn't available before. Fourth, I draw an analogy between general relativistic spacetimes and Newtonian spacetimes, which allows me to argue that as 'physical observables' are not needed in Newtonian spacetime, then neither are they in general relativity. In this sense, I conclude that the 'observable' view of general relativity is unmotivated.</description>

      <title>The problem of time for non-deparametrizable models and quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article I introduce a distinction between two types of reparametrization invariant models and I argue that while both suffer from a problem of time at the time of applying canonical quantization methods to quantize them, its severity depends greatly on the type of model. Deparametrizable models are models that have time as a configuration or phase space variable and this makes it the case that the problem of time can be solved. In the case of non-deparametrizable models, we cannot find time in the configuration or phase space of the model, and hence the techniques that allow solving the problem in the deparametrizable case do not apply. This seems to signal that the canonical quantization techniques fail to give a satisfactory quantization of non-deparametrizable models. As I argue that general relativity is non-deparametrizable, this implies that the canonical quantization of this theory may fail to provide a successful theory of quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>How do Laws Produce the Future?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The view that the laws of nature produce later states of the universe from earlier ones (prominently defended by Maudlin) faces difficult questions as to how the laws produce the future and whether that production is compatible with special relativity. This article grapples with those questions, arguing that the concerns can be overcome through a close analysis of the laws of classical mechanics and electromagnetism. The view that laws produce the future seems to require that the laws of nature take a certain form, fitting what Adlam has called "the time evolution paradigm." Making that paradigm precise, we might demand that there be temporally local dynamical laws that take properties of the present and the arbitrarily-short past as input, returning as output changes in such properties into the arbitrarily-short future. In classical mechanics, Newton's second law can be fit into this form if we follow a proposal from Easwaran and understand the acceleration that appears in the law to capture how velocity (taken to be a property of the present and the arbitrarily-short past) changes into the arbitrarily-short future. The dynamical laws of electromagnetism can be fit into this form as well, though because electromagnetism is a special relativistic theory we might require that the laws meet a higher standard: linking past light-cone to future light-cone. With some work, the laws governing the evolution of the vector and scalar potentials in the Lorenz gauge, as well as the evolution of charged matter, can be put in a form that meets this higher standard.</description>
