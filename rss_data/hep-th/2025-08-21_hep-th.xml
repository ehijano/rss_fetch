      <title>Exact solutions to complex Type IIB supergravity for complex superalgebra $F(4)$ and its real forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct the general local solutions to complexified Type IIB supergravity which are invariant under the complexified Lie superalgebra $F(4)$. The geometry is a product of complexified maximally symmetric spaces $\mathcal M_{6 {\mathbb C}}$ and $\mathcal M_{2 {\mathbb C}}$ warped over a complexified surface $\Sigma_{\mathbb C}$. We classify the reality conditions that may be imposed consistently to obtain real form solutions within real forms of complex Type IIB supergravity. The latter comprise standard Type IIB, Type IIB$^\star$ and IIB$^\prime$, as well as theories with $3$, $5$, $7$ and $9$ time-like directions. Our classification of real solutions is consistent with and exhausts the real forms of $F(4)$, whose classification we confirm by elementary methods. The geometry of each real form solution is a product of real maximally symmetric spaces $\mathcal M_6$ and $\mathcal M_2$ warped over a Riemann surface $\Sigma$, with various signatures. The real solutions include, among others, known $AdS_6 \times S^2 \times \Sigma$ and $AdS_2 \times S^6 \times \Sigma$ solutions to standard Type IIB as well as new solutions of the form $dS_{1,5}\times S^2 \times \Sigma$ in Type IIB$^\star$. There are no real forms of the complex solutions with $\mathfrak{so} (7;{\mathbb R}) \oplus \mathfrak{so} (3;{\mathbb R})$ symmetry. We discuss the relevance of the complex solutions, and of analytic continuations from $dS_{1,5}\times S^2\times\Sigma$ to $S^6\times S^2\times\Sigma$ within complex Type IIB, in connection with holography for the polarized IKKT model.</description>

      <title>Defect Anomalies, a Spin-Flux Duality, and Boson-Kondo Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the infrared phases of certain line defects in 2+1d quantum field theories are determined by anomalies, including anomalies in the space of defect coupling constants, together with a symmetry-refined corollary of the $g$-theorem. As an example, we prove that the spin-$1/2$ impurities in the 2+1d critical $O(2)$ and $O(3)$ models (known respectively as the Halon and Boson-Kondo defects) flow to non-trivial conformal line operators in the IR, and we supply evidence that the same extends to all spin $s$. We also argue that, under particle/vortex duality, the Halon impurity is exchanged with the $\pi$-flux vortex line leading to spin-flux duality, a proposal which we test with a detailed matching of symmetries, anomalies, and phases. Finally, we write down quantum lattice Hamiltonians which can be used to test our predictions, and give an argument on the lattice in favor of spin-flux duality.</description>

      <title>Spin versus Magic: Lessons from Gluon and Graviton Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum property of non-stabiliserness, also known as magic, plays a key role in designing quantum computing systems. How to produce, manipulate and enhance magic remains mysterious, such that concrete examples of physical systems that manifest magic behaviour are sought after. In this paper, we study two-particle scattering of gluons and gravitons in Yang--Mills theory and General Relativity, as well as their supersymmetric extensions. This provides an interesting case of two-qubit systems, differing only in the physical spin of the qubits. We show that magic is generically produced in both theories, and also show that magic typically decreases as the spin of the qubits increases. The maximal magic in each case is found to be substantially less than the known upper bound. Differences in the profile of magic generation can be traced to the known physics of each theory, as manifested in relations between their respective scattering amplitudes. Our case study may provide useful insights into understanding magic in other systems.</description>

      <title>Bootstrap AdS Veneziano Amplitude with Arbitrary Kaluza-Klein Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a derivation of the first curvature correction to the AdS Veneziano amplitude for arbitrary Kaluza-Klein (KK) modes, using a bootstrap approach based on the world-sheet representation and AdS$\times$S formalism. Our results establish a universal formula for the first order curvature correction without considering any low-lying KK configurations. We give new predictions for Wilson coefficients in the low-energy expansion. In the high-energy regime, the amplitude exhibits a universal exponent independent of the external KK charges, providing a coherent picture of AdS stringy amplitudes in different backgrounds.</description>

      <title>On Entropy Bounds for Irrelevant Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consistency constraints for low-energy theories, especially those lacking Lorentz invariance, have recently garnered attention. Building on results from black hole thermodynamics, we investigate the conjecture that leading irrelevant deformations of a conformal field theory in the infrared must increase the system's entropy. We show that this entropy-positivity conjecture is equivalent to a decrease in the thermal grand potential at a fixed temperature. We then evaluate this proposal against various known positivity bounds and other physical constraints on effective theories: for $U(1)$ Goldstone bosons with a quartic self-interaction at (non-)zero chemical potential, for the Euler-Heisenberg model, for the $O(N)$ nonlinear sigma model in $(2+1)D$, and for $T\bar{T}$ deformations of the 2D Ising CFT. We find broad agreement with the entropy-positivity conjecture, and we discuss test cases where the conjecture cannot be applied.</description>

      <title>Vacuum Energy and Topological Mass from a Constant Magnetic Field and Boundary Conditions in Coupled Scalar Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the combined effects of a uniform magnetic field and boundary conditions on vacuum energy and topological mass generation in a coupled scalar field theory. The system consists of a real scalar field, subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions, interacting via self- and cross-couplings with a gauge-coupled complex scalar field obeying mixed boundary conditions between two perfectly reflecting parallel plates. The magnetic field induces Landau quantization, leading to novel contributions. Employing zeta-function regularization within the effective potential formalism, we derive the renormalized effective potential up to second order in the coupling constants without imposing a vanishing magnetic field in the renormalization scheme. Our renormalization approach preserves magnetic contributions while properly removing divergences, enabling a consistent treatment of finite-size corrections, magnetic effects, and interaction terms. We compute the vacuum energy per unit area of the plates, analyze the emergence of a topological mass from boundary and magnetic contributions, and evaluate the first-order coupling-constant corrections at two-loop order. Detailed asymptotic analysis are presented for both weak- and strong-field regimes, revealing exponential suppression at high magnetic fields and nontrivial polynomial and logarithmic behavior in the weak-field limit.</description>

      <title>On bosonic vertex algebras associated with 3D reductions of Argyres-Douglas theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the bosonic VOA associated with the 3D $\mathcal{N}=4$ abelian linear quiver gauge theories arising from compactifying 4D $\mathcal{N}=2$ Argyres-Douglas theories of $(A_1,A_{2n-1})$ and $(A_1,D_{2n})$ types. These VOAs are obtained by cancelling the gauge anomaly of the H-twisted 3D theory on the half-space by Heisenberg algebras on the boundary. We particularly conjecture a complete set of strong generators of these bosonic VOAs, which contains more than the Virasoro stress tensor and those arising from Higgs branch operators. We also find that these bosonic VOAs contain copies of the $W_3$ vertex algebra at $c=-2$ as sub vertex algebras.</description>

      <title>Emergent classical gravity as stress-tensor deformed field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a framework in which classical gravity arises from stress-tensor deformations of quantum field theories (QFTs). By expressing the deformed partition function as a gravitational path integral, we propose an equivalent description between a seed QFT coupled to gravity and an effective field theory defined on a deformation-induced metric. This approach, which does not rely on holography or extra dimensions, applies to a variety of gravitational models, including Einstein and Palatini gravity. The deformation parameter acts as a coupling to the emergent geometry, linking stress-energy dynamics to spacetime curvature. The framework provides a calculable, dimension-independent method for studying gravitational theories resulting from QFT deformations.</description>

      <title>Cosmological pole-skipping, shock waves and quantum chaotic dynamics of de Sitter horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic analysis of pole-skipping for scalar, Maxwell, and gravitational waves in cosmological spacetimes. Specifically, working in empty de Sitter space and in Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole geometries, we locate the tower of pole-skipping points of such fields and show that they impose nontrivial constraints on the corresponding bulk two-point functions. Focusing on the gravitational sound channel, we then extract the Lyapunov exponent and butterfly velocities that characterize hypothetical dual many-body quantum chaos at each horizon. These chaotic data precisely match the outcome of a gravitational shock wave calculation, confirming that the relevant pole-skipping points encode high-energy scattering of horizon quanta. Interestingly, the butterfly velocities can become superluminal or imaginary, with the latter signaling a spatially modulated propagation of chaos. Assuming that a holographic dual exists, we translate our results into field theory language and propose that the dual theory can be divided into two entangled sectors that capture the black hole and cosmological horizon degrees of freedom. Our results suggest that the black hole sector becomes increasingly nonlocal as the black hole shrinks and that the cosmological horizon sector exhibits behavior compatible with violations of Hermiticity. Finally, we outline simple microscopic toy models, built from long-range and non-Hermitian deformations of the Double Scaled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (DSSYK)-type chains, that realize these features, providing a concrete arena for future exploration.</description>

      <title>Extrapolating the massive fields to future timelike infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-known that future timelike infinity ($i^+$) in four-dimensional Minkowski spacetime is conformal to the unit three-dimensional hyperboloid ($H^3$). We asymptotically expand massive fields with spin $0,1,2$ near $i^+$ and extrapolate them onto this hyperboloid. These fields oscillate with a frequency equal to their mass and exhibit a universal asymptotic decay $\tau^{-3/2}$. The fundamental fields are free and encode the outgoing scattering data. They are local operators defined on the boundary $H^3$ with which we construct the Poincar\'e charges. The Poincar\'e algebra can be extended to $\text{MDiff}(H^3)\ltimes C^{\infty}(H^3)$ using smeared operators associated with energy and angular momentum densities. For spinning fields, a spin operator must be included to close the algebra. The extended algebra shares the same form as the five-dimensional intertwined Carrollian diffeomorphism and reduces to the BMS algebra at $i^+$ by restricting the choice of test functions and vectors.</description>

      <title>de Sitter locality from conformal field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An important insight from the study of AdS/CFT is that bulk locality can be derived from crossing symmetry of the boundary CFT. In this paper, we take the first steps in extending this statement to de Sitter background by demonstrating how to reconstruct a conformally coupled scalar effective field theory (EFT) with higher derivative interactions in four-dimensional de Sitter space from its in-in correlators. The latter can be computed from a certain EFT in Euclidean Anti-de Sitter space involving two scalar fields, which we derive from crossing symmetry of boundary correlators along with two novel constraints arising from unmixing anomalous dimensions of degenerate operators and equating them in different OPE channels. To facilitate the analysis, we work in Mellin space and apply dispersion relations to extract anomalous dimensions more efficiently.</description>

      <title>Universality of giant graviton correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a class of heavy-heavy-light-light (HHLL) integrated correlators of superconformal primary operators in $SU(N)$ $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory involving two light operators from the stress-tensor multiplet and two heavy operators whose conformal dimensions are proportional to the number of colours $N$. In the large-$N$ limit these heavy operators are dual to sphere and AdS giant gravitons, realised holographically as D3-branes wrapping an $S^3$ inside either the $S^5$ or the $AdS_5$ factor of the $AdS_5 \times S^5$ background geometry. These HHLL correlators thus describe the scattering of two gravitons off D3-branes. In the planar limit we derive exact expressions for the HHLL integrated correlators as functions of both the 't Hooft coupling and the giant graviton dimension. Remarkably, despite exhibiting distinct perturbative expansions at weak coupling, these integrated correlators share the same universal asymptotic series at strong coupling. We also demonstrate that a seemingly unrelated integrated correlator in a $USp(2N)$ $\mathcal{N}=2$ gauge theory, holographically dual to gluon-graviton scattering off D7-branes, exhibits precisely the same strong coupling asymptotic series. This reveals a striking universality of D-brane scattering processes. Furthermore, we compute the exponentially suppressed corrections at strong coupling for all these observables, showing that they are precisely the non-perturbative effects that account for the differences between these integrated correlators beyond the universal asymptotic series. Finally, we comment on the resurgent properties and the holographic interpretation of these exponentially suppressed terms.</description>

      <title>One-loop determinants in AdS$_3$ supergravity with extended supersymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We re-examine the computation of the one-loop partition function of Type II supergravity theory compactified on $AdS_3 \times \mathbf{S}^3 \times X$, where $X$ can be $K_3$, $T^4$ and $\mathbf{S}^3 \times \mathbf{S}^1$. These backgrounds preserve eight supercharges (four left and four right moving) and are known to be holographically dual to either small or large $N=(4,4)$ superconformal field theories. By extending well-established heat kernel techniques, we evaluate the one-loop determinants associated to these supergravity backgrounds. The resulting expressions are then used to reconstruct the characters of short multiplets of the corresponding dual boundary theories. A distinctive aspect of our analysis is the emergence of contributions from multiple gravitational saddle points in the path integral, reflecting the spectral flow structure present in the boundary theory.</description>

      <title>Infrared Extended Uncertainty Principle Corrections and Quintessence-Induced Topology of Reissner-Nordstr\"om AdS Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a unified topological and geometric analysis of charged Anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes immersed in a quintessence field, incorporating infrared gravitational corrections arising from the Extended Uncertainty Principle (EUP). The latter modifies the standard Heisenberg uncertainty relation by introducing a minimal momentum/maximal length scale, which effectively captures long-wavelength quantum gravitational effects relevant to black hole thermodynamics in curved spacetimes. We derive analytic expressions for the corrected Hawking temperature, entropy and heat capacity in terms of the EUP deformation parameter. Furthermore, the inclusion of quintessence, characterized by barotropic indices \(\omega_q = -\frac{2}{3}\) and \(\omega_q = -\frac{1}{3}\), modifies the black hole metric function. By studying the relaxation-time function $\tau(r_h)$, we identify a number of inflection points that depends sensitively on the equation of state parameter of quintessence, indicating a nontrivial impact of the latter on the black hole phase structure. Applying Duan's topological current method to the off-shell free energy, we compute integer-valued winding numbers associated with each thermodynamic critical point. A parallel topological analysis of the photon sphere assigns charges \( \pm 1 \) to individual light rings, showing that quintessence effects can trigger the splitting or merging of photon spheres, while preserving the total exterior topological charge of $-1$.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of dilute anyon gases from fusion constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent measurements on 2d materials tuning between fractional quantum anomalous Hall phases and a plethora of correlated electronic states call for a detailed understanding of the dynamics of anyons. Here we develop a general theory of the statistical mechanics of anyon gases at finite temperature, valid in regimes where the anyons are sufficiently dilute and can be treated as weakly interacting particles. We find that with a minimal set of universal braiding and fusion data, along with information about the hierarchy of anyon gaps, it is possible to construct a distribution function for any dilute anyon gas, as well as derive thermodynamic observables. Our results are built on an anyon exclusion principle manifesting as a constraint on fusion outcomes of physical states. Our approach unifies and streamlines a range of results for itinerant anyon models, from solvable lattice Hamiltonians to large-N field theories.</description>

      <title>The beginning of the endpoint bootstrap for conformal line defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A challenge in the study of conformal field theory (CFT) is to characterize the possible defects in specific bulk CFTs. Given the success of numerical bootstrap techniques applied to the characterization of bulk CFTs, it is desirable to develop similar tools to study conformal defects. In this work, we successfully demonstrate this possibility for endable conformal line defects. We achieve this by incorporating the endpoints of a conformal line defect into the numerical four-point bootstrap and exploit novel crossing symmetry relations that mix bulk and defect CFT data in a way that further possesses positivity, so that rigorous numerical bootstrap techniques are applicable. We implement this approach for the pinning field line defect of the $3d$ Ising CFT, obtaining estimates of its defect CFT data that agree well with other recent estimates, particularly those obtained via the fuzzy sphere regularization. An interesting consequence of our bounds is nearly rigorous evidence that the $\mathbb Z_2$-symmetric defect exhibiting long range order obtained as a direct sum of two conjugate pinning field defects is unstable to domain wall proliferation.</description>

      <title>Spurion Analysis for Non-Invertible Selection Rules from Near-Group Fusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize the framework of spurion analysis to a class of selection rules arising from non-invertible fusion algebras in perturbation theory. As a first step toward systematic applications to particle physics, we analyze the near-group fusion algebras, defined by fusion rules built from a finite Abelian group $G$ extended by a single non-invertible element. Notable examples include the Fibonacci and Ising fusion rules. We introduce a systematic scheme for labeling coupling constants at the level of the non-invertible fusion algebra, enabling consistent tracking of couplings when constructing composite amplitudes from simpler building blocks. Our labeling provides a clear interpretation of why the tree-level exact non-invertible selection rules are violated through radiative corrections, a unique phenomenon essential to ``loop-induced groupification''. We also identify the limit where the near-group fusion algebra is lifted to a $G\times \mathbb{Z}_2$ group, which provides an alternative scheme of spurion analysis consistent with the original one based on the near-group algebra. Meanwhile, we highlight the distinctions between the selection rules imposed by the near-group fusion algebra and those from breaking the $G\times \mathbb{Z}_2$ group.</description>

      <title>Classical constant electric fields and the Schwinger effect in de Sitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study constant classical electric fields and the Schwinger effect in de Sitter space, with potential implications for magnetogenesis and inflationary dark matter production. Treating the photon as a dynamical field, we show that sustaining a constant electric field in de Sitter requires a tachyonic photon mass of order the Hubble scale. This observation has physical implications, as it alters the infrared behaviour of the induced Schwinger current. Using an on-shell renormalization condition consistent with a tachyonic photon, we recompute the current for charged fermions and scalars, finding it to be finite and positive even in the massless limit of the charge carriers-contrary to earlier results predicting a puzzling negative IR divergence. For scalars, we include a non-minimal coupling to the Ricci curvature, enabling us to analyze the conformal limit, where the current closely matches that of charged fermions.</description>

      <title>Contextuality from the vacuum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contextuality, a key resource for quantum advantage, is a phenomenon where the outcome of a measurement is not independent of other compatible measurements, violating the premise of classical hidden variable descriptions of the theory. We investigate the harvesting of contextuality from the vacuum of a quantum field using Unruh-DeWitt detectors. We show that interactions with the field can endow initially non-contextual detectors with contextuality with respect to Heisenberg-Weyl measurements, as quantified by contextual fraction. The harvested contextuality correlates with the emergence of Wigner function negativity, in agreement with known equivalences between these notions. Our results establish contextuality harvesting as a fundamental phenomenon in relativistic quantum information, highlighting it as a resource that can be extracted directly from the quantum vacuum.</description>

      <title>Quantum Monte Carlo calculations in the nuclear shell model by the complex Langevin method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nuclear shell model is known to describe the properties of various nuclei extremely well. However, the auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo calculations cannot be applied to it with general interactions due to the sign problem. The model has therefore been investigated primarily by variational methods, where the accuracy of the results depends crucially on the ansatz for the wave function. Here we perform the auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo calculations in the case of small systems at finite temperature using the complex Langevin method (CLM), which has been successfully applied to various interesting systems with the sign problem over the decade. In particular, we show the existence of a parameter region in which the validity criterion for the CLM is satisfied and the expectation value of the energy obtained by exact diagonalization is correctly reproduced. Thus the CLM can be a complementary approach to the variational method for large systems.</description>

      <title>Disentangling the Origins of the NANOGrav Signal: Early Universe Models and $\Delta N_{eff}$ Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate whether an Early-Universe stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) can account for the common spectrum process reported by NANOGrav, while also being consistent with current and projected CMB measurements of extra radiation. We compute the contribution of effective number of relativistic species, $\Delta N_{eff}$, for a number of Early-Universe models proposed to explain the pulsar timing array (PTA) spectrum. We demonstrate that models predicting $\Delta N_{eff}$ above the CMB limit would be firmly excluded, implying that the NANOGrav signal in tension with these bounds must instead arise from astrophysical sources. We find that current NANOGrav 15-year dataset, sensitive up to 60 nHz, gives a negligible contribution to $\Delta N_{eff}$ and remains well below the present and future CMB detection threshold. However, when we project future PTA capabilities reaching upto 1 $\mu$Hz, even with our conservative estimate we find that Inflation, Scalar Induced Gravitational Waves (SIGW), and metastable cosmic strings can induce a $\Delta N_{eff}$ large enough for $&gt;3.5\sigma$ detection by the Simons Observatory.</description>

Abstract: We construct the invariant $F_K^{\mathfrak{sl}_3}\in\mathbb{Z}[q,q^{-1}][[x,y]]$ for any positive braid knot $K$, whose existence was conjectured by Park, building on earlier work of Gukov--Manolescu. The main step in our work extends a result by the first author on the invariant associated to symmetric representations of $\mathfrak{sl}_3$ to all irreducible representations. We conclude with a conjectural framework for constructing $F_K^{\mathfrak{sl}_N}$ for arbitrary $N$.</description>

      <title>Phenomenological description of the $D^*_{s0}(2317)\to D_s\pi^0$ decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For coupled channels $D^0K^+$, $D^+K^0$, $D_s^+\eta$, and $D_s^+\pi^0$, the $S$-wave scattering amplitudes are constructed taking into account the mixing of the isoscalar resonance $D^*_{s0}(2317)^+$ with nonresonance amplitudes with isospin $I=1$. The phenomenological approach we use allows us to quite simply clear up the general structure of the $D^*_{s0}(2317)^+\to D_s^+\pi^0$ decay amplitude violating isospin. We show that the phase of this amplitude coincides with the phase of the nonresonanct $D_s^+\pi^0 $ scattering amplitude in agreement with the Watson theorem. Its modulus squared, as it should be, determines the width of the resonance peak in the $D_s^+\pi^0$ channel. Taking into account the $\pi^0-\eta$ mixing in internal lines up to the second order inclusively ensures that the unitarity condition is fulfilled. The presented analysis complements the description of the $D^*_{s0}(2317 )^+\to D_s^+\pi^0$ decay based on the coupled channel unitarized chiral perturbation theory. The numerical estimates obtained by us for the $D^*_{s0}(2317)^+\to D_s^+\pi^0$ decay width do not contradict those available in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bianchi I cosmological solutions in f(T) gravity are discussed. We start from diagonal metrics and tetrads and show that their dynamical equations are pretty much tractable analytically, with a possible arena for physical applications. Then we derive a very bad unpredictability of the teleparallel connection in these configurations. Namely, even for the simple isotropic Friedmann universes, one might apply an arbitrary time-dependent spatial rotation to the standard tetrad without changing anything in the cosmological equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: {In the Standard Model of elementary particles the fermions are assumed to be intrinsically massless. Here we propose a new theoretical idea of fermion mass generation (other than by the Higgs mechanism) through the coupling with the vector gauge fields of the unified $SU(2) \otimes SU(4)$ gauge symmetry, especially with the $Z$ boson of the weak interaction that affects all elementary fermions. The resulting small masses are suggested to be proportional to the self-energy of the $Z$ field as described by a Yukawa potential. Thereby the electrically neutral neutrino just gets a tiny mass through its $Z$-field coupling. In contrast, the electrically charged electron and quarks can become more massive by the inertia induced through the Coulomb energy of the electrostatic fields surrounding them in their rest frames.</description>

      <title>GW/DT invariants and 5D BPS indices for strips from topological recursion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological string theory partition function gives rise to Gromov-Witten invariants, Donaldson-Thomas invariants and 5D BPS indices. Via the remodeling conjecture connecting Topological Recursion and topological string theory for toric Calabi-Yau 3-folds, a more direct connection is studied for the subclass of strip geometries. In doing so, new developments in the theory of topological recursion are applied as its extension to Logarithmic Topological Recursion (Log-TR) and the universal $x$--$y$ duality. Through these techniques, our main result in this paper is a direct derivation of all free energies from topological recursion for general strip geometries. In analyzing the expression of free energy, we shed some light on the meaning and the influence of the $x$--$y$ duality in topological string theory and its interconnection to GW and DT invariants as well as the 5D BPS index.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the quantum correction on thermodynamics of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole in the presence of the quintessence matter associated with dark energy. To this end, the modified Hawking temperature, heat capacity, and entropy functions of the black hole are derived. { Investigation reveals that the modified uncertainty principles and normalization factor $\alpha$ restrict the lower bound value of horizon radius to affect the Hawking temperature and the parameter $\eta_{0}$ have a non-negligible effect on the heat capacity threshold.} {Furthermore}, the correction of entropy does not depend on the quintessence matter. It is also examined the equation of state associated with the pressure and the volume in this framework. In addition, we employ graphical methods to compare and discuss the findings within the generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) and extended uncertainty principle (EUP).</description>

      <title>Energy conditions for regular black holes in EFT of gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As Einstein's gravity is a non-renormalizable theory, it can be a good description of physics only at the scales of energy or spacetime curvature below the Planck mass. Moreover, it requires the presence of an infinite tower of higher-derivative corrections, as required in the framework of effective field theory (EFT). Black holes, known to be vacuum solutions in Einstein's gravity, necessarily have singularities in the center, where both Einstein's gravity and low-energy EFT expansions break down. In this work, we address the question of whether, in the presence of matter, regular solutions looking like black holes from outside do exist. We show that the matter distribution supporting the regular black hole solution in the presence of Riemann tensor cube and Riemann tensor to the fourth power EFT corrections satisfies positivity of energy (also called weak energy condition, WEC) and null energy condition (NEC) everywhere outside the horizon. Unlike the case of singular solutions, the EFT description is also valid in the interior of such an object, given that the maximal curvature is bounded and does not exceed the cut-off scale. We found that in a wide range of parameters, WEC is satisfied inside the horizon, but NEC is violated inside the horizon in all cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11896v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a natural identification of cobordism classes of framed links with the fundamental group of the group-completed configuration space of points in the plane, by appeal to Okuyama's previously underappreciated interval configuration model for the latter. Under Segal's theorem, these classes are integers generated by the Hopf generator in the 2-cohomotopy of the 3-sphere, and we identify these knot-theoretically with the writhe sum of the linking and framing number of links. We observe that this link invariant is the properly regularized Wilson line observable of abelian Chern-Simons theory, and show, in consequence of the main theorem, that this arises equivalently as the expectation value of pure quantum states on the group algebra, under link sum, of cobordism classes of framed links. Observing that these quantum states regard framed links as worldlines of anyons in that they assign a fixed complex phase factor to each crossing (braiding) of strands, we close with an outlook on implications for the identification of anyonic solitons in 2D electron gases as exotic flux quantized in Cohomotopy instead of in ordinary cohomology.</description>

      <title>Constructing the Infrared Conformal Generators on the Fuzzy Sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02998v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the conformal algebra on the fuzzy sphere, and in particular the generators of translations and special conformal transformations which are emergent symmetries in the infinite IR but are broken along the RG flow. We show how to extract these generators using the energy momentum tensor, which is complicated by the fact that one does not have a priori access to the energy momentum tensor of the CFT limit but rather must construct it numerically. We discuss and quantitatively analyze the main sources of corrections to the conformal generators due to the breaking of scale-invariance at finite energy, and develop efficient methods for removing these corrections. The resulting generators have matrix elements that match CFT predictions with accuracy varying from sub-percent level for the lowest-lying states up to several percent accuracy for states with dimension $\sim 5$ with $N=16$ fermions. We show that the generators can be used to accurately identify primary operators vs descendant operators in energy ranges where the spectrum is too dense to do the identification solely based on the approximate integer spacing within conformal multiplets.</description>

      <title>A $3D$ Field-Theoretic Model: Discrete Duality Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07849v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate the discrete duality symmetry between the Abelian 1-form and 2-form basic gauge fields in the context of a three $(2 + 1)$-dimensional ($3D$) combined system of the field-theoretic model of the free Abelian 1-from and 2-form gauge theories within the framework of Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) formalism. The classical gauge-fixed Lagrangian density of this theory is generalized to its quantum counterpart as the BRST and co-BRST invariant Lagrangian density. We show clearly the existence of the off-shell nilpotent (co-)BRST symmetry transformations and establish their intimate connection through a set of underlying discrete duality symmetry transformations in our $3D$ BRST-quantized theory. We provide the mathematical basis for the existence of the discrete duality symmetry transformations in our theory through the Hodge duality operator (that is defined on the $3D$ flat Minkowskian spacetime manifold). We briefly mention a bosonic symmetry transformation which is constructed from the anticommutator of the above off-shell nilpotent (co-)BRST symmetry transformations. We lay emphasis on the algebraic structures of the existing continuous and discrete duality symmetry transformations for our $3D$ BRST-quantized theory (where they are treated as operators). We also comment on the appearance of a pseudo-scalar field (with negative kinetic term). This field happens to be one of the possible candidates for the phantom field of the cosmological models.</description>

      <title>Traversable wormhole for string, but not for particle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a Lorentzian wormhole geometry characterized by a closed string massless sector with nontrivial $H$-flux and a scalar dilaton. In the string frame, the dilaton exhibits a negative kinetic term, enabling the existence of the wormhole. The geometry consists of three distinct regions. The middle region contains the throat, and its boundaries with the other two regions form non-Riemannian two-spheres, where a fundamental string becomes chiral, akin to a non-relativistic string. While point-particle geodesics are complete within each region and non-traversable across regions, strings perceive the geometry differently, allowing a chiral string to traverse freely.</description>

      <title>Canonical differential equations for the elliptic two-loop five-point integral family relevant to $t\bar t +$jet production at leading colour</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present differential equations (DEs) in canonical form for a family of two-loop five-point Feynman integrals containing elliptic functions and nested square roots. This is the only family for which canonical DEs were not yet available among those required to compute the two-loop leading-colour amplitude for top-pair production in association with a jet at hadron colliders. We write the DEs in terms of one-forms having (locally) simple poles at all singular points, and highlight the `duplet' structure that generalises the even/odd charge of square roots to nested roots. All transcendental functions in the DEs are expressed in closed form using complete elliptic integrals, while one-forms free of elliptic functions are given in terms of logarithms, including those with the nested roots. In addition to marking a significant step towards next-to-next-to-leading order QCD predictions for an important LHC process, this work represents the first time that a canonical basis of integrals involving elliptic functions has been obtained for a five-particle process.</description>

      <title>Quantum Brownian motion induced by fluctuating boundaries and compactification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the quantum Brownian motion of a point charge arising as a consequence of two fluctuating point-like boundaries. The study considers Dirichlet, Neumann, and mixed boundary conditions imposed on a real massless scalar field. Additionally, we analyze the effects of a fluctuating compactification length on the random motion of the point charge, induced by the imposition of a quasi-periodic condition on the scalar field. By associating a wave function with the length scale of each system, we demonstrate that typical divergences, which commonly appear in scenarios with fixed boundaries and compactification size, are effectively smoothed out. This approach generalizes and extends previous results found in the literature, offering new insights into the regularization of divergences appearing in idealized systems.</description>

      <title>Large $N$ Wess-Zumino model at finite temperature and large chemical potential in $3d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17999v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the supersymmetric Wess-Zumino model at large $N$ in $(2+1)$ dimension. We introduce a chemical potential($\mu$) at finite temperature($T$). The non-trivial fixed point of this model is described by a pair of coupled gap equations. This fixed point behaves as a thermal CFT for all values of the coupling. We find that at large chemical potential these coupled equations simplify and solutions become analytically tractable. We solve them analytically for all values of the coupling at this limit. The solutions admit a systematic series expansion in $\frac{T}{\mu}$. Thus, using the solutions of the gap equation at large chemical potential we can evaluate the analytic form of the partition function, stress tensor and spin-1 current as a perturbative expansion in orders of $\frac{T}{\mu}$. Applying the OPE inversion formula on the scalar and fermion two point functions of the theory, we compute higher spin currents at large $\mu$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss algebraic universality in the sense of P. Vogel for the simplest refined quantity, the Macdonald dimensions. The main known source of universal quantities is given by Chern-Simons theory. Refinement of Chern-Simons theory means introducing additional parameters. At the level of symmetric functions, the refinement is the transition from the Schur functions to the Macdonald polynomials. We consider the Macdonald polynomials associated with the simple Lie algebras, define Macdonald dimensions and dual Macdonald dimensions, and present a universal formula for them that unifies these quantities for algebras associated with simply laced root systems. We also consider mixed Macdonald dimensions that depend on two different root systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14984v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct superinvariants in M-theory via local supersymmetry, which include $(DF)^4$ terms and fermionic bilinear terms with mass dimension eight. The bases of the $(DF)^4$ and the fermionic bilinear terms are classified and the variations under the local supersymmetry are evaluated by using the Mathematica codes. By imposing the local supersymmetry, we find that 24 independent terms of $(DF)^4$ are governed by 10 parameters. The result is consistent with the effective action obtained by analyzing scattering amplitudes of superparticles or supermembranes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10623v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complex-valued Feynman integrals in the imaginary time formalism and zero-temperature limit suffer from particular types of infrared divergences that can not be regulated by integration dimension alone. Related problems leading to integration order dependent results are even further pronounced in the presence of additional scales such as external momenta. This plays a noticeable role in systems featuring fermionic degrees of freedom such as cold Quantum Chromodynamics, where loop integrals are complexified by chemical potential(s). Working in the limit of vanishing temperature, we utilize novel complex-valued extensions to bubble Feynman integrals and study momentum expansions of fermionic loop integrals. The expansions are then used to illustrate the mechanisms of manifested discrepancies between orders of integration, associated with the residue theorem. Finally, we address the issues by introducing a representation avoiding the observed ambiguity and briefly overview classes of integrals insensitive to problems from external momenta.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a constructive gravitational dual of two-dimensional $T\bar{T}$-deformed conformal field theories (CFTs) grounded in their two-dimensional gravity description. This framework can be viewed as a Randall-Sundrum-type braneworld, where two-dimensional gravity localized on the $AdS_3$ boundary is dynamical. Assuming the AdS/CFT correspondence, the holographic dictionary provides a straightforward translation between the $T\bar{T}$-deformed CFT and its gravitational dual. In particular, this $T\bar{T}$ braneworld holography remains valid in the presence of matter. To clarify how our framework relates to -- and differs from -- the cutoff AdS proposal, we examine, in the absence of matter, the effect of dynamical boundary gravity on the bulk geometry. In general, semiclassical integration of the boundary two-dimensional gravity -- weighted by the massive gravity action -- leads to a deformation of the two-dimensional metric on constant-radial surfaces. However, we find that the surface commonly interpreted as the cutoff emerges dynamically as a characteristic bulk surface on which the deformation is neutralized. This perspective opens the door to possible extensions of our framework to incorporate matter effects on the bulk surface in future work.</description>

Abstract: We review the suggestion that it is possible to eliminate the Big Bang curvature singularity of the Friedmann cosmological solution by considering a particular type of degenerate spacetime metric. Specifically, we take the 4-dimensional spacetime metric to have a spacelike 3-dimensional defect with a vanishing determinant of the metric. This new solution suggests the existence of another "side" of the Big Bang (perhaps a more appropriate description than "pre-Big-Bang" phase used in our original paper). The corresponding new solution for defect wormholes is also briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>A Dilaton Sum Rule for the Conformal Anomaly Form Factor in QCD at Order $\alpha_s$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01904v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an off-shell dispersive analysis of the graviton-gluon-gluon ($TJJ$) vertex, extending previous investigations carried out in both QED and QCD. Within the framework of a non-Abelian gauge theory, we extract the conformal anomaly form factor from the trace component of the correlator and demonstrate that it satisfies a one-loop sum rule, valid under the most general kinematic conditions. Analogously to the chiral and chiral-gravitational cases, a spectral flow emerges in which the exchanged intermediate state becomes localized at zero invariant mass along the graviton line as the quark mass approaches zero. The total integral of the spectral density precisely reproduces the anomaly. We examine how the behaviour of these spectral densities evolves as the system approaches the conformal limit with on-shell gluons. The perturbative analysis reveals that such sum rules are fundamental dynamical features of anomaly-induced interactions. In particular, the appearance or absence of associated dilaton poles is closely tied to whether the sum rule is saturated by a pole contribution or by a dispersive continuum. In the conformal, on-shell limit, the particle-pole interaction yields a nonlocal S-matrix element entirely supported on the light-cone.</description>

Abstract: The Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) has recently released new measurements and constraints on inflationary observables. In this paper it is shown that a component of a dynamical affine connection, which is independent of the metric, can easily drive inflation in agreement with these observations. Such geometrical explanation of inflation is analysed in detail here in the minimal model, including the predictions for the scalar spectral index $n_s$ and its running $\alpha_s$, the amplitude of the scalar perturbations and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. Furthermore, this minimal model is shown to provide an inflationary attractor: arbitrary initial values of the kinetic energy density are dynamically attracted down to negligible values compared to the potential energy density in homogeneous and isotropic metrics. Also, the role of the Higgs boson during and after inflation is briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Null infinity as a Killing horizon</title>

Abstract: Symmetries are ubiquitous in modern physics. They not only allow for a more simplified description of physical systems but also, from a more fundamental perspective, can be seen as determining a theory itself. In the present paper, we propose a new definition of asymptotic symmetries that unifies and generalizes the usual notions of symmetry considered in asymptotically flat spacetimes and expanding universes with cosmological horizons. This is done by considering BMS-like symmetries for "asymptotic (conformal) Killing horizons", or A(C)KHs, here defined as null hypersurfaces that are tangent to a vector field satisfying the (conformal) Killing equation in a limiting sense. The construction is theory-agnostic and extremely general, for it makes no use of the Einstein equations and can be applied to a wide range of scenarios with different dimensions or hypersurface cross sections. While we reproduce the results by Dappiaggi, Moretti, and Pinamonti in the case of asymptotic Killing horizons, the conformal generalization does not yield only the BMS group, but a larger group. The enlargement is due to the presence of "superdilations". We speculate on many implications and possible continuations of this work, including the exploration of gravitational memory effects beyond general relativity, understanding antipodal matching conditions at spatial infinity in terms of bifurcate horizons, and the absence of superrotations in de Sitter spacetime and Killing horizons.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Vortex Clusters on a Torus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13158v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the collective dynamics of multivortex assemblies in a two dimensional (2D) toroidal fluid film of distinct curvature and topology. The incompressible and inviscid nature of the fluid allows a Hamiltonian description of the vortices, along with a self-force of geometric origin, arising from the standard Kirchhoff-Routh regularization procedure. The Hamiltonian dynamics is constructed in terms of $q$-digamma functions $\Psi_q(z)$, closely related to the Schottky-Klein prime function known to arise in multiply connected domains. We show the fundamental motion of the two-vortex system and identify five classes of geodesics on the torus for the special case of a vortex dipole, along with subtle distinctions from vortices in quantum superfluids. In multivortex assemblies, we observe that a randomly initialized cluster of vortices of the same sign and strength (chiral cluster) remains geometrically confined on the torus, while undergoing an overall drift along the toroidal direction, exhibiting collective dynamics. A cluster of fast and slow vortices also show the collective toroidal drift, with the fast ones predominantly occupying the core region and the slow ones expelled to the periphery of the revolving cluster. Vortex clusters of mixed sign but zero net circulation (achiral cluster) show unconfined dynamics and scatter all over the surface of the torus. A chiral cluster with an impurity in the form of a single vortex of opposite sign also show similar behavior as a pure chiral cluster, with occasional ``jets" of dipoles leaving and re-entering the revolving cluster. The work serves as a step towards analysis of vortex clusters in models that incorporate harmonic velocities in the Hodge decomposition.</description>

      <title>Effective Pressure of the FRW Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17789v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the effective pressure of the $N$-dimensional FRW(Friedmann-Robertson-Walker) universe in Einstein gravity, Gauss-Bonnet gravity, and Lovelock gravity. The effective pressure is defined by $P_{eff}:=-dE/dV$, where $E=\rho V$ is the effective energy and $V$ is the volume of the FRW universe inside the apparent horizon. The effective pressure in Einstein gravity is always negative and its absolute value decreases with the horizon radius $R_A$. The effective pressure in Gauss-Bonnet gravity is different with the one in Einstein gravity only when $N\geq6$, and in this case, the effective pressure is not always negative and has a minimum. The effective pressure in Lovelock gravity can have multiple zero-points and extreme points. The effective pressure in different dimensions has interesting relations. We also find that under certain condition, the effective pressure is equivalent with the `ordinary' pressure $p$ of the perfect fluid, and this condition do not depend on the specific choice of gravitational theories.</description>

      <title>Quantum Aspects of Natural Top Quark Condensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21243v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In top quark condensation the Brout-Englert-Higgs (BEH) boson is a $\bar{t}t$ bound state. With a UV completion of a single coloron exchange interaction, a recent semiclassical treatment gave a novel theory of the BEH boson as an extended object with composite scale $M_0\sim 6$ TeV. Presently we obtain the semiclassical theory as an effective action, using the source/Legendre transformation techniques of Jackiw, \etal, and fermion loop effects in the large-$N_c$ limit by deploying an auxiliary field to implement the sum of leading fermion loop diagrams. The theory remains natural at the loop level, with fine tuning at the level of a few \%, and the effective coupling of the 4-fermion interaction, $\bar{g}_0^2$, is significantly enhanced by quantum loops over the fundamental coloron coupling, $g_0^2$. Hence a relatively weaker ``topcolor'' theory can produce critical coupling in the effective BEH bound state theory.</description>

      <title>Self-Gravity in Superradiance Clouds: Implications for Binary Dynamics and Observational Prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spinning black holes could produce ultralight particles via the superradiance instability. These particles form a dense cloud around the host black hole, introducing new opportunities for the detection of ultralight new physics. When the black hole is part of a binary system, the binary can trigger transitions among different states of the cloud configuration. Such transitions backreact on the orbital dynamics, modifying the frequency evolution of the emitted gravitational waves. Based on this observation, black hole binaries were proposed as a way to test the existence of ultralight particles. We investigate the effects of the self-gravity of the cloud on the orbital evolution and on the gravitational wave emission. We find that cloud self-gravity could lead to a density-dependent modification of the energy levels of ultralight particles and that it could alter the order of hyperfine energy levels. The crossing of hyperfine levels prevents binaries from triggering resonant hyperfine transitions and allows them to approach radii that could trigger resonant transitions of fine levels. We study the implications of these findings, especially in the context of future space-borne gravitational wave observatory, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). For quasi-circular, prograde and equatorial orbits, we find that LISA could probe ultralight particles in the mass range $10^{-15}\,{\rm eV} \, - \, 10^{-13}\, {\rm eV}$ through gravitational wave observations.</description>

      <title>On quantum creation of a toroidal universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08747v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the quantum creation of a universe with flat spatial sections and the topology of a 3-torus, taking into account the effect of Casimir energy. We show that the corresponding instantons are singular. Since these instantons describe universes originating in a state of infinite energy, we argue that they cannot be interpreted as quantum creation from `nothing'. If quantum corrections to the energy-momentum tensor are neglected, the spacetime of the toroidal universe reduces to de Sitter space with appropriate periodic identifications. Contrary to previous claims in the literature, this spacetime is geodesically incomplete. We argue that this spacetime describes a classical universe originating at a singularity, and not a quantum origin. We conclude that the quantum creation of a toroidal universe from nothing cannot be described in the context of semiclassical quantum gravity -- it is either impossible, or it depends essentially on Planck-scale physics. We therefore see no reasonable way to compare the probability of creation of a toroidal universe, if it is possible at all, with that of a spherical universe.</description>

      <title>Entropy, purity and gluon cascades at high energies with recombinations and transitions to vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13781v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study one dimensional dipole cascade models in the high-energy limit of QCD. Motivated by data on hadron multiplicities in the LHCb kinematical range, we generalize existing cascade models for splitting and recombination to account also for transitions to the vacuum. This modification allows us to describe the data. Furthermore, we perform both analytical and numerical studies of the cascades and find that the cascade including loop corrections, as well as the one accounting for transitions to the vacuum, can both be related to the Negative Binomial Distribution. In the latter case, however, one must properly normalize the cascade to account for transitions to the vacuum. We also study the scaling properties of the cascades and identify new regimes, which we call "focal" and "parallel." Finally, we investigate the Quantum Information (QI) measures of the cascades, which allow us to highlight their distinctive properties.</description>
