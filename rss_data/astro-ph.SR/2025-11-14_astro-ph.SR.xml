      <title>Is a 1D perturbative method sufficient for asteroseismic modelling of $\beta$ Cephei pulsators? Implications for measurements of rotation and internal magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asymmetries in the observed rotational splittings of a multiplet contain information about the star's rotation profile and internal magnetic field. However, to exploit this information, highly accurate theoretical predictions are needed. We aim to quantify the difference in the predicted mode asymmetries between a 1D perturbative method, and a 2D method that includes a 2D stellar structure model, which takes rotation into account. We then put these differences in the context of asteroseismic measurements of internal magnetic fields. We couple the 1D pulsation codes GYRE and StORM to the 2D stellar structure code ESTER and compare the oscillation predictions with the results from the 2D TOP pulsation code. We focus on ZAMS models representative of rotating $\beta$~Cephei pulsators, going up to 20% of the critical rotation rate. We find a generally good agreement between the oscillation frequencies resulting from the 1D and 2D pulsation codes. Since the magnetic asymmetries are small compared to the differences in the rotational asymmetries resulting from the 1D and 2D predictions, accurate measurements of the magnetic field are in most cases challenging. Differences in the predicted mode asymmetries between 1D perturbative methods and 2D non-perturbative methods can greatly hinder accurate measurements of internal magnetic fields in main-sequence pulsators with low-order modes. Nevertheless, reasonably accurate measurements could be possible with $n_{pg} \ge 2$ modes if the internal rotation is roughly below 10% of the critical rotation frequency for (aligned) magnetic fields on the order of a few hundred kG. While the differences between the 1D and 2D predictions are mostly too large for internal magnetic field detections, the rotational asymmetries predicted by StORM are in general accurate enough for asteroseismic modelling of the stellar rotation in main-sequence stars.</description>

      <title>Simulated Real-Time Testing of the Prototype Implementation of the SOFIE Model: The 2025 Space Weather Prediction Testbed Exercise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The CLEAR Space Weather Center of Excellence's solar energetic particle (SEP) prediction model, SOlar wind with FIeld lines and Energetic particles (SOFIE), was run and evaluated on-site during the Space Weather Prediction Testbed (SWPT) exercise at NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC) in May 2025. As a physics-based SEP simulation and prediction model, SOFIE simulates the acceleration and transport of energetic particles in the coronal mass ejection (CME) driven shock in the solar corona and inner heliosphere. It has been validated against historical events. However, questions remain regarding whether a physics-based model, traditionally considered computationally expensive, could meet operational needs. The SWPT exercise offered a valuable opportunity to evaluate SOFIE's performance under simulated real-time conditions. Interactive feedback during the exercise from SWPC forecasters, SRAG console operators, CCMC personnel, and M2M SWAO analysts led to significant strategic improvements in the model setup to meet operational requirements. The resolution of the simulation domain was optimized by combining a coarser background grid with higher-resolution regions along the CME path and facing toward Earth, reducing computational cost without compromising accuracy. In this work, we present the operational performance of SOFIE and its capability to predict SEP fluxes significantly faster than real time. SOFIE was able to complete a 4-day SEP simulation within 5 hours on a supercomputer with 1,000 CPU cores during the SWPT exercise. This marks a critical milestone in demonstrating both the robustness and operational usefulness of SOFIE to support future human space exploration.</description>

      <title>Towards model-free stellar chemical abundances. Potential applications in the search for chemically peculiar stars in large spectroscopic surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chemical abundance determinations from stellar spectra are challenged by observational noise, limitations in stellar models, and departures from simplifying assumptions. While traditional and supervised machine learning methods have made remarkable progress in estimating atmospheric parameters and chemical compositions within existing physical models, these factors still constrain our ability to fully exploit the vast data sets provided by modern spectroscopic surveys. We aim to develop a self-supervised, disentangled representation learning framework that extracts chemically meaningful features directly from spectra, without relying on externally imposed label catalogs. We build a variational autoencoder-based representation learning model with physics-inspired structure: multiple decoders each focus on spectral regions dominated by a particular element, enforcing that each latent dimension maps to a single abundance. To evaluate the potential application of our framework, we trained and validated the model on low-resolution, low signal-to-noise synthetic spectra focusing on $\rm [Fe/H]$, $\rm [C/Fe]$, and $\rm [\alpha/Fe]$. We then demonstrate how the trained model can be used to flag stars as chemically enhanced or depleted in these abundances based on their position within the latent distribution. Our model successfully learns a representation of spectra whose axes correlate tightly with the target abundances ($r=0.92\pm0.01$ for $\rm [Fe/H]$, $r=0.92\pm0.01$ for $\rm [C/Fe]$, $r=0.82\pm0.02$ for $\rm [\alpha/Fe]$). The disentangled representations provide a robust means to distinguish stars based on their chemical properties, offering an efficient and scalable solution for large spectroscopic surveys.</description>

      <title>Fast Rotating Blue Straggler Stars in the globular cluster NGC 1851</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we study the rotational velocities of a sample of blue straggler stars (BSSs) and reference stars belonging to the Galactic globular cluster NGC 1851, using high-resolution spectra acquired with FLAMES-GIRAFFE at the ESO/VLT. After field decontamination based on radial velocities and proper motions, the final sample of member stars is composed of 15 BSSs and 45 reference stars populating the red giant and horizontal branches of the cluster. In agreement with previous findings, the totality of reference stars has negligible rotation (lower than 15 km/s). In contrast, we find high values of rotational velocity (up to $\sim$ 150 km/s) for a sub-sample of BSSs. By defining the threshold for fast rotating BSSs at 40 km/s, we found 4 fast-rotating BSSs out of 15, corresponding to a percentage of 27 $\pm$ 14 %. This results delineates a monotonically decreasing trend (instead of a step function) between the percentage of fast spinning BSSs and the central concentration and density of the host cluster, supporting a scenario where recent BSS formation preferentially occurs in low-density environments from the evolution of binary systems.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the magnetic fields in massive young stellar objects with masers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze observational data on methanol masers in the disks of young massive stellar objects in the massive star formation regions: NGC6334I, G33.641-0.228, G12.89+0.49. Special attention is paid to analysis of the magnetic fields and their possible connection with maser flares. For this purpose, we estimate the distance from star to maser, the magnetospheric radius and magnetic field strength in the region of this radius. The distances from stars to masing regions lie in range from 380 to 620 au. Stellar and disk's magnetic field strengths are comparable at the magnetosphere boundary and lie in the range from 590 to 1880 G for considered objects. Our estimates show that the magnetic fields may play an important role in the considered regions. In particular, observed luminosity bursts and maser flares may be related to magnetic reconnection events near the stars.</description>

      <title>Alfven Waves in Partially Ionised Solar Steady-State Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our study investigates the properties of Alfv\'en waves in partially ionised solar plasmas in the presence of steady, field-aligned, flows of charged and neutral particles. Our work aims to understand how such flows modify wave propagation and damping in environments where ion-neutral collisions are significant. We employ a two-fluid model that treats ions and neutrals as separate, colliding fluids and incorporates background steady flows for both species. Using a combination of analytical dispersion analysis and numerical solutions, we examine the impact of these flows on the behaviour of Alfv\'en waves. Our results show that steady flows lead to substantial modifications of wave properties, including Doppler shifts, propagation direction reversal, flow-dependent changes in damping rates, and the appearance of a new mode associated with neutral flow and collisional coupling. We also identify conditions under which flow-driven mode conversion can arise. Our results offer new insights into the interplay between plasma flows and particle collisions in the regions of the solar atmosphere where partial ionisation is relevant.</description>

      <title>A predictive framework for realistic star planet radio emission in compact systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio emission from star planet interactions (SPI) beyond our solar system has yet to be firmly detected, primarily due to challenges such as weak signals, directional beaming effects, and low frequency emissions that are blocked by the ionosphere of Earth. Addressing these obstacles calls for strategic target selection. This proof of concept study aims to improve SPI target prioritization by simulating SPI induced radio emission frequencies and estimating associated radio power to identify systems most likely to produce detectable signals. We combine Zeeman Doppler Imaging (ZDI) maps with 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) stellar wind simulations and use the ExPRES code to model SPI driven radio emissions. We also estimate the intensity of these emissions using the Radio Magnetic Scaling Law, based on the magnetic field and plasma density parameters from the 3D wind models. This approach is applied to systems such as Tau Boo, HD 179949, and HD 189733 to assess their detectability with current and future radio telescopes. This framework, tested on benchmark systems, is applicable to any star planet system with available ZDI maps and wind models. As magnetic field reconstructions and wind simulations improve, the method will become more robust. It provides a data driven approach to prioritize targets and optimize telescope scheduling. This shall enable systematic exploration of magnetic SPI radio emissions across a wide range of exoplanetary systems.</description>

      <title>Collisional and magnetic effects on the polarization of the solar oxygen infrared triplet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: The scattering polarization of the infrared (IR) triplet of neutral oxygen (O\,\textsc{i}) near 777\,nm provides a powerful diagnostic of solar atmospheric conditions. However, interpreting such polarization requires a rigorous treatment of isotropic depolarizing collisions between O\,\textsc{i} atoms and neutral hydrogen.
  Aims: We aim to investigate the combined effects of collisional and magnetic depolarization in shaping the alignment of O\,\textsc{i} levels (and thus the polarization of the O\,\textsc{i} IR triplet).
  Methods: We compute, for the first time, a comprehensive set of collisional depolarization and polarization transfer rates for the relevant O\,\textsc{i} energy levels. These rates are incorporated into a multi-level atomic model, and the statistical equilibrium equations (SEE) are solved to quantify the impact of collisions and magnetic fields on atomic alignment.
  Results: Our calculations indicate that elastic collisions with neutral hydrogen, together with the Hanle effect of turbulent magnetic fields stronger than about 20 G, efficiently suppress the bulk of the atomic alignment in deep photospheric conditions where hydrogen densities exceed $n_{\mathrm{H}} \sim 10^{16}$ cm$^{-3}$. In the chromosphere, however, the lower hydrogen density weakens collisional depolarization, allowing polarization to persist.
  Conclusions: Our results are consistent with a chromospheric origin for the linear polarization signals of the O I IR triplet. Future studies should combine accurate non-LTE radiative transfer with reliable collisional rates in order to achieve fully consistent modeling.</description>

      <title>Les Trente Glorieuses: 29 years of helioseismic observations with the Luminosity Oscillations Imager</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Luminosity Oscillations Imager (LOI) of the Variability of Solar Irradiance and Gravity Oscillations (VIRGO) instrument aboard the SoHO mission has been operating for almost the past 30 years.
  I report on the effect of solar activity upon mode frequencies, linewidths, height and energy rate. I report on the variation as a function of frequency for frequency, $a_2$ coefficient and linewidth changes, as well as the average over the degree and the frequency of these changes. Using the 29-year time series, I report on the frequencies, linewidths and mode height fitted with \texttt{progFIT}. Using the collapsogram technique, I also report on the detection of modes below 1600 $\mu$Hz, making the lowest frequencies detected with an instrument observing the Sun in intensity. I also report on the detection of p mode in the high voltage and guiding pixel signals with a mode height about 5 to 10 times larger than what is observed in the Sun-as-a-star signal for $l=1$. The ratios of the observed mode visibilities for the different signals are provided following a calibration of the size of the guiding pixels. While the visibility ratios for the signals excluding the limb are in good agreement with theory, those covering the solar limb are in strong disagreement.</description>

      <title>VELOCE III. Reconstructing Radial Velocity Curves of Classical Cepheids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel framework for accurately reconstructing radial velocity (RV) curves of classical Cepheids (Cepheids) from sparsely sampled time-series data suitable for application in large spectroscopic surveys. The framework provides a set of priors for the principal components of RV curves established based on high-precision measurements from the VELOCE project; template RV curves of Cepheids can be readily extracted from our results. We demonstrate the ability of our framework to estimate unbiased pulsation average velocities, $v_\gamma$, to within $20-30$m/s, and peak-to-peak amplitudes, $P2P$, to within $\sim 2\%$. Subsampling the initial data set, we show that $v_\gamma$ and $P2P$ can be determined to within $\sim 0.35$ km/s and $\sim 6-7\%$, respectively, from as few as three observations. We fitted existing time-series RV data of Cepheids in the LMC and SMC using this framework and obtained typical RMSE of $0.5-2.0$ km/s. The typical total uncertainty on $v_\gamma$ achieved for the SMC Cepheids is $\sim 0.85$ km/s, providing sensitivity to spectroscopic binaries (SB). We identified 8 SB1 systems; two and one of which are new detections in the LMC and SMC, respectively. This yields a single-lined SB fraction of $\sim 25\%$ and $29\%$ in the two galaxies, similar to the Milky Way's SB fraction of $29\%$ established as part of VELOCE. Despite their relatively small number, LMC Cepheids reproduce the known line-of-sight component of the LMC's large-scale rotation, which differs in the extremes by more than $80$km/s. The kinematics of the SMC are more complex and not sufficiently sampled by the available Cepheids. Our framework is designed to yield accurate $v_\gamma$ and $P2P$ of Cepheids observed by large spectroscopic surveys, such as 4MOST, SDSS-V, and others, and will unlock new insights into the kinematics and multiplicity of evolved intermediate-mass stellar populations.</description>

      <title>The Non-thermal Energy Window for Laser-Driven Nuclear Reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astrophysical nuclear reaction rates in stellar environments are governed by the Gamow window, where Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions and quantum tunneling probabilities combine to produce effective reactivity. However, this conventional formulation is inadequate for the non-thermal ion distributions generated in ultra-intense laser-plasma interactions. Here, we introduce an analytical framework, based on a Target Normal Sheath Acceleration (TNSA) mechanism, to evaluate nuclear reaction rates under these non-equilibrium conditions. We identify a new effective energy window and analytical expression of the fusion reactivity distinct from the conventional Gamow window, providing a predictive tool for laboratory astrophysics experiments designed to replicate astrophysical nuclear processes using laser-driven nuclear reactions.</description>

      <title>A Submillimeter Survey of CS Excitation in Protoplanetary Disks: Evidence of X-ray-Driven Sulfur Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sulfur chemistry in protoplanetary disks influences the properties of nascent planets, including potential habitability. Although the inventory of sulfur molecules in disks has gradually increased over the last decade, CS is still the most commonly-observed sulfur-bearing species and it is expected to be the dominant gas-phase sulfur carrier beyond the water snowline. Despite this, few dedicated multi-line observations exist, and thus the typical disk CS chemistry is not well constrained. Moreover, it is unclear how that chemistry - and in turn, the bulk volatile sulfur reservoir - varies with stellar and disk properties. Here, we present the largest survey of CS to date, combining both new and archival observations from ALMA, SMA, and NOEMA of 12 planet-forming disks, covering a range of stellar spectral types and dust morphologies. Using these data, we derived disk-integrated CS gas excitation conditions in each source. Overall, CS chemistry appears similar across our sample with rotational temperatures of ${\approx}$10-40 K and column densities between 10$^{12}$-10$^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$. CS column densities do not show strong trends with most source properties, which broadly suggests that CS chemistry is not highly sensitive to disk structure or stellar characteristics. We do, however, identify a positive correlation between stellar X-ray luminosity and CS column density, which indicates that the dominant CS formation pathway is likely via ion-neutral reactions in the upper disk layers, where X-ray-enhanced S$^+$ and C$^+$ drive abundant CS production. Thus, using CS as a tracer of gas-phase sulfur abundance requires a nuanced approach that accounts for its emitting region and dependence on X-ray luminosity.</description>

      <title>Planetary architectures under the influence of a stellar binary</title>

Abstract: Context. The presence of a stellar companion can strongly influence the architecture and long-term stability of planetary systems. Motivated by the discovery of exoplanets exhibiting extremely high eccentricities (e &gt;= 0.8) in systems with a binary companion, we investigate how planetary orbits around one star (S-type configuration) evolve under the gravitational perturbations of the companion. Aims. We aim to assess the role of a stellar companion in shaping the orbital evolution of S-type planets and to explore whether dynamical interactions in such environments can account for the formation of highly eccentric planets. Methods. We performed a suite of N-body simulations, modeling systems initially composed of three Jupiter-mass planets on nearly circular, coplanar orbits around the primary star. We systematically varied the semi-major axis, eccentricity, and inclination of the stellar companion, to characterize the conditions under which extreme eccentricities can be excited. Results. Our results show that dynamical processes such as planet-planet scattering and secular mechanisms--including the von Zeipel-Kozai-Lidov effect induced by the binary--often act together to produce abrupt and significant changes in planetary orbital evolution, with the outcome strongly dependent on the binary separation. The binary's eccentricity primarily dictates the number of surviving planets, while its inclination not only governs the final eccentricities of those survivors but also drives their orbits to align with the binary plane. Our simulations successfully reproduce the high eccentricities and compact orbits observed in four observed systems, showing close agreement between the modeled configurations and the actual systems.</description>

      <title>Type Ia supernova feedback effects on globular clusters of different masses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Through 3D hydrodynamical simulations, we explore the impact of Type Ia supernova (SN) explosions on the star formation history and chemical properties of second-generation (SG) stars in young globular clusters with masses of 10^5-10^6 Msun. We assume that the SG is formed out of the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) ejecta of first-generation stars plus pristine interstellar medium gas which is modelled as a uniform gas moving at a constant velocity towards the cluster. We tested two values for the infalling gas density of 10^(-24) and 10^(23) g/cm^3. Type Ia SNe start to explode together with the release of gas from the most massive AGB stars. Three simulated models are analyzed. In the low-mass and low-density scenario, we find that SNe Ia quench star formation which however restarts when the gas cools down again in between two explosions. SG stars are dominated by a He-rich population (Y&gt;0.33), which is poorly diluted by pristine gas. In the high-mass models, star formation is mildly affected, while the He composition is significantly altered as exploding SNe prevent the accretion of pristine gas and therefore extremely helium-rich stars form. In the high-density model, such weak gas accretion leads to a maximum enhancement in helium mass fraction much larger than the observed one and not correlating with the initial cluster mass as found in models without Type Ia SNe. As for the iron content, small spreads have been found in all models, but the SG is less homogeneous than the FG, at variance with current observations.</description>

      <title>Mitigating numerical dissipation in simulations of subsonic turbulent flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of subsonic (Mach number~$&lt;1$) turbulence are crucial to our understanding of several processes including oceanic and atmospheric flows, the amplification of magnetic fields in the early universe, accretion discs, and stratified flows in stars. In this work, we demonstrate that conventional numerical schemes are excessively dissipative in this low-Mach regime. We demonstrate that a new numerical scheme (termed `USM-BK' and implemented in the FLASH MHD code) reduces the dissipation of kinetic and magnetic energy, constrains the divergence of magnetic field to zero close to machine precision, and resolves smaller-scale structure than other, more conventional schemes, and hence, is the most accurate for simulations of low-Mach turbulent flows among the schemes compared in this work. We first compare several numerical schemes/solvers, including Split-Roe, Split-Bouchut, USM-Roe, USM-HLLC, USM-HLLD, and the new USM-BK, on a simple vortex problem. We then compare the schemes/solvers in simulations of the turbulent dynamo and show that the choice of scheme affects the growth rate, saturation level, and viscous and resistive dissipation scale of the dynamo. We also measure the numerical kinematic Reynolds number (Re) and magnetic Reynolds number (Rm) of our otherwise ideal MHD flows, and show that the new USM-BK scheme provides the highest Re and comparable Rm amongst all the schemes compared.</description>

      <title>CORONA-Fields: Leveraging Foundation Models for Classification of Solar Wind Phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Space weather at Earth, driven by the solar activity, poses growing risks to satellites around our planet as well as to critical ground-based technological infrastructure. Major space weather contributors are the solar wind and coronal mass ejections whose variable density, speed, temperature, and magnetic field make the automated classification of those structures challenging. In this work, we adapt a foundation model for solar physics, originally trained on Solar Dynamics Observatory imagery, to create embeddings suitable for solar wind structure analysis. These embeddings are concatenated with the spacecraft position and solar magnetic connectivity encoded using Fourier features which generates a neural field-based model. The full deep learning architecture is fine-tuned bridging the gap between remote sensing and in situ observations. Labels are derived from Parker Solar Probe measurements, forming a downstream classification task that maps plasma properties to solar wind structures. Although overall classification performance is modest, likely due to coarse labeling, class imbalance, and limited transferability of the pretrained model, this study demonstrates the feasibility of leveraging foundation model embeddings for in situ solar wind tasks. As a first proof-of-concept, it lays the groundwork for future improvements toward more reliable space weather predictions. The code and configuration files used in this study are publicly available to support reproducibility.</description>

      <title>Population demographics of white dwarf binaries with intermediate separations: Gaia constraints on post-AGB mass transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14786v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Astrometry from the Gaia mission has revealed a large population of white dwarf (WD) + main sequence (MS) binaries with periods of $100 - 1000\,$d. These systems have separations intermediate to predictions from standard binary evolution scenarios, challenging models of binary interaction and mass transfer. Because the selection function of Gaia astrometric catalogs is complex, the underlying population demographics of WD+MS binaries remain imperfectly understood. We present a forward-model of the AU-scale WD+MS binary population probed by Gaia that begins with a realistic binary population and incorporates a full model of Gaia mock observations and astrometric model fitting, as well as cuts employed in producing the Gaia astrometric catalog and selecting WD+MS binary candidates. We model the formation of AU-scale WD+MS binaries as the result of interaction when the WD progenitor is an AGB star. We test several models for the binaries' formation, including stable mass transfer with theoretically predicted stability criteria and two different formalisms for common envelope evolution. None of these models succeed in reproducing the observed component mass distributions or the absolute number of WD+MS binaries. The data are best reproduced by a model in which post-AGB binaries remain wide only if the accretor-to-donor mass ratio exceeds $\sim 0.4$. Our model allows us to constrain the intrinsic population demographics of intermediate-separation WD+MS binaries. The inferred period distribution is close to flat, with ${\rm d}N/{\rm d}P_{{\rm orb}}\propto P_{{\rm orb}}^{0.12}$, while the WD mass distribution is sharply peaked at $0.6\,M_{\odot}$. The model implies that $\sim 0.4\%$ of solar-type stars have WD companions with periods of $100 - 1000\,$d.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18892v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate $g$-mode oscillations in dark matter admixed neutron stars employing a relativistic mean field model to describe hadronic matter and a model for self-interacting fermionic dark matter motivated by the neutron decay anomaly. Following the construction of such admixed configurations, we derive the equilibrium and adiabatic speeds of sound therein, leading to a computation of the star's $g$-mode spectrum in the Cowling approximation. In particular, we explore the effect of dark matter self-interaction, the nucleon effective mass and dark matter fraction on the principal $g$-mode frequency, and its first overtone. We show that the effect on $g$-mode frequency depends predominantly on the dark matter fraction, and demonstrate an equation of state-independent constraint for the latter. Prospects of identifying the presence of dark matter in neutron stars using $g$-mode are discussed.</description>

      <title>ASASSN-24fw: Candidate circumplanetary disk occultation of a main-sequence star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05367v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dusty disks around planetary and substellar companions in outer reaches of exo-planetary systems can be detected as long-lasting occultations, provided the observer is close to the secondary's orbital plane. Here we report optical spectroscopy with KOSMOS (APO), MagE (Magellan) and GHOST (Gemini-S) of ASASSN-24fw (Gaia 07:05:18.97+06:12:19.4), a 4-magnitude dimming event of a main-sequence star which lasted 8.5 months. We discover multiple low-ionization metal emission lines with velocity dispersion $\lesssim 10$ km/s blue-shifted by 27 km/s with respect to the star, as well as kinematically complex Na D absorption. If associated with the occulter, these detections suggest that the occulter is gas-rich. Further, we detect blue-shifted and broad ($\sim 200$ km/s) H$\alpha$ line, which likely originates in the inner circumstellar disk. We confirm the previously reported occultations in 1981 and 1937 seen in historic data, yielding a semi-major axis of the occulter's orbital motion around the star of 14 AU. If the occulter is a circumsecondary disk filling 30-100% of the Hill radius, we estimate the minimum mass of the secondary to be a few Jupiter masses and a disk mass of 1% of the mass of the Moon. Given the age of the star ($&gt;2$ Gyr), the disk is unlikely to be a survivor of the planet formation stage and may be a result of a planetary collision. If Na D absorption and/or metal emission lines originate in the disk, the observations presented here are the first discovery of a circumsecondary disk wind or rotation.</description>

      <title>Neural-Network Chemical Emulator for First-Star Formation: Robust Iterative Predictions over a Wide Density Range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16114v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a neural-network emulator for the thermal and chemical evolution in Population III star formation. The emulator accurately reproduces the thermochemical evolution over a wide density range spanning 21 orders of magnitude (10$^{-3}$-10$^{18}$ cm$^{-3}$), tracking six primordial species: H, H$_2$, e$^{-}$, H$^{+}$, H$^{-}$, and H$_2^{+}$. To handle the broad dynamic range, we partition the density range into five subregions and train separate deep operator networks (DeepONets) in each region. When applied to randomly sampled thermochemical states, the emulator achieves relative errors below 10% in over 90% of cases for both temperature and chemical abundances (except for the rare species H$_2^{+}$). The emulator is roughly ten times faster on a CPU and more than 1000 times faster for batched predictions on a GPU, compared with conventional numerical integration. Furthermore, to ensure robust predictions under many iterations, we introduce a novel timescale-based update method, where a short-timestep update of each variable is computed by rescaling the predicted change over a longer timestep equal to its characteristic variation timescale. In one-zone collapse calculations, the results from the timescale-based method agree well with traditional numerical integration even with many iterations at a timestep as short as 10$^{-4}$ of the free-fall time. This proof-of-concept study suggests the potential for neural network-based chemical emulators to accelerate hydrodynamic simulations of star formation.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Field-Line Curvature and Its Role in Particle Acceleration by Magnetically Dominated Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20628v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We employ first-principles, fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulations to investigate magnetic field-line curvature in magnetically dominated turbulent plasmas and its role in particle acceleration through curvature-drift motion along the motional electric field. By varying the fluctuation-to-mean magnetic-field ratio $\delta B_0/B_0$, we examine curvature $\kappa$ statistics and their connection to particle acceleration. The curvature probability densities display broad power-law wings, scaling linearly in $\kappa$ below the peak and developing hard high-$\kappa$ tails for $\delta B_0/B_0 \gtrsim 1$. As the mean field strengthens, the high-$\kappa$ tails steepen, and large-curvature events are suppressed when $\delta B_0/B_0 \ll 1$. The probability density functions of magnetic field-line contraction, ${\bf v}_E \cdot {\bf \kappa}$, with ${\bf v}_E$ the field-line velocity, develop power-law tails well described by a symmetric Pareto distribution, characteristic of stochastic energy exchanges, with the tails becoming harder as $\delta B_0/B_0$ increases. Our guiding-center analysis shows that curvature-drift acceleration accounts for a substantial fraction of the energization via the motional electric field, and that it strengthens with increasing $\delta B_0/B_0$. For well-magnetized particles, curvature-drift acceleration typically exceeds ${\bf\nabla}B$ drift, polarization drift, and betatron contributions. These results identify curvature-drift acceleration as a principal pathway through which magnetized turbulence transfers energy to nonthermal particles in astrophysical plasmas.</description>

      <title>From M100 to NGC 7331: A Multiband Study and Physical Parameters in Nearby Galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09482v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study five nearby galaxies (M100/NGC 4321, NGC 1300, M 74, M 60, and NGC 7331) by combining multiband imaging (optical, UV, NIR, and X-rays) with simple photometric measurements to show how each spectral window traces different physical components: UV/blue emphasizes recent star formation, NIR outlines the old stellar mass and internal structure, and X-rays reveal compact sources and hot gas. For M100 we present a multiband mosaic with X-ray contours including the SN 1979C region. We compare isophotal morphology in NGC 1300 (barred) and M 74 (unbarred), quantify ellipticity and equivalent radius in M 60, and illustrate a Tully-Fisher distance estimate for NGC 7331, discussing assumptions (inclination, internal corrections) and consistency with classical scales. Our results underscore that a layered view reduces interpretative biases and that straightforward integrations of public data with open-source software yield robust introductory-level physical diagnostics.</description>
