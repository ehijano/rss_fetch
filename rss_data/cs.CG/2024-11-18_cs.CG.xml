      <title>Constant Workspace Algorithms for Computing Relative Hulls in the Plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The constant workspace algorithms use a constant number of words in addition to the read-only input to the algorithm stored in an array. In this paper, we devise algorithms to efficiently compute relative hulls in the plane using a constant workspace. Specifically, we devise algorithms for the following three problems: \newline (i) Given two simple polygons $P$ and $Q$ with $P \subseteq Q$, compute a simple polygon $P'$ with a perimeter of minimum length such that $P \subseteq P' \subseteq Q$. \newline (ii) Given two simple polygons $P$ and $Q$ such that $Q$ does not intersect the interior of $P$ but it does intersects with the interior of the convex hull of $P$, compute a weakly simple polygon $P'$ contained in the convex hull of $P$ such that the perimeter of $P'$ is of minimum length. \newline (iii) Given a set $S$ of points located in a simple polygon $P$, compute a weakly simple polygon $P' \subseteq P$ with a perimeter of minimum length such that $P'$ contains all the points in $S$. \newline To our knowledge, no prior works devised algorithms to compute relative hulls using a constant workspace and this work is the first such attempt.</description>

      <title>Ranking and Unranking of the Planar Embeddings of a Planar Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{G}$ be the set of all the planar embeddings of a (not necessarily connected) $n$-vertex graph $G$. We present a bijection $\Phi$ from $\mathcal{G}$ to the natural numbers in the interval $[0 \dots |\mathcal{G}| - 1]$. Given a planar embedding $\mathcal{E}$ of $G$, we show that $\Phi(\mathcal{E})$ can be decomposed into a sequence of $O(n)$ natural numbers each describing a specific feature of $\mathcal{E}$. The function $\Phi$, which is a ranking function for $\mathcal{G}$, can be computed in $O(n)$ time, while its inverse unranking function $\Phi^{-1}$ can be computed in $O(n \alpha(n))$ time. The results of this paper can be of practical use to uniformly at random generating the planar embeddings of a graph $G$ or to enumerating such embeddings with amortized constant delay. Also, they can be used to counting, enumerating or uniformly at random generating constrained planar embeddings of $G$.</description>

      <title>When alpha-complexes collapse onto codimension-1 submanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a finite set of points $P$ sampling an unknown smooth surface $\mathcal{M} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^3$, our goal is to triangulate $\mathcal{M}$ based solely on $P$. Assuming $\mathcal{M}$ is a smooth orientable submanifold of codimension 1 in $\mathbb{R}^d$, we introduce a simple algorithm, Naive Squash, which simplifies the $\alpha$-complex of $P$ by repeatedly applying a new type of collapse called vertical relative to $\mathcal{M}$. Naive Squash also has a practical version that does not require knowledge of $\mathcal{M}$. We establish conditions under which both the naive and practical Squash algorithms output a triangulation of $\mathcal{M}$. We provide a bound on the angle formed by triangles in the $\alpha$-complex with $\mathcal{M}$, yielding sampling conditions on $P$ that are competitive with existing literature for smooth surfaces embedded in $\mathbb{R}^3$, while offering a more compartmentalized proof. As a by-product, we obtain that the restricted Delaunay complex of $P$ triangulates $\mathcal{M}$ when $\mathcal{M}$ is a smooth surface in $\mathbb{R}^3$ under weaker conditions than existing ones.</description>

      <title>Insights from a workshop on gamification of research in mathematics and computer science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Can outreach inspire and lead to research and vice versa? In this work, we introduce our approach to the gamification of research in mathematics and computer science through three illustrative examples. We discuss our primary motivations and provide insights into what makes our proposed gamification effective for three research topics in discrete and computational geometry and topology: (1) DominatriX, an art gallery problem involving polyominoes with rooks and queens; (2) Cubical Sliding Puzzles, an exploration of the discrete configuration spaces of sliding puzzles on the $d$-cube with topological obstructions; and (3) The Fence Challenge, a participatory isoperimetric problem based on polyforms. Additionally, we report on the collaborative development of the game Le Carr\'e du Diable, inspired by The Fence Challenge and created during the workshop Let's talk about outreach!, held in October 2022 in Les Diablerets, Switzerland. All of our outreach encounters and creations are designed and curated with an inclusive culture and a strong commitment to welcoming the most diverse audience possible.</description>
