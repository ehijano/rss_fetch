      <description>arXiv:2511.05765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the oldest methods for constructing integrable Hamiltonian systems, proposed by Jacobi, recently is being presented as a novel St\"{a}ckel lift construction related with Haantjes geometry. It may cause some confusion.</description>

      <title>Travelling wave solutions of equations in the Burgers Hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We emphasize that construction of travelling wave solutions for partial differential equations is a problem of considerable interest and thus introduce a simple algebraic method to generate such solutions for equations in the Burgers hierarchy. Our method based on a judicious use of the well known Cole-Hopf transformation is found to work satisfactorily for higher Burgers equations for which the direct method of integration is inapplicable. For Burgers equation we clearly demonstrate how does the diffusion term in the equation counteract the nonlinearity to result in a smooth wave. We envisage a similar study for higher equations in the Buggers hierarchy and establish that (i) as opposed to the solution of the Burgers equation, the purely nonlinear terms of these equations support smooth solutions and more interestingly (ii) the complete solutions of all higher-order equations are identical.</description>

      <title>On a class of integrable deformations of the integrable hierarchy of topological type associated to a semisimple Frobenius manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a semisimple Frobenius manifold, we construct a class of integrable deformations of its hierarchy of topological type. We show that these integrable deformations have polynomial tau-structures, and conjecture that for the one-dimensional Frobenius manifold they give a universal object for integrable deformations of the Riemann--Hopf hierarchy having a tau-structure.</description>

      <title>On differential equations invariant under a projective transformation group: integrability and reductions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09800v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a projective transformation and establish the invariants for this transformation group up to order seven. We use the obtained invariants to construct a class of nonlinear evolution equations and identify some symmetry-integrable equations in this class. Notably, the only symmetry-integrable evolution equation of order three in this class is a fully-nonlinear equation for which we find the recursion operator and its connection to the Schwarzian KdV. We furthermore establish that higher-order symmetry-integrable equations in this class belong to the hierarchy of the fully-nonlinear 3rd-order equation and prove this for the 5th-order case as well as for the quasi-linear 7th-order case. We list all symmetry reductions of this 3rd-order fully-nonlinear symmetry-integrable evolution equation to ordinary differential equations by exploiting the 1-dimensional optimal Lie symmetry subalgebras of the transformation group. We also identify the ordinary differential equations that are invariant under this projective transformation and reduce the order of these equations.</description>

      <title>Exact solutions of the reverse space-time higher-order modified self-steepening nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03118v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates a reverse space-time higher-order modified self-steepening nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation, which distinguishes its standard local counterparts through the reverse space-time symmetry. The integrability of this nonlocal equation is rigorously verified by presenting its associated Lax pair and infinitely many conservation laws. Utilizing the Darboux transformation, we systematically construct a diverse range of localized wave solutions on both zero and nonzero backgrounds. These patterns, such as kinks, exponentially decaying solitons, asymmetric rogue waves and their interaction solutions, exhibit novel dynamical behaviors that are not found in the local counterparts. This work not only enriches the family of solutions for the equation, but also highlights the effectiveness of the Darboux transformation in exploring nonlinear wave dynamics in nonlocal systems.</description>

      <title>Isochronous waveforms of Li\'enard equations via commutative factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08659v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Isochronous waveform solutions of homogeneous Li\'enard equations are obtained by a modification of the nonlinear factorization method of Rosu and Cornejo-P\'erez. The scheme is based on the assumption that the intermediate function $\Phi$ that can be introduced in this factorization method depends on both the dependent and independent variables of the nonlinear equation. The method is applied to three cases, a noted cubic anharmonic oscillator, a Li\'enard-reduced form of the Sharma-Tasso-Olver evolution equation, and the cubic-quintic Wilson's Li\'enard equation. All these cases are written in a commutative factored form that allows to obtain the general solutions as solutions of a certain type of Bernoulli differential equation. A theorem is also given asserting the general form of the Li\'enard equation, i.e., for given polynomial degree n of its coefficients, which can be solved by this method. The conditions under which these equations can be also approached by non-local transformations are established.</description>
