      <title>Selective nonlinearities removal from digital signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many instruments performing optical and non-optical imaging and sensing, such as Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging or Fourier-transform spectrometry, produce digital signals containing modulations, sine-like components, which only after Fourier transformation give information about the structure or characteristics of the investigated object. Due to the fundamental physics-related limitations of such methods, the distribution of these signal components is often nonlinear and, when not properly compensated, leads to the resolution, precision or quality drop in the final image. Here, we propose an innovative approach that has the potential to allow cleaning of the signal from the nonlinearities but most of all, it now allows to switch the given order off, leaving all others intact. The latter provides a tool for more in-depth analysis of the nonlinearity-inducing properties of the investigated object, which can lead to applications in early disease detection or more sensitive sensing of chemical compounds. We consider OCT signals and nonlinearities up to the third order. In our approach, we propose two neural networks: one to remove solely the second-order nonlinearity and the other for removing solely the third-order nonlinearity. The input of the networks is a novel two-dimensional data structure with all the information needed for the network to infer a nonlinearity-free signal. We describe the developed networks and present the results for second-order and third-order nonlinearity removal in OCT data representing the images of various objects: a mirror, glass, and fruits.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty components in profile likelihood fits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04007v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When a measurement of a physical quantity is reported, the total uncertainty is usually decomposed into statistical and systematic uncertainties. This decomposition is not only useful to understand the contributions to the total uncertainty, but also required to propagate these contributions in subsequent analyses, such as combinations or interpretation fits including results from other measurements or experiments. In profile-likelihood fits, widely applied in high-energy physics analyses, contributions of systematic uncertainties are routinely quantified using "impacts", which are not adequate for such applications. We discuss the difference between impacts and actual uncertainty components, and establish methods to determine the latter in a wide range of statistical models.</description>

      <title>Fast Identification of Transients: Applying Expectation Maximization to Neutrino Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel method for identifying transients suitable for both strong signal-dominated and background-dominated objects. By employing the unsupervised machine learning algorithm known as expectation maximization, we achieve computing time reductions of over $10^4$ on a single CPU compared to conventional brute-force methods. Furthermore, this approach can be readily extended to analyze multiple flares. We illustrate the algorithm's application by fitting the IceCube neutrino flare of TXS 0506+056.</description>
