      <title>Optimal positioning in derivative securities in incomplete markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper analyzes a problem of optimal static hedging using derivatives in incomplete markets. The investor is assumed to have a risk exposure to two underlying assets. The hedging instruments are vanilla options written on a single underlying asset. The hedging problem is formulated as a utility maximization problem whereby the form of the optimal static hedge is determined. Among our results, a semi-analytical solution for the optimizer is found through variational methods for exponential, power/logarithmic, and quadratic utility. When vanilla options are available for each underlying asset, the optimal solution is related to the fixed points of a Lipschitz map. In the case of exponential utility, there is only one such fixed point, and subsequent iterations of the map converge to it.</description>

      <title>A time-stepping deep gradient flow method for option pricing in (rough) diffusion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a novel deep learning approach for pricing European options in diffusion models, that can efficiently handle high-dimensional problems resulting from Markovian approximations of rough volatility models. The option pricing partial differential equation is reformulated as an energy minimization problem, which is approximated in a time-stepping fashion by deep artificial neural networks. The proposed scheme respects the asymptotic behavior of option prices for large levels of moneyness, and adheres to a priori known bounds for option prices. The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method is assessed in a series of numerical examples, with particular focus in the lifted Heston model.</description>

      <title>Global universal approximation of functional input maps on weighted spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03303v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce so-called functional input neural networks defined on a possibly infinite dimensional weighted space with values also in a possibly infinite dimensional output space. To this end, we use an additive family to map the input weighted space to the hidden layer, on which a non-linear scalar activation function is applied to each neuron, and finally return the output via some linear readouts. Relying on Stone-Weierstrass theorems on weighted spaces, we can prove a global universal approximation result on weighted spaces for continuous functions going beyond the usual approximation on compact sets. This then applies in particular to approximation of (non-anticipative) path space functionals via functional input neural networks. As a further application of the weighted Stone-Weierstrass theorem we prove a global universal approximation result for linear functions of the signature. We also introduce the viewpoint of Gaussian process regression in this setting and emphasize that the reproducing kernel Hilbert space of the signature kernels are Cameron-Martin spaces of certain Gaussian processes. This paves a way towards uncertainty quantification for signature kernel regression.</description>
