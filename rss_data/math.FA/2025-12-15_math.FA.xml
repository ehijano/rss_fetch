      <title>On symmetricity of the norm derivatives orthogonality in operator spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate $\rho$-orthogonality and its local symmetry in the space of bounded linear operators. A characterization of Hilbert space operators with symmetric numerical range is established in terms of $\rho$-orthogonality. Further, we provide characterizations of $\rho$-left and $\rho$-right symmetric operators on finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. In the two-dimensional real case, we show that the only nonzero $\rho$-left (or $\rho$-right) symmetric operators are scalar multiples of orthogonal matrices. However, in any finite-dimensional Hilbert space of dimension greater than two, an operator is $\rho$-left (or $\rho$-right) symmetric if and only if it is the zero operator. For infinite-dimensional spaces, we show that within a large class of operators, the zero operator remains the only example of $\rho$-left and $\rho$-right symmetric operators.</description>

      <title>On Weak Compactness and Uniform Regularity in Lipschitz free Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the properties of weakly compact sets in Lipschitz free spaces. Prior research has established that, for a complete metric space $M$, weakly precompact sets in the Lipschitz free space $\mathcal F(M)$ are tight. In this paper, we prove that these sets actually exhibit a stronger property, which we call uniform regularity. However, this condition alone is not sufficient to characterize weakly compact sets, except in the case of scattered metric spaces. On the other hand, if $T$ is an $\mathbb R$-tree, we leverage Godard's isometry between $\mathcal F(T)$ and $L^1(\lambda_T)$ to obtain an intrinsic characterization of weakly compact sets in $\mathcal F(T)$. This approach allows us to identify conditions that may describe weak compactness across a wider range of spaces. In particular, we provide a characterization of norm-compactness in terms of sums of "large molecules'', while we show that sums of "small molecules'' contain an $\ell_1$-basis.</description>

Abstract: We study a uniform version of the strong diameter two property. In particular, we find a characterisation that does not involve ultrafilters and we use it to provide some examples of spaces with this uniform property that do not follow from previously known results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We solve the commutant lifting and interpolation problems in the setting of the Hardy space and Schur functions on the open unit ball of $\mathbb{C}^n$. Our solutions also signify the role of inner functions on the unit ball, objects whose existence was once in doubt and to which Aleksandrov, Rudin, and others made fundamental contributions. Some of our results, particularly those related to inner functions, are new even in the classical, one-variable case.</description>

      <title>Stratification of the Helffer-Nourrigat cone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a singular filtration on a manifold, e.g. a subriemannian setting, one can understand the elliptic regularity problems through a special kind of calculus. The principal symbol in this calculus involves the unitary representations of a family of graded nilpotent groups. Not all the irreducible representations of these groups have to be taken into account however, the ones that should be considered form the Helffer-Nourrigat cone. This space thus plays the role of a phase space in subriemannian geometry. Its topology is however very singular, preventing any kind of geometry on it. We propose a way to desingularize it. The unitary spectrum of a nilpotent group can be stratified into strata that are locally compact Hausdorff, following Puckansky and Pedersen. We show how this stratification extends to the whole Helffer-Nourrigat cone. As a byproduct, we show that the C*-algebra of principal symbols and the one of pseudodifferential operators of order 0 are solvable with explicit subquotients.</description>

      <title>New insights into Gleason parts for an algebra of holomorphic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the structure of the spectrum of the algebra of uniformly continuous holomorphic functions on the unit ball of $\ell_p$. Our main focus is the relationship between \emph{Gleason parts} and \emph{fibers}. For every $z \in B_{\ell_p}$ with $1 &lt; p &lt; \infty$, we prove that the fiber over $z$ contains $2^{\mathfrak{c}}$ distinct Gleason parts. We also investigate some of the properties of these Gleason parts and show the existence of many strong boundary points in certain fibers. We then examine the case $p = 1$, where similar results on the abundance of Gleason parts within the fibers hold, although the arguments required are more involved. Our results extend and complete earlier work on the subject, providing answers to previously posed questions.</description>

      <title>Minimal projections onto spaces of polynomials on real euclidean spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12123v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate projection constants within classes of multivariate polynomials over finite-dimensional real Hilbert spaces. Specifically, we consider the projection constant for spaces of spherical harmonics and spaces of homogeneous polynomials as well as for spaces of polynomials of finite degree on the unit sphere. We establish a connection between these quantities and certain weighted $L_1$-norms of specific Jacobi polynomials. As a consequence, we present exact formulas, computable expressions and asymptotically accurate estimates for them. The real case we address is considerably more nuanced than its complex counterpart.</description>

Abstract: We study the function $\varphi_1$ of minimal $L^1$ norm among all functions $f$ of exponential type at most $\pi$ for which $f(0)=1$. This function, first studied by H\"{o}rmander and Bernhardsson in 1993, has only real zeros $\pm \tau_n$, $n=1,2, \ldots$, and the sequence $(\tau_n-n-\frac12)$ has $\ell^2$ norm bounded by $0.13$. The zeros $\tau_n$ can be computed by means of a fixed point iteration.</description>

      <title>Gamma-Convergence of Convex Functions, Conjugates, and Subdifferentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work establishes dual and subdifferential characterizations of $\Gamma$-convergence for sequences of proper convex lower semicontinuous functions in weakly compactly generated Banach spaces, which include separable spaces and also reflexive ones, as well as $L^{1}(\mu)$ when $\mu$ is a $\sigma$-finite measure and $C(K)$ spaces when $K$ is an Eberlein compact topological space. It is shown that such a sequence $\Gamma$-converges in the strong topology to a limit function if and only if the sequence of Fenchel conjugates $\Gamma$-converges in the $w^\ast$-topology to the conjugate of the limit function. It is further proved that both conditions are equivalent to the graphical convergence of the associated subdifferentials with respect to the strong--$w^\ast$ product topology. Counterexamples demonstrate that these equivalences break down outside the weakly compactly generated setting. Furthermore, our approach develops a rich family in weakly compactly generated spaces similar to the one recently used to characterize Asplund spaces [C'uth and Fabian (2016)].</description>

      <title>Schatten properties of commutators of fractional integrals on spaces of homogeneous type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02686v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extending classical results of Janson and Peetre (1988) on the Schatten class $S^p$ membership of commutators of Riesz potentials on the Euclidean space, we obtain analogous results for commutators $[b,T]$, where $T\in\{T_\varepsilon,\widetilde T_\alpha\}$ belongs to either one of two natural classes of fractional integral operators on a space of homogeneous type. Our approach is based on recent related work of Hyt\"{o}nen and Korte on singular (instead of fractional) integrals; working directly with the kernels, it differs from the Fourier analytic considerations of Janson and Peetre, covering new operators even when specialised to $\mathbb R^d$.
  The cleanest case of our characterization in spaces of lower dimension $d&gt; 2$ and satisfying a $(1,2)$-Poincar\'e inequality is as follows. For a parameter $\varepsilon \in (0,\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{d})$ describing the order of the fractional integral $T_\varepsilon $, we have a dichotomy: If $\frac{d}{1+d\varepsilon }&lt;p&lt;\frac{1}{\varepsilon}$, then $[b,T_{\varepsilon}]\in S^p$ if and only if $b$ belongs to a suitable Besov (or fractional Sobolev) space. If $0&lt;p\leq \frac{d}{1+d\varepsilon }$, then $[b,T_{\varepsilon}]\in S^p$ if and only if $b$ is constant. This is analogous to the result for singular integrals, where a similar cut-off happens at $p=d$, formally corresponding to fractional order $\varepsilon =0$. We also obtain results for other parameter values, including dimensions $0&lt;d\leq 2$.
  As an application, these results are used to show Schatten properties of commutators of fractional Bessel operators, complementing recent related results of Fan, Lacey, Li, and Xiong (2025) on commutators of singular integrals in the Bessel setting.</description>

      <title>Fej\'er--Riesz factorization for positive noncommutative trigonometric polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09267v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a Fej\'er-Riesz type factorization for positive matrix-valued noncommutative trigonometric polynomials on $\mathscr{W}\times\mathfrak{Y}$, where $\mathscr{W}$ is either the free semigroup $\langle x \rangle_g$ or the free product group $\mathbb{Z}_2^{g}$, and $\mathfrak{Y}$ is a discrete group. More precisely, using the shortlex order, if $A$ has degree at most $w$ in the $\mathscr{W}$ variables and is uniformly strictly positive on all unitary representations of $\mathscr{W}\times\mathfrak{Y}$, then $A=B^{*}B$ with $B$ analytic and of $\mathscr{W}$-degree at most $w$; this degree bound is optimal, and strict positivity is essential. As an application, we obtain degree-bounded sums-of-squares certificates for Bell-type inequalities in $\mathbb{C}[\mathbb{Z}_2^{*g}\times \mathbb{Z}_2^{*h}]$ from quantum information theory.
  In the special case $\mathscr{W}=\mathbb{Z}^h$ we recover, in the matrix-valued setting, the classical commutative multivariable Fej\'er-Riesz factorization. For trivial $\mathfrak{Y}$ we obtain a ``perfect'' group-algebra Positivstellensatz on $\mathbb{Z}_2^{*g}$ that does not require strict positivity; this result is sharp, as demonstrated by counterexamples in $\mathbb{Z}_2*\mathbb{Z}_3$ and $\mathbb{Z}_3^{*2}$.
  To establish our main results two novel ingredients of independent interest are developed: (a) a positive-semidefinite Parrott theorem with entries given by functions on a group; and (b) solutions to positive semidefinite matrix completion problems for $\langle x \rangle_g$ or the free product group $\mathbb{Z}_2^{*g}$ indexed by words in $\mathscr{W}$ of length $\le w$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06539v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a Neural Network that approximates the matrix multiplication operator for any activation function such that there exists a Neural Network which can approximate the scalar multiplication function. In particular, we use the Strassen algorithm to reduce the number of weights and layers needed for such Neural Networks. This allows us to define another Neural Network for approximating the inverse matrix operator. Also, by relying on the Galerkin method, we apply those Neural Networks to solve parametric elliptic PDEs for a whole set of parameters. Finally, we discuss improvements with respect to the prior results.</description>

      <title>On the Riesz transform and its reverse inequality on manifolds with quadratically decaying curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14864v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Riesz and reverse Riesz inequalities on manifolds whose Ricci curvature decays quadratically. First, we refine existing results on the boundedness of the Riesz transform by establishing a Lorentz-type endpoint estimate. Next, we explore the relationship between the Riesz and reverse Riesz transforms, proving that the reverse Riesz, Hardy, and weighted Sobolev inequalities are essentially equivalent. Finally, we apply our methods to Grushin spaces, which exhibit a quadratic decay in 'Ricci curvature', verifying that the reverse inequality holds for all $p\in (1,\infty)$ and that the Riesz transform is bounded on $L^p$ for $p\in (1,n)$. Our approach relies on an asymptotic formula for the Riesz potential combined with an extension of the so-called harmonic annihilation method.</description>
