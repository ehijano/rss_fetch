      <title>Modulation leading to frequency downshifting of water waves in the vicinity of the Benjamin-Feir transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For Stokes waves in finite depth within the neighbourhood of the Benjamin-Feir stability transition, there are two families of periodic waves, one modulationally unstable and the other stable. In this paper we show that these two families can be joined by a heteroclinic connection, which manifests in the fluid as a travelling front. By shifting the analysis to the setting of Whitham modulation theory, this front is in wavenumber and frequency space. An implication of this jump is that a permanent frequency downshift of the Stokes wave can occur in the absence of viscous effects. This argument, which is built on a sequence of asymptotic expansions of the phase dynamics, is confirmed via energetic arguments, with additional corroboration obtained by numerical simulations of a reduced model based on the Benney-Roskes equation.</description>

      <title>Scaling with the Stars: The emergence of marginal stability in low Prandtl number turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To improve models of the structure and evolution of stellar and planetary interiors, it is important to quantify transport by strongly stratified turbulence in low Prandtl number fluids. Recent numerical studies have shown evidence for scale-separated dynamics in strongly anisotropic flows. Motivated by these results, in the first part of this report we perform a multiscale analysis of the governing equations and identify regimes of behaviour. In the second part, we apply algorithms for solving slow-fast quasilinear systems to our reduced-order systems for low Prandtl number fluids and demonstrate their approach to and maintenance of marginal stability. This is a Fellow's Report for the 2022 Program of the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Summer School.</description>

      <title>Role of the argon and helium bath gases on the structure of H2/O2 detonations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the role of two inert mono-atomic diluents, argon and helium, on the detonation structure in order to assess the importance of vibrational non-equilibrium and wall losses. When relaxation effects and wall losses are neglected, the detonation waves in mixtures diluted with either of these gases have the same kinetics, Mach number, and specific heat ratio and hence are expected to lead to the same cellular dynamics. The experiments were conducted in 2H2/O2/7Ar and 2H2/O2/7He mixtures in a narrow channel. The initial pressure was adjusted in such a way that the induction zone length (therefore cell sizes) calculated from the ideal ZND model remained constant. The experiments revealed differences in velocity deficits and cell sizes despite maintaining a constant induction zone length across the mixtures. Near the detonation limits, the disparity in cell sizes between the two mixtures nearly doubled. We incorporated the boundary layer flow divergence in a perturbation analysis based on the square wave detonation assumption and established the controlling loss parameter as the product of the induction to channel size and the inverse of the square root of the Reynolds number. The very good collapse of the scaled results with the two bath gases with the loss parameter, and further comparison with 2D numerical simulations with account for flow divergence to the third dimension, confirmed the viscous loss mechanism to be dominating. Calculations suggest that the slower relaxation of H2 becomes comparable with the ignition delay anticipated from the ZND model and is slower by 70% in the argon diluted system. Differences possibly highlighting the role of non-equilibrium were not observed. This suggests the vibrational non-equilibrium effect may be less apparent in cellular detonations due to the lengthening of the ignition delays owing to the non-steady detonation structure.</description>

      <title>Traveling spatially localized convective structures in an inclined porous medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple stationary, localized structures were recently found for inclined porous medium convection with constant-temperature boundaries. We analyze traveling asymmetric, localized convective structures, consisting of 1 to 5 pulses, in a 2D inclined porous layer with fixed temperature at the bottom and an imperfectly conducting boundary at the top, such that midplane reflection symmetry is broken. Direct numerical simulations (DNS) are performed with different Biot numbers at the top boundary. The drift velocity $c$ of pulses is measured for different values of the symmetry parameter $\kappa\geq0$ based on the Biot number, with perfect midplane reflection symmetry and $c=0$ at $\kappa=0$. In small domains, the drift velocity $c&gt;0$ (upslope), increases monotonically with $\kappa$, while in large domains $c$ changes sign depending on parameters. We show that pulse tails, controlling interactions, depend on the dominant spatial eigenvalues, whose real part is closest to zero, with a transition at $\kappa_c&gt;0$: below $\kappa_c$, both dominant eigenvalues are complex, and the tails are oscillatory. Above $\kappa_c$, the dominant spatial eigenvalue with a positive real part becomes real, and the downslope tail transitions from oscillatory to monotonic. Below $\kappa_c$, bound states with different numbers of pulses exist whose collisions are studied. Well above $\kappa_c$, adjacent pulses repel each other, spreading out and becoming equispaced in the domain. A reduced model is proposed based on the interaction via tails of adjacent pulses, reproducing the repulsion and collisions from DNS. The model shows that the transition from bound states to equidistant spreading occurs when the monotonic/oscillatory tails have the same slope. This study elucidates the motion of localized patterns in moderate-Rayleigh number convection in an inclined porous layer with an imperfectly conducting boundary.</description>

      <title>Electrostatics slows down the breakup of liquid bridges on solid surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally study the breakup of water-glycerol liquid bridges on non-conductive surfaces and find that spontaneous charge deposition at the receding contact line, slide electrification, can have a substantial influence. Electrostatic forces slow down the dynamics during, and cause spontaneous motion of satellite drops after the bridge breakup. We show that our experimental observations align with slide electrification theory. Our findings demonstrate that slide electrification plays an important role in dewetting beyond drop-related scenarios.</description>

      <title>A fully-coupled algorithm with implicit surface tension treatment for interfacial flows with large density ratios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stability of most surface-tension-driven interfacial flow simulations is governed by the capillary time-step constraint. This concerns particularly small-scale flows and, more generally, highly-resolved liquid-gas simulations with moderate inertia. To date, the majority of interfacial-flow simulations are performed using an explicit surface-tension treatment, which restrains the performance of such simulations. Recently, an implicit treatment of surface tension able to breach the capillary time-step constraint using the volume-of-fluid (VOF) method was proposed, based on a fully-coupled pressure-based finite-volume algorithm. To this end, the interface-advection equation is incorporated implicitly into the linear flow solver, resulting in a tight coupling between all implicit solution variables (colour function, pressure, velocity). However, this algorithm is limited to uniform density and viscosity fields. Here, we present a fully-coupled algorithm for interfacial flows with implicit surface tension applicable to interfacial flows with large density and viscosity ratios. This is achieved by solving the continuity and momentum equations in conservative form, whereby the density is treated implicitly with respect to the colour function, and the advection term of the interface-advection equation is discretised using the THINC/QQ algebraic VOF scheme, yielding a consistent discretisation of the advective terms. This new algorithm is tested by considering representative surface-tension-dominated interfacial flows, including the Laplace equilibrium of a stationary droplet and the three-dimensional Rayleigh-Plateau instability of a liquid filament. The presented results demonstrate that interfacial flows with large density and viscosity ratios can be simulated and energy conservation is ensured, even with a time step larger than the capillary time-step constraint.</description>

      <title>Hybrid LES/RANS for flows including separation: A new wall function using Machine Learning based on binary search trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) is used for developing wall functions for Improved Delayed Detached Eddy Simulations (IDDES). The ML model is based on KDtree which essentially is a fast look-up table. It searches the nearest target datapoint(s) for which y+ and U+ are closest to the CFD y+ and U+ cells. The target y+ value gives the friction velocity which is used for setting the wall shear stress for the wall-parallel velocity and for fixing k and epsilon at the wall-adjacent cells. Two target databases are created from time-averaged data of low-Reynolds number (i.e. wall-resolved) IDDES: diffuser flow with opening angle alpha=15 degrees and hump flow.
  The new ML wall function is used to predict five test cases: diffuser flow with opening angles alpha=15 degrees and alpha=10 degrees the hump flow, channel flow at $Re_tau=16 000 (inlet-outlet) and flat-plate boundary layer.
  A novel grid strategy is used. The wall-adjacent cells are large (20 &lt; y+ &lt; 60 in attached boundary layers). But further away from the wall, the wall-normal cell distribution is identical to that of a low-Re number grid. This new grid is found to improve the predictions compared to a standard wall-function grid.
  The new ML wall function is found to perform well compared to the low-Re IDDES and better than the Reichardt's wall function</description>

      <title>Drop deformation with soluble surfactants in linear flows: role of adsorption-desorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Drop deformation in shear flow is determined up to second order theory in Ca while considering kinetic effects on surfactants distributions in steady state. Surfactants inside the drop are adsorbed faster than those on the surface leading to an increase in total surfactants concentration on the semi-minor axis of the ellipsoidal droplet. New expressions for Taylor deformation and angle deviation are proposed involving kinetics effects. Theoretical calculations lead to a possibility of lesser deformation than the usual limit condition and a minor correction for the deviation angle.</description>

      <title>Higher-order integrable models for oceanic internal wave-current interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we derive a higher-order KdV equation (HKdV) as a model to describe the unidirectional propagation of waves on an internal interface separating two fluid layers of varying densities. Our model incorporates underlying currents by permitting a sheared current in both fluid layers, and also accommodates the effect of the Earth's rotation by including Coriolis forces (restricted to the Equatorial region). The resulting governing equations describing the water wave problem in two fluid layers under a `flat surface' assumption are expressed in a general form as a system of two coupled equations through Dirichlet-Neumann (DN) operators. The DN operators also facilitate a convenient Hamiltonian formulation of the problem. We then derive the HKdV equation from this Hamiltonian formulation, in the long-wave, and small-amplitude, asymptotic regimes. Finally, it is demonstrated that there is an explicit transformation connecting the HKdV we derive with the following integrable equations of similar type: KdV5, Kaup-Kuperschmidt equation, Sawada-Kotera equation, Camassa-Holm and Degasperis-Procesi equations.</description>

      <title>A Physics-Informed, Deep Double Reservoir Network for Forecasting Boundary Layer Velocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05728v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When a fluid flows over a solid surface, it creates a thin boundary layer where the flow velocity is influenced by the surface through viscosity, and can transition from laminar to turbulent at sufficiently high speeds. Understanding and forecasting the fluid dynamics under these conditions is one of the most challenging scientific problems in fluid dynamics. It is therefore of high interest to formulate models able to capture the nonlinear spatio-temporal velocity structure as well as produce forecasts in a computationally efficient manner. Traditional statistical approaches are limited in their ability to produce timely forecasts of complex, nonlinear spatio-temporal structures which are at the same time able to incorporate the underlying flow physics. In this work, we propose a model to accurately forecast boundary layer velocities with a deep double reservoir computing network which is capable of capturing the complex, nonlinear dynamics of the boundary layer while at the same time incorporating physical constraints via a penalty obtained by a Partial Differential Equation (PDE). Simulation studies on a one-dimensional viscous fluid demonstrate how the proposed model is able to produce accurate forecasts while simultaneously accounting for energy loss. The application focuses on boundary layer data in a water tunnel with a PDE penalty derived from an appropriate simplification of the Navier-Stokes equations, showing improved forecasting by the proposed approach in terms of mass conservation and variability of velocity fluctuation against non-physics-informed methods.</description>

      <title>Velocity fluctuations for bubbly flows at small Re</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16824v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We experimentally investigate the effect of Reynolds number (Re) on the turbulence induced by the motion of bubbles in a quiescent Newtonian fluid at small Re. The energy spectra, $E(k)$, is determined from the decaying turbulence behind the bubble swarm obtained using particle image velocimetry (PIV). We show that when Re $\sim$ $O$(100), the slope of the normalized energy spectra is no longer independent on the gas volume fraction and the $k^{-3}$ subrange is significantly narrower, where $k$ is the wavenumber. This is further corroborated using second-order longitudinal velocity structure function and spatial correlation of the velocity vector behind the bubble swarm. On further decreasing the bubble Reynolds number ($O(1) &lt; $ Re $ &lt; O(10)$), the signature $k^{-3}$ of the energy spectra for the bubble induced turbulence is replaced by $k^{-5/3}$ scaling. Thus, we provide experimental evidence to the claim by \citet{mazzitelli2003effect} that at low Reynolds numbers the normalized energy spectra of the bubble induced turbulence will no longer show the $k^{-3}$ scaling because of the absence of bubble wake and that the energy spectra will depend on the number of bubbles, thus non-universal.</description>

      <title>Flutter stability of twin-box bridge decks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present paper reports on wind tunnel tests and analyses carried out to investigate the effect of the static angle of attack on the aerodynamic stability of a twin-box bridge deck section. It is found that the critical wind speed for onset of flutter increases with increasing positive static angles (nose-up) and that this effect relates mainly to a decrease in the loss of aerodynamic stiffness. A simplified flutter analysis, linking the slope of the static moment coefficient to the increase of flutter stability for increasing positive angles of attack. It is concluded that it is desirable to design twin-box bridge deck sections to have a positive moment coefficient at zero angle of attack and a positive, decreasing moment slope for increasing nose-up angles. With these requirements fulfilled, the present study show that the critical wind speeds for onset of flutter increase with increasing angles, and ensures that the elastically supported deck will always meet the wind at ever increasing angles for increasing wind speeds.</description>

      <title>Conformation and dynamics of wet tangentially-driven active filaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17602v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the impact of hydrodynamic interactions on the conformational and dynamical properties of wet tangentially-driven active polymers using multiparticle collision dynamics simulations. By analyzing active filaments with varying degrees of flexibility, we find that fluid-mediated interactions significantly influence both their conformation and dynamics. These interactions cause polymer conformations to shrink relative to their dry counterparts, especially for semiflexible polymers at high activity levels, where the average size of wet chains becomes nearly three times smaller, due to local buckling of wet polymers. This hydrodynamic-induced shrinkage is a hallmark of active polymers, as fluid-mediated interactions do not affect conformational properties of passive polymers. Furthermore, for tangentially-driven polymers where activity and conformation are coupled, hydrodynamic interactions significantly enhance the orientational and translational dynamics compared to their dry counterparts.</description>
