      <title>Dynamics of Phase-Separated Interfaces in Inhomogenous and Driven Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive effective equations of motion governing the dynamics of sharp interfaces in phase-separated binary mixtures driven by spatio-temporal modulations of their material properties. We demonstrate, in particular, that spatial heterogeneities in the surface tension induce an effective capillary force that drives the motion of interfaces, even in the absence of hydrodynamics. Applying our sharp interface model to quantify the dynamics of thermophoretic droplets, we find that their deformation and transport properties are controlled by a combination of bulk and capillary forces, whose relative strength depends on droplet size. Strikingly, we show that small thermophobic droplets -- composed of a material with a positive Soret coefficient -- can spontaneously migrate towards high-temperature regions as a result of capillary forces.</description>

      <title>Emergent collective dynamics from motile photokinetic organisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The day-night cycle drives the largest biomass migration on Earth: the diel vertical migration (DVM) of aquatic organisms. Here, we present a three-dimensional agent-based model that incorporates photokinesis, gyrotaxis, and stochastic reorientation to explore how individual-level swimming behaviors give rise to population-scale DVM patterns. By solving Langevin equations for swarms of swimmers, we identify four distinct regimes -- Surface Accumulation, Shallow DVM, Deep DVM, and Sinking -- governed by two key dimensionless parameters: the Peclet number (Pe), representing motility persistence, and the vertical swimming asymmetry ratio (W=wdown/wup), encoding photokinetic bias. These regimes emerge from nonlinear interactions between light-driven navigation and active noise, diagnosed through topological and statistical features of vertical distributions. A critical feedback is uncovered: upward-biased swimming (W&lt;1) promotes surface aggregation, while excessive downward bias (W&gt;1) leads to irreversible sinking. Analytical estimates link regime boundaries to gyrotactic alignment and velocity reversals. Together, our results provide a mechanistic framework to interpret DVM diversity and emphasize the central role of light gradients-beyond absolute intensity-in shaping ecological self-organization.</description>

      <title>Simulation of Flagellated Bacteria Near a Solid Surface: Effects of Flagellar Morphology and Ionic Strength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study systematically investigates the dynamics of the bacterial transition from free-swimming to surface adhesion, a process characterized by both height $h$ and inclination angle $\Psi$. The surface entrapment process is divided into three main stages. Initially, bacteria swim towards the surface at an approach velocity proportional to the motor rotation frequency. Subsequently, during the reorientation stage, the cotangent of the inclination angle decays exponentially with the product of the motor rotation frequency and time. Finally, the combined effect of near-field hydrodynamic interactions and DLVO forces drives the bacteria to a stable fixed point $(h^{*},\Psi^{*})$ near the surface. Bacteria with left-handed chiral flagella exhibit clockwise circular motion on the surface. The stable height, inclination angle, and radius of curvature of these circular trajectories are collectively determined by the flagellar morphology and ionic strength of the electrolyte solution. More precisely, increasing the contour length of the flagellum decreases the stable inclination angle and increases the radius of curvature. In contrast, decreasing the ionic strength increases the stable height and radius of curvature, while also decreasing the stable inclination angle. Typically, the stable inclination angle falls within $(\pi/2,\pi)$, the stable height ranges from a few nanometers to approximately one hundred nanometers, and the radius of curvature of the circular motion spans several to tens of micrometers.</description>

      <title>Towards a two-scale model for morphogenesis -- How cellular processes influence tissue deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a two-scale model to resolve essential features of developmental tissue deformations. The model couples individual cellular behavior to the mechanics at tissue scale. This is realized by a multiphase-field model addressing the motility, deformability and interaction of cells on an evolving surface. The surface evolution is due to bending elasticity, with bending properties influenced by the topology of the cellular network, which forms the surface. We discuss and motivate model assumptions, propose a numerical scheme, which essentially scales with the number of cells, and explore computationally the effect of the two-scale coupling on the global shape evolution. The approach provides a step towards more quantitative modeling of morphogenetic processes.</description>

      <title>Elastic heterogeneity governs anomalous scaling in a soft porous crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanoscale molecular transport plays a crucial role in regulating mass diffusion and responsiveness in condensed matter systems. In soft porous crystals, in particular, adsorption of guest molecules induces host framework deformation and changes in rigidity, underpinning their characteristic stimuli-responsive behaviour. Surface-mediated adsorption leads to inhomogeneous adsorbate distribution, which, through local framework deformation, induces spatial variations in rigidity -- elastic heterogeneity. Although this heterogeneity is expected to affect adsorption kinetics and mechanical behaviour, its role remains poorly understood. Here we show that elastic heterogeneity governs adsorption kinetics, leading to emergent phenomena including size-dependent uptake, surface creasing, and anomalous dynamic scaling that is distinct from established scaling. Stress relaxation near corners facilitates adsorption, resulting in a size-dependent deviation from diffusive kinetics. Away from corners, flexible unadsorbed regions between rigid adsorbed domains relieve stress through crease formation. The resulting lateral correlations exhibit anomalous dynamic scaling, characterized by a breakdown of scale invariance between global and local interfacial fluctuations. These findings provide a mechanistic foundation for controlling adsorption and deformation kinetics in soft porous materials via elastic heterogeneity. Our work opens a route to engineering responsive materials, where mechanical feedback is harnessed to control cooperative molecular transport and drive macroscopic shape changes under external perturbations.</description>

      <title>Self-assembled clusters of mutually repelling particles in confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mutually repelling particles form spontaneously ordered clusters when forced into confinement. The clusters may adopt similar spatial arrangements even if the underlying particle interactions are contrastingly different. Here we demonstrate with both simulations and experiments that it is possible to induce particles of very different types to self-assemble into the same ordered geometric structure by simply regulating the ratio between the repulsion and confining forces. This is the case for both long- and short-ranged potentials. This property is initially explored in systems with two-dimensional (2D) circular symmetry and subsequently demonstrated to be valid throughout the transition to one-dimensional (1D) structures through continuous elliptical deformations of the confining field. We argue that this feature can be utilized to manipulate the spatial structure of confined particles, thereby paving the way for the design of clusters with specific functionalities.</description>

      <title>Elastic Plateau-Rayleigh instability in soft cylinders: Surface elasticity and periodic beading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Plateau-Rayleigh instability shows that a cylindrical fluid flow can be destabilized by surface tension. Similarly, capillary forces can make an elastic cylinder unstable when the elastocapillary length is comparable to the cylinder's radius. While existing models predict a single isolated bulge as the result of an instability, experiments reveal a periodic sequence of bulges spaced out by thinned regions, a phenomenon known as beading instability. Most models assume that surface tension is independent of the deformation of the solid, neglecting variations due to surface stretch.
  In this work, we assume that surface tension arises from the deformation of material particles near the free surface, treating it as a pre-stretched elastic surface surrounding the body. Using the theoretical framework proposed by Gurtin and Murdoch, we show that a cylindrical solid can undergo a mechanical instability with a finite critical wavelength if the body is sufficiently soft or axially stretched. Post-buckling numerical simulations reveal a morphology in qualitative agreement with experimental observations. Period-halving secondary bifurcations are also observed. The results of this research have broad implications for soft materials, biomechanics, and microfabrication applications where surface tension plays a crucial role.</description>

      <title>Interfacial instability of confined 3D active droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Instabilities of fluid-fluid interfaces are ubiquitous in passive soft matter. Adding activity to the interface or either fluid can dramatically change the stability of the interface. Using experiment and theory, we investigate the interfacial instability of a deformable 3D active nematic liquid crystal droplet in the isotropic phase surrounded by a passive fluid and confined between two parallel plates. Spontaneous active flows drive the growth of undulations along the active/passive interface, with the mode number of the fastest-growing mode increasing with droplet radius and decreasing with gap height. We apply the lubrication approximation to a minimal nematohydrodynamic model to determine the growth rates of all interfacial modes. The magnitude of the growth rate is determined by the active timescale and the relaxation timescales associated with liquid crystalline order, as well as capillary and viscous stresses. We find multiple points of agreement between experiment and theory, including the shape evolution of individual droplets, the growth rates of unstable modes averaged across many droplets, and the extensional shear flows observed within droplets.</description>
