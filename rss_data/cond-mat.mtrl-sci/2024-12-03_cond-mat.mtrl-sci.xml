      <title>LPCVD Grown Si-Doped $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ Films with Promising Electron Mobilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically investigated the growth of Si-doped $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ films using LPCVD system, achieving high electron mobilities of 162 cm$^2$/V.s and 149 cm$^2$/V.s at carrier concentrations of $1.51 \times 10^{17}$ cm$^{-3}$ and $1.15 \times 10^{17}$ cm$^{-3}$, respectively, for homoepitaxial (010) $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ films grown on $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ substrates and heteroepitaxial (-201) $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ films grown on off-axis c-sapphire substrates with 6{\deg} miscut, representing the highest mobilities reported for LPCVD-grown $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ materials. Carrier concentrations were precisely tuned by varying SiCl$_4$ flow rates at a growth temperature of 1000{\deg}C, resulting in concentrations ranging from $1.15 \times 10^{17}$ to $1.19 \times 10^{19}$ cm$^{-3}$, as confirmed by both Hall and C-V measurements. The films exhibited high crystalline quality, confirmed by high-resolution XRD and Raman spectroscopy, indicating phase purity and structural integrity. Surface morphologies characterized by FESEM and AFM imaging showed a strong correlation between carrier concentrations and surface smoothness, with lower concentrations resulting in reduced RMS roughness. SIMS analysis revealed uniform Si incorporation, with low carbon, hydrogen, and chlorine impurities below detection limits, indicating high purity of the films. A high low-temperature peak mobility exceeding 843 cm$^2$/V$\cdot$s was achieved for (-201) $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ films at 80 K, highlighting the high purity and low compensation of these films. These findings emphasize the potential of LPCVD growth system for producing high-purity $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ films with thickness ranging between ~2.3-11.7 $\mu$m and faster growth rates (~4.7-17 $\mu$m/hr), promising transport properties, controllable doping, and scalability for developing high power vertical devices.</description>

      <title>Ehrenfest dynamics with localized atomic-orbital basis sets within the projector augmented-wave method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Density functional theory with linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) basis sets is useful for studying large atomic systems, especially when it comes to computationally highly demanding time-dependent dynamics. We have implemented the Ehrenfest molecular dynamics (ED) method with the approximate approach of Tomfohr and Sankey within the projector augmented-wave code GPAW. We apply this method to small molecules as well as larger periodic systems, and elucidate its limits, advantages, and disadvantages in comparison to the existing implementation of Ehrenfest dynamics with a real-space grid representation. For modest atomic velocities, LCAO-ED shows satisfactory accuracy at a much reduced computational cost. This method will be particularly useful for modeling ion irradiation processes that require large amounts of vacuum in the simulation cell.</description>

      <title>Theory of polarization-switchable electrical conductivity anisotropy in nonpolar semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The anisotropic propagation of particles is a fundamental transport phenomenon in solid state physics. As for crystalline semiconductors, the anisotropic charge transport opens novel designing routes for electronic devices, where the electrical manipulation of anisotropic resistance provides essential guarantees. Motivated by the concept of anisotropic magnetoresistance, we develop an original theory on the electrically manipulatable anisotropic electroresistance. We show that when gaining electric polarization, nonpolar semiconductors can showcase anisotropic electrical conductivities between two perpendicular directions and the electrical conductivity anisotropy (ECA) is switchable by flipping the polarization. By symmetry analysis, we identify several point groups hosting the polarization-switchable ECA. These point groups simultaneously enable polarization-reversal induced conductivity change along specific directions, akin to the tunnelling electroresistance in ferroelectric tunnel junctions. First-principles-based conductivity calculations predict that AlP and NaSrP are two good materials having such exotic charge transport. Our theory can motivate the design of intriguing anisotropic electronic devices (e.g., anisotropic memristor and field effect transistor).</description>

      <title>Is p-type doping in TeO2 feasible?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wide-bandgap two-dimensional (2D) beta-TeO2 has been reported as a high-mobility p-type transparent semiconductor (Nat. Electron. 2021, 4, 277-283), attracting significant attention. This "breakthrough" not only challenges the conventional characterization of TeO2 as an insulator but also conflicts with the anticipated difficulty in hole doping of TeO2 by established chemical trends. Notably, the reported Fermi level of 0.9 eV above the valence band maximum (VBM) actually suggests that the material is an insulator, contradicting the high hole density obtained by Hall effect measurement. Furthermore, the detected residual Se and the possible reduced elemental Te in the 2D beta-TeO2 samples introduces complexity, considering that elemental Se, Te, and Te1-xSex themselves are high-mobility p-type semiconductor. Therefore, doubts regarding the true cause of the p-type conductivity observed in the 2D beta-TeO2 samples arise. In this work, we employ density functional theory calculations to illustrate that TeO2, whether in its bulk forms of alpha-, beta-, or gamma-TeO2, or in 2D beta-TeO2, inherently exhibits insulating properties and poses challenges in carrier doping due to its shallow conduction band minimum and deep valence band maximum (VBM). Our findings shed light on the insulating electrical properties and doping difficulty of TeO2, contrasting with the claimed p-type conductivity in the 2D beta-TeO2 samples, prompting inquiries into the true origin of the p-type conductivity.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Studies on Sodium Storage Mechanism in Hard Carbon Anodes of Sodium-Ion Batteries: Molecular Simulations Based on Machine Learning Force Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00340v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have garnered significant attention in recent years as a promising alternative to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) due to their low cost, abundant sodium resources, and excellent cycling performance. Hard carbon materials, characterized by their high specific capacity, outstanding cycling stability, and low cost, have emerged as potential candidates for SIB anodes. However, the sodium storage mechanism in hard carbon anodes remains highly complex, especially in disordered structures, and is yet to be fully understood. To address this, we employed relative machine learning force fields (MLFFs) in conjunction with multiscale simulation techniques to systematically investigate the sodium storage behavior in hard carbon. By integrating simulations, this study provides a detailed exploration of sodium adsorption, intercalation, and filling mechanisms. High-precision, large-scale simulations reveal the dynamic behavior and distribution patterns of sodium ions in hard carbon. The findings not only deepen our understanding of sodium storage mechanisms in hard carbon anodes, but also offer a theoretical foundation for optimizing future SIB designs, while introducing novel simulation methodologies and technical frameworks to enhance battery performance.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear optical response and spontaneous polarization in layer-stacked gallenene using second harmonic generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00461v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gallenene is a promising low-dimensional material with a structure down to the thickness of a single atom, similar to graphene. However, van der Waals stacking of two-dimensional (2D) gallenene under confinement remain poorly understood. In this study, we present evidence of the formation of parallel-stacked hexagonal gallenene (a100) structures in liquid gallium. The present study demonstrates the AB stacking of 2D gallenene a100 crystals in liquid gallium sandwiched between two graphene layers, as observed through transmission electron microscopy. A nonlinear optical response of the confined hexagonal gallenene was investigated through second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy. The SHG signal exhibits periodic peak intensity shifts upon angular rotation up to 90 degrees and intensity dampening at elevated temperatures. These findings offer insights on device applications of 2D gallenene.</description>

      <title>Quantum Delocalization Enables Water Dissociation on Ru(0001)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the long-standing question of whether water molecules dissociate on the Ru(0001) surface through nanosecond-scale path-integral molecular dynamics simulations on a sizable supercell. This is made possible through the development of an efficient and reliable machine-learning potential with near first-principles accuracy, overcoming the limitations of previous ab initio studies. We show that the quantum delocalization associated with nuclear quantum effects enables rapid and frequent proton transfers between water molecules, thereby facilitating the water dissociation on Ru(0001). This work provides the direct theoretical evidence of water dissociation on Ru(0001), resolving the enduring issue in surface sciences and offering crucial atomistic insights into water-metal interfaces.</description>

      <title>Efficient photoreforming of plastic waste using a high-entropy oxide catalyst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simultaneous catalytic hydrogen (H2) production and plastic waste degradation under light, known as photoreforming, is a novel approach to green fuel production and efficient waste management. Here, we use a high-entropy oxide (HEO), a new family of catalysts with five or more principal cations in their structure, for plastic degradation and simultaneous H2 production. The HEO shows higher activity than that of P25 TiO2, a benchmark photocatalyst, for the degradation of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastics in water. Several valuable products are produced by photoreforming of PET bottles and microplastics including H2, terephthalate, ethylene glycol and formic acid. The high activity is attributed to the diverse existence of several cations in the HEO lattice, lattice defects, and appropriate charge carrier lifetime. These findings suggest that HEOs possess high potential as new catalysts for concurrent plastic waste conversion and clean H2 production.</description>

      <title>Uni-Electrolyte: An Artificial Intelligence Platform for Designing Electrolyte Molecules for Rechargeable Batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrolyte is a very important part of rechargeable batteries such as lithium batteries. However, the electrolyte innovation is facing grand challenges due to the complicated solution chemistry and infinite molecular space (&gt;1060 for small molecules). This work reported an artificial intelligence (AI) platform, namely Uni-Electrolyte, for designing advanced electrolyte molecules, which mainly includes three parts, i.e. EMolCurator, EMolForger, and EMolNetKnittor. New molecules can be designed by combining high-throughput screening and generative AI models from more than 100 million alternative molecules in the EMolCurator module. The molecule properties including frontier molecular orbital information, formation energy, binding energy with a Li ion, viscosity, and dielectric constant, can be adopted as the screening parameters. The EMolForger, and EMolNetKnittor module can predict the retrosynthesis pathway and reaction pathway with electrodes for a given molecule, respectively. With the assist of advanced AI methods, the Uni-Electrolyte is strongly supposed to discover new electrolyte molecules and chemical principles, promoting the practical application of next-generation rechargeable batteries.</description>

      <title>Efficient Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production on Defective and Strained Black Bismuth (III) Oxide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bismuth (III) oxide (Bi2O3) has been highly studied as a photocatalyst for green hydrogen production due to its low band gap, yet its efficiency requires enhancement. This study synthesizes a defective and strained black Bi2O3 by severe straining under high pressure, via a high-pressure torsion method, to improve its photocatalytic hydrogen production. The material rich in oxygen vacancies exhibits a ten-fold improvement in water splitting with excellent cycling stability. Such improvement is due to improved light absorption, narrowing band gap and reduced irradiative electron-hole recombination. Moreover, the valence band bottom energy positively increases by straining leading to a high overpotential for hydrogen production. This research highlights the potential of vacancies and lattice strain in developing dopant-free active catalysts for water splitting.</description>

      <title>Impact of high-pressure columbite phase of titanium dioxide (TiO2) on catalytic photoconversion of plastic waste and Simultaneous hydrogen (H2) production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photoreforming is a sustainable photocatalytic process that degrades plastic waste while simultaneously producing hydrogen (H2) from water. However, this process has received limited attention due to the scarcity of effective catalysts capable of both plastic degradation and H2 production, such as titanium dioxide (TiO2). In this study, an active catalyst is developed by stabilizing the high-pressure orthorhombic phase of TiO2, known as columbite, using a high pressure torsion (HPT) method. This material effectively degrades polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic under light, converting it into valuable organic compounds such as formic acid, terephthalate, glycolic acid, and acetic acid. Additionally, it produces a significant amount of H2. The findings show that the high-pressure orthorhombic phase, especially in the presence of oxygen vacancies, enhances catalytic H2 production and microplastic degradation by increasing light absorption, reducing electron-hole recombination, and generating hydroxyl radicals. These results highlight the substantial potential of modified high-pressure TiO2 photocatalysts in simultaneously addressing the plastic waste crisis and the demand for H2 fuel.</description>

      <title>Thermal creep behavior of refractory high-entropy alloy: an atomistic study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Refractory high-entropy alloy (RHEA) is a promising class of materials with potential applications in extreme environments, where the dominant failure mode is thermal creep. The design of these alloys, therefore, requires an understanding of how their microstructure and local chemical distribution affect creep behavior. In this study, we performed high-fidelity atomistic simulations using machine-learning interatomic potentials to explore the creep behavior of MoNbTaW RHEA under a wide range of stress and temperature conditions. We parametrized grain size and local chemical order (LCO) to investigate the effects of these two important design variables, which can be controlled during the alloy fabrication process. Our investigation revealed that resistance to creep deformation is enhanced with larger grain size and higher levels of LCO. This study highlights the importance of utilizing LCO in conjunction with other microstructural properties when designing RHEAs for extreme environment applications.</description>

      <title>Phase-resolving spin-wave microscopy using infrared strobe light</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The needs for sensitively and reliably probing magnetization dynamics have been increasing in various contexts such as studying novel hybrid magnonic systems, in which the spin dynamics strongly and coherently couple to other excitations, including microwave photons, light photons, or phonons. Recent advances in quantum magnonics also highlight the need for employing magnon phase as quantum state variables, which is to be detected and mapped out with high precision in on-chip micro- and nano-scale magnonic devices. Here, we demonstrate a facile optical technique that can directly perform concurrent spectroscopic and imaging functionalities with spatial- and phase-resolutions, using infrared strobe light operating at 1550-nm wavelength. To showcase the methodology, we spectroscopically studied the phase-resolved spin dynamics in a bilayer of Permalloy and Y3Fe5O12 (YIG), and spatially imaged the backward volume spin wave modes of YIG in the dipolar spin wave regime. Using the strobe light probe, the detected precessional phase contrast can be directly used to construct the map of the spin wave wavefront, in the continuous-wave regime of spin-wave propagation and in the stationary state, without needing any optical reference path. By selecting the applied field, frequency, and detection phase, the spin wave images can be made sensitive to the precession amplitude and phase. Our results demonstrate that infrared optical strobe light can serve as a versatile platform for magneto-optical probing of magnetization dynamics, with potential implications in investigating hybrid magnonic systems.</description>

      <title>Floquet Chern Vector Topological Insulators in Three Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically and numerically investigate Chern vector insulators and topological surface states in a three-dimensional lattice, based on phase-delayed temporal-periodic interactions within the tight-binding model. These Floquet interactions break time-reversal symmetry, effectively inducing a gauge field analogous to magnetic flux. This gauge field results in Chern numbers in all spatial dimensions, collectively forming the Chern vector. This vector characterizes the topological phases and signifies the emergence of robust surface states. Numerically, we observe these states propagating unidirectionally without backscattering on all open surfaces of the three-dimensional system. Our work paves the way for breaking time-reversal symmetry and realizing three-dimensional Chern vector topological insulators using temporal-periodic Floquet techniques.</description>

      <title>Electronic Structure, mass fluctuation, and Localized Bond Properties of two-dimensional double-layer transition metal chalcogenide MX$_2$ (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se, Te) Calculated Based on Density Functional Theory and BBC model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study systematically investigates the electronic structure and bonding properties of two-dimensional bilayer transition metal chalcogenides MX$_2$ (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se, Te) using density functional theory calculations. Through the analysis of band gaps, deformation bond energies, and non-Hermitian bonding characteristics of various MX$_2$ compounds, the electronic properties and chemical bonding features are comprehensively examined. The findings demonstrate that charge transfer plays a critical role in electron mass fluctuation, with the incorporation of topological geometric analysis confirming the influence of mass changes on atomic bonding and electronic states. Furthermore, Heterojunctions between distinct atomic layers are shown to effectively modulate the band gap of two-dimensional bilayer transition metal chalcogenides. This work establishes a theoretical foundation for advancing the application of these materials.</description>

      <title>Formation Energy Prediction of Material Crystal Structures using Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining the stability of chemical compounds is essential for advancing material discovery. In this study, we introduce a novel deep neural network model designed to predict a crystal's formation energy, which identifies its stability property. Our model leverages elemental fractions derived from material composition and incorporates the symmetry classification as an additional input feature. The materials' symmetry classifications represent the crystal polymorphs and are crucial for understanding phase transitions in materials. Our findings demonstrate that the integration of crystal system, point group, or space group symmetry information significantly enhances the predictive performance of the developed deep learning architecture, where the highest accuracy was achieved when space group classification was incorporated. In addition, we use the same model architecture to predict the energy above hull, an indicator to material stability, with formation energy as an additional input feature.</description>

      <title>Control of sphalerite-chalcopyrite phase transition in CdSnAs2 for n-type thermoelectrics with high power factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Practical applications of thermoelectric (TE) materials are constrained by less developments of high-performance n-type materials compared to their p-type counterparts. Chalcopyrite CdSnAs2 is a promising n-type semiconductor for thermoelectrics from its narrow bandgap around 0.2 eV and exceptionally high electron mobility. In this study, we investigated the crystal growth, microstructure, and thermoelectric properties of CdSnAs2. Contrary to conventional theory of unidirectional melt growth, CdSnAs2 samples at higher cooling rates exhibited better crystallinity, while some cracks were observed in samples cooled more slowly. Thermal analyses clarified that a phase transition from sphalerite to chalcopyrite occurred after solidification in the case of slow cooling, leading to dislocations and cracks due to the lattice mismatch between phases. The analysis at rapid cooling suggested that supercooling lowers the solidification temperature and produces an appropriate microstructure. Consequently, the sample grown at the highest cooling rate (7.6 K/min) achieved an ultrahigh power factor of 3.18 mW/mK^2 at 600 K and a peak zT of 0.62 at 682 K. In the power factor, CdSnAs2 surpasses conventional binary n-type TE materials such as SnSe and PbTe, proving that CdSnAs2 is a high potential candidate for mid-temperature TE applications.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Computing Approach to Simulating Corrosion Inhibition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work demonstrates a systematic implementation of hybrid quantum-classical computational methods for investigating corrosion inhibition mechanisms on aluminum surfaces. We present an integrated workflow combining density functional theory (DFT) with quantum algorithms through an active space embedding scheme, specifically applied to studying 1,2,4-Triazole and 1,2,4-Triazole-3-thiol inhibitors on Al111 surfaces. Our implementation leverages the ADAPT-VQE algorithm with benchmarking against classical DFT calculations, achieving binding energies of -0.386 eV and -1.279 eV for 1,2,4-Triazole and 1,2,4-Triazole-3-thiol, respectively. The enhanced binding energy of the thiol derivative aligns with experimental observations regarding sulfur-functionalized inhibitors' improved corrosion protection. The methodology employs the orb-d3-v2 machine learning potential for rapid geometry optimizations, followed by accurate DFT calculations using CP2K with PBE functional and Grimme's D3 dispersion corrections. Our benchmarking on smaller systems reveals that StatefulAdaptVQE implementation achieves a 5-6x computational speedup while maintaining accuracy. This work establishes a workflow for quantum-accelerated materials science studying periodic systems, demonstrating the viability of hybrid quantum-classical approaches for studying surface-adsorbate interactions in corrosion inhibition applications. In which, can be transferable to other applications such as carbon capture and battery materials studies.</description>

      <title>Computationally-guided discovery and synthesis of the amorphous nitride Y2WN4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amorphous materials offer unique functional characteristics, which are often not observed in their crystalline counterparts. This makes them invaluable for many technological applications, such as diffusion barriers in semiconductor devices. However, the computationally guided search for new functional amorphous materials with attractive properties represents a major challenge. In this work, we combine theory and experiment to discover and synthesize the amorphous ternary nitride Y2WN4. We show how computational random structure sampling offers a route to robustly identify chemistries which are hard to crystallize. Experiments prove that the predicted nitride is easily synthesized in amorphous phase with no detectable precipitates. The material exhibits remarkable stability against crystallization at high temperature and as well as excellent oxidation resistance and stability against Cu diffusion. Moreover, Y2WN4 exhibits a sharp onset of optical absorption and an indirect band gap of 2.24 eV. These properties make this material promising for the integration in electronic devices as a high-performance diffusion barrier with adjustable band edges.</description>

Abstract: The intensive study of non-collinear magnets promotes an urgent demand for the quantitative characterization of the non-collinear magnetic structures, which host numerous exotic phenomena. Here we systematically study the non-collinear magnetic structure of an artificial ferrimagnetic multilayer. The AMR measurements reveal two distinct twisted states whose magnetic structures can be quantitatively characterized with the assistance of micromagnetic simulations. Our results manifest AMR as an ideal probe of the non-collinear magnetic structure in artificial ferrimagnets.</description>

      <title>Preparation of hexagonal iron flakes with a hexagonal structure on the sublayer of copper oxides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presented a novel method to prepare hexagonal iron flakes with hexagonal close-packed structures (hcp) on the copper oxide sublayers. Also, it demonstrated that the size and structure of iron grains are functions of sublayer features. The sublayer was prepared by sputtering copper on the glass substrate and annealing it. As the annealing temperature of the copper sublayer increased, the oxygen percentage increased and copper oxide rods were formed. Hexagonal iron flakes were formed after sputtering iron on this sublayer. The XRD analysis showed that these hexagonal flakes have a close-packed hexagonal structure. This finding was further confirmed by the magnetic properties of the samples and by density functional theory (DFT) calculations.</description>

      <title>One-step Fabrication of Sharp Platinum/Iridium Tips via Amplitude-Modulated Alternating-Current Electropolishing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The platinum/iridium (Pt/Ir) alloy tip for scanning probe microscopy (SPM) was successfully fabricated by amplitude-modulated alternating-current (AC) electropolishing. The clean tips with a radius of curvature less than 100 nm were reproducibly obtained by applying the 1000 Hz sinusoidal voltage with amplitude modulation of the sinusoidal wave of 100 Hz in $\mathrm{CaCl_2}$/$\mathrm{H_2O}$/acetone solution. The analyses by scanning electron microscopy with an energy-dispersive X-ray analyzer (SEM-EDX) and atom probe tomography (APT) showed that a uniform Pt/Ir alloy was exposed on the tip surface as a clean surface without O or Cl contamination. The STM imaging using the fabricated tip showed that it is more suitable for investigating rough surfaces than conventional as-cut tips and applicable for atomic-resolution imaging. Furthermore, we applied the fabricated tip to qPlus AFM analysis in liquid and showed that it has atomic resolution in both the horizontal and vertical directions. Therefore, it is concluded that the amplitude-modulated AC etching method reproducibly provides sharp STM/AFM tips capable of both atomic resolution and large-area analyses without complex etching setups.</description>

      <title>Advances and Challenges of Hexagonal Boron Nitride-based Anticorrosion Coatings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The corrosion of metallic surfaces poses significant challenges across industries such as petroleum, energy, and biomedical sectors, leading to structural degradation, safety risks, and substantial maintenance costs. Traditional organic and metallic coatings provide some protection, but their limited durability and susceptibility to harsh environmental conditions necessitate the development of more advanced and efficient solutions. This has driven significant interest in two-dimensional (2D) materials, with graphene extensively studied for its exceptional mechanical strength and impermeability to gases and ions. However, while graphene offers short-term corrosion protection, its high electrical conductivity presents a long-term issue by promoting galvanic corrosion on metal surfaces. In contrast, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has emerged as a promising alternative for anticorrosion coatings. h-BN combines exceptional chemical stability, impermeability, and electrical insulation, making it particularly suited for long-term protection in highly corrosive or high-temperature environments. While h-BN holds promise as anticorrosion material, challenges such as structural defects, agglomeration of nanosheets, and poor dispersion within coatings limit its performance. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of recent advancements in addressing these challenges, including novel functionalization strategies, scalable synthesis methods, and hybrid systems that integrate h-BN with complementary materials. By bridging the gap between fundamental research and industrial applications, this review outlines the potential for h-BN to revolutionize anticorrosion technologies. These obstacles necessitate advanced strategies such as surface functionalization to improve compatibility with polymer matrices and dispersion optimization to minimize agglomeration.</description>

      <title>Light-induced hysteresis of electronic polarization in antiferromagnet FePS3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research on manipulating materials using light has garnered significant interest, yet examples of controlling electronic polarization in magnetic materials remain scarce. Here, we demonstrate the hysteresis of electronic polarization in the antiferromagnetic semiconductor FePS3 via light. Below the N\'eel temperature, we observe linear dichroism (i.e., optical anisotropy) without structural symmetry breaking. Light-induced net polarization aligns along the a-axis (zigzag direction) at 1.6 eV due to the dipolar polarization and along the b-axis (armchair direction) at 2.0 eV due to the combined effects of dipolar and octupolar polarizations, resulting from charge transfer from the armchair to the zigzag direction by light. Unexpected hysteresis of the electronic polarization occurs at 2.0 eV due to the octupolar polarization, in contrast to the absence of such hysteresis at 1.6 eV. We attribute this to a symmetry breaking of the light-induced phase of FePS3 involving electronic polarization within the spin lattice. This study suggests a new mechanism for generating and controlling electronic polarization in magnetic materials using light, with implications for future device applications.</description>

      <title>Light-matter interactions in layered materials and heterostructures: from moir\'e physics and magneto-optical effects to ultrafast dynamics and hybrid meta-photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Layered two-dimensional (2D) materials have revolutionized how we approach light-matter interactions, offering unprecedented optical and electronic properties with the potential for vertical heterostructures and manipulation of spin-valley degrees of freedom. The discovery of moir\'e physics in twisted heterostructures has further unlocked new possibilities for controlling the band structure of tailored semiconductor heterostructures. In parallel, the integration of 2D materials with hybrid photonic structures and ultrafast studies on their optical and spin-valley properties has revealed a wealth of novel physical phenomena. This perspective highlights the recent advances in our understanding of light-matter interactions in moir\'e and 2D systems, with a particular emphasis on ultrafast processes and the integration of these materials into photonic platforms. We explore the implications for optoelectronics and emerging photonic technologies, positioning 2D materials as a transformative tool for next-generation devices.</description>

      <title>Realization of Hopf-link structure in phonon spectra: Symmetry guidance and High-throughput investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The realization of Hopf-link structure in the Brillouin zone is rather rare hindering the comprehensive exploration and understanding of such exotic nodal loop geometry. Here we first tabulate 141 space groups hosting Hopf-link structure and then investigate Phonon Database at Kyoto University consisting of 10034 materials to search for phonon realization of the Hopf-link nodal structure. It is found that almost all the investigated materials own nodal loops or nodal chains while only 113 materials can host Hopf-link structure in phonon spectra, among which 8 representative materials are manually selected to showcase relatively clean Hopf-link structure including LiGaS$_2$, LiInSe$_2$, Ca$_2$Al$_2$Si(HO$_4$)$_2$, Ca$_7$GeN$_6$, Al(HO)$_3$, NaNd(GaS$_2$)$_4$, Ga$_5$(PS)$_3$ and RbTh$_3$F$_{13}$. The visible phonon drumhead surface states corresponding to the nodal loops in the Hopf-link structure are further demonstrated using Ga$_5$(PS)$_3$ as an example.The listed 113 crystalline materials provide a good platform for experimentalists to further explore the interesting properties related to Hopf-link structure.</description>

      <title>Magnonic Fabry-P\'{e}rot resonators as programmable phase shifters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the use of magnonic Fabry-P\'erot resonators as programmable phase shifters for spin-wave computing. The resonator, composed of a yttrium iron garnet (YIG) film coupled with a CoFeB nanostripe, operates through dynamic dipolar coupling, leading to wavelength downconversion and the formation of a magnonic cavity. Using super-Nyquist sampling magneto-optical Kerr effect (SNS-MOKE) microscopy and micromagnetic simulations, we demonstrate that these resonators can induce a $\pi$ phase shift in the transmitted spin wave. The phase shift is highly sensitive to the magnetization alignment within the resonator, allowing for on-demand control via magnetic switching. This feature, combined with low-loss transmission, positions the magnonic Fabry-P\'erot resonator as a promising component for reconfigurable magnonic circuits and spin-wave computing devices.</description>

      <title>Theory of the divacancy in 4H-SiC: Impact of Jahn-Teller effect on optical properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01390v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the optical properties of color centers in silicon carbide is essential for their use in quantum technologies, such as single-photon emission and spin-based qubits. In this work, first-principles calculations were employed using the r2SCAN density functional to investigate the electronic and vibrational properties of neutral divacancy configurations in 4H-SiC. Our approach addresses the dynamical Jahn-Teller effect in the excited states of axial divacancies. By explicitly solving the multimode dynamical Jahn-Teller problem, we compute emission and absorption lineshapes for axial divacancy configurations, providing insights into the complex interplay between electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom. The results show strong alignment with experimental data, underscoring the predictive power of the methodologies. Our calculations predict spontaneous symmetry breaking due to the pseudo Jahn-Teller effect in the excited state of the $kh$ divacancy, accompanied by the lowest electron-phonon coupling among the four configurations and distinct polarizability. These unique properties facilitate its selective excitation, setting it apart from other divacancy configurations, and highlight its potential utility in quantum technology applications. These findings underscore the critical role of electron-phonon interactions and optical properties in spin defects with pronounced Jahn-Teller effects, offering valuable insights for the design and integration of quantum emitters for quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Double Layer-Interlocked Crystals of Nitrogen-Rich Compounds under Zero-Pressure Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01497v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stabilizing nitrogen-rich compound crystals under conventional conditions is a key issue in the development and application of high-energy density materials (HEDMs). Herein, a two-dimensional double-layer interlocked Li4(N5)2 nitrogen-rich compound crystals, in which the two N5 rings are locked to by sharing four Li atoms, was found to maintain structural stability at zero pressure conditions. Dynamics studies reliably confirm crystal stability below 250 K. Furthermore, the stability of Li4(N5)2 crystal mainly arises from the ionic interaction between Li atoms and N5 rings, formed by the charge transfer from Li atoms to N5 rings. This study highlights the feasibility of stabilizing nitrogen-rich compound crystals under conventional conditions, paving the way for atomic level advancements in HEDMs.</description>

      <title>Magnetic-Transition-Induced Colossal Magnetoresistance in the Ferrimagnetic Semiconductor Mn$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the ferrimagnetic semiconductor Mn$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$, a colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) is observed only when a magnetic field is applied along the magnetic hard axis ($\mathbf{H}\parallel c$). This phenomenon suggests an unconventional CMR mechanism potentially driven by the interplay between magnetism, topological band structure, and/or chiral orbital currents (COC). By comparing electrical resistance measurements using continuous direct currents and pulse currents, we found that the current-induced insulator-metal transition, supporting the COC-driven CMR mechanism, is likely a consequence of Joule heating effects. Additionally, multiple magnetic field-induced metamagnetic transitions were identified through AC magnetostriction coefficient experiments, but only when $\mathbf{H}\parallel c$. Importantly, the transition at $\sim$ 5 T marks the boundary between the low-field CMR and high-field weak MR. These findings suggest that field-induced metamagnetic transition combined with partial polarization of magnetic moments are the primary causes of the band gap closure, leading to the observed CMR in Mn$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$.</description>

      <title>Violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law and ultra-low thermal conductivity of Ti$_3$C$_2$T$_x$ MXene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high electrical conductivity and good chemical stability of MXenes offer hopes for their use in many applications, such as wearable electronics, energy storage, or electromagnetic interference shielding. While their optical, electronic and electrochemical properties have been widely studied, the information on thermal properties of MXenes is scarce. In this study, we investigate the heat transport properties of Ti$_3$C$_2$T$_x$ MXene single flakes using scanning thermal microscopy and find exceptionally low anisotropic thermal conductivities within the Ti$_3$C$_2$T$_x$ flakes, leading to an effective thermal conductivity of 0.78$\pm$0.21 W m$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$. This observation is in stark contrast to the predictions of the Wiedemann-Franz law, as the estimated Lorenz number is only 0.25 of the classical value. Due to the combination of low thermal conductivity and low emissivity of Ti$_3$C$_2$T$_x$, the heat loss from it is two orders of magnitude smaller than that from common metals. Our study explores the heat transport mechanisms of MXenes and highlights a promising approach for developing thermal insulation, two-dimensional thermoelectric, or infrared stealth materials.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we present Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire (LGD) model specifically an improved to describe charge-polarization coupling in the oxygen-deficient HfO2-y nanoparticles. This model incorporates parametrized Landau expansion coefficients for both polar and antipolar orderings. To validate the model's accuracy, we utilized existing experimental X-ray diffraction data for the oxygen-deficient HfO2-y nanoparticles (pure and doped with rare-earth elements). The X-ray diffraction confirmed the formation of a ferroelectric-like orthorhombic phase in the oxygen-deficient HfO2-y nanoparticles, as well as in the HfO2-y nanoparticles doped with the rare-earth element yttrium.</description>

      <title>Electrostatic interactions in atomistic and machine-learned potentials for polar materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-range electrostatic interactions critically affect polar materials. However, state-of-the-art atomistic potentials, such as neural networks or Gaussian approximation potentials employed in large-scale simulations, often neglect the role of these long-range electrostatic interactions.
  This study introduces a novel model derived from first principles to evaluate the contribution of long-range electrostatic interactions to total energies, forces, and stresses. The model is designed to integrate seamlessly with existing short-range force fields without further first-principles calculations or retraining. The approach relies solely on physical observables, like the dielectric tensor and Born effective charges, that can be consistently calculated from first principles. We demonstrate that the model reproduces critical features, such as the LO-TO splitting and the long-wavelength phonon dispersions of polar materials, with benchmark results on the cubic phase of barium titanate (BaTiO$_3$).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the accurate description of redox reactions remains a challenge for first-principles calculations, it has been shown that extended Hubbard functionals (DFT+U+V) can provide a reliable approach, mitigating self-interaction errors, in materials with strongly localized d or f electrons. Here, we first show that DFT+U+V molecular dynamics is capable to follow the adiabatic evolution of oxidation states over time, using representative Li-ion cathode materials. In turn, this allows to develop redox-aware machine-learned potentials. We show that considering atoms with different oxidation states (as accurately predicted by DFT+U+V) as distinct species in the training leads to potentials that are able to identify the correct ground state and pattern of oxidation states for redox elements present. This can be achieved, e.g., through a systematic combinatorial search for the lowest energy configuration or with stochastic methods. This brings the advantages of machine-learned potentials to key technological applications (e.g., rechargeable batteries), which require an accurate description of the evolution of redox states.</description>

      <title>Moire magnetism in CrBr3 multilayers emerging from differential strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interfaces between twisted 2D materials host a wealth of physical phenomena originating from the long-scale periodicity associated with the resulting moire structure. Besides twisting, an alternative route to create structures with comparably long or even longer periodicities is inducing a differential strain between adjacent layers in a van der Waals (vdW) material. Despite recent theoretical efforts analyzing its benefits, this route has not yet been implemented experimentally. Here we report evidence for the simultaneous presence of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic regions in CrBr3 _a hallmark of moire magnetism_ from the observation of an unexpected magnetoconductance in CrBr3 tunnel barriers with ferromagnetic Fe3GeTe2 and graphene electrodes. The observed magnetoconductance evolves with temperature and magnetic field as the magnetoconductance measured in small angle CrBr3 twisted junctions, in which moire magnetism occurs. Consistent with Raman measurements and theoretical modeling, we attribute the phenomenon to the presence of a differential strain in the CrBr3 multilayer, which locally modifies the stacking and the interlayer exchange between adjacent CrBr3 layers, resulting in spatially modulated spin textures. Our conclusions indicate that inducing differential strain in vdW multilayers is a viable strategy to create moire-like superlattices, which in the future may offer in-situ continuous tunability even at low temperatures.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric transport of strained CsK$_2$Sb: Role of momentum-dependent scattering in low-dimensional Fermi surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this first-principles study, we investigated the thermoelectric properties of the full-Heusler compound CsK$_2$Sb at different compressive strains. We predict a p-type figure of merit ($zT$) of 2.6 at 800 K, in line with previous high $zT$ predictions. This high $zT$ arises from a low lattice thermal conductivity of 0.35 Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$ and a valence band structure exhibiting significant effective mass anisotropy, forming tube-like energy isosurfaces below the band edge, a characteristic of two dimensional (2D) systems that leads to a large number of high mobility charge carriers. The extended energy isosurfaces also correspond to large electron-scattering space, but with realistic wave function- and momentum-dependent electron scattering, we found this effect to be largely compensated by reduced scattering rates for larger momentum ${\mathbf{q}}$. The electronic transport properties were further enhanced with compressive strain, increasing the power factor by up to 66 %, in part due to enhanced 2D-features of the valence band. Unfortunately, compressive strain also increase the lattice thermal conductivity, resulting in a maximum p-type $zT=2.7$ at 1 % compressive strain. In the conduction band, strain can align the $\Gamma$- and X-centered valleys, resulting in the optimal n-type $zT$ increasing from 0.9 to 2.3 when adding 2 % compressive strain. Thus, the material class can have potential for both good p- and n- type thermoelectricity.</description>

      <title>An alternative GPU acceleration for a pseudopotential plane-waves density functional theory code with applications to metallic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an alternative GPU acceleration for plane waves pseudopotentials electronic structure codes designed for systems that have small unit cells but require a large number of k points to sample the Brillouin zone as happens, for instance, in metals. We discuss the diagonalization of the Kohn and Sham equations and the solution of the linear system derived in density functional perturbation theory. Both problems take advantage from a rewriting of the routine that applies the Hamiltonian to the Bloch wave-functions to work simultaneously (in parallel on the GPU threads) on the wave-functions with different wave-vectors k, as many as allowed by the GPU memory. Our implementation is written in CUDA Fortran and makes extensive use of kernel routines that run on the GPU (GLOBAL routines) or can be called from inside the GPU threads (DEVICE routines). We compare our method with the CPUs only calculation and with the approach currently implemented in Quantum ESPRESSO that uses GPU accelerated libraries for the FFT and for the linear algebra tasks such as the matrix-matrix multiplications as well as OpenACC directives for loop parallelization. We show in a realistic example that our method can give a significant improvement in the cases for which it has been designed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pressure-solution is a chemo-mechanical process, involving dissolution at grain/asperity contacts and precipitation away from them. It induces a compaction in time of rocks and sediments. The present study investigates numerically the impact of precipitation on the slowdown of creep behavior induced by pressure-solution. A recently published framework, called the Phase-Field Discrete Element Model, is carefully calibrated against existing indentation experiments and validated for other rate-limiting scenarios. It is shown that when precipitation is relatively slow, the slowdown of pressure-solution is due to a chemical mechanism (accumulation of solute concentration within the pore space), whereas, at fast precipitation, the slowdown is due to a mechanical mechanism (stress reduction at the contact).</description>

      <title>PAL -- Parallel active learning for machine-learned potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Constructing datasets representative of the target domain is essential for training effective machine learning models. Active learning (AL) is a promising method that iteratively extends training data to enhance model performance while minimizing data acquisition costs. However, current AL workflows often require human intervention and lack parallelism, leading to inefficiencies and underutilization of modern computational resources. In this work, we introduce PAL, an automated, modular, and parallel active learning library that integrates AL tasks and manages their execution and communication on shared- and distributed-memory systems using the Message Passing Interface (MPI). PAL provides users with the flexibility to design and customize all components of their active learning scenarios, including machine learning models with uncertainty estimation, oracles for ground truth labeling, and strategies for exploring the target space. We demonstrate that PAL significantly reduces computational overhead and improves scalability, achieving substantial speed-ups through asynchronous parallelization on CPU and GPU hardware. Applications of PAL to several real-world scenarios - including ground-state reactions in biomolecular systems, excited-state dynamics of molecules, simulations of inorganic clusters, and thermo-fluid dynamics - illustrate its effectiveness in accelerating the development of machine learning models. Our results show that PAL enables efficient utilization of high-performance computing resources in active learning workflows, fostering advancements in scientific research and engineering applications.</description>

Abstract: The ability to control matter at the atomic scale has revolutionized our understanding of the physical world, opening doors to unprecedented technological advancements. Quantum technology, which harnesses the unique principles of quantum mechanics, enables us to construct and manipulate atomic structures with extraordinary precision.
  Here, we propose a bottom-up approach to create topological magnetic textures in diluted adatom lattices on the Nb(110) surface. By fine-tuning adatom spacing, previously inaccessible magnetic phases can emerge. Our findings reveal that interactions between magnetic adatoms, mediated by the Nb substrate, foster the formation of unique topological spin textures, such as skyrmions and anti-skyrmions, both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic. Since Nb can be superconducting, our findings present a novel platform with valuable insights into the interplay between topological magnetism and superconductivity, paving the way for broader exploration of topological superconductivity in conjunction with spintronics applications.</description>

      <title>Universal Moir\'e Buckling of Freestanding 2D Bilayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The physics of membranes, a classic subject, acquires new momentum from two-dimensional (2D) materials multilayers. This work reports the surprising results emerged during a theoretical study of equilibrium geometry of bilayers as freestanding membranes. While ordinary membranes are prone to buckle around compressive impurities, we predict that all 2D material freestanding bilayers universally undergo, even if impurity-free, a spontaneous out-of-plane buckling. The moir\'e network nodes here play the role of internal impurities, the dislocations that join them giving rise to a stress pattern, purely shear in homo-bilayers and mixed compressive/shear in hetero-bilayers. That intrinsic stress is, theory and simulations show, generally capable to cause all freestanding 2D bilayers to undergo distortive bucklings with large amplitudes and a rich predicted phase transition scenario. Realistic simulations predict quantitative parameters expected for these phenomena as expected in hetero-bilayers such as graphene/hBN, $\rm{WS_2/WSe_2}$ hetero-bilayers, and for twisted homo-bilayers such as graphene, hBN, $\rm{MoS_2}$. Buckling then entails a variety of predicted consequences. Mechanically, a critical drop of bending stiffness is expected at all buckling transitions. Thermally, the average buckling corrugation decreases with temperature, with buckling-unbuckling phase transitions expected in some cases, and the buckled state often persisting even above room temperature. Buckling will be suppressed by deposition on hard attractive substrates, and survive in reduced form on soft ones. Frictional, electronic and other associated phenomena are also highlighted. The universality and richness of these predicted phenomena strongly encourages an experimental search, which is possible but still missing.</description>

      <title>Measurements of absolute bandgap deformation-potentials of optically-bright bilayer WSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bilayers of transition-metal dichalcogenides show many exciting features, including long-lived interlayer excitons and wide bandgap tunability using strain. Not many investigations on experimental determinations of deformation potentials relating changes in optoelectronic properties of bilayer WSe$_2$ with the strain are present in the literature. Our experimental study focuses on three widely investigated high-symmetry points, K$_{c}$, K$_{v}$, and Q$_{c}$, where subscript c (v) refers to the conduction (valence) band, in the Brillouin zone of bilayer WSe$_2$. Using local biaxial strains produced by nanoparticle stressors, a theoretical model, and by performing the spatially- and spectrally-resolved photoluminescence measurements, we determine absolute deformation potential of -5.10 $\pm$ 0.24 eV for Q$_{c}$-K$_{v}$ indirect bandgap and -8.50 $\pm$ 0.92 eV for K$_{c}$-K$_{v}$ direct bandgap of bilayer WSe$_2$. We also show that $\approx$0.9% biaxial tensile strain is required to convert an indirect bandgap bilayer WSe$_2$ into a direct bandgap semiconductor. Moreover, we also show that a relatively small amount of localized strain $\approx$0.4% is required to make a bilayer WSe$_2$ as optically bright as an unstrained monolayer WSe$_2$. The bandgap deformation potentials measured here will drive advances in flexible electronics, sensors, and optoelectronic- and quantum photonic- devices through precise strain engineering.</description>

      <title>Quantum Active Learning for Structural Determination of Doped Nanoparticles -- a Case Study of 4Al@Si$_{11}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active learning (AL) has been widely applied in chemistry and materials science. In this work we propose a quantum active learning (QAL) method for automatic structural determination of doped nanoparticles, where quantum machine learning (QML) models for regression are used iteratively to indicate new structures to be calculated by DFT or DFTB and this new data acquisition is used to retrain the QML models. The QAL method is implemented in the Quantum Machine Learning Software/Agent for Material Design and Discovery (QMLMaterial), whose aim is using an artificial agent (defined by QML regression algorithms) that chooses the next doped configuration to be calculated that has a higher probability of finding the optimum structure. The QAL uses a quantum Gaussian process with a fidelity quantum kernel as well as the projected quantum kernel and different quantum circuits. For comparison, classical AL was used with a classical Gaussian process with different classical kernels. The presented QAL method was applied in the structural determination of doped Si$_{11}$ with 4 Al (4Al@Si$_{11}$) and the results indicate the QAL method is able to find the optimum 4Al@Si$_{11}$ structure. The aim of this work is to present the QAL method -- formulated in a noise-free quantum computing framework -- for automatic structural determination of doped nanoparticles and materials defects.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity at Pd/Bi$_2$Se$_3$ Interfaces Due to Self-Formed PdBiSe Interlayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the physical and chemical processes at the interface of metals and topological insulators is crucial for developing the next generation of topological quantum devices. Here we report the discovery of robust superconductivity in Pd/Bi$_2$Se$_3$ bilayers fabricated by sputtering Pd on the surface of Bi$_2$Se$_3$. Through transmission electron microscopy measurements, we identify that the observed interfacial superconductivity originates from the diffusion of Pd into Bi$_2$Se$_3$. In the diffusion region, Pd chemically reacts with Bi$_2$Se$_3$ and forms a layer of PdBiSe, a known su-perconductor with a bulk transition temperature of 1.5 K. Our work provides a method for in-troducing superconductivity into Bi$_2$Se$_3$, laying the foundation for developing sophisticated Bi$_2$Se$_3$-based topological devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite significant advancements in wireless smart implants over the last two decades, current implantable devices still operate passively and require additional electronic modules for wireless transmission of the stored biological data. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative wireless force sensing paradigm for implantable systems through the integration of mechanical metamaterials and nano energy harvesting technologies. We demonstrate composite mechanical metamaterial implants capable of serving as all-in-one wireless force sensing units, incorporating functions for power generation, sensing and transmission with ultra-low power requirements. In this alternative communication approach, the electrical signals harvested by the implants from mechanical stimuli are utilized directly for the wireless transmission of the sensed data. We conduct experimental and theoretical studies to demonstrate the wireless detection of the generated strain-induced polarization electric field using electrodes. The feasibility of the proposed wireless force sensing approach is evaluated through a proof-of-concept orthopedic implant in the form of a total knee replacement. The findings indicate that the created wireless, electronic-free metamaterial implants with a power output as low as 0.1 picowatts enable direct, self-powered wireless communication during force sensing across air, simulated body fluid and animal tissue. We validate the functionality of the proposed implants through a series of experiments conducted on an ex vivo human cadaver knee specimen. Furthermore, the effect of electrode size and placement on the strength of the received signals is examined. Finally, we highlight the potential of our approach to create a diverse array of mechanically-tunable wireless force sensing implants without relying on any external power sources.</description>

      <title>Transistors based on Novel 2-D Monolayer Semiconductors Bi2O2Se, InSe, and MoSi2N4 for Enhanced Logic Density Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Making ultra-short gate-length transistors significantly contributes to scaling the contacted gate pitch. This, in turn, plays a vital role in achieving smaller standard logic cells for enhanced logic density scaling. As we push the boundaries of miniaturization, it is intriguing to consider that the ultimate limit of contacted gate pitch could be reached with remarkable 1 nm gate-length transistors. Here, we identify InSe, Bi2O2Se, and MoSi2N4 as potential two-dimensional semiconductors for 1 nm transistors with low contact resistance and outstanding interface properties. We employ a fully self-consistent ballistic quantum transport model starting from first-principle calculations. Our simulations show that the interplay between electrostatics and quantum tunneling influences the performance of these devices over the device design space. MoSi2N4 channels have the best immunity to quantum tunneling, and Bi2O2Se channel devices have the best electrostatics. We show that for a channel length of 12 nm, all the devices can deliver I_$ON$/I_$OFF$ &gt; 10^3 , suitable for electronic applications, and Bi2O2Se is the best-performing channel material.</description>

      <title>A Universal Localized Failure Mechanism for Real Cylindrical Shells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From cell development to space rockets, the mechanical stability of thin shells is crucial across many industrial and natural processes. However, predicting shells' failure properties remains an open challenge, owing to their sensitivity to imperfections inevitably present in real structures. Existing predictive methods are informed by classical stability analyses of idealized shells, which associate shell buckling with a spontaneously emerging delocalized buckling mode. Here, we show through experimental and numerical observations how realistic geometric imperfections instead result in a universal localized buckling mode. The profile of this mode is robust across shells despite their differing underlying defect structures. Further contrasting with classical predictions, a real shell's equilibrium surface deformations grow in the shape of this universal localized mode even at stable loads well before failure. Our findings show that these complex nonlinear dynamics for loads below buckling are described by a 1-D relationship for structures buckling from a saddle-node bifurcation instability. This breakthrough provides a simplified yet general understanding of buckling mechanisms, leading to improved non-destructive predictive methods. To showcase these applications, we experimentally implement a lateral-probing technique that predicts the buckling loads of several unmodified shells to within 1% of the correct value.</description>

      <title>Spectral theory of effective transport for continuous uniaxial polycrystalline materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Following seminal work in the early 1980s that established the existence and representations of the homogenized transport coefficients for two phase random media, we develop a mathematical framework that provides Stieltjes integral representations for the bulk transport coefficients for uniaxial polycrystalline materials, involving spectral measures of self-adjoint random operators, which are compositions of non-random and random projection operators. We demonstrate the same mathematical framework also describes two-component composites, with a simple substitution of the random projection operator, making the mathematical descriptions of these two distinct physical systems directly analogous to one another. A detailed analysis establishes the operators arising in each setting are indeed self-adjoint on an $L^2$-type Hilbert space, providing a rigorous foundation to the formal spectral theoretic framework established by Golden and Papanicolaou in 1983. An abstract extension of the Helmholtz theorem also leads to integral representations for the inverses of effective parameters, e.g., effective conductivity and resistivity. An alternate formulation of the effective parameter problem in terms of a Sobolev-type Hilbert space provides a rigorous foundation for an approach first established by Bergman and Milton. We show that the correspondence between the two formulations is a one-to-one isometry. Rigorous bounds that follow from such Stieltjes integrals and partial knowledge about the material geometry are reviewed and validated by numerical calculations of the effective parameters for polycrystalline media.</description>

      <title>Enhanced solid solution hardening by off-center substitutional solute atoms in {\alpha}-Ti</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most recently, some substitutional solute atoms in {\alpha}-Ti have been predicted to occupy unexpectedly the low-symmetry (LS) positions away from the high-symmetry (HS) lattice site, which was speculated to result in enhanced solid solution hardening (SSH). In the present work, the SSH induced by the LS off-center solute atom is evaluated within the framework of continuum elasticity theory, in comparison with that induced by its HS lattice-site counterpart. The interaction energy and force between the solute atom and the basal/prismatic edge/screw &lt;a&gt; dislocations in {\alpha}-Ti solid solution are calculated with the elastic dipole model, with which the strength increments induced by the solute atoms are evaluated with the Labusch model. We show that, in general, the LS solute atom interacts much more strongly with the dislocations than its HS counterpart does. The calculated interaction energies suggest that the LS solute atom forms atmosphere above/below the slip plane of the basal &lt;a&gt; dislocations but on the slip plane of the prismatic &lt;a&gt; dislocations regardless of the dislocation types (edge or screw). The strength increments caused by most of the LS solute atoms are more than an order of magnitude higher than those by their HS counterparts. The SSH effect induced by the LS solute atom is mainly determined by the strength of the Jahn-Teller splitting of the d-orbitals of the solute atom, dissimilar to that induced by HS solute atom where the atomic size mismatch dominates.</description>

      <title>Physically Constrained 3D Diffusion for Inverse Design of Fiber-reinforced Polymer Composite Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing fiber-reinforced polymer composites (FRPCs) with a tailored nonlinear stress-strain response can enable innovative applications across various industries. Currently, no efforts have achieved the inverse design of FRPCs that target the entire stress-strain curve. Here, we develop PC3D_Diffusion, a 3D spatial diffusion model designed for the inverse design of FRPCs. We generate 1.35 million FRPCs and calculate their stress-strain curves for training. Although the vanilla PC3D_Diffusion can generate visually appealing results, less than 10% of FRPCs generated by the vanilla model are collision-free, in which fibers do not intersect with each other. We then propose a loss-guided, learning-free approach to apply physical constraints during generation. As a result, PC3D_Diffusion can generate high-quality designs with tailored mechanical behaviors while guaranteeing to satisfy the physical constraints. PC3D_Diffusion advances FRPC inverse design and may facilitate the inverse design of other 3D materials, offering potential applications in industries reliant on materials with custom mechanical properties.</description>

      <title>The dynamical enhancement of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in lattice Anderson impurity model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new route to generate an interband Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in metals from solely microscopic perspective. The system consists of conduction band electrons in the presence of the Rashba spin-orbit coupling which are coupled to a $f(d)$-type localized and interacting electrons. The double occupancy in the $f$-band is penalized by a significant Coulomb interaction energy, $U$. When the hybridization between two bands is not strictly local, it leads an alternative pathway to a spin Hamiltonian that may proliferate the formation of Skyrmion textures. The effective spin Hamiltonian is derived using the Schriffer-Wolff perturbation theory. In addition to a Kondo spin exchange interaction between conduction band spins and $f(d)$-band spins, which is denoted as $\vec{s}_m \cdot \vec{S}_n$, the spin Hamiltonian admits a {\bf Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya} spin coupling term, $\vec{s}_m \times \vec{S}_n$. The magnitude of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya term is approximately ten to hundred times smaller than that of the Kondo term under physically relevant assumptions.
  The magnitude of spin coupling terms can be engineered using time-dependent external fields, motivating a generalization to a effective time-dependent Hamiltonian. In this respect, the perturbative derivation is extended to include time-dependent external field using a time-dependent SW transformation. The form of the effective spin Hamiltonian is retained while the spin coupling coefficients gain time dependence. It has been shown that the DM term acquires a new energy scale, which leads to an enhancement of one to two orders of magnitude and makes it comparable to the Kondo coupling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate spin textures induced by nonmagnetic vacancies in classical noncollinear magnets. By developing an "elasticity theory" for spin systems, we show that a defect-induced spin readjustment decays with a power law at large distances. The power-law exponent depends on the multipole moment of the local spin deformation, which is in turn determined by both the lattice symmetry and the equilibrium spin configuration in the absence of a defect. The interplay of these two ingredients is best illustrated by the J1-J2 Heisenberg model on a kagome lattice for which a point vacancy may produce spin deformations that decay as 1/r^2 for the q=0 ground state and as a 1/r for the \sqrt{3} x \sqrt{3} magnetic structure. The analytic conclusions are confirmed by extensive numerical simulations. We also compute the fractional magnetic moments associated with vacancies and other lattice defects. Our results shed light on relative fragility of different magnetic structures with respect to spin glass formation at higher doping levels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.15656v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The shift in the backbone of the frequency--response curve and the `jump-down' observed at a critical frequency observed in nano-resonators are caused by their nonlinear mechanical response. The shift and jump-down point are therefore often used to infer the mechanical properties that underlie the nonlinear response, particularly the resonator's stretching modulus. To facilitate this, the resonators's dynamics are often modelled using a Galerkin-type numerical approach or lumped ordinary differential equations like the Duffing equation, that incorporate an appropriate nonlinearity. To understand the source of the problem's nonlinearities, we first develop an axisymmetric but spatially-varying model of a membrane resonator subject to a uniform oscillatory load with linear damping. We then derive asymptotic solutions for the resulting partial differential equations (PDEs) using the Method of Multiple Scales (MS), which allows a systematic reduction to a Duffing-like equation with analytically determined coefficients. We also solve the PDEs numerically via the method of lines. By comparing the numerical solutions with the asymptotic results, we demonstrate that the numerical approach reveals a non-constant maximum compliance with increasing load, which contradicts the predictions of the MS analysis. In contrast, we show that combining a Galerkin decomposition with the Harmonic Balance Method accurately captures the non-constant maximum compliance and reliably predicts jump-down behaviour. We analyze the resulting frequency-response predictions derived from these methods. We also argue that fitting based on the jump-down point may be sensitive to noise and discuss strategies for fitting frequency-response curves from experimental data to theory that are robust to this.</description>

Abstract: Strong coupling between light and matter generates hybrid polariton modes. We present a continuum formalism that expresses the polariton modes in terms of light and matter densities of states (DOS). We derive exact expressions for the light and matter DOS for a planar cavity containing a strongly dispersive dielectric. We show that these DOS depend exclusively on the linear response of the cavity components, i.e., the reflectance of the mirrors and the susceptibility of the dielectric. We further show that, within the strong coupling regime, the light and matter DOS are well-approximated by coupled mode theory. Altogether, our continuum formalism offers a unified treatment of polaritons that connects the framework of light-matter coupling with that of linear dispersion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In materials science, a wide range of properties of materials are governed by various types of energies, including thermal, physicochemical, structural, and mechanical energies. In 2005, Dr. Frans Spaepen used crystalline face-centered-cubic (fcc) copper as an example to discuss a variety of phenomena that are associated with energies. Inspired by his pioneering work, we broaden our analysis to include a selection of representative pure metals with fcc, hexagonal close-packed (hcp), and body-centered cubic (bcc) structures. Additionally, we extend our comparison to energies between pure metals and equiatomic binary, ternary, and multi-principal element alloys (sometimes also known as high-entropy alloys). Through an extensive collection of data and calculations, we compile energy tables that provide a comprehensive view of how structure and alloying influence the energy profiles of these metals and alloys. We highlight the significant impact of constituent elements on the energies of alloys compared to pure metals and reveal a notable disparity in mechanical energies among materials in fcc-, hcp- and bcc-structured metals and alloys. Furthermore, we discuss the energy relationships, the implications for structural transformations and potential applications, providing insights into the broader context of these energy variations.</description>

Abstract: The vast majority of materials science knowledge exists in unstructured natural language, yet structured data is crucial for innovative and systematic materials design. Traditionally, the field has relied on manual curation and partial automation for data extraction for specific use cases. The advent of large language models (LLMs) represents a significant shift, potentially enabling efficient extraction of structured, actionable data from unstructured text by non-experts. While applying LLMs to materials science data extraction presents unique challenges, domain knowledge offers opportunities to guide and validate LLM outputs. This review provides a comprehensive overview of LLM-based structured data extraction in materials science, synthesizing current knowledge and outlining future directions. We address the lack of standardized guidelines and present frameworks for leveraging the synergy between LLMs and materials science expertise. This work serves as a foundational resource for researchers aiming to harness LLMs for data-driven materials research. The insights presented here could significantly enhance how researchers across disciplines access and utilize scientific information, potentially accelerating the development of novel materials for critical societal needs.</description>

      <title>Reentrant polar phase induced by the ferro-ionic coupling in Bi$_{1-x}$Sm$_x$FeO$_3$ nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12856v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the model of four sublattices, the Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire-Kittel phenomenological approach and the Stephenson-Highland ionic adsorption model for the description of coupled polar and antipolar long-range orders in ferroics, we calculated analytically the phase diagrams and polar properties of Bi$_{1-x}$Sm$_x$FeO$_3$ nanoparticles covered by surface ions in dependence on their size, surface ions density, samarium content "x" and temperature. The size effects and ferro-ionic coupling govern the appearance and stability conditions of the long-range ordered ferroelectric, reentrant ferrielectric and antiferroelectric phases in the Bi1-xSmxFeO3 nanoparticles. Calculated phase diagrams are in a qualitative agreement with the X-ray diffraction phase analysis, electron paramagnetic resonance, infra-red spectroscopy and electrophysical measurements of the Bi$_{1-x}$Sm$_x$FeO$_3$ nanopowders sintered by the solution combustion method. The combined theoretical-experimental approach allows to establish the influence of the ferro-ionic coupling and size effects in Bi$_{1-x}$Sm$_x$FeO$_3$ nanoparticles on their polar properties.</description>

      <title>Domino-like magnetic phase transition induced by a bias voltage in FeRh thin film</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14772v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The first-order magnetic phase transition (MPT) usually happens with a very wide magnetic field span about tens of thousands Oersted which hinders its applications. In this work, we induce a domino-like MPT via introducing a bias voltage in FeRh thin film and thus realize a large narrowing of transition magnetic field span from 6*10^4 Oe to lower than 2*10^3 Oe at room temperature. Meanwhile, nonvolatile switchings between pure magnetic phases of FeRh at room temperature also can be realized by applying voltage pulses. The critical condition and phase diagram for domino-like MPTs are obtained in theory and our experiments support it well. Our works not only benefit the studies and applications of MPT-based devices but also are significant in the applications of the phase transition systems with resistance change.</description>

      <title>Powder Ball Milling: An energy balance approach to particle size reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Milling of brittle materials shows a lower limit in size reduction, below which grinding cannot proceed further. Experimentally, the smallest particle size is determined by the milling media energy, and it is time-independent. Rittinger's law, which applies to fine grinding, does not consider any lower limit in size, leading to nonphysical results. A damping factor gradually inhibiting grinding efficiency has already been suggested as a modification. Milling mechanics and changes in material properties at small sizes have been associated to this behavior. In this work, the grinding inhibition is linked to an energy balance between the powder's specific surface energy and the energy density, calculated as the kinetic energy of the milling media divided by the impacted volume. By introducing the idea of energy equilibrium, comminution behaves as a phase transformation characterized by a JMAK kinetics. Validation of this formulation has been conducted on published and original data.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Constraint Integration for Simultaneously Optimizing Crystal Structures with Multiple Targeted Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08562v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In materials science, finding crystal structures that have targeted properties is crucial. While recent methodologies such as Bayesian optimization and deep generative models have made some advances on this issue, these methods often face difficulties in adaptively incorporating various constraints, such as electrical neutrality and targeted properties optimization, while keeping the desired specific crystal structure. To address these challenges, we have developed the Simultaneous Multi-property Optimization using Adaptive Crystal Synthesizer (SMOACS), which utilizes state-of-the-art property prediction models and their gradients to directly optimize input crystal structures for targeted properties simultaneously. SMOACS enables the integration of adaptive constraints into the optimization process without necessitating model retraining. Thanks to this feature, SMOACS has succeeded in simultaneously optimizing targeted properties while maintaining perovskite structures, even with models trained on diverse crystal types. We have demonstrated the band gap optimization while meeting a challenging constraint, that is, maintaining electrical neutrality in large atomic configurations up to 135 atom sites, where the verification of the electrical neutrality is challenging. The properties of the most promising materials have been confirmed by density functional theory calculations.</description>

      <title>Phosphorus Nanotubes from Chemical Cleavage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17531v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a strategy to make phosphorus nanotubes from two well-known phosphorus allotropes: violet phosphorus and fibrous red phosphorus. First-principles calculations show that doping with sulfur dissociates the covalent bonds between tubular phosphorus structures that form bilayers in these allotropes, resulting in free-standing 1D nanotubes. Due to the substitutional nature of the sulfur dopant, the resulting 1D structure is linear, unlike the helical ring structure studied previously. The sulfur sites are situated periodically along the 1D nanotubes and can be further functionalized. Our results show that the S-doped phosphorus nanotube can sustain a tensile strain of up to 18%. The strain also substantially modifies the electronic band gap and the effective mass of carriers. Calculations using the many-body Green's functions (GW) and the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) approaches reveal a large exciton binding energy of 1.57 eV. The one-dimensional nature, linearity, functionalizability, mechanical flexibility, tunability of electronic properties, and large exciton binding energy make this material interesting for applications in optoelectronic devices, solar cells, chemical sensors, and quantum computing.</description>

      <title>LLM4Mat-Bench: Benchmarking Large Language Models for Materials Property Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00177v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used in materials science. However, little attention has been given to benchmarking and standardized evaluation for LLM-based materials property prediction, which hinders progress. We present LLM4Mat-Bench, the largest benchmark to date for evaluating the performance of LLMs in predicting the properties of crystalline materials. LLM4Mat-Bench contains about 1.9M crystal structures in total, collected from 10 publicly available materials data sources, and 45 distinct properties. LLM4Mat-Bench features different input modalities: crystal composition, CIF, and crystal text description, with 4.7M, 615.5M, and 3.1B tokens in total for each modality, respectively. We use LLM4Mat-Bench to fine-tune models with different sizes, including LLM-Prop and MatBERT, and provide zero-shot and few-shot prompts to evaluate the property prediction capabilities of LLM-chat-like models, including Llama, Gemma, and Mistral. The results highlight the challenges of general-purpose LLMs in materials science and the need for task-specific predictive models and task-specific instruction-tuned LLMs in materials property prediction.</description>

      <title>Molecular beam epitaxy growth of superconducting tantalum germanide</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01038v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Developing new material platforms for use in superconductor-semiconductor hybrid structures is desirable due to limitations caused by intrinsic microwave losses present in commonly used III/V material systems. With the recent reports on tantalum superconducting qubits that show improvements over the Nb and Al counterparts, exploring Ta as an alternative superconductor in hybrid material systems is promising. Here, we study the growth of Ta on semiconducting Ge (001) substrates grown via molecular beam epitaxy. We show that at a growth temperature of 400$^{\circ}$C the Ta diffuses into the Ge matrix in a self-limiting nature resulting in smooth and abrupt surfaces and interfaces with roughness on the order of 3-7 \r{A} as measured by atomic force microscopy and x-ray reflectivity. The films are found to be a mixture of Ta$_{5}$Ge$_{3}$ and TaGe$_{2}$ binary alloys and form a native oxide that seems to form a sharp interface with the underlying film. These films are superconducting with a $T_{C}\sim 1.8-2$K and $H_{C}^{\perp} \sim 1.88T$, $H_{C}^{\parallel} \sim 5.1T$. These results show this tantalum germanide film to be promising for future superconducting quantum information platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14112v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The miniaturization of integrated circuits is facing an obstruction due to the escalating electrical resistivity of conventional copper interconnects. The underlying reason for this problem was unveiled by Fuchs and Sondheimer, who showed that thinner wires are more resistive because current-carrying electrons encounter the rough surfaces of the wire more frequently therein. Here, we present a generalization of the Fuchs-Sondheimer theory to Dirac and Weyl materials, which are candidates for next-generation interconnects. We predict a nonlinear longitudinal electric current originating from the combined action of the Berry curvature and non-specular surface-scattering.</description>

      <title>Quantum Valley Hall effect without Berry curvature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15050v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum valley Hall effect (QVHE) is characterized by the valley Chern number (VCN) in a way that one-dimensional (1D) chiral metallic states are guaranteed to appear at the domain walls (DW) between two domains with opposite VCN for a given valley. Although in the case of QVHE, the total BC of the system is zero, the BC distributed locally around each valley makes the VCN well-defined as long as inter-valley scattering is negligible. Here, we propose a new type of valley-dependent topological phenomenon that occurs when the BC is strictly zero at each momentum. Such zero Berry curvature (ZBC) QVHE is characterized by the valley Euler number (VEN) which is computed by integrating the Euler curvature around a given valley in two-dimensional (2D) systems with space-time inversion symmetry. 1D helical metallic states can be topologically protected at the DW between two domains with the opposite VENs when the DW configuration preserves either the mirror symmetry with respect to the DW or the combination of the DW space-time inversion, and chiral symmetries. We establish the fundamental origin of ZBC-QVHE. Also, by combining tight-binding model study and first-principles calculations, we propose stacked hexagonal bilayer lattices including h-BX (X=As, P) and large-angle twisted bilayer graphenes as candidate systems with robust helical DW states protected by VEN.</description>

      <title>Origin of competing charge density waves in kagome metal ScV$_6$Sn$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17058v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding competing charge density wave (CDW) orders in the bilayer kagome metal ScV$_6$Sn$_6$ remains challenging. Experimentally, upon cooling, short-range order with wave vector $\mathbf{q}_{2}=(\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{2})$ forms, which is subsequently suppressed by the condensation of long-range $\mathbf{q}_{3}=(\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{3})$ CDW order at lower temperature. Theoretically, however, the $\mathbf{q}_{2}$ CDW is predicted as the ground state, leaving the CDW mechanism elusive. Here, using anharmonic phonon-phonon calculations combined with density functional theory, we predict a temperature-driven structural phase transitions from the high-temperature pristine phase to the $\mathbf{q}_{2}$ CDW, followed by the low-temperature $\mathbf{q}_{3}$ CDW, explaining experimental observations. We demonstrate that semi-core electron states stabilize the $\mathbf{q}_{3}$ CDW over the $\mathbf{q}_{2}$ CDW. Furthermore, we find that the out-of-plane lattice parameter controls the competing CDWs, motivating us to propose compressive bi-axial strain as an experimental protocol to stabilize the $\mathbf{q}_{2}$ CDW. Finally, we suggest Ge or Pb doping at the Sn site as another potential avenue to control CDW instabilities. Our work provides a full theory of CDWs in ScV$_6$Sn$_6$, rationalizing experimental observations and resolving earlier discrepancies between theory and experiment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11979v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose that a high-quality flat interface or boundary may act as a long-range skew scatterer for charged quasiparticles in a metal. In the presence of electric current parallel to the interface the number of clockwise and anti-clockwise reflections from the interface are no longer compensated. This results in a net orbital magnetization that can be observed by magneto-electric Kerr effect in a vicinity of the mean free path from the edge. The value of effective magnetization is given by the product of charge current density and the electron mean free path. Unlike orbital Hall or orbital Edelstein effects the proposed phenomenon does not require inversion symmetry breaking in the bulk of the sample.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16520v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In designing material functionalities for transition metal oxides, lattice structure and d-orbital occupancy are key determinants. However, the modulation of these two factors is inherently limited by the need to balance thermodynamic stability, growth kinetics, and stoichiometry precision, particularly for metastable phases. We introduce a methodology, namely the gigantic-oxidative atomic-layer-by-layer epitaxy (GOALL-Epitaxy), enhancing oxidation power 3-4 orders of magnitude beyond conventional pulsed laser deposition (PLD) and oxide molecular beam epitaxy (OMBE), while ensuring atomic-layer-by-layer growth of designed complex structures. Thermodynamic stability is markedly augmented with stronger oxidation at elevated temperatures, whereas growth kinetics is sustained by laser ablation at lower temperatures. We demonstrate the accurate growth of complex nickelates and cuprates, especially an artificially designed structure with alternating single and double NiO2 layers possessing distinct nominal d-orbital occupancy, as a parent of high-temperature superconductor. The GOALL-Epitaxy enables material discovery within the vastly broadened growth parameter space.</description>

      <title>InvDesFlow: An AI search engine to explore possible high-temperature superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discovery of new superconducting materials, particularly those exhibiting high critical temperature ($T_c$), has been a vibrant area of study within the field of condensed matter physics. Conventional approaches primarily rely on physical intuition to search for potential superconductors within the existing databases. However, the known materials only scratch the surface of the extensive array of possibilities within the realm of materials. Here, we develop InvDesFlow, an AI search engine that integrates deep model pre-training and fine-tuning techniques, diffusion models, and physics-based approaches (e.g., first-principles electronic structure calculation) for the discovery of high-$T_c$ superconductors. Utilizing InvDesFlow, we have obtained 74 dynamically stable materials with critical temperatures predicted by the AI model to be $T_c \geq$ 15 K based on a very small set of samples. Notably, these materials are not contained in any existing dataset. Furthermore, we analyze trends in our dataset and individual materials including B$_4$CN$_3$ (at 5 GPa) and B$_5$CN$_2$ (at ambient pressure) whose $T_c$s are 24.08 K and 15.93 K, respectively. We demonstrate that AI technique can discover a set of new high-$T_c$ superconductors, outline its potential for accelerating discovery of the materials with targeted properties.</description>

Abstract: Optical phonon engineering through nonlinear effects has been utilized in ultrafast control of material properties. However, nonlinear optical phonons typically exhibit rapid decay due to strong mode-mode couplings, limiting their effectiveness in temperature or frequency sensitive applications. In this study, we report the observation of long-lived nonlinear optical phonons through the spontaneous formation of phonon frequency combs in the van der Waals material CrXTe$_3$ (X=Ge, Si) using high-resolution Raman scattering. Unlike conventional optical phonons, the highest $A_g$ mode in CrGeTe$_3$ splits into equidistant, sharp peaks forming a frequency comb that persists for hundreds of oscillations and survives up to 100K before decaying. These modes correspond to localized oscillations of Ge$_2$Te$_6$ clusters, isolated from Cr hexagons, behaving as independent quantum oscillators. Introducing a cubic nonlinear term to the harmonic oscillator model, we simulate the phonon time evolution and successfully replicate the observed comb structure. Similar frequency comb behavior is observed in CrSiTe$_3$, demonstrating the generalizability of this phenomenon. Our findings reveal that Raman scattering effectively probes high-frequency nonlinear phonon modes, providing new insight into generating long-lived, tunable phonon frequency combs with applications in ultrafast material control and phonon-based technologies.</description>

      <title>Quantum dynamics of photophysical aggregates in conjugated polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14675v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photophysical aggregates are ubiquitous in many solid-state microstructures adopted by conjugated polymers, in which $\pi$ electrons interact with those in other polymer chains or those in other chromophores along the chain. These interactions fundamentally define the electronic and optical properties of the polymer film. While valuable insight can be gained from linear excitation and photoluminescence spectra, nonlinear coherent excitation spectral lineshapes provide intricate understanding on the electronic couplings that define the aggregate and their fluctuations. Here, we discuss the coherent two-dimensional excitation lineshape of a model hairy-rod conjugated polymer. At zero population waiting time, we find a $\pi/2$ phase shift between the 0-0 and 0-1 vibronic peaks in the real and imaginary components of the complex coherent spectrum, as well as a dynamic phase rotation with population waiting time over timescales that are longer than the optical dephasing time. We conjecture that these are markers of relaxation of the photophysical aggregate down the tight manifold of the exciton band. These results highlight the potential for coherent spectroscopy via analysis of the complex spectral lineshape to become a key tool to develop structure-property relationships in complex functional materials.</description>
