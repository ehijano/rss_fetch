      <title>Information and the living tree of life: A theory of measurement grounded in biology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend a formal framework that previously derived time from the multifractal structure of biological lineages (Hudnall \&amp; D'Souza, 2025). That work showed that time itself is multifractal -- not a universal background dimension, but an observer-dependent geometry. Here we develop the corresponding theory of measurement: showing that a multifractal conception of time not only permits measurement, but grounds it more rigorously in the structure of biology. The tree of life is modeled as the outcome of stochastic, convex branching, and we show how information-theoretic and fractal measures render its multifractal geometry into measurable, observer-relative time intervals. At the core is a dilation equation that expresses relative time elapse between entities as dimensionless ratios. Operational standards such as the SI second remain valid, but our framework makes explicit their lineage-dependence. This framework unifies measurement theory with biological form, preserves full compatibility with established science, and provides a biologically grounded theory of observation. It enables comparative analyses of duration and kinematics across lineages, with predictions that are directly open to experimental validation.</description>

      <title>Modelling road mortality risks to persistence to a Western Toad ({\it Anaxyrus boreas}) population in British Columbia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Road mortality may be a significant factor in the global decline of amphibian populations, yet rigorous assessments of its effect on long-term population persistence are lacking.
  Here, we investigate population persistence through a field study and mathematical model of a western toad ({\textit{Anaxyrus Boreas}} {\RR(Baird and Girard, 1852)}) population within a highway corridor in the Selkirk Mountains of British Columbia.
  The analysis shows traffic levels strongly correlate with toad mortality, with each additional vehicle causing a 3.1\% $\pm$ 1.3\% ($p=0.020$) increase in toad deaths.
  Although the current risk of the population becoming threatened or endangered is low, it rises to 50\% if baseline road mortality increases from 10\% to 30\%. Gravid female mortality is higher than the baseline mortality and can increase the probability of endangerment by nearly two-fold at higher baseline mortality levels.
  We make the case that a small increase in vehicle traffic resulting from future development and recreational pressures
  could destabilize this apparently healthy toad population. The high sensitivity to traffic levels and rapid transition from healthy to endangered raises concerns for similar populations worldwide. Compensatory structures such as amphibian underpasses (toad tunnels) should be given high priority.</description>

      <title>Evaluating sampling strategies for effective detection of African swine fever in the growing pig population in the U.S</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early detection of African swine fever virus (ASFV) is critical to preventing widespread epidemics. However, the effectiveness of within-farm sampling remains to be examined, particularly during the early phase of an outbreak when disease prevalence is low, animals may be asymptomatic, or clinical signs are masked by co-circulating diseases. This study assessed four sampling strategies for detecting ASFV-infected animals in suspected growing pig farms within the first 14 days of the introduction of either a high- or moderate-virulence ASFV strain. Pens were selected using three methods: random sampling, targeted sampling of pens with clinical animals, and informative sampling based on estimated pen infection probabilities. The informative sampling method was further divided into sequential method, which ranked pens by descending viral load probability, and cluster and random method, which selected pens at random from high and low viral load clusters. Each pen-selection method was examined with different sample sizes. We calculated the sensitivity of each approach as the probability of detecting at least one ASFV-positive pig per farm. Results showed that sampling 30 pens with one pig per pen using the target and random pen-selection method yielded the highest detection sensitivity, even in the presence of other co-circulating diseases that interfere with the accurate identification of clinical ASFV cases. In contrast, sampling five pens resulted in the lowest sensitivity. These findings provide valuable insights for improving ASFV surveillance strategies in the U.S. and can inform preparedness efforts for other foreign animal diseases.</description>

      <title>Parameter Estimation in Recurrent Tumor Evolution with Finite Carrying Capacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the population dynamics of tumor cells under therapeutic pressure. Although drug treatment initially induces a reduction in tumor burden, treatment failure frequently occurs over time due to the emergence of drug resistance, ultimately leading to cancer recurrence. To model this process, we employ a two-type branching process with state-dependent growth rates. The model assumes an initial tumor population composed predominantly of drug-sensitive cells, with a small subpopulation of resistant cells. Sensitive cells may acquire resistance through mutation, which is coupled to a change in cellular fitness. Furthermore, the growth rates of resistant cells are modulated by the overall tumor burden. Using stochastic differential equation techniques, we establish a functional law of large numbers for the scaled populations of sensitive cells, resistant cells, and the initial resistant clone. We then define the stochastic recurrence time as the first time the total tumor population regrows to its initial size following treatment. For this recurrence time, as well as for measures of clonal diversity and the size of the largest resistant clone at recurrence, we derive corresponding law of large number limits. These asymptotic results provide a theoretical foundation for constructing statistically consistent estimators for key biological parameters, including the cellular growth rates, the mutation rate, and the initial fraction of resistant cells.</description>

      <title>PhyloLM : Inferring the Phylogeny of Large Language Models and Predicting their Performances in Benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04671v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces PhyloLM, a method adapting phylogenetic algorithms to Large Language Models (LLMs) to explore whether and how they relate to each other and to predict their performance characteristics. Our method calculates a phylogenetic distance metric based on the similarity of LLMs' output. The resulting metric is then used to construct dendrograms, which satisfactorily capture known relationships across a set of 111 open-source and 45 closed models. Furthermore, our phylogenetic distance predicts performance in standard benchmarks, thus demonstrating its functional validity and paving the way for a time and cost-effective estimation of LLM capabilities. To sum up, by translating population genetic concepts to machine learning, we propose and validate a tool to evaluate LLM development, relationships and capabilities, even in the absence of transparent training information.</description>

      <title>The Rhythm of Aging: Stability and Drift in Human Senescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04143v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human aging is marked by a steady rise in the risk of dying with age--a process demographers call senescence. Over the past century, life expectancy has risen dramatically, but is this because we are aging slower, or simply starting it later? Vaupel hypothesizes that the pace at which individuals age may be constant, with gains in longevity coming from the delayed onset of senescence rather than its slowing down. We test this idea using a new framework that decomposes the pace of senescence into three components: a biological baseline, a long-term trend, and the cumulative impact of period shocks. Applying this to cohort mortality data from 12 countries, we find that once period shocks are accounted for, there is no statistical evidence of a long-term trend, consistent Vaupel's hypothesis. Rather than indicating a change in the process that drives senescence, these variations are consistent with echoes of shared historical events. These results suggest that while longevity has shifted, the rhythm of human aging may be conserved.</description>
