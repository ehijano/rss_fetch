      <title>On exact products of two dihedral groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An exact product of two finite groups $H$ and $K$ is a finite group $X$ which contains $H$ and $K$ as subgroups, satisfying $X=HK$ and $H\cap K=\{1_X\}$. In this paper, we provide a classification of the exact products of two dihedral groups of orders $2m$ and $2n$ for all odd numbers $m,n\geq 3$.</description>

      <title>$p$-elements in profinite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate some properties of the $p$-elements of a profinite group $G$. We prove that if $p$ is odd and the probability that a randomly chosen element of $G$ is a $p$-element is positive, then $G$ contains an open prosolvable subgroup. On the contrary, there exist groups that are not virtually prosolvable but in which the probability that a randomly chosen element of $G$ is a 2-element is arbitrarily close to 1. We prove also that if a profinite group $G$ has the property that, for every $p$-element $x$, it is positive the probability that a randomly chosen element $y$ of $G$ generates with $x$ a pro-$p$ group, then $G$ contains an open pro-$p$ subgroup.</description>

      <title>Dimension and partial groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A partial group with $n+1$ elements is, when regarded as a symmetric simplicial set, of dimension at most $n$. This dimension is $n$ if and only if the partial group is a group. As a consequence of the first statement, finite partial groups are genuinely finite, despite being seemingly specified by infinitely much data. In particular, finite partial groups have only finitely many im-partial subgroups. We also consider dimension of partial groupoids.</description>

      <title>Dehn functions of subgroups of products of free groups: 3-factor case, $F_{n-1}$ case, and Bridson-Dison group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subgroups of direct products of finitely many finitely generated free groups form a natural class that plays an important role in geometric group theory. Its members include fundamental examples, such as the Stallings-Bieri groups. This raises the problem of understanding their geometric invariants. We prove that finitely presented subgroups of direct products of three free groups, as well as subgroups of finiteness type $\mathcal{F}_{n-1}$ in a direct product of $n$ free groups, have Dehn function bounded above by $N^9$. This gives a positive answer to a question of Dison within these important subclasses and provides new insights in the context of Bridson's conjecture that finitely presented subgroups of direct products of free groups have polynomially bounded Dehn function. We also give the first precise computation of a superquadratic Dehn function of a finitely presented subgroup of a direct product of finitely many free groups: we show that the Bridson-Dison group is a subgroup of a direct product of three free groups with Dehn function $N^4$. To prove our results we generalise techniques for "pushing fillings" into normal subgroups and define a new invariant for obtaining optimal lower bounds on Dehn functions.</description>

      <title>A Hurewicz-type formula for asymptotic-dimension-lowering symmetric quasimorphisms of countable approximate groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A well-known Hurewicz-type formula for asymptotic-dimension-lowering group homomorphisms, due to A. Dranishnikov and J. Smith, states that if $f:G\to H$ is a group homomorphism, then $\mathrm{asdim} G \leq \mathrm{asdim} H + \mathrm{asdim} (\ker f)$. In this paper we establish a similar formula for certain quasimorphisms of countable approximate groups: if $(\Xi, \Xi^\infty)$ and $(\Lambda, \Lambda^\infty)$ are countable approximate groups and if $f:(\Xi, \Xi^\infty)\to (\Lambda,\Lambda^\infty)$ is a symmetric unital quasimorphism, we show that $\mathrm{asdim} \Xi \leq \mathrm{asdim} \Lambda + \mathrm{asdim} (f^{-1}\!(D(f)))$, where $D(f)$ is the defect set of $f$.</description>

      <title>Metric duality for Abelian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main aim of the paper is to introduce the concept of metric duality in the category of topological Abelian groups that extends the classical notion of duality for normed vector spaces and behaves quite nicely for LCA groups (equipped with nice metrics). In particular, it is shown that each Polish LCA group admits a reflexive proper metric and, more generally, all LCA groups possess reflexive (proper) metric structures.</description>

      <title>Equi-isoclinic subspaces from symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a flexible technique that constructs tight fusion frames with prescribed transitive symmetry. Applying this technique with representations of the symmetric and alternating groups, we obtain several new infinite families of equi-isoclinic tight fusion frames, each with the remarkable property that its automorphism group is either $S_n$ or $A_n$. These ensembles are optimal packings for Grassmannian space equipped with spectral distance, and as such, they find applications in block compressed sensing.</description>

      <title>The Finiteness Problem for Automaton Semigroups of Extended Bounded Activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the notion of activity for automaton semigroups and monoids introduced by Bartholdi, Godin, Klimann and Picantin to a more general setting. Their activity notion was already a generalization of Sidki's activity hierarchy for automaton groups. Using the concept of expandability introduced earlier by the current authors, we show that the language of $\omega$-words with infinite orbits is effectively a deterministic B\"uchi language for our extended activity. This generalizes a similar previous result on automaton groups by Bondarenko and the third author. By a result of Francoeur and the current authors, the description via a B\"uchi automaton immediately yields that the finiteness problem for complete automaton semigroups and monoids of bounded activity is decidable. In fact, we obtain a stronger result where we may consider sub-orbits under the action of a regular, suffix-closed language over the generators. This, in particular, also yields that it is decidable whether a finitely generated subsemigroup (or -monoid) of a bounded complete automaton semigroup is finite.</description>

      <title>Locally moving groups and laminar actions on the line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.14678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.14678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove various results that, given a sufficiently rich subgroup $G$ of the group of homeomorphisms on the real line, describe the structure of the other possible actions of $G$ on the line, and address under which conditions such actions must be semi-conjugate to the natural defining action of $G$. The main assumption is that $G$ should be locally moving, meaning that for every open interval the subgroup of elements fixing pointwise its complement, acts on it without fixed points. We show that when $G$ is a locally moving group, every $C^1$ action of $G$ on the real line is semi-conjugate to its standard action or to a non-faithful action. The situation is much wilder when considering actions by homeomorphisms: for a large class of groups, we describe uncountably many conjugacy classes of faithful minimal actions. Next, we prove structure theorems for $C^0$ actions, based on the study of laminar actions, which are actions on the line preserving a lamination. When $G$ is a group of homeomorphisms of the line acting minimally, and with a non-trivial compactly supported element, then any faithful minimal action of $G$ on the line is either laminar or conjugate to its standard action. Moreover, when $G$ is a locally moving group with a suitable finite generation condition, for any faithful minimal laminar action there is a map from the lamination to the line, called a horograding, which is equivariant with respect to the action on the lamination and the standard one, and with some extra suitable conditions. This establishes a tight relation between all minimal actions on the line of such groups, and their standard actions. Finally, based on an analysis of the space of harmonic actions, we show that for a large class of locally moving groups, the standard action is locally rigid, in the sense that sufficiently small perturbations in the compact-open topology give semi-conjugate actions.</description>

Abstract: Let $V$ be a finite-dimensional vector space over the field with $p$ elements, where $p$ is a prime number. Given arbitrary $\alpha,\beta\in \mathrm{GL}(V)$, we consider the semidirect products $V\rtimes\langle \alpha\rangle$ and $V\rtimes\langle \beta\rangle$, and show that if $V\rtimes\langle \alpha\rangle$ and $V\rtimes\langle \beta\rangle$ are isomorphic, then $\alpha$ must be similar to a power of $\beta$ that generates the same subgroup as $\beta$; that is, if $H$ and $K$ are cyclic subgroups of $\mathrm{GL}(V)$ such that $V\rtimes H\cong V\rtimes K$, then $H$ and $K$ must be conjugate subgroups of $\mathrm{GL}(V)$. If we remove the cyclic condition, there exist examples of non-isomorphic, let alone non-conjugate, subgroups $H$ and $K$ of $\mathrm{GL}(V)$ such that $V\rtimes H\cong V\rtimes K$. Even if we require that non-cyclic subgroups $H$ and $K$ of $\mathrm{GL}(V)$ be abelian, we may still have $V\rtimes H\cong V\rtimes K$ with $H$ and $K$ non-conjugate in $\mathrm{GL}(V)$, but in this case, $H$ and $K$ must at least be isomorphic. If we replace $V$ by a free module $U$ over ${\mathbf Z}/p^m{\mathbf Z}$ of finite rank, with $m&gt;1$, it may happen that $U\rtimes H\cong U\rtimes K$ for non-conjugate cyclic subgroups of $\mathrm{GL}(U)$. If we completely abandon our requirements on $V$, a sufficient criterion is given for a finite group $G$ to admit non-conjugate cyclic subgroups $H$ and $K$ of $\mathrm{Aut}(G)$ such that $G\rtimes H\cong G\rtimes K$. This criterion is satisfied by many groups.</description>

      <title>Non-commutative error correcting codes and proper subgroup testing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Property testing has been a major area of research in computer science in the last three decades. By property testing we refer to an ensemble of problems, results and algorithms which enable to deduce global information about some data by only reading small random parts of it. In recent years, this theory found its way into group theory, mainly via group stability.
  In this paper, we study the following problem: Devise a randomized algorithm that given a subgroup $H$ of $G$, decides whether $H$ is the whole group or a proper subgroup, by checking whether a single (random) element of $G$ is in $H$. The search for such an algorithm boils down to the following purely group theoretic problem: For $G$ of rank $k$, find a small as possible test subset $A\subseteq G$ such that for every proper subgroup $H$, $|H\cap A|\leq (1-\delta)|A|$ for some absolute constant $\delta&gt;0$, which we call the detection probability of $A$. It turns out that the search for sets $A$ of size linear in $k$ and constant detection probability is a non-commutative analogue of the classical search for families of good error correcting codes. This paper is devoted to proving that such test subsets exist, which implies good universal error correcting codes exist -- providing a far reaching generalization of the classical result of Shannon.
  In addition, we study this problem in certain subclasses of groups -- such as abelian, nilpotent, and finite solvable groups -- providing different constructions of test subsets for these subclasses with various qualities. Finally, this generalized theory of non-commutative error correcting codes suggests a plethora of interesting problems and research directions.</description>

      <title>Minimality of the inner automorphism group</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.17065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By [6], a minimal group $G$ is called $z$-minimal if $G/Z(G)$ is minimal. In this paper, we present the $z$-Minimality Criterion for dense subgroups with some applications to topological matrix groups. For a locally compact group $G$, let $\operatorname{Inn}(G)$ be the group of all inner automorphisms of $G,$ endowed with the Birkhoff topology. Using a theorem by Goto [14], we obtain our main result which asserts that if $G$ is a connected Lie group and $H\in\{G/Z(G), \operatorname{Inn}(G)\},$ then $H$ is minimal if and only if it is centre-free and topologically isomorphic to $\operatorname{Inn}(G/Z(G)).$ In particular, if $G$ is a connected Lie group with discrete centre, then $\operatorname{Inn}(G)$ is minimal. We prove that a connected locally compact nilpotent group is $z$-minimal if and only if it is compact abelian. In contrast, we show that there exists a connected metabelian $z$-minimal Lie group that is neither compact nor abelian.</description>
