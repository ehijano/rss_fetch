      <title>A New Spectral Library for Modeling the Surfaces of Hot, Rocky Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST's MIRI LRS provides the first opportunity to spectroscopically characterize the surface compositions of close-in terrestrial exoplanets. Models for the bare-rock spectra of these planets often utilize a spectral library from R. Hu et al., which is based on room temperature reflectance measurements of materials that represent archetypes of rocky planet surfaces. Here we present an expanded library that includes hemispherical reflectance measurements for a greater variety of compositions, varying textures (solid slab, coarsely crushed, and fine powder), as well as high temperature (500-800 K) emissivity measurements for select samples. We incorporate this new library into version 6.3 of the retrieval package PLATON and use it to show that surfaces with similar compositions can have widely varying albedos and surface temperatures. We additionally demonstrate that changing the texture of a material can significantly alter its albedo, making albedo a poor proxy for surface composition. We identify key spectral features -- the 5.6 \textmu{m} olivine feature, the transparency feature, the Si-O stretching feature, and the Christiansen feature -- that indicate silicate abundance and surface texture. We quantify the number of JWST observations needed to detect these features in the spectrum of the most favorable super-Earth target, LHS 3844 b, and revisit the interpretation of its Spitzer photometry. Lastly, we show that temperature-dependent changes in spectral features are likely undetectable at the precision of current exoplanet observations. Our results illustrate the importance of spectroscopically-resolved thermal emission measurements, as distinct from surface albedo constraints, for characterizing the surface compositions of hot, rocky exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Planet Masses, Radii, and Orbits from NASA's K2 Mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the masses, sizes, and orbital properties of 86 planets orbiting 55 stars observed by NASA's K2 Mission with follow-up Doppler measurements by the HIRES spectrometer at the W. M. Keck Observatory and the Automated Planet Finder at Lick Observatory. Eighty-one of the planets were discovered from their transits in the K2 photometry, while five were found based on subsequent Doppler measurements of transiting planet host stars. The sizes of the transiting planets range from Earth-size to larger than Jupiter (1-3 REarth is typical), while the orbital periods range from less than a day to a few months. For 32 of the planets, the Doppler signal was detected with significance greater than 5-sigma (51 were detected with &gt;3-sigma significance). An important characteristic of this catalog is the use of uniform analysis procedures to determine stellar and planetary properties. This includes the transit search and fitting procedures applied to the K2 photometry, the Doppler fitting techniques applied to the radial velocities, and the spectral modeling to determine bulk stellar parameters. Such a uniform treatment will make the catalog useful for statistical studies of the masses, densities, and system architectures of exoplanetary systems. This work also serves as a data release for all previously unpublished RVs and associated stellar activity indicators obtained by our team for these systems, along with derived stellar and planet parameters.</description>

      <title>Compact protoplanetary discs can be produced by dead zones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radially compact protoplanetary discs (&lt;=50 au) are ubiquitous in nearby star-forming regions. Multiple mechanisms have been invoked to interpret various compact discs. In this paper, we propose that fragmentation of fragile dust grains in moderate turbulence, as expected beyond the dead zone, provides an effective alternative mechanism to form compact discs which are consistent with current observations. We run 1-D dust transport and collision models with DustPy and generate synthetic observations, and find that discs formed by this mechanism have sizes determined by the extent of their dead zones. Accounting for dust porosity, and considering less fragile dust, do not change disc sizes significantly. The smooth dust morphology can be altered only when pressure bumps are present in the dead zone. However, when present at small radii (&lt;=10 au), pressure bumps cannot effectively trap dust. Dust in these bumps fragments and replenishes the inner discs, effectively hiding dust traps in the optically thick inner disc from observations. We note a striking resemblance in the radial intensity profile between our synthetic observations and some recent high-resolution observations of compact discs. We discuss how such observations can inform our understanding of the underlying disc physics.</description>

      <title>Context images for Venus Express radio occultation measurements: A search for a correlation between temperature structure and UV contrasts in the clouds of Venus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Venus exhibits strong and changing contrasts at ultraviolet wavelengths apparently related to the clouds and the dynamics in the cloud layer, but to date their origin continues to be unknown. We investigate the nature of the UV contrasts exhibited by Venus clouds by examining possible correlations between the thermal structure inferred from radio occultation data and UV brightness from imagery data, both observed with Venus Express. We analyse Venus Express images obtained from 11 hours before to a few hours after the time of radio occultation measurements of the same area. We account for the advection of clouds by zonal and meridional winds and apply a phase angle correction to compensate for the changing viewing geometry. We find a possible anti-correlation between UV-brightness and atmospheric temperature in the 65-70 km altitude range for low latitudes. Heating in this altitude and latitude region due to an increase in the UV-absorber has been predicted by radiative forcing studies. The predictions roughly match our observed temperature amplitude between UV-dark and UV-bright regions. We find no evidence for any correlation between UV-brightness and static stability in the atmosphere in the 50-80 km altitude region. This could be the first observational evidence for a direct link between UV-brightness and atmospheric temperature in the 65-70km altitude region in the clouds of Venus.</description>

      <title>Impact-induced Vaporization During Accretion of Planetary Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Giant impacts dominate the late stages of accretion of rocky planets. They contribute to the heating, melting, and sometimes vaporizing of the bodies involved in the impacts. Due to fractionation during melting and vaporization, planet-building impacts can significantly change the composition and geochemical signatures of rocky objects. Using first-principles molecular dynamics simulations, we analyze the shock behavior of complex realistic silicate systems, representative of both rocky bodies. We introduce a novel criterion for vapor formation that uses entropy calculations to determine the minimum impact velocity required to pass the threshold for vapor production. We derive impact velocity criteria for vapor formation (7.1 km per s for chondritic bodies) and show that this threshold is reached in 61 and 89 percent of impacts in dynamical simulations of the late stages of accretion with classical and annulus starting configuration (respectively) for analogs of Earth. These outcomes should be nuanced by factors such as the impact angle and the mass of the impacting bodies, which further influence the vaporization dynamics and the resultant material distribution. Our findings indicate that vaporization was common during accretion and likely played a crucial role in shaping the early environments and material properties of terrestrial planets.</description>

      <title>Clusters of tribocharged dust aggregates as pebbles in protoplanetary disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the tribocharging of colliding and bouncing submillimeter (submm) particles has been studied as a possible mechanism promoting the formation of large pebbles on centimeter (cm) to decimeter (dm) scales in protoplanetary disks. Here, we observe, for the first time, that it is not only monolithic, spherical particles, but also real dust aggregates, that become tribocharged and end up forming large clusters. For aggregates of $\sim 0.4$ mm consisting of $\rm \sim$ 1 $\rm \mu m$ sized dust, we determined net charge densities up to $10^{-7}$ C/$\rm m^2$ during our drop tower experiments. These charged aggregates form compact clusters up to 2 cm in size via collisions with other clusters and aggregates at collision velocities on the order of 1 cm/s. Size and speed are the only lower limits for growth, currently set by the limits of the experiment. However, these clusters already form under conditions that are well beyond the expected transition to bouncing for uncharged aggregates and clusters. Our findings further support the idea that collisional charging can leapfrog the traditional bouncing barrier and form larger clusters that then serve as large pebbles. These cm-sized clusters are more susceptible to further evolutionary steps via particle trapping, concentration, and planetesimal formation.</description>

      <title>ALMA reveals thermal and non-thermal desorption of methanol ice in the HD 100546 protoplanetary disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Methanol (CH$_3$OH) and formaldehyde (H$_2$CO) are chemically coupled organic molecules proposed to act as an intermediate step between simple molecules and more complex prebiotic compounds. Their abundance distributions across disks regulate the prebiotic potential of material at different disk radii. We present observations of multiple methanol and formaldehyde transitions toward the Herbig Ae disk HD 100546 obtained with ALMA, building upon the previous serendipitous detection of methanol in this source. We find that methanol has a higher rotational temperature ($T_\mathrm{rot}$) than formaldehyde towards both the centrally concentrated emission component in the inner disk ($0-110$ au) and a radially separate dust ring farther out in the disk ($180-260$ au). $T_\mathrm{rot}$ decreases for methanol and formaldehyde from the inner ($152^{+35}_{-27}$ K and $76^{+9}_{-8}$ K) to the outer disk ($52^{+8}_{-6}$ K and $31^{+2}_{-2}$ K), suggesting that we are tracing two different chemical environments. $T_\mathrm{rot}$ for both species in the inner disk is consistent with thermal desorption as the origin, while the outer disk reservoir is driven by non-thermal desorption. The CH$_3$OH/H$_2$CO column density ratio decreases from 14.6$^{+5.2}_{-4.6}$ in the inner disk to $1.3^{+0.3}_{-0.2}$ in the outer disk, consistent with modelling predictions. The CH$_3$OH/H$_2$CO column density ratio for the inner disk is consistent with the median value in the range of column density ratios compiled from Solar System comets which would have formed at a similar distance. This supports the notion that interstellar ice is inherited and preserved by protoplanetary disks around solar-mass and intermediate-mass stars as we are seeing 'fresh' ice sublimation, as well as providing more evidence for the presence of prebiotic precursor molecules in planet-forming regions.</description>

      <title>The GAPS Programme at TNG LXVII. Detection of water and preliminary characterisation of the atmospheres of the two hot Jupiters KELT-8 b and KELT-23 Ab</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Expanding the number of hot giant planets with atmospheric characterisation can improve our understanding of their atmospheres as well as their formation and evolution mechanisms. In this work, we use high-resolution spectroscopy in the near-infrared (NIR) to search for chemical signatures in the atmospheres of the two hot Jupiters KELT-8 b and KELT-23 Ab, and perform a first characterisation of their atmospheric properties. We measured the transmission spectrum of each target with the NIR high-resolution spectrograph GIANO-B at the TNG and searched for atmospheric signals by cross-correlating the data with synthetic transmission spectra. In order to characterise the chemical-physical properties of the two atmospheres, we ran two different atmospheric retrievals for each dataset: a retrieval assuming chemical equilibrium and a ``free-chemistry'' retrieval, in which the abundance of each molecule could vary freely. We detect $H_2O$ in the atmospheres of KELT-8 b and KELT-23 Ab with an S/N = 6.6 and S/N = 4.2, respectively. The two retrievals indicate a water-rich atmosphere for both targets. For KELT-8 b, we determine a water volume mixing ratio of log$_{10}$(VMR$_{\rm H_2O})=-2.07^{+0.53}_{-0.72}$, a metallicity [M/H] $=0.77^{+0.61}_{-0.89}$ dex, and a sub-solar C/O ratio (C/O $\leq0.30$, at $2\,\sigma$). For KELT-23 Ab, we find log$_{10}$(VMR$_{\rm H_2O})=-2.26^{+0.75}_{-1.24}$, [M/H] $=-0.42^{+1.56}_{-1.35}$ dex, and a C/O ratio $\leq0.78$ (at $2\,\sigma$). Comparing these chemical properties with those of the host stars, we suggest that, for both planets, the accretion of gaseous material occurred within the $H_2O$ snowline in a pebble-rich disk enriched in oxygen due to sublimation of water ice from the inward-drifting pebbles. In conclusion, we measure the atmospheric signals of KELT-8 b and KELT-23 Ab for the first time and place first constraints on their properties.</description>

      <title>Measurement of plutonium isotopes, 239Pu and 240Pu, in air-filter samples from Seville (2001-2002)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the last nuclear atmospheric test carried out by the People Republic of China in 1980 and since the Chernobyl accident in 1986, the plutonium hasn't been directly released into the atmosphere. However, nowadays, it is still present in the troposphere. This is due to plutonium-bearing soil particles physical resuspension processes. In this work, we study for the first time the temporal variation of plutonium isotopes, 239Pu and 240Pu, baseline concentrations on a monthly basis in surface air from Seville (Spain), and their correlation with some tracers of mineral dust, during 2001 and 2002. The Pu analyses were performed by low-energy Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS). The 239Pu plus 240Pu (239+240Pu) activity levels achieved maximums during the summer period, characterized by the absence of rains, and minimums during the rainy seasons, laying in the range 1-20 nBq per cubic meter. The 240Pu/239Pu two-year average atomic ratio was 0.18(0.03), in agreement with the fallout plutonium. A good correlation with Pu and Al and Ti levels is observed. They are crustal components usually used as tracers of African dust over European countries. The hypothesis of the influence of the Saharan dust intrusions is supported as well through the study of Total Ozone Mass Spectrometer (TOMS) daily images.</description>

      <title>Debris disks around M dwarfs: The Herschel DEBRIS survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Herschel open-time key program Disc Emission via a Bias-free Reconnaissance in the Infrared and Sub-millimeter (DEBRIS) is an unbiased survey of the nearest ~100 stars for each stellar type A-M observed with a uniform photometric sensitivity to search for cold debris disks around them. The analysis of the Photoconductor Array Camera and Spectrometer (PACS) photometric observations of the 94 DEBRIS M dwarfs of this program is presented in this paper, following upon two companion papers on the DEBRIS A-star and FGK-star subsamples. In the M-dwarf subsample, two debris disks have been detected, around the M3V dwarf GJ581 and the M4V dwarf FomalhautC (LP876-10). This result gives a disk detection rate of 2.1^{+2.7}_{-0.7}% at the 68% confidence level, significantly less than measured for earlier stellar types in the DEBRIS program. However, we show that the survey of the DEBRIS M-dwarf subsample is about ten times shallower than the surveys of the DEBRIS FGK subsamples when studied in the physical parameter space of the disk's fractional dust luminosity versus blackbody radius. Furthermore, had the DEBRIS K-star subsample been observed at the same shallower depth in this parameter space, its measured disk detection rate would have been statistically consistent with the one found for the M-dwarf subsample. Hence, the incidence of debris disks does not appear to drop from the K subsample to the M subsample of the DEBRIS program, when considering disks in the same region of physical parameter space. An alternative explanation is that the only two bright disks discovered in the M-dwarf subsample would not, in fact, be statistically representative of the whole population.</description>

      <title>A possible trail of dust from a young, highly-extincted brown dwarf in the outskirts of the Trapezium Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04447v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the JWST discovery of a highly-extincted ($A_V\sim52$) candidate brown dwarf ($\sim0.018$M$_\odot$) in the outskirts of the Trapezium Cluster that appears to be coincident with the end of a $\sim 1700\,$au long, remarkably uniformly wide, dark trail that broadens only slightly at the end opposite the point source. We examine whether a dusty trail associated with a highly-extincted brown dwarf could plausibly be detected with JWST and explore possible origins. We show that a dusty trail associated with the brown dwarf could be observable if dust within it is larger than that in the ambient molecular cloud. For example, if the ambient cloud has a standard $\sim0.25$$\mu$m maximum grain size and the trail contains micron-sized grains, then the trail will have a scattering opacity over an order of magnitude larger compared to the surroundings in NIRCam short-wavelength filters. We use a simple model to show that a change in maximum grain size can reproduce the high $A_V$ and the multi-filter NIRCam contrast seen between the trail and its surroundings. We propose and explore two possible mechanisms that could be responsible for the trail: i) a weak FUV radiation-driven wind from the circum-brown dwarf disc due to the O stars in the region and ii) a Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion wake. The former would be the most distant known case of the Trapezium stars' radiation driving winds from a disc, and the latter would be the first known example of ``late'' infall from the interstellar medium onto a low mass object in a high-mass star-forming region.</description>

      <title>Emission from multiple molecular isotopologues in a high-inclination protoplanetary disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a MIRI-MRS spectrum of the high-inclination protoplanetary disk around the solar-mass (K0) star MY Lup, obtained as part of the JWST Disk Infrared Spectral Chemistry Survey (JDISCS). The spectrum shows an unusually weak water emission spectrum for a disk around a star of its spectral type, but strong emission from CO$_2$, HCN, and isotopologues of both molecules. This includes the first ever detection of C$^{18}$O$^{16}$O and H$^{13}$CN in an inner disk, as well as tentative detections of C$^{17}$O$^{16}$O and HC$^{15}$N. Slab modeling provides molecular temperatures, column densities and emitting areas of the detected molecules. The emitting molecular gas is cold compared to that of other observed protoplanetary disk spectra. We estimate the isotopologue ratios of CO$_2$ and HCN, albeit with significant uncertainty. We suggest that the unusual spectrum of MY Lup arises from a combination of inner disk clearing, which removes emission from warm water, and its nearly edge-on inclination, which enhances line-of-sight column densities, although unusual chemistry may also be required. MY Lup's spectrum highlights the potential to detect and measure trace isotopologues to study isotopic fractionation in protoplanetary disks; observations at higher spectral resolving power is needed to constrain the isotopologue ratios to greater precision.</description>

      <title>General solution to Euler-Poisson equations of a free symmetric body by direct summation of power series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10326v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Euler-Poisson equations describe the temporal evolution of a rigid body's orientation through the rotation matrix and angular velocity components, governed by first-order differential equations. According to the Cauchy-Kovalevskaya theorem, these equations can be solved by expressing their solutions as power series in the evolution parameter. In this work, we derive the sum of these series for the case of a free symmetric rigid body. By using the integrals of motion and directly summing the terms of these series, we obtain the general solution to the Euler-Poisson equations for a free symmetric body in terms of elementary functions. This method circumvents the need for standard parametrizations like Euler angles, allowing for a direct, closed-form solution. The results are consistent with previous studies, offering a new perspective on solving the Euler-Poisson equations.</description>
