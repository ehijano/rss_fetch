      <title>Subdiffusive bound on Fredkin and Motzkin dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify a pseudolocal conserved charge in the Fredkin and Motzkin quantum spin chains and explore its consequences for the hydrodynamics of systems with Fredkin- or Motzkin-type kinetic constraints. We use this quantity to formulate an exact upper bound ${\cal O}(L^{-5/2})$ on the gap of the Fredkin and Motzkin spin chains. Our results establish that transport in kinetically constrained dynamical systems with Fredkin or Motzkin constraints is subdiffusive, with dynamical exponent $z \geq 5/2$.</description>

      <title>Discrete generative diffusion models without stochastic differential equations: a tensor network approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) are a class of generative machine learning methods that sample a target distribution by transforming samples of a trivial (often Gaussian) distribution using a learned stochastic differential equation. In standard DMs, this is done by learning a ``score function'' that reverses the effect of adding diffusive noise to the distribution of interest. Here we consider the generalisation of DMs to lattice systems with discrete degrees of freedom, and where noise is added via Markov chain jump dynamics. We show how to use tensor networks (TNs) to efficiently define and sample such ``discrete diffusion models'' (DDMs) without explicitly having to solve a stochastic differential equation. We show the following: (i) by parametrising the data and evolution operators as TNs, the denoising dynamics can be represented exactly; (ii) the auto-regressive nature of TNs allows to generate samples efficiently and without bias; (iii) for sampling Boltzmann-like distributions, TNs allow to construct an efficient learning scheme that integrates well with Monte Carlo. We illustrate this approach to study the equilibrium of two models with non-trivial thermodynamics, the $d=1$ constrained Fredkin chain and the $d=2$ Ising model.</description>

      <title>Emergent family of Tsallis entropies from the $q$-deformed combinatorics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the derivation of a formula for the $q$-generalised multinomial coefficient rooted in the $q$-deformed algebra, a foundational framework in the study of nonextensive statistics. Previous approximate expressions in the literature diverge as $q$ approaches 2 (or 0, depending on convention). In contrast, our derived formula provides an exact, smooth function for all real values of $q$, expressed as an infinite series expansion involving Tsallis entropies with sequential entropic indices, coupled with Bernoulli numbers. This formulation is achieved through the analytic continuation of the Riemann zeta function, stemming from the $q$-deformed factorials. Thus, our formula offers a distinctive characterisation of Tsallis entropy within the $q$-deformed combinatorics. Furthermore, we discuss extending our results to encompass more general, affinity-sensitive cases based on the previously established framework of affinity-based extended entropy.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Space of Chemical Reaction Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Living systems are usually maintained out of equilibrium and exhibit complex dynamical behaviors. The external energy supply often comes from chemical fluxes that can keep some species concentrations constant. Furthermore, the properties of the underlying chemical reaction networks (CRNs) are also instrumental in establishing robust biological functioning. Hence, capturing the emergent complexity of living systems and the role of their non-equilibrium nature is fundamental to uncover constraints and properties of the CRNs underpinning their functions. In particular, while kinetics plays a key role in shaping detailed dynamical phenomena, the range of operations of any CRN must be fundamentally constrained by thermodynamics, as they necessarily operate with a given energy budget. Here, we derive universal thermodynamic upper and lower bounds for the accessible space of species concentrations in a generic CRN. The resulting region determines the "thermodynamic space" of the CRN, a concept we introduce in this work. Moreover, we obtain similar bounds also for the affinities, shedding light on how global thermodynamic properties can limit local non-equilibrium quantities. We illustrate our results in two paradigmatic examples, the Schl\"ogl model for bistability and a minimal self-assembly process, demonstrating how the onset of complex behaviors is intimately tangled with the presence of non-equilibrium driving. In summary, our work unveils the exact form of the accessible space in which a CRN must work as a function of its energy budget, shedding light on the non-equilibrium origin of a variety of phenomena, from amplification to pattern formation. Ultimately, by providing a general tool for analyzing CRNs, the presented framework constitutes a stepping stone to deepen our ability to predict complex out-of-equilibrium behaviors and design artificial chemical reaction systems.</description>

      <title>Helicity modulus in the bilayer XY model by worm algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The behaviour of the helicity modulus has been frequently employed to investigate the onset of the topological order characterizing the low-temperature phase of the two-dimensional XY-model. We here present how the analysis based on the use of this key quantity can be applied to the study of the properties of coupled layers. To this aim, we first discuss how to extend the popular worm algorithm to a layered sample, and in particular to the evaluation of the longitudinal helicity, that we introduce taking care of the fact that the virtual twist representing the elastic deformation one applies to properly define the helicity modulus can act on a single layer or on all of them. We then apply the method to investigate the bilayer XY-model, showing how the helicity modulus can be used to determine the phase diagram of the model as a function of temperature and inter-layer coupling strength</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several closely related ab initio thermal mean-field theories for fermions, both well-established and new ones, are compared with one another at the formalism level and numerically. The theories considered are Fermi-Dirac theory, thermal Hartree-Fock (HF) theory, two modifications of the thermal single-determinant approximation of Kaplan and Argyres, and first-order thermal perturbation theory based on zero-temperature or thermal HF reference. The thermal full configuration interaction is used as the benchmark.</description>

      <title>Visitation Dynamics of $d$-Dimensional Fractional Brownian Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fractional Brownian motion (fBm) is a paradigmatic strongly non-Markovian process with broad applications in various fields. Despite their importance, the properties of the territory covered by a $d$-dimensional fBm have remained elusive so far. Here, we study the visitation dynamics of the fBm by considering the time $\tau_n$ required to visit a site, defined as a unit cell of a $d$-dimensional lattice, when $n$ sites have been visited. Relying on scaling arguments, we determine all temporal regimes of the probability distribution function of $\tau_n$. These results are confirmed by extensive numerical simulations that employ large-deviation Monte Carlo algorithms. Besides these theoretical aspects, our results account for the tracking data of telomeres in the nucleus of mammalian cells, microspheres in an agorose gel, and vacuoles in the amoeba, which are experimental realizations of fBm.</description>

      <title>Crossover from Anomalous to Normal Diffusion: Ising Model with Stochastic Resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of the two-dimensional Ising model with stochastic resetting, utilizing a constant resetting rate procedure with zero-strength initial magnetization. Our results reveal the presence of a characteristic rate $r_c \sim L^{-z}$, where $L$ represents the system size and $z$ denotes the dynamical exponent. Below $r_c$, both the equilibrium and dynamical properties remain unchanged. At the same time, for $r &gt; r_c$, the resetting process induces a transition in the probability distribution of the magnetization from a double-peak distribution to a three-peak distribution, ultimately culminating in a single-peak exponential decay. Besides, we also find that at the critical points, as $r$ increases, the diffusion of the magnetization changes from anomalous to normal, and the correlation time shifts from being dependent on $L$ to being $r$-dependent only.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Onsager's regression hypothesis connects the temporal relaxation of close-to-equilibrium systems with their dynamical correlation functions at thermal equilibrium. While the hypothesis is provably correct in classical systems, it is known to fail in the quantum regime. Here, we derive a suitably adjusted quantum version of Onsager's original hypothesis. Rigorous analytical results are complemented by a variety of numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Quantum and Classical Dynamics with Random Permutation Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding thermalisation in quantum many-body systems is among the most enduring problems in modern physics. A particularly interesting question concerns the role played by quantum mechanics in this process, i.e. whether thermalisation in quantum many-body systems is fundamentally different from that in classical many-body systems and, if so, which of its features are genuinely quantum. Here we study this question in minimally structured many-body systems which are only constrained to have local interactions, i.e. local random circuits. We introduce a class of random permutation circuits (RPCs), where the gates locally permute basis states modelling generic microscopic classical dynamics, and compare them to random unitary circuits (RUCs), a standard toy model for generic quantum dynamics. We show that, like RUCs, RPCs permit the analytical computation of several key quantities such as out-of-time order correlators (OTOCs), or entanglement entropies. RPCs can be interpreted both as quantum or classical dynamics, which we use to find similarities and differences between the two. Performing the average over all random circuits, we discover a series of exact relations, connecting quantities in RUC and (quantum) RPCs. In the classical setting, we obtain similar exact results relating (quantum) purity to (classical) growth of mutual information and (quantum) OTOCs to (classical) decorrelators. Our results indicate that despite of the fundamental differences between quantum and classical systems, their dynamics exhibits qualitatively similar behaviours.</description>

      <title>Measurement-induced entanglement transition in chaotic quantum Ising chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the robustness against various perturbations of measurement-induced phase transition in monitored quantum Ising models in the no-click limit, where the dynamics is described by a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. We study perturbations that break the integrability and/or the symmetry of the model, as well as modifications in the measurement protocol, characterizing the resulting chaos and lack of integrability through the Dissipative Spectral Form Factor (DSFF). We show that while the measurement-induced phase transition and its properties appear to be broadly insensitive to lack of integrability and breaking of the $\mathbb{Z_2}$ symmetry, a modification of the measurement basis from the transverse to the longitudinal direction makes the phase transition disappear altogether.</description>

      <title>Quantum-inverse scattering for the 20-vertex model up to Dynkin automorphism: crossing probabilities, 3D Poisson structure, triangular height functions, weak integrability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We initiate a novel application of the quantum-inverse scattering method for the 20-vertex model, building upon seminal work from Faddeev and Takhtajan on the study of Hamiltonian systems, with applications to crossing probabilities, 3D Poisson structure, triangular height functions, and integrability. In comparison to a previous work of the author in late $2023$ which characterized integrability of a Hamiltonian flow for the 6-vertex model from integrability of inhomogeneous limit shapes, formalized in a work of Keating, Reshetikhin and Sridhar, notions similar to those of integrability can be realized for the 20-vertex model by studying new classes of higher-dimensional L-operators. In comparison to two-dimensional L-operators expressed in terms of Pauli basis elements, three-dimensional L-operators provided by Boos and colleagues have algebraic, combinatorial, and geometric, qualities, all of which impact leading order approximations of correlations, products of L-operators, the transfer matrix, and the quantum monodromy matrix in finite volume. In comparison to the inhomogeneous 6-vertex model, the 20-vertex model does not enjoy as strong of an integrability property through the existence of suitable action-angle variables, which is of interest to further explore, possibly from information on limit shapes given solutions to the three-dimensional Euler-Lagrange equations.</description>

      <title>Chaos and integrability in triangular billiards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterize quantum dynamics in triangular billiards in terms of five properties: (1) the level spacing ratio (LSR), (2) spectral complexity (SC), (3) Lanczos coefficient variance, (4) energy eigenstate localisation in the Krylov basis, and (5) dynamical growth of spread complexity. The billiards we study are classified as integrable, pseudointegrable or non-integrable, depending on their internal angles which determine properties of classical trajectories and associated quantum spectral statistics. A consistent picture emerges when transitioning from integrable to non-integrable triangles: (1) LSRs increase; (2) spectral complexity growth slows down; (3) Lanczos coefficient variances decrease; (4) energy eigenstates delocalize in the Krylov basis; and (5) spread complexity increases, displaying a peak prior to a plateau instead of recurrences. Pseudo-integrable triangles deviate by a small amount in these charactertistics from non-integrable ones, which in turn approximate models from the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE). Isosceles pseudointegrable and non-integrable triangles have independent sectors that are symmetric and antisymmetric under a reflection symmetry. These sectors separately reproduce characteristics of the GOE, even though the combined system approximates characteristics expected from integrable theories with Poisson distributed spectra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a natural, parameter-free, discrete-variable formulation of Feynman path integrals. We show that for discrete-variable quantum systems, Feynman path integrals take the form of walks on the graph whose weighted adjacency matrix is the Hamiltonian. By working out expressions for the partition function and transition amplitudes of discretized versions of continuous-variable quantum systems, and then taking the continuum limit, we explicitly recover Feynman's continuous-variable path integrals. We also discuss the implications of our result.</description>

      <title>Observation of relaxation stages in a non-equilibrium closed quantum system: decaying turbulence in a trapped superfluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of non-equilibrium closed quantum systems and their route to thermalization are of fundamental interest to several fields, from cosmology to particle physics. However, a comprehensive description of non-equilibrium phenomena still presents a significant challenge. In this work, we report the observation of distinct stages during the relaxation of the decaying turbulence in trapped Bose-Einstein condensates. Our findings show a direct particle cascade from low to high momenta, a consequence of the energy injection in the system, exhibiting a characteristic universal scaling. This stage is followed by an inverse particle cascade responsible for repopulating the previously depleted condensate. Both cascades can be explained through self-similar solutions provided by wave turbulence theory. These findings provide important insights into the relaxation stages of out-of-equilibrium quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Quantum Phase Transition and Thermal Equilibrium in the Lattice Thirring Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using tensor network methods, we simulate the real-time evolution of the lattice Thirring model quenched out of equilibrium in both the critical and massive phases, and study the appearance of dynamical quantum phase transitions, as non-analyticities in the Loschmidt rate. Whereas the presence of a dynamical quantum phase transition in the model does not correspond to quenches across the critical line of the equilibrium phase diagram at zero temperature, we identify a threshold in the energy density of the initial state, necessary for a dynamical quantum phase transition to be present. Moreover, in the case of the gapped quench Hamiltonian, we unveil a connection of this threshold to a transition between different regions in the finite temperature phase diagram.</description>

      <title>Accurate Numerical Simulations of Open Quantum Systems Using Spectral Tensor Trains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decoherence between qubits is a major bottleneck in quantum computations. Decoherence results from intrinsic quantum and thermal fluctuations as well as noise in the external fields that perform the measurement and preparation processes. With prescribed colored noise spectra for intrinsic and extrinsic noise, we present a numerical method, Quantum Accelerated Stochastic Propagator Evaluation (Q-ASPEN), to solve the time-dependent noise-averaged reduced density matrix in the presence of intrinsic and extrinsic noise. Q-ASPEN is arbitrarily accurate and can be applied to provide estimates for the resources needed to error-correct quantum computations. We employ spectral tensor trains, which combine the advantages of tensor networks and pseudospectral methods, as a variational ansatz to the quantum relaxation problem and optimize the ansatz using methods typically used to train neural networks. The spectral tensor trains in Q-ASPEN make accurate calculations with tens of quantum levels feasible. We present benchmarks for Q-ASPEN on the spin-boson model in the presence of intrinsic noise and on a quantum chain of up to 32 sites in the presence of extrinsic noise. In our benchmark, the memory cost of Q-ASPEN scales linearly with the system size once the number of states is larger than the number of basis functions.</description>

      <title>Using recurrent neural networks to predict aspects of 3-D structure of folded copolymer sequences</title>

Abstract: The neural network techniques are developed for artificial sequences based on approximate models of proteins. We only encode the hydrophobicity of the amino acid side chains without attempting to model the secondary structure. We use our approach to obtain a large set of sequences with known 3-D structures for training the neural network. By employing recurrent neural networks we describe a way to augment a neural network to deal with sequences of realistic length and long-distant interactions between the sequence regions.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-driven self-assembly of emerin nanodomains at the nuclear envelope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emerin, a nuclear membrane protein with important biological roles in mechanotransduction and nuclear shape adaptation, self-assembles into nanometer-size domains at the inner nuclear membrane. The size and emerin occupancy of these nanodomains change with applied mechanical stress as well as under emerin mutations associated with Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD). Through a combination of theory and experiment we show here that a simple reaction-diffusion model explains the self-assembly of emerin nanodomains. Our model yields quantitative agreement with experimental observations on the size and occupancy of emerin nanodomains for wild-type emerin and EDMD-associated mutations of emerin, with and without applied forces, and allows successful prediction of emerin diffusion coefficients from observations on the overall properties of emerin nanodomains. Our results provide a physical understanding of EDMD-associated defects in emerin organization in terms of changes in key reaction and diffusion properties of emerin and its nuclear binding partners.</description>

      <title>Approximate inverse measurement channel for shallow shadows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical shadows are a versatile tool to probe many-body quantum systems, consisting of a combination of randomised measurements and classical post-processing computations. In a recently introduced version of the protocol, the randomization step is performed via unitary circuits of variable depth $t$, defining the so-called shallow shadows. For sufficiently large $t$, this approach allows one to get around the use of non-local unitaries to probe global properties such as the fidelity with respect to a target state or the purity. Still, shallow shadows involve the inversion of a many-body map, the measurement channel, which requires non-trivial computations in the post-processing step, thus limiting its applicability when the number of qubits $N$ is large. In this work, we put forward a simple approximate post-processing scheme where the infinite-depth inverse channel is applied to the finite-depth classical shadows and study its performance for fidelity and purity estimation. The scheme allows for different circuit connectivity, as we illustrate for geometrically local circuits in one and two spatial dimensions and geometrically non-local circuits made of two-qubit gates. For the fidelity, we find that the resulting estimator coincides with a known linear cross-entropy, achieving an arbitrary small approximation error $\delta$ at depth $t=O(\log (N/\delta))$ (independent of the circuit connectivity). For the purity, we show that the estimator becomes accurate at a depth $O(N)$. In addition, at those depths, the variances of both the fidelity and purity estimators display the same scaling with $N$ as in the case of global random unitaries. We establish these bounds by analytic arguments and extensive numerical computations in several cases of interest. Our work extends the applicability of shallow shadows to large system sizes and general circuit connectivity.</description>

      <title>Quantum Chaos, Randomness and Universal Scaling of Entanglement in Various Krylov Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using a random matrix approach, combined with the ergodicity hypothesis, we derive an analytical expression for the time-averaged quantum Fisher information (QFI) that applies to all quantum chaotic systems governed by Dyson's ensembles. Our approach integrates concepts of randomness, multipartite entanglement and quantum chaos. Furthermore, the QFI proves to be highly dependent on the dimension of the Krylov space confining the chaotic dynamics: it ranges from $N^2/3$ for $N$ qubits in the permutation-symmetric subspace (e.g. for chaotic kicked top models with long-range interactions), to $N$ when the dynamics extend over the full Hilbert space with or without bit reversal symmetry or parity symmetry (e.g. in chaotic models with short-range Ising-like interactions). In the former case, the QFI reveals multipartite entanglement among $N/3$ qubits. Interestingly this result can be related to isotropic substructures in the Wigner distribution of chaotic states and demonstrates the efficacy of quantum chaos for Heisenberg-scaling quantum metrology. Finally, our general expression for the QFI agrees with that obtained for random states and, differently from out-of-time-order-correlators, it can also distinguish chaotic from integrable unstable spin dynamics.</description>

      <title>Anti-hyperuniform diluted vortex matter induced by correlated disorder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disordered hyperuniform materials are very promising for applications but the successful route for synthesizing them requires to understand the interactions induced by the host media that can switch off this hidden order. With this aim we study the model system of vortices in the $\beta$-Bi$_2$Pd superconductor where correlated defects seem to play a determinant role for the nucleation of a gel vortex phase at low densities. We directly image vortices in extended fields-of-view and show that the disordered vortex structure in this material is anti-hyperuniform, contrasting with the case of vortex structures nucleated in samples with point-like disorder. Based on numerical simulations, we show that this anti-hyperuniform structure arises both, from the interaction of a diluted vortex structure with a fourfold-symmetric correlated disorder quite likely generated when cleaving the samples and from the out of equilibrium nature of the quenched configuration.</description>

      <title>Rejection-free quantum Monte Carlo in continuous time from transition path sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.08935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo refers to a class of algorithms designed to sample the thermal distribution of a quantum Hamiltonian through exact expansions of the Boltzmann exponential in terms of stochastic trajectories which are periodic in imaginary time. Here, we show that for (sign-problem-free) quantum many-body systems with discrete degrees of freedom -- such as spins on a lattice -- this sampling can be done in a rejection-free manner using transition path sampling (TPS). The key idea is to converge the trajectory ensemble through updates where one individual degree of freedom is modified across all time while the remaining unaltered ones provide a time-dependent background. The ensuing single-body dynamics provides a way to generate trajectory updates exactly, allowing one to obtain the target ensemble efficiently via rejection-free TPS. We demonstrate our method on the transverse field Ising model in one and two dimensions, and on the quantum triangular plaquette (or Newman-Moore) model. We show that despite large autocorrelation times, our method is able to efficiently recover the respective quantum phase transition of each model. We also discuss the connection to rare event sampling in continuous-time Markov dynamics.</description>

      <title>Effective Single Particle Theory for Active Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02247v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a collection of active agents and present an effective single-particle theory to describe the dynamical behaviour of the system in the steady state. Unlike their equilibrium counterparts, active particles display phase separation at much lower packing densities, marked by continuous formation and dissolution of clusters. To model such behavior, we replace the effect of many-particle interactions by a time-dependent local density. Further we propose a unique auto-correlation of the local density with a characteristic correlation time. The correlation time monotonically increases with packing density and unveils a transition at a critical density. In experimental setups, this correlation time is easily quantifiable by monitoring changes in density around a tagged particle. By utilizing this local density and its correlation, we calculate the effective diffusivity of the particles. Finally, we compare the results of the effective single particle theory with numerical simulations and find good agreement between them across a range of packing densities.</description>

      <title>Numerical Accuracy of the Derivative-Expansion-Based Functional Renormalization Group</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18707v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the precision of the numerical implementation of the functional renormalization group based on extracting the eigenvalues from the linearized RG transformation. For this purpose, we implement the LPA and $O(\partial^2)$ orders of the derivative expansion for the three-dimensional $O(N)$ models with $N~\in~\{1,2,3\}$. We identify several categories of numerical error and devise simple tests to track their magnitude as functions of numerical parameters. Our numerical schemes converge properly and are characterized by errors of several orders of magnitude smaller than the error bars of the derivative expansion for these models. We highlight situations in which our methods cease to converge, most often due to rounding errors. In particular, we observe an impaired convergence of the discretization scheme when the $\tilde \rho$ grid is cut off at the value $\tilde \rho_{\text{Max}}$ smaller than $3.5$ times the local potential minimum. The program performing the numerical calculations for this study is shared as an open-source library accessible for review and reuse.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Processes: entropy, Gibbs states and the continuous time Ruelle operator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.01993v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a Riemmaniann compact manifold $M$, the associated Laplacian $\Delta$ and the corresponding Brownian motion $X_t$, $t\geq 0.$ Given a Lipschitz function $V:M\to\mathbb R$ we consider the operator $\frac{1}{2}\Delta+V$, which acts on differentiable functions $f: M\to\mathbb R$ via the operator
  $$\frac{1}{2} \Delta f(x)+\,V(x)f(x) ,$$ for all $x\in M$.
  Denote by $P_t^V$, $t \geq 0,$ the semigroup acting on functions $f: M\to\mathbb R$ given by $$P_{t}^V (f)(x)\,:=\, \mathbb E_{x} \big[e^{\int_0^{t} V(X_r)\,dr} f(X_t)\big].\,$$
  We will show that this semigroup is a continuous-time version of the discrete-time Ruelle operator.
  Consider the positive differentiable eigenfunction $F: M \to \mathbb{R}$ associated to the main eigenvalue $\lambda$ for the semigroup $P_t^V$, $t \geq 0$. From the function $F$, in a procedure similar to the one used in the case of discrete-time Thermodynamic Formalism, we can associate via a coboundary procedure a certain stationary Markov semigroup. The probability on the Skhorohod space obtained from this new stationary Markov semigroup can be seen as a stationary Gibbs state associated with the potential $V$. We define entropy, pressure, the continuous-time Ruelle operator and we present a variational principle of pressure for such a setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07043v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well established that the presence of single impurity can have a substantial impact on the transport properties of quantum many-body systems at low temperature. In this work, we investigate a close analog of this problem from the perspective of quantum information dynamics. We construct Brownian circuits and Clifford circuits consisting of a free fermion hopping term and a sole interaction. In both circuits, our findings reveal the emergence of operator scrambling. Notably, the growth of the operator can be mapped to the symmetric exclusion process in the presence of a source term localized at a single point. We demonstrate that in the one-dimensional system, both the operator and entanglement exhibit diffusive scaling. Conversely, in scenarios characterized by all-to-all hopping, the operator's size undergoes exponential growth, while the entanglement exhibits a linear increase over time.</description>

      <title>Path integral for the quartic oscillator: An accurate analytic formula for the partition function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09859v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work an approximate analytic expression for the quantum partition function of the quartic oscillator described by the potential $V(x) = \frac{1}{2} \omega^2 x^2 + g x^4$ is presented. Using a path integral formalism, the exact partition function is approximated by the partition function of a harmonic oscillator with an effective frequency depending both on the temperature and coupling constant $g$. By invoking a Principle of Minimal Sensitivity (PMS) of the path integral to the effective frequency, we derive a mathematically well-defined analytic formula for the partition function. Quite remarkably, the formula reproduces qualitatively and quantitatively the key features of the exact partition function. The free energy is accurate to a few percent over the entire range of temperatures and coupling strengths $g$. Both the harmonic ($g\rightarrow 0$) and classical (high-temperature) limits are exactly recovered. The divergence of the power series of the ground-state energy at weak coupling, characterized by a factorial growth of the perturbational energies, is reproduced as well as the functional form of the strong-coupling expansion along with accurate coefficients. Explicit accurate expressions for the ground- and first-excited state energies, $E_0(g)$ and $E_1(g)$ are also presented.</description>

      <title>Model for bubble nucleation efficiency of low-energy nuclear recoils in bubble chambers for dark matter detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bubble chambers are promising technologies for detecting low-energy nuclear recoils from the elastic scattering of dark matter particle candidates. Bubble nucleation occurs when the energy deposition exceeds a specific threshold defined traditionally by the "heat-spike" Seitz threshold. In this paper, we report on a physical model that can account for observed discrepancies between the current Seitz model and the measured nucleation efficiency of low-energy nuclear recoils, which is necessary for interpreting dark matter signals. In our work, we combine molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations together with the Lindhard model to predict bubble nucleation efficiency and energy thresholds for C$_3$F$_8$, CF$_3$I, and xenon with enhanced accuracy over the Seitz model when compared to existing experimental data. We use our model to determine the effect on cross-section limits for spin-dependent and spin-independent interactions and compare it to the current PICO dark matter experiment. Our technique can also be applied to estimate the efficiency of future target fluids where no experimental data are available. As an example, we predict the nucleation efficiency, the energy threshold and the cross-section limits in the spin-independent channel for the Scintillating Bubble Chamber experiment filled with superheated liquid argon.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic correlation functions in 2D critical percolation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18576v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is believed that the large-scale geometric properties of two-dimensional critical percolation are described by a logarithmic conformal field theory, but it has been challenging to exhibit concrete examples of logarithmic singularities and to find an explanation and a physical interpretation, in terms of lattice observables, for their appearance. We show that certain percolation correlation functions receive independent contributions from a large number of similar connectivity events happening at different scales. Combined with scale invariance, this leads to logarithmic divergences. We study several logarithmic correlation functions for critical percolation in the bulk and in the presence of a boundary, including the four-point function of the density (spin) field. Our analysis confirms previous findings, provides new explicit calculations and explains, in terms of lattice observables, the physical mechanism that leads to the logarithmic singularities we discover. Although we adopt conformal field theory (CFT) terminology to present our results, the core of our analysis relies on probabilistic arguments and recent rigorous results on the scaling limit of critical percolation and does not assume a priori the existence of a percolation CFT. As a consequence, our results provide strong support for the validity of a CFT description of critical percolation and a step in the direction of a mathematically rigorous formulation of a logarithmic CFT of two-dimensional critical percolation.</description>

Abstract: The quantum Langevin equation as obtained from the independent-oscillator model describes a strong-coupling situation, devoid of the Born-Markov approximation that is employed in the context of the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad equation. The question we address is what happens when we implement such 'Born-Markov'-like approximations at the level of the quantum Langevin equation for a harmonic oscillator which carries a noise term satisfying a fluctuation-dissipation theorem. In this backdrop, we also comment on the rotating-wave approximation.</description>

      <title>A replica analysis of under-bagging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09779</link>

Abstract: Under-bagging (UB), which combines under-sampling and bagging, is a popular ensemble learning method for training classifiers on an imbalanced data. Using bagging to reduce the increased variance caused by the reduction in sample size due to under-sampling is a natural approach. However, it has recently been pointed out that in generalized linear models, naive bagging, which does not consider the class imbalance structure, and ridge regularization can produce the same results. Therefore, it is not obvious whether it is better to use UB, which requires an increased computational cost proportional to the number of under-sampled data sets, when training linear models. Given such a situation, in this study, we heuristically derive a sharp asymptotics of UB and use it to compare with several other popular methods for learning from imbalanced data, in the scenario where a linear classifier is trained from a two-component mixture data. The methods compared include the under-sampling (US) method, which trains a model using a single realization of the under-sampled data, and the simple weighting (SW) method, which trains a model with a weighted loss on the entire data. It is shown that the performance of UB is improved by increasing the size of the majority class while keeping the size of the minority fixed, even though the class imbalance can be large, especially when the size of the minority class is small. This is in contrast to US, whose performance is almost independent of the majority class size. In this sense, bagging and simple regularization differ as methods to reduce the variance increased by under-sampling. On the other hand, the performance of SW with the optimal weighting coefficients is almost equal to UB, indicating that the combination of reweighting and regularization may be similar to UB.</description>

      <title>Non-stabilizerness versus entanglement in matrix product states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18768v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the relationship between entanglement and non-stabilizerness (also known as magic) in matrix product states (MPSs). We study the relation between magic and the bond dimension used to approximate the ground state of a many-body system in two different contexts: full state of magic and mutual magic (the non-stabilizer analogue of mutual information, thus free of boundary effects) of spin-1 anisotropic Heisenberg chains. Our results indicate that obtaining converged results for non-stabilizerness is typically considerably easier than entanglement. For full state magic at critical points and at sufficiently large volumes, we observe convergence with $1/\chi^2$, with $\chi$ being the MPS bond dimension. At small volumes, magic saturation is so quick that, within error bars, we cannot appreciate any finite-$\chi$ correction. Mutual magic also shows a fast convergence with bond dimension, whose specific functional form is however hindered by sampling errors. As a by-product of our study, we show how Pauli-Markov chains (originally formulated to evaluate magic) resets the state of the art in terms of computing mutual information for MPS. We illustrate this last fact by verifying the logarithmic increase of mutual information between connected partitions at critical points. By comparing mutual information and mutual magic, we observe that, for connected partitions, the latter is typically scaling much slower - if at all - with the partition size, while for disconnected partitions, both are constant in size.</description>

      <title>Black box work extraction and composite hypothesis testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03400v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Work extraction is one of the most central processes in quantum thermodynamics. However, the prior analysis of optimal extractable work has been restricted to a limited operational scenario where complete information about the initial state is given. Here, we introduce a general framework of black box work extraction, which addresses the inaccessibility of information on the initial state. We show that the optimal extractable work in the black box setting is completely characterized by the performance of a composite hypothesis testing task, a fundamental problem in information theory.We employ this general relation to reduce the asymptotic black box work extraction to the quantum Stein's lemma in composite hypothesis testing, allowing us to provide their exact characterization in terms of the Helmholtz free energy. We also show a new quantum Stein's lemma motivated in this physical setting, where a composite hypothesis contains a certain correlation. Our work exhibits the importance of information about the initial state and gives a new interpretation of the quantities in the composite quantum hypothesis testing, encouraging the interplay between the physical settings and the information theory.</description>

      <title>Non-Adiabatic Quantum Optimization for Crossing Quantum Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09596v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the optimal driving of the ground state of a many-body quantum system across a quantum phase transition in finite time. In this context, excitations caused by the breakdown of adiabaticity can be minimized by adjusting the schedule of the control parameter that drives the transition. Drawing inspiration from the Kibble-Zurek mechanism, we characterize the timescale of onset of adiabaticity for several optimal control procedures. Our analysis reveals that schedules relying on local adiabaticity, such as Roland-Cerf's local adiabatic driving and the quantum adiabatic brachistochrone, fail to provide a significant speedup over the adiabatic evolution in the transverse-field Ising and long-range Kitaev models. As an alternative, we introduce a novel framework, Non-Adiabatic Quantum Optimization (NAQO), that, by exploiting the Landau-Zener formula and taking into account the role of higher-excited states, outperforms schedules obtained via both local adiabaticity and state-of-the-art numerical optimization. NAQO is not restricted to exactly solvable models, and we further confirm its superior performance in a disordered non-integrable model.</description>

      <title>General Relativistic Fluctuation Theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the recently proposed covariant framework of general relativistic stochastic mechanics and stochastic thermodynamics, we proved the detailed and integral fluctuation theorems in curved spacetime. The time-reversal transformation is described as a transformation from the perspective of future-directed observer to that of the corresponding past-directed observer, which enables us to maintain general covariance throughout the construction. The result presented in this work may be applied in understanding the origin of irreversibility in macroscopic processes in the presence of relativistic gravity, as in most astrophysical or cosmological processes.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation theorems in general relativistic stochastic thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09914v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on the recently proposed framework of general relativistic stochastic mechanics and stochastic thermodynamics at the ensemble level, this work focuses on general relativistic stochastic thermodynamics at the trajectory level. The first law of stochastic thermodynamics is reformulated and the fluctuation theorems are proved on this level, with emphasis on maintaining fully general covariance and on the choice of observers.</description>
