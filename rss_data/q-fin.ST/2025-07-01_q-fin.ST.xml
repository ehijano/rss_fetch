      <title>Scale-Dependent Multifractality in Bitcoin Realised Volatility: Implications for Rough Volatility Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We assess the applicability of rough volatility models to Bitcoin realised volatility using the normalised p-variation framework of Cont and Das (2024). Applying this model free estimator to high-frequency Bitcoin data from 2017 to 2024 across multiple sampling resolutions, we find that the normalised statistic remains strictly negative throughout, precluding the estimation of a valid roughness index. Stationarity tests and robustness checks reveal no significant evidence of non-stationarity or structural breaks as explanatory factors. Instead, convergent evidence from three complementary diagnostics, namely multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis, log-log moment scaling, and wavelet leaders, reveals a multifractal structure in Bitcoin volatility. This scale-dependent behaviour violates the homogeneity assumptions underlying rough volatility estimation and accounts for the estimator's systematic failure. These findings suggest that while rough volatility models perform well in traditional markets, they are structurally misaligned with the empirical features of Bitcoin volatility.</description>

      <title>The Efficient Tail Hypothesis: An Extreme Value Perspective on Market Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06661v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In econometrics, the Efficient Market Hypothesis posits that asset prices reflect all available information in the market. Several empirical investigations show that market efficiency drops when it undergoes extreme events. Many models for multivariate extremes focus on positive dependence, making them unsuitable for studying extremal dependence in financial markets where data often exhibit both positive and negative extremal dependence. To this end, we construct regular variation models on the entirety of $\mathbb{R}^d$ and develop a bivariate measure for asymmetry in the strength of extremal dependence between adjacent orthants. Our directional tail dependence (DTD) measure allows us to define the Efficient Tail Hypothesis (ETH) -- an analogue of the Efficient Market Hypothesis -- for the extremal behaviour of the market. Asymptotic results for estimators of DTD are described, and we discuss testing of the ETH via permutation-based methods and present novel tools for visualization. Empirical study of China's futures market leads to a rejection of the ETH and we identify potential profitable investment opportunities. To promote the research of microstructure in China's derivatives market, we open-source our high-frequency data, which are being collected continuously from multiple derivative exchanges.</description>
