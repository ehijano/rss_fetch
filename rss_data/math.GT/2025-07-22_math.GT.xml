      <title>A remark on the counterexample to the unknotting number conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By using Snappy, M. Brittenham and S. Hermiller discovered a very surprising example that $u(7_1\#\overline{7_1})\leq 5&lt;6=u(7_1)+u(\overline{7_1})$, where $7_1$ is the $(2,7)$-torus knot and $\overline{7_1}$ is its mirror image. Based on their work, we give a direct verification of this fact.</description>

      <title>Filtered Instantons and the Concordance of Satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In \cite{NST23}, Nozaki-Sato-Taniguchi defined a family of invariants $ r_s $ for integer homology spheres with filtered instanton homology \cite{FS92}. Coupling these with techniques in classical knot theory, we produce some results in the knot concordance group, including criteria for a family of satellite knots to be linearly independent and the independence of what we call the Whitehead $ n $-ble $ P_n $.</description>

      <title>The configuration functor of a punctured space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $U$ be a space whose one point compactification $U^*$ is a CW-complex for which the added point $*$ is the only $0$-cell. We observe that the configuration space $Conf_n(U)$ of $n$ numbered distinct points in $U$ has no closed support homology in degree $&lt;n$ and prove that Borel-Moore homology group $H^{cl}_n(Conf_n(U))$ depends only on the fundamental group $\pi_1(U^*,*)$. We describe this homology group in terms of a presentation of $\pi_1(U^*,*)$.
  A case of interest is when $U$ is a connected closed oriented surface of positive genus minus a finite nonempty set. Then the mapping class group $Mod(U)$ of $U$ acts on both $\pi_1(U^*,*)$ and ${H^k}(Conf_n(U){)}\cong H^{cl}_ {2n-k}(Conf_n(U))$ and we prove that its action on the latter is through its action on the nilpotent quotient $\pi_1(U^*,*)/ \pi_1(U^*,*)^{(k+1)}$. Furthermore, we give an example of a mapping class of a once punctured closed surface $U$ which acts trivially on ${H^n}(Conf_n(U))$, but not on the nilpotent quotient $\pi_1(U^*,*)/ \pi_1(U^*,*)^{(n+1)}$. The former generalizes a theorem of Bianchi-Miller-Wilson and the latter disproves a conjecture of theirs.</description>

      <title>Note on Euler class 0 taut foliation on the Whitehead link exterior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the existence of co-orientable taut foliations on 3-manifolds, particularly focusing on the Whitehead link exterior. We demonstrate fundamental obstructions to the existence of such foliations with certain Euler class properties, contrasting with the more permissive case of the figure-eight knot exterior. Our analysis reveals that most lattice points in the dual unit Thurston ball of the Whitehead link exterior cannot be realized as Euler classes of co-orientable taut foliations, with only limited exceptional cases. The proofs combine techniques from foliation theory, including saddle fillings and index formulas, with topological obstructions derived from Dehn surgery. These results yield general methods for studying foliations on cusped hyperbolic 3-manifolds. These techniques applied to broader classes of manifolds beyond the specific examples considered here</description>

      <title>Classification of locally standard torus actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An action of a torus T on a manifold M is locally standard if, at each point, the stabilizer is a sub-torus and the non-zero isotropy weights are a basis to its weight lattice. The quotient M/T is then a manifold-with-corners, decorated by a so-called unimodular labelling, which keeps track of the isotropy representations in M, and by a degree two cohomology class with coefficients in the integral lattice of the Lie algebra of T, which encodes the "twistedness" of M over M/T. We classify locally standard smooth actions of T, up to equivariant diffeomorphisms, in terms of triples (Q,lambda,c), where Q is a manifold-with-corners, lambda is a unimodular labelling, and c is a degree two cohomology class with coefficients in the integral lattice.</description>

      <title>Configurations of Lagrangian spheres in $K3$ surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Dehn--Seidel twists on configurations of Lagrangian spheres in symplectic $K3$ surfaces, using tools from Seiberg--Witten theory. In the case of $ADE$ configurations of Lagrangian spheres, we prove that a naturally associated representation of the generalised Braid group in the symplectic mapping class group is always faithful after abelianising, in a suitable sense. More generally, we prove that squared Dehn--Seidel twists on homologically-distinct Lagrangian spheres are algebraically independent in the abelianisation of the smoothly-trivial symplectic mapping class group, and deduce from this new infinite-generation results. Beyond symplectic $K3$ surfaces, we also establish analogues of these results at the level of the fundamental group of the space of symplectic forms.</description>

      <title>Morse matchings and Khovanov homology of 4-strand torus links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a link or a tangle diagram, we define algorithmic Morse theoretic simplifications on their Khovanov homology. In contrast to Bar-Natan's scanning algorithm, the cancellations are postponed until the end and performed in one go. Although our novel approach is computationally inferior to Bar-Natan's algorithm, it side-steps the need for a large amount of iterations, making it more fitting for theoretical analysis. Our main application is towards integral Khovanov homology of 4-strand torus links, for which we compute non-trivial Khovanov homology groups in all homological degrees and find an abundance of $4$-torsion. At the limit $T(4,\infty)$, our computations agree with a conjecture of Gorsky, Oblomkov and Rasmussen. For finite $n$, we use the $\lambda$-invariant of Lewark, Marino and Zibrowius to derive lower bounds on proper rational Gordian distances from $T(4,n)$.</description>

      <title>Topology and Algebra of Bonded Knots and Braids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present a detailed study of \emph{bonded knots} and their related structures, integrating recent developments into a single framework. Bonded knots are classical knots endowed with embedded bonding arcs modeling physical or chemical bonds. We consider bonded knots in three categories (long, standard, and tight) according to the type of bonds, and in two categories, topological vertex and rigid vertex, according to the allowed isotopy moves, and we define invariants for each category. We then develop the theory of \emph{bonded braids}, the algebraic counterpart of bonded knots. We define the {\it bonded braid monoid}, with its generators and relations, and formulate the analogues of the Alexander and Markov theorems for bonded braids, including an $L$-equivalence for bonded braids. Next, we introduce \emph{enhanced bonded knots and braids}, incorporating two types of bonds (attracting and repelling) corresponding to different interactions. We define the enhanced bonded braid group and show how the bonded braid monoid embeds into this group. Finally, we study \emph{bonded knotoids}, which are open knot diagrams with bonds, and their closure operations, and we define the \emph{bonded closure}. We introduce \emph{bonded braidoids} as the algebraic counterpart of bonded knotoids. These models capture the topology of open chains with inter and intra-chain bonds and suggest new invariants for classifying biological macromolecules.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a complete set of covering moves, or moves relating colored link diagrams appearing as branch sets of simple branched coverings of $S^3$ by the same 3-manifold, for each fixed degree $d \geq 4$. We also show that up to $d-2$ stabilizations, this set can be refined to two local tangle replacements. This extends prior work of Apostolakis and Piergallini, and is a braided analogue to the covering moves of Bobtcheva and Piergallini.</description>

      <title>Twisting, Stabilization and Bordered Floer homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider an unknot $c$ in $S^3$ and a knot $K$ in ${S^3-N(c)}$. Twisting the knot $K$ along $c$, or equivalently applying $\frac{1}{m}$-surgery on $c$, produces a family of knots $\{K_m\}_{m \in \mathbb{Z}}$. We use bordered Floer homology and the theory of immersed curve invariants to show that for $|m|\gg0$, total dimension of $\widehat{\mathrm{HFK}}(K_m)$, $\tau(K_{m})$ and thickness of $K_{m}$ are linear functions of $m$. Furthermore, we prove that the extremal coefficients of the Alexander polynomial and extremal knot Floer homologies of $K_m$ stabilize as $m$ goes to infinity. This generalizes results of Chen, Lambert-Cole, Roberts, Van Cott and the author on coherent twist families.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Link homology theories (such as knot Floer homology and Khovanov homology) have become indispensable tools for studying knots and links, including powerful 4-dimensional obstructions. These notes, based on lectures given at the 2024 Georgia Topology Summer School, discuss what these toolkits say about surfaces in 4-space themselves, via the homomorphisms assigned to link cobordisms. We begin with a brief overview of these theories (focusing on their shared formal properties) and survey some of their applications to knotted surfaces. Afterwards, we give an introduction to Khovanov homology (with an eye towards its cobordism maps), discuss hands-on computational techniques for Khovanov and Bar-Natan homology, and outline the role of the Bar-Natan category in this story.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hopf index, a topological invariant that quantifies the linking of preimage fibers, is fundamental to the structure and stability of hopfions. In this work, we propose a new mathematical framework for modeling hopfions with high Hopf index, drawing on the language of singularity theory and the topology of differentiable maps. At the core of our approach is the notion of a generalized Hopf map of order $n$, whose structure is captured via fold maps and their Stein factorizations. We demonstrate that this theoretical construction not only aligns closely with recent experimental observations of high-Hopf-index hopfions, but also offers a precise classification of the possible configurations of fiber pairs associated to distinct points. Our results thus establish a robust bridge between the geometry of singular maps and the experimentally observed topology of complex field configurations of hopfions in materials and other physical systems.</description>

      <title>Relatively hyperbolic groups, Grothendieck pairs, and uncountable profinite ambiguity among fibre products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: These notes expand upon our lectures on {\em profinite rigidity} at the international colloquium on randomness, geometry and dynamics, organised by TIFR Mumbai at IISER Pune in January 2024. We are interested in the extent to which groups that arise in hyperbolic geometry and 3-manifold topology are determined by their finite quotients. The main theme of these notes is the radical extent to which rigidity is lost when one passes from consideration of groups with hyperbolic features to consideration of their direct products. We describe a general method for producing infinite sequences of {\em{Grothendieck pairs,}} i.e.~embeddings $P_i\hookrightarrow G\times G$ inducing isomorphisms of profinite completions, with $G$ fixed and $P_i$ finitely generated. In order to apply this method, one needs $G$ to map onto a subgroup of finite index in the commutator subgroup of a group $\Gamma$ with $H_2(\Gamma,\mathbb{Z})=0$, and $\Gamma$ should be relatively hyperbolic. By exploiting the flexibility of the construction, we explain how, under the same hypotheses on $G$, one can construct {\em uncountable families} of pairwise non-isomorphic subgroups $P_\lambda$ such that $P_\lambda\hookrightarrow G\times G$ induces an isomorphism of profinite completions. Examples of groups $G$ satisfying these conditions include the fundamental group of the Weeks manifold and the fundamental group of the 4-fold branch cover of the figure-8 knot complement. Both of these examples are profinitely rigid in the absolute sense and in each case Grothendieck pairs account entirely for the loss of profinite rigidity for $G\times G$: if $H$ is a finitely generated group whose profinite completion is isomorphic to that of $G\times G$, then there is an embedding $H\hookrightarrow G\times G$ that is a Grothendieck pair.</description>

      <title>Transversal non-Clifford gates on qLDPC codes breaking the $\sqrt{N}$ distance barrier and quantum-inspired geometry with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ systolic freedom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Historically, a $\sqrt{N}log^{1/2}(N)$ distance barrier for quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes with $N$ qubits persisted for nearly two decades, until the recent discovery of the fibre-bundle code. An open question is whether such a distance barrier can be broken while preserving the ability to perform transversal non-Clifford gates. In this direction, another long-standing distance barrier of $N^{1/3}$ for LDPC stabilizer codes -- present since the discovery of the 3D color code -- was only recently overcome by a construction achieving an $\Omega(\sqrt{N})$ distance (arXiv:2501.19375). The present work further breaks the $\sqrt{N}$ distance barrier by taking a homological product of three good qLDPC codes, combined with the Freedman-Hastings code-to-manifold mapping and the triple cup product to implement transversal CCZ gates. The resulting code achieves an $\Omega(N^{2/3})$ distance (a linear $X$-distance of $\Theta(N)$) and a dimension of $\Theta(N^{2/3})$, which enables fault-tolerant preparation of $\Theta(N^{1/3})$ independent logical CCZ magic states in a single shot, without distillation (`magic state fountain'). This new quantum code also inspires the discovery of a family of exotic $3q$-dimensional manifolds $\mathcal{M}$, which exhibit both a power-law $\mathbb{Z}_2$-($q$, $2q$)-systolic freedom and $\Theta(vol(\mathcal{M}))$ triple intersection points of $2q$-dimensional submanifolds.</description>

      <title>On the computation of $\mathrm{Ext}_{\mathcal A}^{k,k+*}(\mathbb{Z}/2,\mathbb{Z}/2)$ for $k \leq 5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This Note presents a computational algorithm for determining a basis of the cohomology of the mod 2 Steenrod algebra, $\mathrm{Ext}_{\mathcal A}^{k, k+*}(\mathbb{Z}/2, \mathbb{Z}/2)$ for $k \leq 5$, based on the well-known generators and the Adem relations given in Chen's work [2]. The purpose of this algorithm is to verify the hand-computed results for $\mathrm{Ext}_{\mathcal A}^{4, 4+*}(\mathbb{Z}/2, \mathbb{Z}/2)$ presented in our corrected papers [8, 9, 10]. Combining our most recent works [11, 12], the verification of the domain and the codomain of the fourth algebraic transfer in specific degrees can now be completed.</description>

      <title>An algorithm to construct one-vertex triangulations of Heegaard splittings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17556v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Following work of Jaco and Rubinstein (2006), which (non-constructively) proved that any 3-manifold admits a one-vertex layered triangulation, we present an algorithm, with implementation using Regina, that uses a combinatorial presentation of a Heegaard diagram to construct a generalised notion of a layered triangulation. We show that work of Husz\'ar and Spreer (2019) extends to our construction: given a genus-$g$ Heegaard splitting, our algorithm generates a triangulation with cutwidth bounded above by $4g-2$. Beyond Heegaard splittings, our construction actually extends to a natural generalisation of Dehn fillings: given a one-vertex triangulation with a genus-$g$ boundary component $B$, we can construct a one-vertex triangulation of any 3-manifold obtained by filling $B$ with a handlebody. To demonstrate the usefulness of our algorithm, we present findings from preliminary computer searches using this algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study properties of "hyperbolic directions" in groups acting cocompactly on properly convex domains in real projective space, from three different perspectives simultaneously: the (coarse) metric geometry of the Hilbert metric, the projective geometry of the boundary of the domain, and the singular value gaps of projective automorphisms. We describe the relationship between different definitions of "Morse" and "regular" quasi-geodesics arising in these three different contexts. This generalizes several results of Benoist and Guichard to the non-Gromov hyperbolic setting.</description>

      <title>The unknotting number, hard unknot diagrams, and reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have developed a reinforcement learning agent that often finds a minimal sequence of unknotting crossing changes for a knot diagram with up to 200 crossings, hence giving an upper bound on the unknotting number. We have used this to determine the unknotting number of 57k knots. We took diagrams of connected sums of such knots with oppositely signed signatures, where the summands were overlaid. The agent has found examples where several of the crossing changes in an unknotting collection of crossings result in hyperbolic knots. Based on this, we have shown that, given knots $K$ and $K'$ that satisfy some mild assumptions, there is a diagram of their connected sum and $u(K) + u(K')$ unknotting crossings such that changing any one of them results in a prime knot. As a by-product, we have obtained a dataset of 2.6 million distinct hard unknot diagrams; most of them under 35 crossings. Assuming the additivity of the unknotting number, we have determined the unknotting number of 43 at most 12-crossing knots for which the unknotting number is unknown.</description>

Abstract: The OU matrix of a braid diagram is a square matrix that represents the number of over/under crossings of each pair of strands. In this paper, the OU matrix of a pure braid diagram is characterized for up to 5 strands. As an application, the crossing matrix of a positive pure braid is also characterized for up to 5 strands. Moreover, a standard form of the OU matrix is given and characterized for general braids of up to 5 strands.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08090v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Posed by Taniguchi, the classification of quandles with good involutions is a difficult question with applications to surface-knot theory. We address this question for subquandles of conjugation quandles, including all core quandles. We also study good involutions of faithful racks. In particular, we obtain sharp bounds on the number of good involutions of racks in these families.
  As an application of our results, we implement group-theoretic algorithms that compute all good involutions of conjugation quandles and core quandles; we provide data for those up to order 23. As another application, we construct infinite families of connected, noninvolutive symmetric quandles.
  We also classify symmetric and Legendrian racks, quandles, and kei up to order 8 using a computer search. Finally, we exhibit an equivalence of categories between racks and Legendrian racks that induces an equivalence between involutory racks, Legendrian kei, and symmetric kei.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24118v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We produce lattice extensions of a dense family of classical Schottky subgroups of the isometry group of $d$-dimensional hyperbolic space. The extensions produced are said to be systolic, since all loxodromic elements with short translation length are conjugate into the Schottky groups. Various corollaries are obtained, in particular showing that for all $d\geq3$, the set of complex translation lengths realized by systoles of closed hyperbolic $d$-manifolds is dense inside the set of all possible complex translation lengths. We also consider complex translation lengths in arithmetic hyperbolic $d$-manifolds, and provide a new way to construct non-arithmetic lattices.</description>

Abstract: The CN matrix of an $n$-braid projection $B$ is an $n \times n$ matrix such that each $(i,j)$ entry indicates the number of crossings between $i^{th}$ and $j^{th}$ strands of $B$. In this paper, several patterns of an $n \times n$ matrix to be a CN matrix are discussed, and the CN matrix of a pure 6-braid projection is characterized. As an application, the OU matrix of a pure 6-braid diagram and the crossing matrix of a positive pure 6-braid are also characterized.</description>

Abstract: Given a rational homology 3-sphere $M$, we introduce a triple linking form on $H_1(M; \mathbb{Z})$, defined when the classical torsion linking pairing of three homology classes vanishes pairwise. If $M$ is the boundary of a simply-connected 4-manifold $N$, the triple linking form can be computed in terms of the higher order intersection form on $N$, introduced by Matsumoto. We use these methods to formulate an embedding obstruction for rational homology spheres in $S^4$, extending a 1938 theorem of Hantzsche.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10226v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the Singer conjecture and Gromov-L\"uck inequality $\chi \geq |\sigma|$ for aspherical complex surfaces. We give a proof of the Singer conjecture for aspherical complex surface with residually finite fundamental group that does not rely on Gromov's K\"ahler groups theory. Without the residually finiteness assumption, we observe that this conjecture can be proven for all aspherical complex surfaces except possibly those in Class $\mathrm{VII}_0^+$ (a positive answer to the global spherical shell conjecture would rule out the existence of aspherical surfaces in this class). We also sharpen Gromov's inequality for aspherical complex surfaces that are not in Class $\mathrm{VII}_0^+$. This is achieved by connecting the circle of ideas of the Singer conjecture with the study of Reid's conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13479v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a weighted, undirected graph $G$ cellularly embedded on a topological surface $S$, we describe algorithms to compute the second shortest and third shortest closed walks of $G$ that are neither homotopically trivial in $S$ nor homotopic to the shortest non-trivial closed walk or to each other. Our algorithms run in $O(n^2\log n)$ time for the second shortest walk and in $O(n^3)$ time for the third shortest walk. We also show how to reduce the running time for the second shortest homotopically non-trivial closed walk to $O(n\log n)$ when both the genus and the number of boundaries are fixed.
  Our algorithms rely on a careful analysis of the configurations of the first three shortest homotopically non-trivial curves in $S$. As an intermediate step, we also describe how to compute a shortest essential arc between \emph{one} pair of vertices or between \emph{all} pairs of vertices of a given boundary component of $S$ in $O(n^2)$ time or $O(n^3)$ time, respectively.</description>

This gives a classification of all closed proper manifolds locally modelled on such Shilov boundaries, and provides a positive answer, in the case of flag manifolds admitting a $\Theta$-positive structure, to a rigidity question of Limbeek and Zimmer.</description>

We determine the maximum size of such a set for every k. In particular, the maximum never exceeds k+6, and it does not exceed k+4 when k is large.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19764v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The kernel of the natural projection of a graph product of groups onto their direct product is called the Cartesian subgroup of the graph product. This construction generalises commutator subgroups of right-angled Coxeter and Artin groups. Using theory of polyhedral products, we give a lower and an upper bound on the number of relations in presentations of Cartesian groups and on their deficiency. The bounds are related to the fundamental groups of full subcomplexes in the clique complex, and the lower bound coincide with the upper bound if these fundamental groups are free or free abelian.
  Following Li Cai's approach, we also describe an algorithm that computes "small" presentations of Cartesian subgroups.</description>

Abstract: We discuss reconstructing smooth real algebraic maps onto curves whose Reeb graph is as prescribed. This can be contributed to real algebraic geometry, especially in explicit examples in real algebraic geometry in a new way. The Reeb graph of a smooth function is the space of all connected components of preimages of all single points and a natural quotient space of the manifold with the vertex set being all connected components containing some singular points of it. This gives a strong tool in geometry of manifolds and appeared already in 1950 with Morse functions.
  The Reeb graph of the natural height of the unit sphere of dimension at least 2 is a graph with exactly two vertices and one edge. We reconstruct functions, from general finite graphs, conversely. In the differentiable situations, Sharko pioneered this in 2006, followed by Masumoto-Saeki and Michalak, mainly. Related real algebraic situations have been launched and studied by the author. The curve-valued case is first considered here.</description>
