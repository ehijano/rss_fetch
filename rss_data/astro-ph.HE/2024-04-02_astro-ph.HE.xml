      <title>Quadrupole Moment of a Magnetically Confined Mountain on an Accreting Neutron Star in General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: General relativistic corrections are calculated for the quadrupole moment of a magnetically confined mountain on an accreting neutron star. The hydromagnetic structure of the mountain satisfies the general relativistic Grad-Shafranov equation supplemented by the flux-freezing condition of ideal magnetohydrodynamics, as in previous calculations of the magnetic dipole moment. It is found that the ellipticity and hence the gravitational wave strain is $4\%$ to $12\%$ smaller than in the analogous Newtonian system. The direct contribution of the magnetic field to the nonaxisymmetric component of the stress-energy tensor is also considered, and it is shown that it is negligible in systems such as low-mass X-ray binaries.</description>

      <title>Recent progresses in strange quark stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to the hypothesis that strange quark matter may be the true ground state of matter at extremely high densities, strange quark stars should be stable and could exist in the Universe. It is possible that pulsars may actually be strange stars, but not neutron stars. Here we present a short review on recent progresses in the field of strange quark stars. Three popular phenomenological models widely used to describe strange quark matter are introduced, with special attention being paid on the corresponding equation of state in each model. Combining the equation of state with the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov equations, the inner structure and mass-radius relation can be obtained for the whole sequence of strange stars. Strong gravitational wave emissions may be generated by strange stars through various mechanisms, which may help identify strange stars via observations. Especially, close-in strange quark planets with respect to their hosts may provide a unique test for the existence of strange quark objects. Fierce electromagnetic bursts could also be generated by strange stars. The energy may come from the phase transition of neutron stars to strange stars, or from the merger of binary strange stars. The collapse of the strange star crust can also release a huge amount of energy. It is shown that strange quark stars may be involved in short gamma-ray bursts and fast radio bursts.</description>

      <title>Supernova spotting in Super-Kamiokande Gd</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the Super-Kamiokande (SK) neutrino experiment in Japan added gadolinium sulphate octahydrate (Gd) to the pure water in its detector, it has entered a new era in supernova neutrino detection. The addition of Gd makes it possible to tag neutrons from inverse beta decay (IBD) interactions of electron antineutrinos with free protons in the water. This has led to significant improvement in the experiment's sensitivity to low-energy electron antineutrinos, which is key in the observation of supernova neutrinos. Super-Kamiokande Gadolinium (SK-Gd) has the potential to make the first observation of the diffuse supernova neutrino background (DSNB) and pre-supernova (preSN) neutrinos, and can improve the pointing capability of SK in the event of a core-collapse supernova (CCSN) explosion. We present the latest results and prospects for supernova neutrino detection with SK-Gd.</description>

      <title>Kicking time back in black-hole mergers: Ancestral masses, spins, birth recoils and hierarchical-formation viability of GW190521</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pair-instability supernova (PISN) is thought to prevent the formation of black holes from stellar collapse within the approximate mass range $M\in [65,130]M_\odot$. However, such black holes may form through hierarchical formation channels, as the result of merging "ancestor" black holes, whose properties determine those of the ``child'' black hole, namely its mass, spin, and recoil velocity (or kick). Crucially, the child black hole will be expelled from its host environment if its "birth kick" exceeds the corresponding escape velocity, preventing it from undergoing further mergers. In this work, we exploit tight relations between the final kick and final spin of quasi-circular black-hole mergers to obtain posterior probability distributions for the hypothetical ancestral masses, spins and birth kicks of the component black holes of GW190521, assuming both quasi-circular (with generic spins) eccentric (aligned-spin) scenarios for the latter. With this, we evaluate the probability $p_{2g}$ that the GW190521 components formed from the merger of stellar-origin black holes, being retained by the host environment. For the primary component BH1, which falls squarely in the PISN mass gap, we find that such scenario is strongly suppressed if GW190521 happened in a Globular Cluster, unless GW190521 was quasi-circular and BH1 had aligned-spin ancestors, characteristic of isolated black-hole binary formation scenarios. Similarly, for denser host environments (excluding AGNs), we only obtain probabilities $p_{2g} &gt; 0.5$ if GW190521 was quasi-circular and BH1 had aligned-spin ancestors. If GW190521 was eccentric, we find maximal values $p_{2g}$ of only $p_{2g} \simeq 0.1$ which require ancestral mass ratios $q\geq 2$, untypical of isolated formation scenarios. Our results seem consistent with an AGN origin for GW190521, especially if this was eccentric.</description>

      <title>Repeating Nuclear Transients as Candidate Electromagnetic Counterparts of LISA Extreme Mass Ratio Inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) are one of the primary targets for the recently adopted millihertz gravitational-wave (GW) observatory LISA. Some previous studies have argued that a fraction of all EMRIs form in matter-rich environments, and can potentially explain the dozens of soft X-ray band ($\sim 10^{-1} \rm keV$), low-frequency ($\sim 0.1$ mHz) periodic phenomena known as quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) and quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs). Here, using a representative EMRI population retrofitted with cutoffs on LISA-band SNRs and luminosity distances to account for the sensitivity of current instruments, we estimate the mean frequency band in which QPEs and QPOs originating from detectable LISA EMRIs may be emitting an X-ray signal ``today'' (i.e., in 2024) to be $0.46 \pm 0.22$ mHz. We also model the well-known QPO source, RE J1034+396, which falls in this frequency band, as an EMRI assuming its primary black hole mass to be $10^6-10^7 M_\odot$. Through a prior-predictive analysis, we estimate the orbiting compact object's mass to be $46^{+ 10}_{-40} M_\odot$ and the source's LISA-band SNR as $\approx 14$, highlighting it as a candidate multi-messenger EMRI target. We also highlight the role of current and near-future X-ray and UV observatories in enabling multi-messenger observations of EMRIs in conjunction with LISA, and conclude with a discussion of caveats of the current analysis, such as the exclusion of eccentricity and inclination from the model, and the measurability of sub-solar mass compact object EMRIs.</description>

      <title>Constraining Dark Matter Annihilation with Fermi-LAT Observations of Ultra-Faint Compact Stellar Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent results from numerical simulations and models of galaxy formation suggest that recently discovered ultra-faint compact stellar systems (UFCSs) in the halo of the Milky Way (MW) may be some of the smallest and faintest galaxies.
  If this is the case, these systems would be attractive targets for indirect searches of weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) dark matter (DM) annihilation due to their relative proximity and high expected DM content.
  In this study, we analyze 14.3 years of gamma-ray data collected by the Fermi-LAT coincident with 26 UFCSs.
  No significant excess gamma-ray emission is detected, and we present gamma-ray flux upper limits for these systems.
  Assuming that the UFCSs are dark-matter-dominated galaxies consistent with being among the faintest and least massive MW dwarf spheroidal (dSphs) satellite galaxies, we derive the projected sensitivity for a dark matter annihilation signal.
  We find that observations of UFCSs have the potential to yield some of the most powerful constraints on DM annihilation, with sensitivity comparable to observations of known dSphs and the Galactic center.
  This result emphasizes the importance of precise kinematic studies of UFCSs to empirically determine their DM content.</description>

      <title>Anomaly Detection and Approximate Similarity Searches of Transients in Real-time Data Streams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present LAISS (Lightcurve Anomaly Identification and Similarity Search), an automated pipeline to detect anomalous astrophysical transients in real-time data streams. We deploy our anomaly detection model on the nightly ZTF Alert Stream via the ANTARES broker, identifying a manageable $\sim$1-5 candidates per night for expert vetting and coordinating follow-up observations. Our method leverages statistical light-curve and contextual host-galaxy features within a random forest classifier, tagging transients of rare classes (spectroscopic anomalies), of uncommon host-galaxy environments (contextual anomalies), and of peculiar or interaction-powered phenomena (behavioral anomalies). Moreover, we demonstrate the power of a low-latency ($\sim$ms) approximate similarity search method to find transient analogs with similar light-curve evolution and host-galaxy environments. We use analogs for data-driven discovery, characterization, (re-)classification, and imputation in retrospective and real-time searches. To date we have identified $\sim$50 previously known and previously missed rare transients from real-time and retrospective searches, including but not limited to: SLSNe, TDEs, SNe IIn, SNe IIb, SNe Ia-CSM, SNe Ia-91bg-like, SNe Ib, SNe Ic, SNe Ic-BL, and M31 novae. Lastly, we report the discovery of 325 total transients, all observed between 2018-2021 and absent from public catalogs ($\sim$1% of all ZTF Astronomical Transient reports to the Transient Name Server through 2021). These methods enable a systematic approach to finding the "needle in the haystack" in large-volume data streams. Because of its integration with the ANTARES broker, LAISS is built to detect exciting transients in Rubin data.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Atmosphere-Skimming Cosmic-Ray Showers in High-Altitude Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atmosphere-skimming showers are initiated by cosmic rays with incoming directions such that the full development of the cascade occurs inside the atmosphere without ever reaching the ground. This new class of showers has been observed in balloon-borne experiments such as ANITA, but a characterisation of their properties is lacking. The interplay between the Earth's magnetic field, the long distances over which atmosphere-skimming showers develop, and the low density of the atmosphere they traverse gives rise to several effects that are not seen in downward-going cascades, and require detailed modeling. In this article, we used the latest version of the ZHAireS-RASPASS shower simulation program to tackle this problem, and dwell on the particular phenomena that arises from the peculiar environment on which these showers develop. We focus in particular on the properties of the longitudinal profile of the shower and its fluctuations as a function of cosmic-ray energy, direction and primary mass. We have also studied the phase-space of cosmic-ray arrival directions where detection in high-altitude experiments is more likely, and have found that only in a small range of directions the showers are sufficiently developed before reaching the altitude of the detector. Our results are relevant for the design of high-altitude and in particular balloon-borne experiments, and for the interpretation of the data they collect.</description>

      <title>Non-radial oscillations in newly born compact star considering effects of phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The massive stars end their lives by supernova explosions leaving central compact objects that may evolve into neutron stars. Initially, after birth, the star remains hot and gradually cools down. We explore the matter and star properties during this initial stage of the compact stars considering the possibility of the appearance of deconfined quark matter in the core of the star. At the initial stage after the supernova explosion, the occurrence of non-radial oscillation in the newly born compact object is highly possible. Non-radial oscillations are an important source of GWs. There is a high chance for GWs from these oscillations, especially the nodeless fundamental (f-) mode to be detected by next-generation GW detectors. We study the evolution in frequencies of non-radial oscillation after birth considering phase transition and predicting the possible signature for different possibilities of theoretical compact star models.</description>

      <title>Systematic bias from waveform modeling for binary black hole populations in next-generation gravitational wave detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Next-generation gravitational wave detectors such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer will have increased sensitivity and observing volumes, enabling unprecedented precision in parameter estimation. However, this enhanced precision could also reveal systematic biases arising from waveform modeling, which may impact astrophysical inference. We investigate the extent of these biases over a year-long observing run with $10^5$ simulated binary black hole sources using the linear signal approximation. To establish a conservative estimate, we sample binaries from a smoothed truncated power-law population model and compute systematic parameter biases between the IMRPhenomXAS and IMRPhenomD waveform models. For sources with signal-to-noise ratios above 100, we estimate statistically significant parameter biases in $\sim 3\%-20\%$ of the events, depending on the parameter. We find that the average mismatch between waveform models required to achieve a bias of $\leq 1\sigma$ for $99\%$ of detections with signal-to-noise ratios $\geq 100$ should be $\mathcal{O}(10^{-5})$, or at least one order of magnitude better than current levels of waveform accuracy.</description>

      <title>Decoding rotating neutron stars: Role of the symmetry energy slope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In December 2023, the Fermi LAT Catalog announced the discovery of 33 new millisecond pulsars. Motivated by that, in this work, I study how different values of the symmetry energy slope $(L)$ affect the properties of static and slowly rotating neutron stars. For fixed values of angular velocity, I study how the slope influences the increase of the maximum mass, the radii of the canonical 1.4 solar mass, its eccentricity, as well the same quantities for the 2.01 $M_\odot$ stars. I show that different slope values cause different variations not only the absolute quantities but also in relative ones. Indeed, different slope values predict different values for the eccentricity, which does not depend on the absolute value of the neutron stars' radii. Therefore, this quantity can be a powerful tool to constrain the symmetry energy slope.</description>

      <title>ALMA Confirmation of Millimeter Time Variability in the Gamma-Ray Detected Seyfert Galaxy GRS 1734-292</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: GRS 1734-292 is a radio-quiet galaxy, exhibiting neither intense starburst nor jet activities. However, Fermi-LAT detected this object in the GeV band. The origin of non-thermal activity in this Seyfert galaxy is an intriguing question. We report Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of GRS 1734-292 at frequencies of 97.5, 145, and 225 GHz. These observations confirmed the millimeter excess within the central &lt;100 pc region and its time variability based on two separate observations conducted four days apart. The timescale of variability aligns with the light crossing time for a compact source smaller than &lt;100 Schwarzschild radius. If we take into account the power-law synchrotron emission originating from the corona (i.e., the hot plasma located above the accretion disk), the millimeter spectrum indicates the coronal magnetic field of ~10 G and the size of ~10 Schwarzschild radius. An alternative explanation for this millimeter emission could be synchrotron and free-free emission from disk winds (i.e., fast wide-opening angle outflows from the disk) with the size of ~10 pc, although it may be difficult to explain the fast variability. Future millimeter observations with higher resolution (~0.01") will enable the differentiation between these two scenarios. Such observations will provide insights into the acceleration sites of high-energy particles at the core of active galactic nuclei.</description>

      <title>Membrane Paradigm Approach to the Johannsen-Psaltis Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Johannsen-Psaltis black hole is a phenomenologically viable metric obtained by judiciously deforming the Kerr black hole such that the metric is asymptotically flat and causal; and is consistent with the weak field, post-Newtonian tests of gravity; but has additional hairs besides its mass and angular momentum. As it deviates from the Kerr black hole in the strong coupling regime, it is a useful metric to test the Kerr Hypothesis that states that all astrophysical black holes are of the Kerr type. Here we give a membrane description of this black hole that effectively amounts to replacing the observable part of the black hole with a fluid with thermal properties. A time-like membrane, a stretched horizon local in time is assumed to exist. This membrane is expected to approximate the null event horizon which is highly non-local in time. We derive the energy-momentum tensor of the fluid and all the transport coefficients using the action formulation to the membrane as advocated by Parikh and Wilczek. In the fluid description, one observes that the finiteness of the transport coefficients constrains the additional hairs of the Johannsen-Psaltis black hole. Analytically continuing the pressure of the fluid to all values of the radial coordinate $r$, one obtains interesting Van der Waals-type behavior of the pressure of the fluid which diverges at the radius of the outer ergosphere, lending support, from the Membrane Paradigm's perspective to the claim that relativistic astrophysical jets are produced by the ergoregion of the black hole.</description>

      <title>Assessing the impact of instrument noise and astrophysical fluctuations on measurements of the first black hole photon ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Currently envisioned extensions of the Event Horizon Telescope to space will soon target the black hole photon ring: a narrow ring-shaped imprint of a black hole's strong gravity produced in its images by highly bent photon trajectories. In principle, the shape of the photon ring encodes information about the geometry of the underlying black hole spacetime. In practice, however, whether or not this information can be extracted from the ring shape depends on several factors, ranging from the astrophysical details of the emitting source (such as the magnitude of its plasma fluctuations) to the specific configuration of the interferometric array (such as the separation between its telescopes, or the level of noise in its instruments). Here, we employ a phenomenological model to assess the impact of astrophysical fluctuations and instrument noise on the inferred shape of the photon ring. Our systematic study of several astrophysical profiles suggests that this shape can be measured even in the presence of instrument noise across a wide range of baselines. The measurement accuracy and precision appear relatively insensitive to the noise level, up to a sharp threshold beyond which any measurement becomes incredibly challenging (at least without recourse to more sophisticated data analysis methods). Encouragingly, we find that only a few snapshot images are generally needed to overcome the impact of astrophysical fluctuations and correctly infer the ring diameter. Inference becomes more challenging when analyzing the visibility amplitude in a baseline window that is not entirely dominated by a single photon ring. Nevertheless, in most cases, it is still possible to fit a ring shape with the correct fractional asymmetry. These results provide excellent prospects for future precision measurements of black hole spin and fundamental astrophysics via black hole imaging.</description>

      <title>A Narrow Uniform Core with a Wide Structured Wing: Modeling the TeV and Multi-wavelength Afterglows of GRB 221009A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12856v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The TeV afterglow of the BOAT GRB 221009A was interpreted as arising from a narrow jet while the radio to X-ray afterglows were interpreted as arising from a wide structured jet. However, there is no model explaining the TeV and lower-energy multi-wavelength afterglows simultaneously. We here investigate a two-component jet model, including a narrow uniform core with a wide structured wing, to explain both the multi-wavelength afterglows that last up to 100 days. We find that to explain the early TeV afterglow with the inverse-Compton process, we need a circum-burst density higher than $\gtrsim 0.1{\rm cm^{-3}}$, while the radio afterglow and the H.E.S.S. upper limit combine to constrain the density to be lower at larger radii. Thus, a decreasing density profile with radius is favored. Considering that the rising TeV light curve during the afterglow onset favors a constant-density medium, we invoke a stratified density profile, including a constant-density profile at small radii and a wind density profile at large radii. We find that the two-component jet model with such a stratified density profile can explain the TeV, X-ray and optical afterglows of GRB 221009A, although the radio fluxes exceed the observed ones by a factor of two at later epochs. The discrepancy in the radio afterglow could be resolved by invoking some non-standard assumption about the microphysics of afterglow shocks. The total kinetic energy of the two components in our model is $\lesssim 10^{52}{\rm erg}$, significantly smaller than that in the single structured jet models.</description>

      <title>Fast neutrino-flavor swap in high-energy astrophysical environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13842v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We assert that non-linear features of fast neutrino-flavor conversion (FFC) can be qualitatively different between core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) and binary neutron star mergers (BNSMs). This argument arises from recent global FFC simulations in BNSM, in which fast flavor swap (FFS) emerges in very narrow spatial regions, whereas neutrinos in CCSN tend to evolve towards flavor equipartition. In this {\it Letter}, we provide the physical mechanism of FFS based on a colliding neutrino beam model. Neutrinos/antineutrinos can undergo FFS when they propagate in ambient neutrino gas that propagates in the opposite direction and also has the opposite sign of ELN-XLN, where ELN and XLN denote electron- and heavy-leptonic neutrino number, respectively. Such environments can be naturally realized in BNSMs, whereas they are unlikely in CCSNe unless the neutrino sphere is strongly deformed aspherically. Our study exhibits the diversity of non-linear dynamics of FFC.</description>

      <title>A Shock Flash Breaking Out of a Dusty Red Supergiant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14409v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shock breakout emission is light that arises when a shockwave, generated by core-collapse explosion of a massive star, passes through its outer envelope. Hitherto, the earliest detection of such a signal was at several hours after the explosion, though a few others had been reported. The temporal evolution of early light curves should reveal insights into the shock propagation, including explosion asymmetry and environment in the vicinity, but this has been hampered by the lack of multiwavelength observations. Here we report the instant multiband observations of a type II supernova (SN 2023ixf) in the galaxy M101 (at a distance of 6.85+/-0.15 Mpc), beginning at about 1.4 hours after the explosion. The exploding star was a red supergiant with a radius of about 440 solar radii. The light curves evolved rapidly, on timescales of 1-2 hours, and appeared unusually fainter and redder than predicted by models within the first few hours, which we attribute to an optically thick dust shell before it was disrupted by the shockwave. We infer that the breakout and perhaps the distribution of the surrounding dust were not spherically symmetric.</description>

      <title>Low-frequency pulse-jitter measurement with the uGMRT I : PSR J0437$-$4715</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01875v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-precision pulsar timing observations are limited in their accuracy by the jitter noise that appears in the arrival time of pulses. Therefore, it is important to systematically characterise the amplitude of the jitter noise and its variation with frequency. In this paper, we provide jitter measurements from low-frequency wideband observations of PSR J0437$-$4715 using data obtained as part of the Indian Pulsar Timing Array experiment. We were able to detect jitter in both the 300 - 500 MHz and 1260 - 1460 MHz observations of the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT). The former is the first jitter measurement for this pulsar below 700 MHz, and the latter is in good agreement with results from previous studies. In addition, at 300 - 500 MHz, we investigated the frequency dependence of the jitter by calculating the jitter for each sub-banded arrival time of pulses. We found that the jitter amplitude increases with frequency. This trend is opposite as compared to previous studies, indicating that there is a turnover at intermediate frequencies. It will be possible to investigate this in more detail with uGMRT observations at 550 - 750 MHz and future high sensitive wideband observations from next generation telescopes, such as the Square Kilometre Array. We also explored the effect of jitter on the high precision dispersion measure (DM) measurements derived from short duration observations. We find that even though the DM precision will be better at lower frequencies due to the smaller amplitude of jitter noise, it will limit the DM precision for high signal-to-noise observations, which are of short durations. This limitation can be overcome by integrating for a long enough duration optimised for a given pulsar.</description>

      <title>Search for 10--1,000 GeV neutrinos from Gamma Ray Bursts with IceCube</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the results of a search for 10--1,000 GeV neutrinos from 2,268 gamma-ray bursts over 8 years of IceCube-DeepCore data. This work probes burst physics below the photosphere where electromagnetic radiation cannot escape. Neutrinos of tens of GeVs are predicted in sub-photospheric collision of free streaming neutrons with bulk-jet protons. In a first analysis, we searched for the most significant neutrino-GRB coincidence using six overlapping time windows centered on the prompt phase of each GRB. In a second analysis, we conducted a search for a group of GRBs, each individually too weak to be detectable, but potentially significant when combined. No evidence of neutrino emission is found for either analysis. The most significant neutrino coincidence is for Fermi-GBM GRB bn 140807500, with a p-value of 0.097 corrected for all trials. The binomial test used to search for a group of GRBs had a p-value of 0.65 after all trial corrections. The binomial test found a group consisting only of GRB bn 140807500 and no additional GRBs. The neutrino limits of this work complement those obtained by IceCube at TeV to PeV energies. We compare our findings for the large set of GRBs as well as GRB 221009A to the sub-photospheric neutron-proton collision model and find that GRB 221009A provides the most constraining limit on baryon loading. For a jet Lorentz factor of 300 (800), the baryon loading on GRB 221009A is lower than 3.85 (2.13) at a 90% confidence level.</description>

      <title>Timing and Spectral Analysis of HMXB 4U 1700-37 Observed with Insight-HXMT</title>

Abstract: We report timing and spectral studies of the high mass X-ray binary 4U 1700-37 using Insight-HXMT observations carried out in 2020 during its out-of-eclipse state. We found significant variations in flux on a time-scale of kilo-seconds, while the hardness (count rate ratio between 10-30 keV and 2-10 keV) remains relatively stable. No evident pulsations were found over a frequency range of $10^{-3}$-2000 Hz. During the spectral analysis, for the first time we took the configuration of different Insight-HXMT detectors' orientations into account, which allows us obtaining reliable results even if a stable contamination exists in the field-of-view. We found that the spectrum could be well described by some phenomenological models that commonly used in accreting pulsars (e.g., a power law with a high energy cutoff) in the energy range of 2-100 keV. We found hints of cyclotron absorption features around ~ 16 keV or/and ~ 50 keV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We search for MeV gamma-ray emission between 0.75-30 MeV from five galaxy clusters, viz. Coma, VIRGO, SPT-CL J2012-5649, Bullet, and El Gordo, using archival data from the COMPTEL telescope. For this purpose we use three search templates: point source, radial disk and radial Gaussian. We do not detect any signals from Coma, SPT-CL J2012-5649, Bullet and El Gordo clusters with the 95\% c.l. photon energy flux limit $\sim 10^{-10} ~\rm{erg /cm^2/s} $. For VIRGO, we detect a non-zero signal between 0.92 to 1.63 MeV having marginal significance of about $2.5\sigma$, with the observed energy flux $ \sim 10^{-9}~\rm{ergs/cm^2/s}$. However, we do not confirm the previously reported evidence in literature for a gamma-ray line from Coma and VIRGO clusters between 5-7 MeV.</description>

      <title>A Transition Discovered in the Subcritical Regime of 1A 0535+262</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15429v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present NICER observations of accreting X-ray pulsar 1A 0535+262 during its faint state ($\lesssim 6\times10^{36}$ erg/s) observed in several type I and II outbursts. We discovered a transition of temporal and spectral properties around the luminosity $L_{\rm t}=3.3\times10^{35}$ erg/s, below which spectra are relatively soft and the pulse profiles have only a narrow peak. The spectra are harder and a secondary hump gradually appears in pulse profiles when $L \gtrsim L_{\rm t}$. We discuss possible physical mechanisms for this transition, including different Comptonization seed photons, the disappearance of gas shocks on the neutron star surface, and the combination of plasma and vacuum polarization effects.</description>

      <title>Observational imprints of gravastars from accretion disks and hot-spots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07766v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze the observational properties of thin-shell gravastars under two astrophysical frameworks, namely surrounded by optically-thin accretion disks and orbited by hot-spots. We consider the thin-shell gravastar model with two free parameters, the gravastar radius and ratio of mass allocated at the thin-shell, and produce the corresponding observables via the use of numerical backwards ray-tracing codes. Regarding the observations of accretion disks, our results indicate that, due to the absence of a strong gravitational redshift effect, smooth gravastar configurations cannot reproduce shadow observations when internal emission is assumed. We thus expect such models to be excluded as candidates for supermassive objects in galactic cores. Nevertheless, thin-shell gravastars with a large portion of their total mass allocated at the surface can produce such an effect and are thus adequate candidates for black-hole mimickers. In the context of hot-spot orbits, the astrometrical observational properties of ultra-compact gravastars resemble closely those of other ultra-compact objects e.g. fluid stars and bosonic stars. However, for low-compacticity configurations, the time-integrated fluxes feature additional contributions in the form of a high-intensity plunge through image. These qualitative differences in the observational properties of gravastars in comparison with black-hole spacetimes could potentially be discriminated by the next generation of interferometric experiments in gravitational physics.</description>

      <title>Compact Objects in close orbits as Gravitational Wave Sources: Formation Scenarios and Properties</title>

Abstract: Gravitational Waves (GWs) provide a unique way to explore our Universe. The ongoing ground-based detectors, e.g., LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA, and the upcoming next-generation detectors, e.g., Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope, as well as the future space-borne GW antennas, e.g., LISA, TianQin, and TaiJi, cover a wide range of GW frequencies {from $\sim 10^{-4}\;\rm Hz$ to $\sim 10^3\;\rm Hz$} and almost all types of compact objects in close orbits serve as the potential target sources for these GW detectors. The synergistic multi-band GW and EM observations would allow us to study fundamental physics from stars to cosmology. {The formation of stellar GW sources has been extensively explored in recent years, and progress on physical processes in binary interaction has been made as well. Furthermore, some studies have shown that the progress in binary evolution may significantly affect the properties of the stellar GW sources.}</description>

      <title>More on Black Holes Perceiving the Dark Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19604</link>

Abstract: In the last two years the dark dimension scenario has emerged as focal point of many research interests. In particular, it functions as a stepping stone to address the cosmological hierarchy problem and provides a colosseum for dark matter contenders. We reexamine the possibility that primordial black holes (PBHs) perceiving the dark dimension could constitute all of the dark matter in the universe. We re-assess limits on the abundance of PBHs as dark matter candidates from $\gamma$-ray emission resulting from Hawking evaporation. We re-evaluate constraints from the diffuse $\gamma$-ray emission in the direction of the Galactic center which offer the best and most solid upper limits on the dark matter fraction composed of PBHs. The revised mass range which allows PBHs to assemble all cosmological dark matter is estimated to be $10^{15} \alt M_{\rm BH}/{\rm g} \alt 10^{21}$. We demonstrate that due to the constraints from $\gamma$-ray emission, quantum corrections due to the speculative memory burden effect do not modify this mass range. We also investigate the main characteristics of PBHs which are localized in the bulk. We show that PBHs localized in the bulk can make all cosmological dark matter if $10^{11} \alt M_{\rm BH}/{\rm g} \alt 10^{21}$. Finally, we comment on the black holes that could be produced if one advocates a space with two boundaries for the dark dimension.</description>
