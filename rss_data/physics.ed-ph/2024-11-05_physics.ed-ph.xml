      <title>Material Girl Launch Report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Material Girl was a two-stage sounding rocket designed and flown during the 2022-2023 academic year. Weighing a total of 197 lbs and measuring 176 inches in length, the vehicle incorporated many improvements from the team's previous rocket, Mr. Blue Sky.
  The rocket used a Student Researched and Developed (SRAD) P-class motor on each stage, a mechanical staging system, and recovery systems for the booster, sustainer, and nose cone. Flight events were controlled by a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) avionics flight computer, with a custom flight computer carried as a payload. The motor grain geometry and fin dimensions were optimized using an in-house software developed from RASAero and RocketPy.</description>

      <title>AI Support Meets AR Visualization for Alice and Bob: Personalized Learning Based on Individual ChatGPT Feedback in an AR Quantum Cryptography Experiment for Physics Lab Courses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum cryptography is a central topic in the quantum technology field that is particularly important for secure communication. The training of qualified experts in this field is necessary for continuous development. However, the abstract and complex nature of quantum physics makes the topic difficult to understand. Augmented reality (AR) allows otherwise invisible abstract concepts to be visualized and enables interactive learning, offering significant potential for improving quantum physics education in university lab courses. In addition, personalized feedback on challenging concepts can facilitate learning, and large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT can effectively deliver such feedback. This study combines these two aspects and explores the impact of an AR-based quantum cryptography experiment with integrated ChatGPT-based feedback on university students' learning outcomes and cognitive processes. The study involved 38 students in a physics laboratory course at a German university and used four open-ended questions to measure learning outcomes and gaze data as a learning process assessment. Statistical analysis was used to compare scores between feedback and non-feedback questions, and the effect of ChatGPT feedback on eye-tracking data was examined. The results show that ChatGPT feedback significantly improved learning outcomes and affected gaze data. While the feedback on conceptual questions tended to direct attention to the visualizations of the underlying model, the feedback on questions about experimental procedures increased visual attention to the real experimental materials. Overall, the results show that AI-based feedback draws visual attention towards task-relevant factors and increases learning performance in general.</description>

      <title>Exploring the MBTI distribution among Chinese undergraduate physics students: the influence of family income on career trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigated the distribution of MBTI personality types among physics undergraduates at Zhejiang University and analyzed their career aspirations, family income and mental health status. A comprehensive survey of 68 questions, including 52 multiple-choice questions and 16 short-answer questions, assessed various personality traits and their correlation with academic intent and emotional state. The results showed that INTJ and INTP personality types showed the most significant tendency to pursue academic research. They usually come from middle and above-class backgrounds. Notably, these two personality types accounted for about 41\% of the total surveyed population, while NT types combined accounted for about 58\%. This indicates that although NT personality is more suitable for academic research, students with introverted tendencies are more suitable. Research has further shown that people with ISTJ personalities often exhibit unexpectedly strong academic interests. In addition, individuals who aspire to enter academia generally maintain a stable state of mind, as evidenced by their consistent work efficiency in the face of personal challenges. Interestingly, although some aspiring academics come from financially stable families, most have encountered financial constraints. These results contribute to a deeper understanding of how personality traits and socioeconomic factors influence the academic career paths of physics students.</description>

      <title>Astronomical outreach and education in marginalised and indigenous communities: astronomy as a tool for social development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The way we look at the sky is connected to the cosmological paradigm embraced by the society we live in. On the other hand, several astronomical concepts reinforce the idea of a common humanity. Yet, scientific outreach is frequenty reaching out only to a specific part of the world population, often excluding people living in extreme social vulnerability, victims of violence and prejudice, fighting for their lives and for the right of living according to their traditions. We present two outreach projects, developed in Brazil, funded by the Office of Astronomy for Development (OAD) of the International Astronomical Union (IAU), i.e. 'Under Other Skies' and 'OruMbya', which tackle the importance of ethno-astronomy, and the collaboration with leaders and cultural agents of marginalised communities. We also describe an educational project born in the favela of Cantagalo Pav\~ao Pava\~azinho (PPG), in Rio de Janeiro, during the COVID19 pandemic, which started a collaboration with local educators and artists to offer classes of astronomy and English language to children in the favela</description>

      <title>La Serena School for Data Science and the Spanish Virtual Observatory Schools: Initiatives Based on Hands on Experience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The worlds of Data Science (including big and/or federated data, machine learning, etc) and Astrophysics started merging almost two decades ago. For instance, around 2005, international initiatives such as the Virtual Observatory framework rose to standardize the way we publish and transfer data, enabling new tools such as VOSA (SED Virtual Observatory Analyzer) to come to existence and remain relevant today. More recently, new facilities like the Vera Rubin Observatory, serve as motivation to develop efficient and extremely fast (very often deep learning based) methodologies in order to fully exploit the informational content of the vast Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) dataset. However, fundamental changes in the way we explore and analyze data cannot permeate in the "astrophysical sociology and idiosyncrasy" without adequate training. In this talk, I will focus on one specific initiative that has been extremely successful and is based on "learning by doing": the La Serena School for Data Science. I will also briefly touch on a different successful approach: a series of schools organized by the Spanish Virtual Observatory. The common denominator among the two kinds of schools is to present the students with real scientific problems that benefit from the concepts / methodologies taught. On the other hand, the demographics targeted by both initiatives vary significantly and can represent examples of two "flavours" to be followed by others.</description>

      <title>Predictors and Socio-Demographic Disparities in STEM Degree Outcomes: A UK Longitudinal Study using Hierarchical Logistic Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05853v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Socio-demographic disparities in STEM degree outcomes impact the diversity of the UK's future workforce, particularly in fields essential for innovation and growth. Despite the importance of institution-level, longitudinal analyses in understanding degree awarding gaps, detailed multivariate and hierarchical analyses remain limited within the UK context. This study addresses this gap by using a multivariate binary logistic model with random intercepts for STEM subjects to analyse predictors of first-class degree outcomes using a nine-year dataset (2014 to 2022) from a research-intensive Russell Group university. We find that prior academic attainment, ethnicity, gender, socioeconomic status, disability, age, and course duration are significant predictors of achieving a first-class degree, with Average Marginal Effects calculated to provide insight into probability differences across these groups. Key findings reveal that Black students face a significantly lower likelihood of achieving first-class degrees compared to White students, with an average 16 percent lower probability, while students graduating from 4-year degree programmes have an average 24 percent higher probability of achieving a first-class degree relative to those on 3-year programmes. Although male students received a higher proportion of first-class degrees overall, our multivariate hierarchical model shows higher odds for female students, underscoring the importance of model choice when quantifying awarding gaps. Baseline odds for first-class outcomes rose considerably from 2016, peaking in 2021, indicating possible grade inflation during the COVID-19 pandemic. Interaction effects between socio-demographic variables and graduation year indicate stability in ethnicity, disability, and socioeconomic awarding gaps but reveal a declining advantage for female students over time.</description>
