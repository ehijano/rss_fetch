      <title>Engineering Point Defects in MoS2 for Tailored Material Properties using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tunability of physical properties in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) through point defect engineering offers significant potential for the development of next-generation optoelectronic and high-tech applications. Building upon prior work on machine learning-driven material design, this study focuses on the systematic introduction and manipulation of point defects in MoS2 to tailor their properties. Leveraging a comprehensive dataset generated via density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we explore the effects of various defect types and concentrations on the mate rial characteristics of TMDCs. Our methodology integrates the use of pre-trained large language models to generate defect configurations, enabling efficient predictions of defect-induced property modifications. This research differs from traditional methods of material generation and discovery by utilizing the latest advances in transformer model architecture, which have proven to be efficient and accurate discrete predictors. In contrast to high-throughput methods where configurations are generated randomly and then screened based on their physical properties, our approach not only enhances the understanding of defect-property relationships in TMDCs but also provides a robust framework for designing materials with bespoke properties. This facilitates the advancement of materials science and technology.</description>

      <title>Role of interface mixing on coherent heat conduction in periodic and aperiodic superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superlattices (SLs) can induce phonon coherence through the periodic layering of two or more materials, enabling tailored thermal transport properties. While most theoretical studies assume atomically sharp, perfect interfaces, real SLs often feature atomic interdiffusion spanning approximately a single atomic layer or more. Such interface mixing can significantly influence phonon coherence and transport behavior. In this study, we employ atomistic wave-packet simulations to systematically investigate the effects of interface mixing on coherent heat conduction. Our analysis identifies two competing mechanisms that govern phonon transport across mixed interfaces: (1) Interface mixing disrupts coherent mode-conversion effects arising from the interface arrangement. (2) The disorder enhances the potential for interference events, generating additional coherent phonon transport pathways. The second mechanism enhances the transmission of Bragg-reflected modes in periodic SLs and most phonons in aperiodic SLs, which otherwise lack coherent mode-conversion in perfect structures. Conversely, the first mechanism dominates in periodic SLs for non-Bragg-reflected modes, where transmission is already high due to substantial mode-conversion. These findings provide insights into the interplay between interface imperfections and phonon coherence.</description>

      <title>Photo-induced spall failure of (111) twist grain boundaries in Ni bicrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spall failure, a complex failure mechanism driven by tensile stress wave interactions, has been extensively studied in single-crystal FCC metals, revealing a precursor stage involving dislocation emission along closed-packed directions. Here we investigate the photo-induced spall failure of Ni bicrystals under a two-pulse laser configuration, exploring various misorientation angles through two-temperature molecular dynamics (MD) simulations including electronic effects to simulate light-matter interaction. Our findings demonstrate that light-matter interactions can induce spall failure at the sample center, similar to conventional plate-impact methods, when two laser-pulses are applied to the front and back surfaces of the sample. The study reveals the significant influence of misorientation angles on dislocation activity and spall behavior, where grain boundaries (GBs) play pivotal roles, either promoting or impeding dislocation interactions. Furthermore, our work highlights the potential for enhancing spall resistance by tailoring materials through misorientation angle variation.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Modeling of Point Defects in $\beta$-Ga2O3 Combining Hybrid Functional Energetics with Semiconductor and Processes Thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: B-gallium oxide (B-Ga2O3) is of high interest for power electronics because of its unique combination of melt growth, epitaxial growth, n-type dopability, ultrawide bandgap, and high critical field. Optimization of crystal growth processes to promote beneficial defects and suppress harmful ones requires accurate quantitative modelling of both native and impurity defects. Here we quantitatively model defect concentrations as a function of bulk crystal growth conditions and demonstrate the necessity of including effects such as bandgap temperature dependence, chemical potentials from thermochemistry, and defect vibrational entropy in modelling based on defect formation energies computed by density functional theory (DFT) with hybrid functionals. Without these contributions, grossly-erroneous and misleading predictions arise, e.g. that n-type doping attempts would be fully compensated by Ga vacancies. Including these effects reproduces the experimental facts that melt-grown Sn-doped B-Ga2O3 crystals are conductive with small compensation while annealing the same crystals in O2 at intermediate temperatures renders them insulating. To accomplish this modeling, we developed a comprehensive modelling framework (KROGER) based on calculated defect formation energies and flexible thermodynamic conditions. These capabilities allow KROGER to capture full and partial defect equilibria amongst native defects and impurities occurring during specific semiconductor growth or fabrication processes. We use KROGER to model 873 charge-states of 259 defects involving 19 elements in conditions representing bulk crystal growth by edge-fed growth (EFG) and annealing in O2. Our methodology is transferrable to a wide range of materials beyond B-Ga2O3. Integration of thermodynamic and first-principles modelling of point defects provides insight into optimization of point defect populations in growth and processing.</description>

      <title>Chiral Altermagnon in MnTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnetism has surfaced as a novel magnetic phase, bridging the properties of ferro- and anti-ferromagnetism. The momentum-dependent spin-splitting observed in these materials reflects their unique symmetry characteristics which also establish the conditions for chiral magnons to emerge. Here we provide the first direct experimental evidence for a chiral magnon in the altermagnetic candidate MnTe, revealed by circular-dichroism resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (CD-RIXS). This mode which we term chiral altermagnon exhibits a distinct momentum dependence consistent with the proposed altermagnetic $g-$wave symmetry of MnTe. Our results reveal a new class of magnetic excitations, demonstrating how altermagnetic order shapes spin dynamics and paves the way for advances in spintronic and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Effect of metal (Ti) interlayer on fracture toughness of TiN thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Titanium Nitride (TiN) is widely used as a protective coating due to its high hardness, but suffers from inherent brittleness and low fracture toughness, limiting its applicability. The layering of Titanium Nitride films with metallic Titanium (Ti) improves the overall fracture behavior of system by modifying the crack driving force due to elastic-plastic mismatch between the layers. Microcantilever fracture tests were carried out on bilayer (Ti-TiN, TiN-Ti) and trilayer (Ti-TiN-Ti) systems to determine the fracture toughness and study the fundamental crack growth behavior. The initiation fracture toughness in bilayer system with crack in Ti layer is almost 70% higher when compared to crack in TiN layer. In Ti-TiN bilayer the crack propagated catastrophically post linear elastic deformation, whereas the crack was arrested at the TiN/Ti interface in both TiN-Ti and Ti-TiN-Ti systems due to plastic energy dissipation in the Ti layer. Incorpration of crack tip plasticity due to the metallic layer increased the total resistance to fracture by around eight times compared to the Ti-TiN bilayer.</description>

      <title>Unusual temperature dependence of the band structure associated with local atomic distortion in monolayer 1T'-WTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ground state of monolayer 1T'-WTe2 has been a target of intensive debate on whether or not it is a two-dimensional topological insulator (2D TI) associated with exciton formation. We investigated the band structure of an epitaxial monolayer 1T'-WTe2 film grown on graphene/SiC(0001) in a wide temperature range of T = 40 - 400 K by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). We observed an electron band above the Fermi level (EF) slightly away from the {\Gamma} point, together with four hole bands below EF just at the {\Gamma} point. This signifies an indirect band gap exceeding 0.1 eV in support of the 2D-TI phase with the inverted band structure. We uncovered an unexpectedly large downward shift of valence bands upon cooling, accompanied with an upward shift of the conduction band. Comparison of the ARPES-derived band structure with first-principles band calculations suggests that the observed band shift is ascribed to the systematic local atomic distortion of tungsten atoms, which should be incorporated into the interpretation of unusual transport properties of 1T'-WTe2.</description>

      <title>Mechanism of Oleic Acid-Mediated Sulfur Vacancy Healing in monolayer WS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We uncover the mechanism behind the enhancement of photoluminescence yield in monolayer WS$_2$ through oleic acid treatment, a promising scalable strategy for defect healing. By inducing sulfur vacancies through thermal treatment and monitoring the changes in photoluminescence yield and emission spectra, we demonstrate that oleic acid heals the sulfur vacancy by providing substitutional oxygen. Using density functional theory calculations, we provide insight into the underlying mechanism governing the oleic acid-mediated sulfur vacancy healing process. Our findings suggest that effective defect passivation by oxygen doping can be achieved through chemical treatment, opening a pathway for oxygen doping in transition metal dichalcogenides. However, we also highlight the limitations of chemical treatment, which may only lead to small increases in photoluminescence yield beyond a certain point.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Observation of Non-Ergodic States in Two-Dimensional Non-Topological Bubble Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disordered 2D lattices, including hexatic and various glassy states, are observed in a wide range of 2D systems including colloidal nanoparticle assemblies and fluxon lattices. Their disordered nature determines the stability and mobility of these systems, as well as their response to the external stimuli. Here we report on the controlled creation and characterization of a disordered 2D lattice of non-topological magnetic bubbles in the non-centrosymmetric ferrimagnetic alloy Mn$_{1.4}$PtSn. By analyzing the type and frequency of fundamental lattice defects, such as dislocations, the orientational correlation, as well as the induced motion of the lattice in an external field, a non-ergodic glassy state, stabilized by directional application of an external field, is revealed.</description>

      <title>Effect of bismuth crystal orientations in Nernst thermomagnetic devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we report Nernst effect measurements in single crystal bismuth samples, with special emphasis on the characterization of the Nernst coefficient when the magnetic field, heat current and generated voltage are aligned along specific directions relative to the crystal axes. We found significant differences between the different orientations, reflecting the highly anisotropic electronic structure of bismuth and compatible with the Nernst characteristics obtained from polycrystalline samples. These results not only complement the experimental works published in the past but also underline the role of crystalline orientation in the context of transverse thermoelectric effects, towards an efficient design of thermomagnetic devices like the ordinary-Nernst-effect-based energy harvesters.</description>

      <title>Flexoelectricity causes surface piezoelectric-like effects in dielectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the surface effects that bulk flexoelectric models in finite samples exhibit. We first show that when the body is infinite, flexoelectric materials do not exhibit electromechanical response under homogeneous loading. However, when the size of the body is finite, due to the symmetry-breaking nature of surfaces, homogeneous loading (mechanical or electrical) can cause an electromechanical response near the surfaces. We obtain closed-form solutions for finite samples under different electromechanical loading conditions, and show that the electromechanical response caused by the bulk flexoelectric effect is reminiscent of surface piezoelectricity, causing boundary layers in certain components of the strains and/or electric fields near the free surfaces.</description>

      <title>Thermal properties revisited in displacive ferroelectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The collective amplitude mode of the order parameter in displacive ferroelectrics, termed the ferron, represents the amplitude fluctuations of long-range ordered polarization. At temperatures well below phase transition temperature $T_c$, the energy of ferron excitation is significantly gapped in the long-wavelength limit. As $T_c$ is approached, this gap softens dramatically to minimal or gapless values, thereby should lead to a substantial contribution to thermal properties. In this context, we explore the role of ferrons in heat capacity and thermal transport by incorporating a microscopic self-consistent phase-transition theory for displacive ferroelectricity in contrast to the conventional treatment of attributing thermal properties solely to acoustic phonons. Using ferroelectric $\rm{PbTiO}_{3}$ as a case study, we show that the softening of ferrons near the phase transition is essential to accurately capturing the experimental temperature and electric-field dependencies of thermal properties.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Symmetry Instability induced by Topological Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The symmetry-topology interplay dictates how to define order parameters and classify material ordered phases. However, current understanding of this interplay has been predominately approached from a one-sided perspective, with topological states being classified within the constraints imposed by specific fixed symmetries. Here we complete this full circle by demonstrating spontaneous symmetry breaking that results from a periodic alteration of topological phases induced by light in a centrosymmetric Dirac material ZrTe$_5$. The distinguishing feature is the observation of robust correlation and striking anomalies in the fluence and temperature dependence of key transport parameters.First, both shift current $J_{\text{s}}$ and displacement current $J_{\text{d}}$, arising from interband transition and infrared phonon driving, respectively, along with charge carrier pumping, exhibit similar behaviors. Second, they all peak at similar low pump fluence, followed by a subsequent reduction as the fluence further increases. This behavior cannot be explained by conventional energetically allowed, direct excitations. Third, all the three observables exhibit anomalies when they approach the topological phase transition temperature. These results highlight the unique low-energy pumping behaviors in ZrTe$_5$, characterized by reversible fluence dependence and a 'hinge-like' interaction that connects various electronic and lattice observables, including phonons, charge carriers, and currents. Our findings, supported by model analysis, provide key insights into the fragility of crystalline (inversion) and time-reversal symmetries during the dynamics of topological phase transitions. This fragility drives spontaneous symmetry breaking, evidenced by the synchronized emergence of off-resonant infrared phonons and broken-symmetry photocurrents.</description>

      <title>Study of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein by Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy and Transmission Electron Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spike protein (SP) of SARS-CoV-2 is the major molecular target for making diagnostic tests, vaccines, and therapeutic development. We used a combination of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and surface enhanced Raman microscopy (SERS) to study its structure. Using SERS on an aluminum substrate, we were able to detect a characteristic spectrum of SP mostly due to vibration of three aromatic amino acids producing Raman shifts at 466 cm-1, 524 cm-1, 773 cm-1, 831 cm-1, 1048 cm-1, 1308 cm-1, 1457 cm-1, and 1610 cm-1. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) of the SP showed periodic 2D-lattice orientation. The findings from this study have translational values for developing surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) based detectors for screening and testing SARS-CoV-2 signatures in diagnostic settings and contamination tracking.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconductivity in doped SrTiO$_3$ was discovered in 1964, the first superconducting transition observed in a doped semiconductor. However, the mechanism behind electron pairing in SrTiO$_3$ remains a subject of debate. By developing a theoretical framework to incorporate dynamical lattice screening in the electronic Coulomb interactions of semiconductors and insulators, we demonstrate analytically that long-range electron-phonon interactions described by a generalized multi-phonon Fr\"ohlich mechanism result in phonon-mediated electron-electron attraction in SrTiO$_3$. Moreover, by combining our theory with first-principles calculations, we reveal an additional attractive interaction between electrons in SrTiO$_3$ due to the deformation potential mechanism, arising from the mixed ionic-covalent character of the Ti-O bond. Our results may have implications for the emergence of phonon-mediated electron attraction and superconductivity in a broader range of materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17340v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study demonstrates that two-dimensional talc, a naturally abundant mineral, supports hyperbolic phonon-polaritons (HPhPs) at mid-infrared wavelengths, thus offering a low-cost alternative to synthetic polaritonic materials. Using scattering scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM) and synchrotron infrared nano spectroscopy (SINS), we reveal tunable HPhP modes in talc flakes of a long lifetime. These results highlight the potential of natural 2D talc crystals to constituting an effective platform for establishing scalable optoelectronic and photonic devices.</description>

      <title>High-field Breakdown and Thermal Characterization of Indium Tin Oxide Transistors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Amorphous oxide semiconductors are gaining interest for logic and memory transistors compatible with low-temperature fabrication. However, their low thermal conductivity and heterogeneous interfaces suggest that their performance may be severely limited by self-heating, especially at higher power and device densities. Here, we investigate the high-field breakdown of amorphous indium tin oxide (ITO) transistors with scanning thermal microscopy (SThM) and multiphysics simulations. The ITO devices break irreversibly at channel temperatures of ~180 {\deg}C and ~340 {\deg}C on SiO${_2}$ and HfO${_2}$ substrates, respectively, but failure appears primarily caused by thermally-induced compressive strain near the device contacts. Combining SThM measurements with simulations allows us to estimate a thermal boundary conductance (TBC) of 35 ${\pm}$ 12 MWm${^-}$${^2}$K${^-}$${^1}$ for ITO on SiO${_2}$, and 51 ${\pm}$ 14 MWm${^-}$${^2}$K${^-}$${^1}$ for ITO on HfO${_2}$. The latter also enables significantly higher breakdown power due to better heat dissipation and closer thermal expansion matching. These findings provide valuable insights into the thermo-mechanical limitations of ITO devices, paving the way for more reliable and high-performance amorphous oxide transistors.</description>

Abstract: We selectively fabricated monolayers of octahedral (1H) and distorted trigonal (1T') WTe2 on graphene/SiC(0001) by controlling the substrate temperature during epitaxy. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, combined with first-principles band-structure calculations, has revealed several drastic differences between these two polymorphs. The 1T' phase exhibits a semiconducting character with a nearly-zero energy gap, while the 1H phase shows a large band gap and the band splitting at the K/K' point. The present results pave a pathway toward developing nanoelectronic devices based with WTe2.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Raman scattering in layered AgCrP$_2$Se$_6$: Helical modes and excitation energy-dependent intensities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Structural anisotropy in layered two-dimensional materials can lead to highly anisotropic optical absorption which, in turn, can profoundly a^ect their phonon modes. These e^ects include lattice orientation-dependent and excitation energy-dependent mode intensities that can enable new phononic and optoelectronic applications. Here, we report anomalous Raman spectra in single-crystalline AgCrP$_2$Se$_6$, a layered antiferromagnetic material. Density functional theory calculations and experimental measurements reveal several unique features in the Raman spectra of bulk and exfoliated AgCrP$_2$Se$_6$ crystals including three helical vibrational modes. These modes exhibit large Raman optical activities (circular intensity di^erences) in bulk AgCrP$_2$Se$_6$, which progressively decrease with thickness. We also observe strong excitation energy dependent peak intensities as well as a decrease in anti-Stokes peak intensities at room temperature with increasing excitation energy, resulting in an apparent cooling by up to 220 K. All of these anomalies in bulk and exfoliated flakes are attributed to the unique ABC layer stacking structure of AgCrP$_2$Se$_6$ and to the smaller unit cell volume that causes hybridization between the Se and Ag/Cr electron densities, resulting in charge transfer and strongly a^ecting the electron-phonon coupling. This work thus positions AgCrP$_2$Se$_6$ as an exciting new 2D material for optical and phononic applications.</description>

      <title>Bulk superconductivity in pressurized trilayer nickelate Pr4Ni3O10 single crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity in pressurized bilayer and trilayer nickelates have generated significant interest. However, their superconducting properties are often dependent on sample quality and pressure conditions, complicating the interpretation of the underlying physics. Finding new systems with optimized bulk superconducting properties is therefore important for advancing our understanding of these materials. Unlike cupates, where trilayer compounds typically exhibit the highest transition temperature (Tc), the bilayer nickelate La3Ni2O7 has thus far outperformed the trilayer La4Ni3O10 in reported Tc. Whether the trilayer nickelates have achieved the optimal Tc remains unclear, with various scenarios suggesting different possibilities. Here, we report the discovery of bulk superconductivity in pressurized Pr4Ni3O10 single crystals, achieving a maximum onset Tc of 40.5 K at 80.1 GPa, significantly exceeding the 30 K observed in La4Ni3O10. The bulk nature of superconductivity is confirmed by zero resistance and a strong diamagnetic response bellow Tc with a superconducting volume fraction exceeding 80%. These findings establish trilayer nickelates as genuine bulk high-temperature superconductors, provide new insights into the mechanisms driving superconductivity, and point to a promising route toward further enhancing superconducting properties in nickelates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite advances in soft, sticker_like electronics, few efforts have dealt with the challenge of electronic waste. Here, this is addressed by introducing an eco friendly conductive ink for thin_film circuitry composed of silver flakes and a water_based polyurethane dispersion. This ink uniquely combines high electrical conductivity (1.6 x 105 S m_1), high resolution digital printability, robust adhesion for microchip integration, mechanical resilience, and recyclability. Recycling is achieved with an ecologically friendly processing method to decompose the circuits into constituent elements and recover the conductive ink with a decrease of only 2.4 per cent in conductivity. Moreover, adding liquid metal enables stretchability of up to 200 per cent strain, although this introduces the need for more complex recycling steps. Finally, on_skin electrophysiological monitoring biostickers along with a recyclable smart package with integrated sensors for monitoring safe storage of perishable foods are demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of self-dual kagome metamaterials and the emergence of fragile topology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.02746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent years have seen the discovery of systems featuring fragile topological states. These states of matter lack certain protection attributes typically associated with topology and are therefore characterized by weaker signatures that make them elusive to observe. Moreover, they are typically confined to special symmetry classes and, in general, rarely studied in the context of phononic media. In this Letter, we theoretically predict the emergence of fragile topological bands in the spectrum of a twisted kagome elastic lattice with three-fold rotational symmetry, in the so-called self-dual configuration. A necessary requirement is that the lattice is a structural metamaterial, in which the role of the hinges is played by elastic finite-thickness ligaments. The interplay between the edge modes appearing in the bandgaps bounding the fragile topological states is also responsible for the emergence of corner modes at selected corners of a finite hexagonal domain, which qualifies the lattice as a second-order topological insulator. We demonstrate our findings through a series of experiments via 3D Scanning Laser Doppler Vibrometry conducted on a physical prototype. The selected configuration stands out for its remarkable geometric simplicity and ease of physical implementation in the panorama of dynamical systems exhibiting fragile topology.</description>

Abstract: Magnetic Bloch points (BPs) are highly confined magnetization configurations, that often occur in transient spin dynamics processes. However, opposing chiralities of adjacent layers for instance in a FeGe bilayer stack can stabilize such magnetic BPs at the layer interface. These BPs configurations are metastable and consist of two coupled vortices (one in each layer) with same circularity and opposite polarity. Each vortex is stabilized by opposite sign Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. This stabilization mechanism potentially opens the door towards BP-based spintronic applications. An open question, from a methodological point of view, is whether the Heisenberg (HB) model approach (atomistic model) as to be used to study such systems or if the -- computationally more efficient -- micromagnetic (MM) models can be used and still obtain robust results. We are modelling and comparing the energetics and dynamics of a stable BP obtained using both HB and MM approaches. We find that an MM description of a stable BP leads qualitatively to the same results as the HB description, and that an appropriate mesh discretization plays a more important role than the chosen model. Further, we study the dynamics by shifting the BP with an applied in-plane field and investigating the relaxation after switching the filed off abruptly. The precessional motion of coupled vortices in a BP state can be drastically reduced compared to a classical vortex, which may be also an interesting feature for fast and efficient devices. A recent study has shown that a bilayer stack hosting BPs can be used to retain information [1].</description>

Abstract: The measurement and manipulation of the coherent dynamics of excitonic states constitute a forefront research challenge in semiconductor optics and in quantum coherence-based protocols for optoelectronic technologies. Layered semiconductors have emerged as an ideal platform for the study of exciton dynamics with accessible and technologically relevant energy and time scales. Here, we investigate the sub-picosecond exciton dynamics in a van-der-Waals semiconductor upon quasi-resonant excitation, and achieve to single out an incipient coherent excitonic state. Combining broadband transient reflectance spectroscopy and simulations based on many-body perturbation theory, we reveal a transient enhancement of the excitonic line intensity that originates from the photoinduced coherent polarization that is phase-locked with the interacting electromagnetic field. This finding allows us to define the spectral signature of a coherent excitonic state and to experimentally track the dynamical crossover from coherent to incoherent exciton, unlocking the prospective optical control of an exciton population on the intrinsic quantum-coherence timescale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: So-called fragile topological states of matter challenge our conventional notion of topology by lacking the robustness typically associated with topological protection, thereby displaying elusive manifestations that are difficult to harness for wave control. In this Letter, we leverage the recent discovery of fragile topological states in special classes of structural kagome lattices to document the availability of domain wall elastic wave modes that are directly traceable to fragile topology and, yet, exhibit remarkably strong signatures that support omni-directionality. We design twisted kagome bi-domains comprising two topologically distinct sublattices - one trivial and the other fragile topological - sharing a common bandgap and meeting at a domain wall. The two phases are achieved via carefully engineered surface cut patterns that modify the band landscape of the underlying lattices in complementary fashions, leading to dichotomous irreps landscapes. Under these circumstances, a domain wall-bound mode emerges within the shared bandgap and displays remarkable stability against domain wall orientation and introduced defects. We corroborate these findings via $\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{p}$ Hamiltonian and Jackiw-Rabbi analysis and validate them experimentally through laser vibrometry tests on a prototype endowed with water jet-induced perforation patterns.</description>

Abstract: The twisted kagome family comprises a spectrum of configurations that can be realized through the sweep of a single configurational degree of freedom known as a twist angle. Recently, it was shown that certain pairs of configurations along this sweep were linked by duality transformations and displayed matching phonon spectra. In this work, we introduce an intercell-connection system that spreads the lattice in the dimension orthogonal to the tessellation plane. The resulting three-dimensional character of the lattice allows us to sweep the entirety of the twist-angle spectrum, including all the compact configurations featuring overlapping triangles that, in a strictly two-dimensional space, are forbidden. Duality provides precious guidance for interpreting the availability of floppy mechanisms arising in the compact configurations through the one-to-one correspondence with their expanded counterparts. Our focus is on the compact configuration corresponding to a null twist angle, where the lattice degenerates to a chain. From the perspective of the chain, several of the local connections between neighboring lattice cells play the role of nonlocal long-range interactions between cells of the chain. We demonstrate experimentally some peculiar behavior that results from such nonlocality, including a selective activation of floppy sequences that is informed by the direction of loading.</description>

Abstract: Density-functional theory with extended Hubbard functionals (DFT+$U$+$V$) provides a robust framework to accurately describe complex materials containing transition-metal or rare-earth elements. It does so by mitigating self-interaction errors inherent to semi-local functionals which are particularly pronounced in systems with partially-filled d and f electronic states. However, achieving accuracy in this approach hinges upon the accurate determination of the on-site $U$ and inter-site $V$ Hubbard parameters. In practice, these are obtained either by semi-empirical tuning, requiring prior knowledge, or, more correctly, by using predictive but expensive first-principles calculations. Here, we present a machine learning model based on equivariant neural networks which uses atomic occupation matrices as descriptors, directly capturing the electronic structure, local chemical environment, and oxidation states of the system at hand. We target here the prediction of Hubbard parameters computed self-consistently with iterative linear-response calculations, as implemented in density-functional perturbation theory (DFPT), and structural relaxations. Remarkably, when trained on data from 12 materials spanning various crystal structures and compositions, our model achieves mean absolute relative errors of 3% and 5% for Hubbard $U$ and $V$ parameters, respectively. By circumventing computationally expensive DFT or DFPT self-consistent protocols, our model significantly expedites the prediction of Hubbard parameters with negligible computational overhead, while approaching the accuracy of DFPT. Moreover, owing to its robust transferability, the model facilitates accelerated materials discovery and design via high-throughput calculations, with relevance for various technological applications.</description>

A comprehensive analysis was conducted on the full concentration ranges of hexagonal ($\epsilon$) and orthorhombic ($\theta$) phases of (Fe-Co)$_3$C, (Fe-Co)$_3$(B-C), (Fe-Co)$_3$(C-N), and their alloys with 3$d$, 4$d$ and 5$d$ transition metals. The calculations were performed using the density functional theory implemented in the full-potential local-orbital code (FPLO). Calculated properties included formation energies, Curie temperatures, magnetic moments, magnetocrystalline anisotropy energies (MAE), and magnetic hardnesses. The considered compositions exhibit a range of magnetic properties, including soft, semi-hard, and hard magnetic. The materials most promising for hard-magnetic applications are orthorhombic Co$_3$C compound, together with selected Co-rich orthorhombic (Fe,Co)$_3$C and hexagonal (Fe,Co)$_3$C alloys. The calculation results do not indicate that substituting with transition metals increases the potential of the alloys for permanent magnet applications. A significant drawback of alloying orthorhombic $\theta$-Fe$_3$C (cementite) with transition metals is the notable decline in the Curie temperature. We found that a considerable proportion of the orthorhombic Co$_3$(B-C-N) alloys are magnetically hard, of which boron substitution raises the Curie temperature and improves stability. By mapping the dependence of MAE on the concentration of elements covering both the 3$d$ (from Fe to Co) and 2$p$ (from B, through C, to N) positions, we have demonstrated for the first time the near isoelectronic nature of MAE. The latter observation may be particularly useful in designing compositions of new magnetically hard materials.</description>

      <title>Magnon spectroscopy in the electron microscope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02908v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The miniaturisation of transistors is approaching its limits due to challenges in heat management and information transfer speed. To overcome these obstacles, emerging technologies such as spintronics are being developed, which leverage the electron's spin in addition to its charge. Local phenomena at interfaces or structural defects will greatly influence the efficiency of spin-based devices, making the ability to study and control spin wave propagation at the nano- and atomic scales a key challenge. The development of high-spatial-resolution tools to probe spin waves, also called magnons, at relevant lengthscales is thus essential to understand how their properties are affected by such local features. Here, we show the first experimental detection of bulk magnons at the nanoscale using scanning transmission electron microscopy. By employing high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy with hybrid-pixel direct electron detectors optimized for low acceleration voltages, we successfully overcome the challenges posed by weak signals and identify magnon excitations in a thin NiO nanocrystal. Advanced inelastic electron scattering simulations corroborate our findings. These results open new avenues for detecting magnons, exploring their dispersions and their modifications arising from nanoscale structural or chemical defects. This marks an important milestone in magnonics and presents exciting opportunities for the future development of spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Nonclassical heat flow in passive chiral solids is third rank, not odd</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chiral, directionally isotropic gyroid lattices are observed to exhibit nonclassical thermal effects incompatible with an asymmetric ("odd") second rank conductivity tensor but consistent with a third rank tensor property that provides a curl term. The lattices are passive materials so no driving torques are needed to obtain transverse flow. A method for determination of the length scale associated with chirality is provided. The polymer gyroid lattice made by 3D printing is a metamaterial which allows chirality that is tunable by geometry.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Metal-Support Interaction Dictates Cu Nanoparticle Sintering on Al$_2$O$_3$ Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12283v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nanoparticle sintering remains a critical challenge in heterogeneous catalysis. In this work, we present a unified deep potential (DP) model for Cu nanoparticles on three Al$_2$O$_3$ surfaces ($\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$(100), $\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$(110), and $\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$(0001)). Using DP-accelerated simulations, we reveal striking facet-dependent nanoparticle stability and mobility patterns across the three surfaces. The nanoparticles diffuse several times faster on $\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$(0001) than on $\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$(100) at 800 K while expected to be more sluggish based on their larger binding energy at 0 K. Diffusion is facilitated by dynamic metal-support interaction (MSI), where the Al atoms switch out of the surface plane to optimize contact with the nanoparticle and relax back to the plane as the nanoparticle moves away. In contrast, the MSI on $\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$(100) and on $\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$(110) is dominated by more stable and directional Cu-O bonds, consistent with the limited diffusion observed on these surfaces. Our extended long-time MD simulations provide quantitative insights into the sintering processes, showing that the dispersity of nanoparticles (the initial inter-nanoparticle distance) strongly influences coalescence driven by nanoparticle diffusion. We observed that the coalescence of Cu$_{13}$ nanoparticles on $\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$(0001) can occur in a short time (10 ns) at 800 K even with an initial inter-nanoparticle distance increased to 30 \r{A}, while the coalescence on $\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$(100) is inhibited significantly by increasing the initial inter-nanoparticle distance from 15 \r{A} to 30 \r{A}. These findings demonstrate that the dynamics of the supporting surface is crucial to understanding the sintering mechanism and offer guidance for designing sinter-resistant catalysts by engineering the support morphology.</description>

      <title>A generative material transformer using Wyckoff representation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16051v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Materials play a critical role in various technological applications. Identifying and enumerating stable compounds, those near the convex hull, is therefore essential. Despite recent progress, generative models either have a relatively low rate of stable compounds, are computationally expensive, or lack symmetry. In this work we present Matra-Genoa, an autoregressive transformer model built on invertible tokenized representations of symmetrized crystals, including free coordinates. This approach enables sampling from a hybrid action space. The model is trained across the periodic table and space groups and can be conditioned on specific properties. We demonstrate its ability to generate stable, novel, and unique crystal structures by conditioning on the distance to the convex hull. Resulting structures are 8 times more likely to be stable than baselines using PyXtal with charge compensation, while maintaining high computational efficiency. We also release a dataset of 3 million unique crystals generated by our method, including 4,000 compounds verified by density-functional theory to be within 0.001 eV/atom of the convex hull.</description>

      <title>Effects of Co substitution on the structural and magnetic properties of Sr(Ni$_{1-x}$Co$_x$)$_2$P$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.01805v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although SrNi$_2$P$_2$ adopts the common ThCr$_2$Si$_2$ structure for $T\geq 325$ K, being in an uncollapsed tetragonal state, on cooling below 325 K it adopts a one-third collapsed orthorhombic phase where one out of every three P rows bond across the Sr layers. On the other hand, SrCo$_2$P$_2$ only exhibits the uncollapsed ThCr$_2$Si$_2$ structure from room temperature down to 1.8 K. Neither SrNi$_2$P$_2$ nor SrCo$_2$P$_2$ manifests magnetic transitions down to 50 mK and 2 K, respectively. In this work we report the effects of Co substitution in Sr(Ni$_{1-x}$Co$_x$)$_2$P$_2$, which allows for tuning the transition between the one-third collapsed and the uncollapsed structure. We find a rapid decrease of the one-third collapsed structural transition temperature with increasing Co fraction, until reaching full suppression for $x \geq 0.1$. Substitution levels in the range $0.11\leq x\leq 0.58$ show no signs of any transition down to 1.8 K in the magnetization or resistance measurements in the range $1.8\ \text{K}\leq T\leq 300\ \text{K}$. However, different magnetically ordered states emerge for $x\geq 0.65$, and disappear for $x\geq 0.99$, recovering the known paramagnetic properties of the parent compound SrCo$_2$P$_2$. These results are summarized in a phase diagram, built upon the characterization done on single crystals with different Co fraction. Both the magnetic and structural properties are compared to other systems with ThCr$_2$Si$_2$ structure that exhibit magnetic ordering and collapsed tetragonal transitions. The magnetic ordering and moment formation are well described by Takahashi's spin fluctuation theory of itinerant electron magnetism.</description>

      <title>Strain activation of localized states in WSe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Single-photon emission centers generated by controlled atomic force microscopy (AFM) indentation in monolayer WSe\(_2\) on a flexible polymer substrate are explored for applications in quantum technologies. Here, we study the response of these emitters to the polymer substrate's strain state, which is controlled by selecting the indentation force and by gradually thermally annealing the samples. In the indented areas, we observe sharp new photoluminescence (PL) peaks in the regions 1.62--1.68 eV and 1.70--1.73 eV, characterized by sublinear power dependence and spectral wandering. We find that these peaks arise only when the indentation force exceeds a few \(\mu\)N and generally redshift as the applied force increases. Conversely, after thermal annealing (\(T &lt; 60^{\circ}\)C), WSe\(_2\) experiences strain relaxation, leading to a blueshift of the peaks' spectral position and their ultimate disappearance. Our analysis of the peaks' positions vs. strain allows us to draw several conclusions about the nature of these emission. Specifically, we elucidate the roles of excitonic confinement and hybridization between free excitons and defect-related states, a process activated by the strain level. Overall, our approach suggests that the energy of localized emitters may be controlled via strain engineering.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocity of supercurrent along applied magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05306v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal current responses arise in a broad range of systems, from magnons and phonons to supercurrents, due to an interplay between spatial and temporal symmetry breakings. These find applications in devices, such as circulators and rectifiers, as well as in probing the interactions and states that underlie the nonreciprocity. An established symmetry argument anticipates emergence of nonreciprocal currents along a direction perpendicular to the applied magnetic field that breaks the time-reversal symmetry. Here, motivated by recent experiments, we examine the emergence of nonreciprocity in vortex-limited superconducting critical currents along an applied magnetic field. Employing London's equations for describing the Meissner response of a superconducting film, we find that an additional symmetry breaking due to a preferred vortex axis enables nonreciprocal critical currents along the applied magnetic field, consistent with the so far unexplained experimental observation. Building on our concrete theoretical model for supercurrents, we discuss a possible generalization of the prevailing symmetry consideration to encompass nonreciprocal currents along the time-reversal symmetry breaking direction.</description>

      <title>Structure and dynamics of electron-phonon coupled systems using neural quantum states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08701v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we use neural quantum states (NQS) to describe the high-dimensional wave functions of electron-phonon coupled systems. We demonstrate that NQS can accurately and systematically learn the underlying physics of such problems through a variational Monte Carlo optimization of the energy with minimal incorporation of physical information even in highly challenging cases. We assess the ability of our approach across various lattice model examples featuring different types of couplings. The flexibility of our NQS formulation is demonstrated via application to ab initio models parametrized by density functional perturbation theory consisting of electron or hole bands coupled linearly to dispersive phonons. We compute accurate real-frequency spectral properties of electron-phonon systems via a novel formalism based on NQS. Our work establishes a general framework for exploring diverse ground state and dynamical phenomena arising in electron-phonon systems, including the non-perturbative interplay of correlated electronic and electron-phonon effects in systems ranging from simple lattice models to realistic models of materials parametrized by ab initio calculations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18864v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Choosing the correct free energy functional is critical when developing thermodynamically consistent phase field models. We show that the grand-potential phase field model minimizes the Helmholtz free energy when mass conservation is imposed. While both functionals are at a minimum at equilibrium, the Helmholtz free energy decreases monotonically with time in the grand-potential phase field model, whereas the grand potential does not. Minimizing the grand potential implies a different problem where a system can exchange mass with its surroundings at every point, leading to a condition of isochemical potential and invalidating mass conservation of the system.</description>

      <title>Pair Wavefunction Symmetry in UTe2 from Zero-Energy Surface State Visualization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although nodal spin-triplet topological superconductivity appears probable in UTe2, its superconductive order-parameter $\Delta_k$ remains unestablished. In theory, a distinctive identifier would be the existence of a superconductive topological surface band (TSB), which could facilitate zero-energy Andreev tunneling to an s-wave superconductor, and also distinguish a chiral from non-chiral $\Delta_k$ via enhanced s-wave proximity. Here we employ s-wave superconductive scan-tips and detect intense zero-energy Andreev conductance at the UTe2 (0-11) termination surface. Imaging reveals sub-gap quasiparticle scattering interference signatures with a-axis orientation. The observed zero-energy Andreev peak splitting with enhanced s-wave proximity, signifies that $\Delta_k$ of UTe2 is a non-chiral state: B1u, B2u or B3u. However, if the quasiparticle scattering along the a-axis is internodal, then a non-chiral B3u state is the most consistent for UTe2.</description>
