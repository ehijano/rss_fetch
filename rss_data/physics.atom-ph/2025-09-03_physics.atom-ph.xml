      <title>Microfabricated alkali vapor cells with tunable He-Ne buffer gas mixture using reservoirs with laser-actuated break-seals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter reports on the generation of a tunable buffer gas mixture within microfabricated alkali vapor cells. We show that the combination of low-permeation windows with sequential openings of laser-actuated break-seals enables adjustment of a helium-neon (He-Ne) noble gas mixture, fully compatible with alkali metal dispensers. The gas reservoirs and the main cell cavities are initially sealed at the wafer level under distinct helium and neon atmospheres, respectively. Within each cell, after Cs vapor is released from the dispenser, the break-seals are successively actuated to incrementally increase the helium fraction in the buffer gas mixture. This process shifts the atomic clock frequency turnover temperature toward higher values. As an illustration, one of the fabricated cells was operated at 95$^{\circ}$C in a coherent population trapping clock, achieving a fractional frequency stability of 9$\times$10$^{-11}$ at one-day integration time. These results demonstrate the feasibility of precisely tuning buffer gas compositions in microfabricated vapor cells and support the suitability of He-Ne mixtures for miniature atomic clock applications.</description>

      <title>Corrections to radiative rates between atomic configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The computation of radiative opacity or emissivity of hot dense matter is a challenging task. It requires accounting for an immense number of energy levels and lines across various excitation and ionization states. Whether in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) or non-LTE plasmas, statistical methods provide significant assistance. Many computational codes are based on the Detailed Configuration Accounting approximation, which involves averaged rates between configurations. In that approach, only the mean energies of the configurations are considered, and the effects of the energy distributions of the levels within the initial and final configurations are typically neglected. A long time ago, Klapisch proposed a method to correct the rates. The corresponding formalism includes the energy shift and variance of the Unresolved Transition Array, as well as the average energies of the configurations. We extend this formalism and investigate its impact on opacity calculations in two specific cases: first, the iron experiment conducted at Sandia National Laboratories under conditions similar to those at the base of the Sun's convective zone, dominated by L-shell 2p-$n$d transitions, and second, laser experiments--still for iron--at much lower temperature. The latter measurements shed light on our understanding of the envelopes of $\beta$-Cephei-type stars, where the relevant transitions are intra-M-shell $\Delta n=0$ (3-3) transitions, specifically 3s-3p and 3p-3d, in the XUV range. The issue of ensuring the validity of Kirchhoff's law when plasmas approach LTE is also addressed, and a prescription is proposed, applying both to the standard configuration-to-configuration case and to the aforementioned corrections, which account for the energy distribution of the levels within a configuration.</description>

      <title>Permanent magnet based Zeeman slower for lithium atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the design, construction, and characterization of a permanent magnet based, transverse-field Zeeman slower for lithium atoms. We use off-the-shelf compact permanent bar magnets in the Halbach configuration to create a uniform magnetic field in the transverse direction. We develop a general approach for a mechanical structure that supports the spatial distribution of magnets using 3D printing technology. The approach allows for flexible assembly and dismantling of the magnetic field on the target vacuum system. Finally, we verify that the Zeeman slower supports a high flux of slow atoms in the region of magneto-optical trap.</description>

      <title>Hadronic vacuum polarization effect in muonic atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP) corrections to energy levels in muonic atoms are studied systematically across the periodic table. Two nuclear charge distribution models have been considered, with partly analytical solution for an homogeneously charged sphere model and direct numerical integration for a Fermi nuclear charge distribution. Our comparison reveals a good agreement between both approaches with differences typically below a few percent. The magnitude of HVP corrections increases with nuclear charge, displaying irregularities that correlate directly with the non-monotonic behavior of nuclear radii. Despite strong relativistic effects at high $Z$, the ratio of hadronic to muonic vacuum polarization remains remarkably stable, deviating by less than $10\%$ from the established $67\%$ non-relativistic benchmark value</description>

      <title>Probing the isolated vector magnetic field of structured laser beams by atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electric and magnetic fields are inherently coupled in an electromagnetic wave. However, structured light beams enable their spatial separation. In particular, azimuthally polarized laser beams exhibit a localized magnetic field on-axis without the electric counterpart. Recent study by Martin-Domene et al. [App. Phys. Lett. 124, 211101 (2024)] has shown that combining these beams enables the generation of locally isolated magnetic fields with a controllable direction and phase. In the present paper we propose a method to probe and characterize such magnetic fields by studying their interaction with a single trapped atom. In order to theoretically investigate magnetic sublevel populations and their dependence on the relative orientation and phase -- i.e. the polarization state -- of the isolated magnetic field, we use a time-dependent density-matrix method based on the Liouville-von Neumann equation. As illustrative cases, we consider the $2s^2 2p^2 \, {}^3P_0 \, - \, 2s^2 2p^2 \, {}^3P_1$, the $1s^2 2s^2 \, {}^1S_0 \, - \, 1s^2 2s 2p \, {}^3P_2$, and the $2 s^2 2p \, {}^2 P_{1/2} \, - \, 2 s^2 2p \, {}^2 P_{3/2}$ transitions in ${}^{40}$Ca$^{14+}$, ${}^{10}$Be, and ${}^{38}$Ar$^{13+}$, respectively. Our results indicate that monitoring atomic populations serves as an effective tool for probing isolated vector magnetic fields, which opens avenues for studying laser-induced processes in atomic systems where electric field suppression is critical.</description>

      <title>Optical Trapping of SrOH Molecules for Dark Matter and T-violation Searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report an optical dipole trap of strontium monohydroxide (SrOH) with 1400(300) trapped molecules. Through optical pumping, we access vibrational states that are proposed for improved probes of the electron's electric dipole moment (eEDM) and ultralight dark matter (UDM). For each of these states, the lifetime of trapped molecules is measured, and found to be consistent with spontaneous radiative decay and black-body excitation limits, making this platform viable for these eEDM and UDM searches.</description>

      <title>Landscape of scattering universality with general dispersion relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Universality in physics describes how disparate systems can exhibit identical low-energy behavior. Here, we reveal a rich landscape of new universal scattering phenomena governed by the interplay between an interaction and a system's density of states. We investigate one-dimensional scattering with general dispersion relations of the form $\epsilon(k) = |k|^m$ and $\epsilon(k) = \text{sign}(k)|k|^m$ for any real $m \geq 1$. For key models such as emitter scattering and separable potentials, we prove that the low-energy S-matrix converges to universal forms determined solely by the dispersion exponent $m$ and a few integers defining the interaction. This establishes a broad classification of new universality classes, extending far beyond the standard quadratic dispersion paradigm. Furthermore, we derive a generalized Levinson's theorem relating the total winding of the scattering phase to the number of bound states. Our findings are directly relevant to synthetic quantum systems, where engineered dispersion relations in atomic arrays and photonic crystals offer a platform to explore these universal behaviors.</description>

      <title>Strong-Field Photoelectron Interferometry with Near-Single-Cycle Yb Lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of using photoelectron interferometry in short laser fields to probe electron dynamics and target structures was introduced more than two decades ago. However, the quality of experimental data has remained insufficient for quantitative analysis, largely due to the instability of few-cycle Ti:Sa laser pulses, the current workhorse of short pulses. Here, we report the first systematic strong-field ionization experiments performed with industrial-grade, carrier-envelope-phase (CEP) stabilized, near-single-cycle Yb lasers. By measuring photoelectron momentum distributions in the direct-ionization regime, we show that single-cycle cosine-shaped pulses can separate and enhance both spider-leg and fishbone holographic structures. The spider-leg structure enables extraction of the electron scattering phase from the Ar atomic potential-information typically accessible only through attosecond metrology, while the fishbone structure reveals the orbital-parity contrast between Ar atoms and nitrogen molecules. Our measurements are quantitatively reproduced by both semiclassical Herman-Kluk-propagator and \textit{ab initio} simulations, paving the way for precision studies of electron-molecule scattering with widely accessible industrial-grade lasers.</description>

      <title>MEMS Vapor Cells-based Rydberg-atom Electrometry Toward Miniaturization and High Sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rydberg-atom electrometry, as an emerging cutting-edge technology, features high sensitivity, broad bandwidth, calibration-free operation, and beyond. However, until now the key atomic vapor cells used for confining electric field-sensitive Rydberg atoms nearly made with traditional glass-blown techniques, hindering the miniaturization, integration, and batch manufacturing. Here, we present the wafer-level MEMS atomic vapor cells with glass-silicon-glass sandwiched structure that are batch-manufactured for both frequency stability and electric field measurement. We use specially customized ultra-thick silicon wafers with a resistivity exceeding 10,000 cm, three orders of magnitude higher than that of typical silicon, and a thickness of 6 mm, providing a 4-fold improvement in optical interrogation length. With the as-developed MEMS atomic vapor cell, we configured a high-sensitivity Rydberg-atom electrometry with the minimal detectable microwave field to be 2.8 mV/cm. This combination of miniaturization and sensitivity represents a significant advance in the state-of-the-art field of Rydberg-atom electrometry, paving the way for chip-scale Rydberg-atom electrometry and potentially opening up new applications in a wider variety of fields.</description>

      <title>Over-Barrier Ionization Dynamics Studied by Backpropagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tunneling and over-barrier ionization are the primary processes of strong-field ionization of atoms and molecules. While the dynamics of tunneling ionization have been extensively studied, exploration of over-barrier ionization dynamics has remained a significant challenge. In this study, we investigate the dynamics of over-barrier ionization using the backpropagation method specifically adapted for this context. By analyzing the topology of the backpropagating trajectories, we differentiate the contributions of tunneling and over-barrier ionizations to the distributions of photoelectron momentum and ionization time. While the transition from tunneling to over-barrier ionization is known to depend on the field strength, our results reveal that it is also influenced by the initial transverse momentum of the outgoing electron. We clarify how ionization probabilities vary with intensity for each mechanism, highlighting a competitive relationship between them. We further find that accounting for the Stark shift is essential for accurately determining the threshold field strength for over-barrier ionization. Our work provides a detailed understanding of the dynamics of over-barrier ionization and lays the groundwork for exploring new mechanisms in intense laser-matter interactions.</description>

      <title>Laser M\"ossbauer spectroscopy of ^{229}Th</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: M\"ossbauer spectroscopy is widely used in biochemistry, geology, and solid-state physics to obtain structural information on materials. Here, we extend this technique into the optical range using a vacuum ultraviolet laser to probe the low-energy nuclear transitions of thorium-229, doped in calcium fluoride crystals. We discover four distinct doping sites for the thorium ions, determine the characteristic electric field gradients emerging in the interaction with the host crystal, and identify the microscopic structure of the two dominant configurations. Site-selective laser excitation allows to study the isomeric state lifetime and laser-induced quenching for all sites. This laser-based M\"ossbauer spectroscopy provides a powerful probe of the nuclear environment, yielding foundational data for designing future solid-state nuclear clocks.</description>

      <title>Classical and Quantum Beam Dynamics Simulation of the RF Photoinjector Test Bench at JINR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present simulation of the classical and quantum beam dynamics of an RF photoinjector test bench under development at Joint Institute for Nuclear Research. A 0.63 pC electron bunch is driven from a copper photocathode by a 262 nm ultraviolet laser and accelerated to energies of a few MeV in a 2856 MHz, 1.5-cell RF gun. Using realistic electromagnetic field maps and the ASTRA particle-tracking code, we optimize a Carlsten-style emittance-compensation solenoid to achieve a normalized transverse emittance of 3.2 pi mm mrad downstream of the gun. We also simulate the dynamic of a single-electron Laguerre-Gaussian wave packet carrying l = hbar orbital angular momentum projection in the same RF fields: continuous acceleration reduces its de Broglie wavelength and suppresses transverse spreading by a factor of six compared to free-space propagation over 30 cm. These results confirm the injector design, demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed emittance-compensation scheme, and pave the way to the first experimental demonstration of relativistic vortex electron generation in the few MeV energy range.</description>

      <title>Room-temperature alignment-free magnetometry with boron vacancies in hot-pressed hexagonal boron nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic field sensing is essential for applications in communication, environmental monitoring, and biomedical diagnostics. Quantum sensors based on solid-state spin defects, such as nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond or boron vacancies in single-crystal hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), typically require precise alignment between the external magnetic field and the defect's spin quantization axis to achieve reliable sensing. This alignment constraint complicates device integration and hinders scalability. Here, we demonstrate room-temperature optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) from negatively charged boron vacancies (VB-) in commercially available hot-pressed polycrystalline hBN. The random grain orientation inherently samples a broad range of spin quantization axes, enabling alignment-free magnetic field detection. Numerical modeling further confirms that sensing remains feasible despite anisotropic sensitivity, establishing hot-pressed hBN as a robust and practical platform for quantum magnetometry. This approach paves the way toward low-cost, scalable, and mechanically stable quantum magnetic field sensors suitable for real-world deployment.</description>

Abstract: The article reports electron-impact excitation cross-sections and rate coefficients for neutral tungsten for three transitions (400.87 nm, 429.46 nm, and 430.21 nm) using the relativistic distorted wave approach within the flexible atomic code. Some of these lines are also observed in tokamak plasma. Cross-sections are computed for incident electron energy up to 30 keV. The energy levels in flexible atomic code were corrected to match the NIST database. The electron impact excitation rate coefficients are also provided.</description>

Abstract: Nuclear structure effects are essential for describing hyperfine splittings from high-precision atomic spectroscopy measurements. These effects are often parametrized by the effective or elastic Zemach radii, with their difference poorly understood. We solve the longstanding discrepancy between the effective and elastic Zemach radii in ${}^6$Li and ${}^7$Li by performing \emph{ab initio} nuclear structure calculations that take into account nuclear polarizability effects. Our results demonstrate that nuclear polarizability effects, negligible in ${}^7$Li, dominate in ${}^6$Li and explain the observed significant deviation between the effective and elastic Zemach radii. Furthermore, we show that the ratios between the nuclear polarizability contributions in different nuclei are universal in the limit of closure and SU(4) symmetry of nuclear forces. In particular, the nuclear polarizability contribution in an odd-odd nucleus is enhanced by a factor of $\mu_p/(\mu_p+\mu_n)\simeq 3$, with $\mu_{n,p}$ denoting the nucleon magnetic moments, compared to its odd-$A$ isotopes. The same mechanism also explains the Zemach radius deviations observed in ${}^2$H and ${}^3$He. These findings establish nuclear polarizability as the dominant source of isotope-dependent nuclear corrections to hyperfine splitting in light atoms.</description>

      <title>Forward and Backward Electron Acceleration by Radially Polarized Ultra-Intense Laser Focus Seeded By Field Ionization of High Charge States of Neon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thanks to the fabrication of large aperture phase optics, ultra-intense relativistic laser plasma interaction (RLPI) experiments with complex polarization states are becoming feasible. In this work, we perform a computational investigation of direct acceleration of electrons produced during ionization of underdense neon gas using a tightly focused and radially polarized Petawatt-class short pulse lasers by numerically solving the relativistically invariant Lorentz equations, incorporating semi-classical tunneling ionization and Monte Carlo type sampling of the focal volume. The accelerated electrons energy gain increases at longer laser wavelengths and GeV energies are reached for electrons ionized from the neon inner shells, which are field ionized near the peak of the pulse. Backward acceleration of electrons is observed for a range of initial positions and phases of ionization of neon charge states. This apparent counterintuitive phenomenon is directly linked to the radial polarization state of the incident laser beam that results in a strong longitudinal electric field Ez when tightly focused, where electrons ionized near the focal center at the phase when Ez is pointed toward the forward propagation direction experiences an initial push in the backward direction. A parametric study of the phenomenon by varying laser parameters is presented, and a 3D particle in cell (PIC) simulation is considered to confirm the existence of this phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Single-atom imaging of ${}^{173}$Yb in optical tweezers loaded by a five-beam magneto-optical trap</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07371v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on the trapping and imaging of individual ytterbium atoms in arrays of optical tweezers, loaded from a magneto-optical trap (MOT) formed by only five beams in an orthogonal configuration. In our five-beam MOT, operating on the narrow ${}^1$S${}_0 \rightarrow {}^3$P${}_1$ intercombination transition, gravity balances the radiation pressure of a single upward-directed beam. This approach enables efficient trapping and cooling of the most common ytterbium isotopes (${}^{171}$Yb, ${}^{173}$Yb and ${}^{174}$Yb) to $\lesssim 20\,\mu$K at densities $\sim 10^{11}$ atoms/cm$^3$ within less than one second. This configuration allows for significantly reducing the complexity of the optical setup, potentially benefiting any ytterbium-atom based quantum science platform leveraging single-atom microscopy, from quantum processors to novel optical clocks. We then demonstrate the first single-atom-resolved imaging of the fermionic, large-spin isotope ${}^{173}$Yb ($I=5/2$), employing a two-color imaging scheme that does not rely on magic-wavelength trapping. We achieve a high single-atom detection fidelity of $99.96(1)\%$ and a large survival probability of $98.5(2)\%$, despite large differential light shifts affecting all nuclear spin sublevels of the excited ${}^3$P${}_1$ state involved in the cooling transition. The demonstrated capabilities will play a key role in future quantum simulations and computing applications with ${}^{173}$Yb arrays.</description>

      <title>Atomic thermometry in optical lattice clocks</title>

Abstract: Accurate measurement of atomic temperature is fundamental for a wide range of applications, from quantum sensing to precision metrology. In optical lattice clocks, precise characterization of atomic temperature is required to minimize systematic uncertainties at the $10^{-18}$ level. In this work, we investigate atomic temperature measurements in the ytterbium optical lattice clock developed at INRIM, IT-Yb1, employing sideband and Doppler spectroscopy across a wide range of trapping conditions. By implementing clock-line-mediated Sisyphus cooling [Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 053401 (2024)], we reduce the atomic temperature and enable operation at shallower lattice depths down to $D = 50E_{R}$. We compare temperature estimates obtained from the harmonic oscillator model with those derived using a Born-Oppenheimer-based approach [Phys. Rev. A 101, 053416 (2020)], which is expected to provide a more accurate description of atomic motion in both longitudinal and radial directions, especially for hotter atoms whose motion deviates from the harmonic regime. Discrepancies up to a factor of two in extracted temperatures are observed depending on the chosen model. We assess the impact of these modeling differences on the evaluation of lattice shifts and find relative frequency deviations up to $8\times10^{-17}$. Even though extended Sisyphus cooling reduces these inconsistencies to the $1\times10^{-18}$ level, residual biases may still limit the accuracy of optical lattice clocks.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the Dick Effect for AI-based Dynamic Gravimeter</title>

Abstract: Atom interferometer (AI)-based dynamic gravimeter enable high-precision absolute gravity measurements, crucial for applications in geophysics, navigation, resource exploration, and metrology. Understanding their underlying mechanisms and minimizing measurement noise are essential for enhancing performance. This work investigates the gravity measurement noise in AI-based systems induced by the dead time of the classical accelerometer. Using actual dynamic gravity measurement data, we demonstrate that a dead time of 0.12 s introduces significant gravity measurement noise of 8 mGal. To elucidate the mechanism of this noise, we derive a formula for this noise in frequency domain, identifying high-frequency aliasing as its source. Analysis of the derived expressions indicates that reducing the dead time duration and suppressing the high-frequency noise of the acceleration are effective strategies for mitigating this noise. This work provides significant insights for noise analysis and future scheme design of AI-based dynamic gravimeters.</description>

      <title>Collectively enhanced ground-state cooling in subwavelength atomic arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18482v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Subwavelength atomic arrays feature strong light-induced dipole-dipole interactions, resulting in subradiant collective resonances characterized by narrowed linewidths. In this work, we present a sideband cooling scheme for atoms trapped in subwavelength arrays that utilizes these narrow collective resonances. Working in the Lamb-Dicke regime, we derive an effective master equation for the atomic motion by adiabatically eliminating the internal degrees of freedom of the atoms, and validate its prediction with numerical simulations of the full system. Our results demonstrate that subradiant resonances enable the cooling of ensembles of atoms to temperatures lower than those achievable without dipole interactions, provided the atoms have different trap frequencies. Remarkably, narrow collective resonances can be sideband-resolved even when the individual atomic transition is not. In such scenarios, ground-state cooling becomes feasible solely due to light-induced dipole-dipole interactions. This approach could be utilized for future quantum technologies based on dense ensembles of emitters, and paves the way towards harnessing many-body cooperative decay for enhanced motional control.</description>

      <title>Dispersion of first sound in a weakly interacting ultracold Fermi liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10099v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: At low temperature, a normal gas of unpaired spin-1/2 fermions is one of the cleanest realizations of a Fermi liquid. It is described by Landau's theory, where no phenomenological parameters are needed as the quasiparticle interaction function can be computed perturbatively in powers of the scattering length $a$, the sole parameter of the short-range interparticle interactions. Obtaining an accurate solution of the transport equation nevertheless requires a careful treatment of the collision kernel, {as the uncontrolled error made by the relaxation time approximations increases when the temperature $T$ drops below the Fermi temperature}. Here, we study sound waves in the hydrodynamic regime up to second order in the Chapman-Enskog's expansion. We find that the frequency $\omega_q$ of the sound wave is shifted above its linear departure as $\omega_q=c_1 q(1+\alpha q^2\tau^2)$ where $c_1$ and $q$ are the speed and wavenumber of the sound wave and the typical collision time $\tau$ scales as $1/a^2T^2$. Besides the shear viscosity, the coefficient $\alpha$ is described by a single second-order collision time which we compute exactly from an analytical solution of the transport equation, resulting in a positive dispersion $\alpha&gt;0$. Our results suggest that ultracold atomic Fermi gases are an ideal experimental system for quantitative tests of second-order hydrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Search for Axionlike Dark Matter Using Liquid-State Nuclear Magnetic Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16044v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We search for dark matter in the form of axionlike particles (ALPs) in the mass range $5.576741 \,\mathrm{neV/c^2}$ - $5.577733\,\mathrm{neV/c^2}$ by probing their possible coupling to fermion spins through the ALP field gradient. This is achieved by performing proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy on a sample of methanol as a technical demonstration of the Cosmic Axion Spin Precession Experiment Gradient (CASPEr-Gradient) Low-Field apparatus. Searching for spin-coupled ALP dark matter in this mass range with associated Compton frequencies in a 240 Hz window centered at 1.348570 MHz resulted in a sensitivity to the ALP-proton coupling constant of $g_{\mathrm{ap}} \approx 3 \times 10^{-2}\,\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$. This narrow-bandwidth search serves as a proof-of-principle and a commissioning measurement, validating our methodology and demonstrating the experiment's capabilities. CASPEr-Gradient Low-Field will probe the mass range from $4.1\,\mathrm{\peV/c^2}$ to $17\,\mathrm{\neV/c^2}$ with hyperpolarized samples to boost the sensitivity beyond the astronomical limits.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{P}$, $\mathcal{T}$-violating axion-mediated interactions in RaOH molecule</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08667v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If axion simultaneously has the scalar couplings to the nucleons and pseudo-scalar couplings to the electrons, it may mediate a $\mathcal{P}$, $\mathcal{T}$-violating interaction between the electronic shell and nuclei in the molecules. The polyatomic molecule RaOH, which is considered as a promising platform for the $\mathcal{P}$, $\mathcal{T}$ violation searches, is studied for its sensitivity to such interactions. Due to the long-range nature (on molecular scales) of the axion-mediated interaction, it is important whether the enhancement parameter would be sensitive to the vibration of the molecule. Our results imply that the impact of the vibrations on the axion-mediated electron-nucleon interaction in the molecule is similar to the impact on the short-range electron-nucleon scalar-pseudoscalar interaction studied earlier.</description>

      <title>Excitation-Pulse Intensity Mediated Coherent Control in V-Type Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13371v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: V-type three-level systems, where two excited states share a common ground state, serve as fundamental models for exploring coherent light-matter interactions in a range of quantum systems, from atomic gases to semiconductor nanostructures. In this work, we investigate the coherent evolution of such a system under strong femtosecond-pulse excitation by numerically solving the optical Bloch equations. We demonstrate that the coherent evolution of a three-level system critically depends on the product of the excitation-pulse duration and energy separation between the excited states. Using this understanding, we extend our analysis to simulate two-dimensional coherent spectra in a high-intensity regime. We show that by varying the pulse areas of the excitation pulses, one can selectively turn individual spectral features, corresponding to distinct quantum pathways, on or off. Moreover, we can precisely adjust the phase of these peaks, illustrating an advanced level of coherent control within the system. Our approach provides a simple and robust framework for achieving advanced coherent control in multilevel systems.</description>

      <title>Post-collision interaction in the liquid phase: the role of electron scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18734v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report a detailed study of post-collision interaction (PCI) in a liquid medium. We investigate PCI for the Auger KLL electrons of solvated Cl$^-$, K$^+$ and Ca$^{2+}$. All three isoelectronic ions exhibit a very similar PCI behavior, which is little affected by changing the solvent from water to methanol or ethanol. The two main factors modifying the PCI interaction in condensed media is the screening of Coulombic interactions, and scattering of the electrons. The experimental results are compared with the predictions of a previously reported semi-classical PCI theory modified to account for screening and scattering. We show that a better agreement with experiment can be obtained by instead modeling scattering using electron transport Monte-Carlo simulations. We suggest that, in turn, PCI experimental data could be used as another experimental constraint to refine the currently insufficiently well-known scattering parameters of low-energy electrons in water, which are crucial in many fields.</description>
