      <title>Radon mitigation by soil depressurisation case study: radon concentration and pressure field extension monitoring in a pilot house in Spain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A one-year monitoring study was conducted in a pilot house with high radon levels to investigate the ability and efficiency of radon mitigation by soil depressurisation (SD) both active and passive. The study included monitoring of radon concentration, pressure field extension (pfe) under the slab and some atmospheric parameters for different testing phases. Periods in which the house remained closed to foster radon accumulation were alternated with phases of active and passive soil depressurisation under different conditions. The behaviour of the radon concentration in the pilot house was analysed along with the influence of atmospheric variables, significant correlations were found for the radon concentration with atmospheric pressure, outdoor temperature and wind. From the pfe analysis it was proven that the pressure drop with distance from the suction point of the SD system is proportional to the depressurisation generated. It was found also that the permeability characterisation of the pilot house agrees with the literature about granular fill materials characterisation for radon SD systems across Europe. Radon reductions in excess of 85% were achieved for the different testing phases in all cases. Finally, from the results it was stated that a fan power of 23 W is sufficient to ensure radon reductions over 85% for dwellings with similar aggregate layer and soil permeability.</description>

      <title>Graph-accelerated non-intrusive polynomial chaos expansion using partially tensor-structured quadrature rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the graph-accelerated non-intrusive polynomial chaos (NIPC) method has been proposed for solving uncertainty quantification (UQ) problems. This method leverages the full-grid integration-based NIPC method to address UQ problems while employing the computational graph transformation approach, AMTC, to accelerate the tensor-grid evaluations. This method exhibits remarkable efficacy on a broad range of low-dimensional (three dimensions or less) UQ problems featuring multidisciplinary models. However, it often does not scale well with problem dimensions due to the exponential increase in the number of quadrature points when using the full-grid quadrature rule. To expand the applicability of this method to a broader range of UQ problems, this paper introduces a new framework for generating a tailored, partially tensor-structured quadrature rule to use with the graph-accelerated NIPC method. This quadrature rule, generated through the designed quadrature approach, possesses a tensor structure that is tailored for the computational model. The selection of the tensor structure is guided by an analysis of the computational graph, ensuring that the quadrature rule effectively capitalizes on the sparsity within the computational graph when paired with the AMTC method. This method has been tested on one 4D and one 6D UQ problem, both originating from aircraft design scenarios and featuring multidisciplinary models. Numerical results show that, when using with graph-accelerated NIPC method, our approach generates a partially tensor-structured quadrature rule that outperforms the full-grid Gauss quadrature and the designed quadrature methods (more than 40% reduction in computational costs) in both of the test problems.</description>

      <title>A gradient-enhanced univariate dimension reduction method for uncertainty propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The univariate dimension reduction (UDR) method stands as a way to estimate the statistical moments of the output that is effective in a large class of uncertainty quantification (UQ) problems. UDR's fundamental strategy is to approximate the original function using univariate functions so that the UQ cost only scales linearly with the dimension of the problem. Nonetheless, UDR's effectiveness can diminish when uncertain inputs have high variance, particularly when assessing the output's second and higher-order statistical moments. This paper proposes a new method, gradient-enhanced univariate dimension reduction (GUDR), that enhances the accuracy of UDR by incorporating univariate gradient function terms into the UDR approximation function. Theoretical results indicate that the GUDR approximation is expected to be one order more accurate than UDR in approximating the original function, and it is expected to generate more accurate results in computing the output's second and higher-order statistical moments. Our proposed method uses a computational graph transformation strategy to efficiently evaluate the GUDR approximation function on tensor-grid quadrature inputs, and use the tensor-grid input-output data to compute the statistical moments of the output. With an efficient automatic differentiation method to compute the gradients, our method preserves UDR's linear scaling of computation time with problem dimension. Numerical results show that the GUDR is more accurate than UDR in estimating the standard deviation of the output and has a performance comparable to the method of moments using a third-order Taylor series expansion.</description>

      <title>Modal-adaptive Knowledge-enhanced Graph-based Financial Prediction from Monetary Policy Conference Calls with LLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Financial prediction from Monetary Policy Conference (MPC) calls is a new yet challenging task, which targets at predicting the price movement and volatility for specific financial assets by analyzing multimodal information including text, video, and audio. Although the existing work has achieved great success using cross-modal transformer blocks, it overlooks the potential external financial knowledge, the varying contributions of different modalities to financial prediction, as well as the innate relations among different financial assets. To tackle these limitations, we propose a novel Modal-Adaptive kNowledge-enhAnced Graph-basEd financial pRediction scheme, named MANAGER. Specifically, MANAGER resorts to FinDKG to obtain the external related knowledge for the input text. Meanwhile, MANAGER adopts BEiT-3 and Hidden-unit BERT (HuBERT) to extract the video and audio features, respectively. Thereafter, MANAGER introduces a novel knowledge-enhanced cross-modal graph that fully characterizes the semantic relations among text, external knowledge, video and audio, to adaptively utilize the information in different modalities, with ChatGLM2 as the backbone. Extensive experiments on a publicly available dataset Monopoly verify the superiority of our model over cutting-edge methods.</description>

      <title>An experimental evaluation of choices of SSA forecasting parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Six time series related to atmospheric phenomena are used as inputs for experiments offorecasting with singular spectrum analysis (SSA). Existing methods for SSA parametersselection are compared throughout their forecasting accuracy relatively to an optimal aposteriori selection and to a naive forecasting methods. The comparison shows that awidespread practice of selecting longer windows leads often to poorer predictions. It alsoconfirms that the choices of the window length and of the grouping are essential. Withthe mean error of rainfall forecasting below 1.5%, SSA appears as a viable alternative forhorizons beyond two weeks.</description>

      <title>DevServOps: DevOps For Product-Oriented Product-Service Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.08601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For companies developing web-based applications, the Dev and the Ops refer to different groups with either operational or development focus. Therefore, DevOps help these companies streamline software development and operations activities by emphasizing the collaboration between the two groups. However, for companies producing software-intensive products, the Ops would refer to customers who use and operate the product. In addition, companies producing software-intensive products do not only offer products to customers but rather Product Service Systems (PSS), where product-related services play a key role in ensuring customer satisfaction besides their significant revenue contribution. Thus, the context of product-oriented PSS is very different from web-based applications, making it difficult to apply DevOps without considering the role of the services. Therefore, based on a two years participant observation case study conducted at a multinational telecommunications systems provider, we propose a new and novel approach called Development-Services-Operations (DevServOps) which incorporates services as a key player facilitating an end-to-end software flow toward customers in one direction and feedback toward developers in the other direction. Services become the glue that connects the Dev and the Ops, achieved by providing internal services to increase the precision of the development organization and external services to increase the speed of deployment and new content adoption on the customers' side.</description>

      <title>A Linear Time-Delay Scheme to Propagate Reduced Electron Density Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For any linear system where the unreduced dynamics are governed by unitary propagators, we derive a closed, time-delayed, linear system for a reduced-dimensional quantity of interest. We apply this method to understand the memory-dependence of reduced $1$-electron density matrices in time-dependent configuration interaction (TDCI), a scheme to solve for the correlated dynamics of electrons in molecules. Though time-dependent density functional theory has established that the reduced $1$-electron density possesses memory-dependence, the precise nature of this memory-dependence has not been understood. We derive a self-contained, symmetry/constraint-preserving method to propagate reduced TDCI electron density matrices. In numerical tests on two model systems (H$_2$ and HeH$^+$), we show that with sufficiently large time-delay (or memory-dependence), our method propagates reduced TDCI density matrices with high quantitative accuracy. We study the dependence of our results on time step and basis set. To derive our method, we calculate the $4$-index tensor that relates reduced and full TDCI density matrices. Our calculation applies to any TDCI system, regardless of basis set, number of electrons, or choice of Slater determinants in the wave function. This calculation enables a proof that the trace of the reduced TDCI density matrix is constant and equals the number of electrons.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents an overview of scientific modeling and discusses the complementary strengths and weaknesses of ML methods for scientific modeling in comparison to process-based models. It also provides an introduction to the current state of research in the emerging field of scientific knowledge-guided machine learning (KGML) that aims to use both scientific knowledge and data in ML frameworks to achieve better generalizability, scientific consistency, and explainability of results. We discuss different facets of KGML research in terms of the type of scientific knowledge used, the form of knowledge-ML integration explored, and the method for incorporating scientific knowledge in ML. We also discuss some of the common categories of use cases in environmental sciences where KGML methods are being developed, using illustrative examples in each category.</description>

      <title>Accelerating model evaluations in uncertainty propagation on tensor grids using computational graph transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06617v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Methods such as non-intrusive polynomial chaos (NIPC), and stochastic collocation are frequently used for uncertainty propagation problems. Particularly for low-dimensional problems, these methods often use a tensor-product grid for sampling the space of uncertain inputs. A limitation of this approach is that it encounters a significant challenge: the number of sample points grows exponentially with the increase of uncertain inputs. Current strategies to mitigate computational costs abandon the tensor structure of sampling points, with the aim of reducing their overall count. Contrastingly, our investigation reveals that preserving the tensor structure of sample points can offer distinct advantages in specific scenarios. Notably, by manipulating the computational graph of the targeted model, it is feasible to avoid redundant evaluations at the operation level to significantly reduce the model evaluation cost on tensor-grid inputs. This paper presents a pioneering method: Accelerated Model Evaluations on Tensor grids using Computational graph transformations (AMTC). The core premise of AMTC lies in the strategic modification of the computational graph of the target model to algorithmically remove the repeated evaluations on the operation level. We implemented the AMTC method within the compiler of a new modeling language called the Computational System Design Language (CSDL). We demonstrate the effectiveness of AMTC by using it with the full-grid NIPC method to solve four low-dimensional UQ problems involving an analytical piston model, a multidisciplinary unmanned aerial vehicle design model, a multi-point air taxi mission analysis model, and a single-disciplinary rotor model, respectively. For three of the four test problems, AMTC reduces the model evaluation cost by between 50% and 90%, making the full-grid NIPC the most efficacious method to use among the UQ methods implemented.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear dynamic analysis of shear- and torsion-free rods using isogeometric discretization and outlier removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10652v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a discrete formulation of nonlinear shear- and torsion-free rods introduced by Gebhardt and Romero in [20] that uses isogeometric discretization and robust time integration. Omitting the director as an independent variable field, we reduce the number of degrees of freedom and obtain discrete solutions in multiple copies of the Euclidean space (R^3), which is larger than the corresponding multiple copies of the manifold (R^3 x S^2) obtained with standard Hermite finite elements. For implicit time integration, we choose the same integration scheme as Gebhardt and Romero in [20] that is a hybrid form of the midpoint and the trapezoidal rules. In addition, we apply a recently introduced approach for outlier removal by Hiemstra et al. [26] that reduces high-frequency content in the response without affecting the accuracy, ensuring robustness of our nonlinear discrete formulation. We illustrate the efficiency of our nonlinear discrete formulation for static and transient rods under different loading conditions, demonstrating good accuracy in space, time and the frequency domain. Our numerical example coincides with a relevant application case, the simulation of mooring lines.</description>
