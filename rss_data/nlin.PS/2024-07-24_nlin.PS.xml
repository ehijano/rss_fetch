      <title>Nonlinear dynamics of vortex pairing in transitional jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the onset of linear instabilities and their later nonlinear interactions in the shear layer of an initially-laminar jet using a combination of stability analysis and data from high-fidelity flow simulations. We provide a complete picture of the vortex-pairing process. Hydrodynamic instabilities initiate the transition to turbulence, causing the shear layer to spread rapidly. In this process, the shear layer rolls up to form vortices, accompanied by the exponential growth of the fundamental frequency. As the fundamental frequency grows, it gains energy from the mean flow. Subsequently, as it saturates and begins to decay, the fundamental vortices start to pair. During this vortex pairing process, the subharmonic vortex acquires energy both linearly from the mean flow and nonlinearly through a reverse cascade from the fundamental. The process concludes when the subharmonic vortex eventually saturates. Similarly, two subharmonic vortices merge to form a second subharmonic vortex. Our results confirm Kelly's (1967) hypothesis of a resonance mechanism between the fundamental and subharmonic, which supplies energy to the subharmonic. In this multi-tonal, convective-dominated flow, we clarify the ambiguity surrounding the fundamental frequency by demonstrating that the spatially most amplified frequency should be considered fundamental, rather than the structure associated with the spectral energy peak. For the initially-laminar jet considered here, the fundamental frequency corresponds to the fourth largest spectral peak, highlighting the important distinction between the energetically and dynamical significance of a tone. Despite its low energy, the fundamental frequency is dynamically dominant as it determines all other spectral peaks and supplies energy to the subharmonics through a reverse energy cascade.</description>

      <title>Standing and Traveling Waves in a Nonlinearly Dispersive Lattice Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11649</link>

Abstract: In the work of Colliander et al. (2010), a minimal lattice model was constructed describing the transfer of energy to high frequencies in the defocusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. In the present work, we present a systematic study of the coherent structures, both standing and traveling, that arise in the context of this model. We find that the nonlinearly dispersive nature of the model is responsible for standing waves in the form of discrete compactons. On the other hand, analysis of the dynamical features of the simplest nontrivial variant of the model, namely the dimer case, yields both solutions where the intensity is trapped in a single site and solutions where the intensity moves between the two sites, which suggests the possibility of moving excitations in larger lattices. Such excitations are also suggested by the dynamical evolution associated with modulational instability. Our numerical computations confirm this expectation, and we systematically construct such traveling states as exact solutions in lattices of varying size, as well as explore their stability. A remarkable feature of these traveling lattice waves is that they are of "antidark" type, i.e., they are mounted on top of a non-vanishing background. These studies shed light on the existence, stability and dynamics of such standing and traveling states in $1+1$ dimensions, and pave the way for exploration of corresponding configurations in higher dimensions.</description>
