      <title>Unveiling connectivity patterns of railway timetables through complex network theory and Infomap clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to analysing railway timetable connectivity using complex network theory and the Infomap clustering algorithm. By transforming railway timetables into network representations, we examine the connectivity and efficiency of the Norwegian railway system for the timetables of the current 2024 year and for a future timetable of year 2033. We define and apply the Timetable Connectivity Index, a comprehensive measure that evaluates the overall connectivity based on the number of services, travel times, and the hierarchical structure of the network. The analysis is conducted across three distinct network spaces: Stops, Stations, and Changes, with both unweighted and weighted networks. Our results reveal key insights into how infrastructural developments, service frequencies, and travel time adjustments influence network connectivity. The findings provide valuable insights for railway planners and operators, aiming to improve the efficiency and reliability of train networks.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Independence Breeds Disruption but Limits Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recombinant growth theory highlights the pivotal role of cumulative knowledge in driving innovation. Although interconnected knowledge facilitates smoother dissemination, its connection to scientific disruption remains poorly understood. Here, we quantify knowledge dependence based on the degree to which references within a given paper's bibliography cite one another. Analyzing 53.8 million papers spanning six decades, we observe that papers built on independent knowledge have decreased over time. However, propensity score matching and regression analyses reveal that such papers are associated with greater scientific disruption, as those who cite them are less likely to cite their references. Moreover, a team's preference for independent knowledge amplifies its disruptive potential, regardless of team size, geographic distance, or collaboration freshness. Despite the disruptive nature, papers built on independent knowledge receive fewer citations and delayed recognition. Taken together, these findings fill a critical gap in our fundamental understanding of scientific innovation, revealing a universal law in peer recognition: Knowledge independence breeds disruption at the cost of impact.</description>

      <title>Predicting the critical behavior of complex dynamic systems via learning the governing mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Critical points separate distinct dynamical regimes of complex systems, often delimiting functional or macroscopic phases in which the system operates. However, the long-term prediction of critical regimes and behaviors is challenging given the narrow set of parameters from which they emerge. Here, we propose a framework to learn the rules that govern the dynamic processes of a system. The learned governing rules further refine and guide the representative learning of neural networks from a series of dynamic graphs. This combination enables knowledge-based prediction for the critical behaviors of dynamical networked systems. We evaluate the performance of our framework in predicting two typical critical behaviors in spreading dynamics on various synthetic and real-world networks. Our results show that governing rules can be learned effectively and significantly improve prediction accuracy. Our framework demonstrates a scenario for facilitating the representability of deep neural networks through learning the underlying mechanism, which aims to steer applications for predicting complex behavior that learnable physical rules can drive.</description>

      <title>Working with Large Language Models to Enhance Messaging Effectiveness for Vaccine Confidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vaccine hesitancy and misinformation are significant barriers to achieving widespread vaccination coverage. Smaller public health departments may lack the expertise or resources to craft effective vaccine messaging. This paper explores the potential of ChatGPT-augmented messaging to promote confidence in vaccination uptake.
  We conducted a survey in which participants chose between pairs of vaccination messages and assessed which was more persuasive and to what extent. In each pair, one message was the original, and the other was augmented by ChatGPT. At the end of the survey, participants were informed that half of the messages had been generated by ChatGPT. They were then asked to provide both quantitative and qualitative responses regarding how knowledge of a message's ChatGPT origin affected their impressions.
  Overall, ChatGPT-augmented messages were rated slightly higher than the original messages. These messages generally scored better when they were longer. Respondents did not express major concerns about ChatGPT-generated content, nor was there a significant relationship between participants' views on ChatGPT and their message ratings. Notably, there was a correlation between whether a message appeared first or second in a pair and its score.
  These results point to the potential of ChatGPT to enhance vaccine messaging, suggesting a promising direction for future research on human-AI collaboration in public health communication.</description>

      <title>Modelling &amp; Steady State Compliance Testing of an Improved Time Synchronized Phasor Measurement Unit Based on IEEE Standard C37.118.1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synchrophasor technology is an emerging and developing technology for monitoring and control of wide area measurement systems (WAMS). In an elementary WAMS, two identical phasors measured at two different locations have difference in the phase angles measured since their reference waveforms are not synchronized with each other. Phasor measurement units (PMUs) measure input phasors with respect to a common reference wave based on the atomic clock pulses received from global positioning system (GPS) satellites, eliminating variation in the measured phase angles due to distant locations of the measurement nodes. This has found tremendous applications in quick fault detection, fault location analysis, accurate current, voltage, frequency and phase angle measurements in WAMS. Commercially available PMU models are often proven to be expensive for research and development as well as for grid integration projects. This research article proposes an economic PMU model optimized for accurate steadystate performance based on recursive discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and provides results and detailed analysis of the proposed PMU model as per the steady state compliance specifications of IEEE standard C37.118.1. Results accurate up to 13 digits after decimal point are obtained through the developed PMU model for both nominal and off-nominal frequency inputs in steady state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we have shown that the distributions of ksi satisfy an exponential law for real networks while the distributions of ksi for random networks are bell-shaped and closer to the normal distribution. The ksi distributions for Barabasi-Albert and Watts-Strogatz networks are similar to the ksi distributions for random networks (bell-shaped) for most parameters, but when these parameters become small enough, the Barabasi-Albert and Watts-Strogatz networks become more realistic with respect to the ksi distributions.</description>

      <title>Analogical models to introduce high school students to modern physics: an inquiry-based activity on Rutherford's gold foil experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of a didactic proposal on Rutherford's gold foil experiment, tailored for high schools. Grounded in constructivist pedagogy, the activity introduces key concepts of modern physics-often absent from standard curricula-through a hands on, inquiry-based approach. By employing analogical reasoning and black box modeling, students engage in experimental investigation and collaborative problem-solving to explore atomic structure. The activity was implemented as a case study with a class of first-year students (aged 14-15) from a applied science-focused secondary school in Italy. Data collection combined qualitative observations, structured discussions, and digital feedback tools to assess conceptual learning and student engagement. Findings indicate that well-designed, student-centered interventions can meaningfully support the development of abstract scientific understanding, while fostering critical thinking and collaborative skills.</description>

      <title>Majority voting is not good for heaven or hell, with mirrored performance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00592v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the ViSE (Voting in Stochastic Environment) model, we study the effectiveness of majority voting in various environments. By the pit of losses paradox identified in previous work, majority decisions in apparently hostile environments tend to reduce the capital of society. In such cases, the simple social decision rule of "rejecting all proposals without voting" outperforms majority voting. In this paper, we identify another pit of losses appearing in favorable environments. Here, the simple social decision rule of "accepting all proposals without voting" is superior to majority voting. We prove that under a version of simple majority called symmetrized majority and the antisymmetry of the voting body, the second pit of losses is a mirror image of the pit of losses in hostile environments and explain this phenomenon. Technically, we consider a voting society consisting of individualists whose strategy is supporting all proposals that increase their capital and a group (groups) whose members vote to increase the wealth of their group. According to the main result, the expected capital gain of each agent in the environment whose generator $X$ has mean $\mu&gt;0$ exceeds by $\mu$ their expected capital gain under generator $-X$. This result extends to location families of generators with distributions symmetric about their mean. The mentioned result determines the symmetry of the difference between the expected capital gain under the symmetrized majority and that under the "basic" social decision rule that rejects (resp. accepts) all proposals in unfavorable (resp. favorable) environments.</description>

      <title>Learning about the liveability of cities from young migrants using the combinatiorial Hodge theory approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11166v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Migration involves making a significant decision to leave one place and settle in another, entailing substantial career and lifestyle changes. Migration flows are then the collection of individuals' comparative evaluations of origin-destination pairs, implicitly revealing people's preferences about where to live as people ``vote with their feet'' (Tiebout, 1956). However, is it possible to derive a consistent measure of the liveability of cities from these flows? We propose a combinatorial-Hodge-theory approach: the empirical liveability of cities is evaluated by a potential governing unbalanced, acyclic migrations between cities. As a case study, we measure the liveability of municipalities in Japan for specific populations such as families with small children and women of reproductive age in a population-decline society. Using these potentials as dependent variables, we perform a regression analysis to identify the factors relevant to liveability. We also derive analytical expressions that allow us to interpret as potentials the standards of living or utilities, estimated in the economics literature (Douglas &amp; Wall, 1993; Douglas, 1997; Douglas &amp; Wall, 2000; Wall, 2001; Nakajima &amp; Tabuchi, 2011). The proposed method extracts a consistent metric of interval scale from the non-transitive, pairwise comparison between locations and provides substantial statistics for urban planning by policymakers.</description>

      <title>Observing network dynamics through sentinel nodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00045v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A fundamental premise of statistical physics is that the particles in a physical system are interchangeable, and hence the state of each specific component is representative of the system as a whole. This assumption breaks down for complex networks, in which nodes may be extremely diverse, and no single component can truly represent the state of the entire system. It seems, therefore, that to observe the dynamics of social, biological or technological networks, one must extract the dynamic states of a large number of nodes -- a task that is often practically prohibitive. To overcome this challenge, we use machine learning techniques to detect the network's sentinel nodes, a set of network components whose combined states can help approximate the average dynamics of the entire network. The method allows us to assess the equilibrium state of a large complex system by tracking just a small number of carefully selected nodes. We find that the sentinels are mainly determined by the network structure such that they can be extracted even with little knowledge of the system's specific interaction dynamics. Therefore, the network's sentinels offer a natural probe by which to observe the system's dynamic states. Intriguingly, sentinels tend to avoid the highly central nodes such as the hubs.</description>

      <title>Oscillatory and Excitable Dynamics in an Opinion Model with Group Opinions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In traditional models of opinion dynamics, each agent in a network has an opinion and changes in opinions arise from pairwise (i.e., dyadic) interactions between agents. However, in many situations, groups of individuals possess a collective opinion that can differ from the opinions of its constituent individuals. In this paper, we study the effects of group opinions on opinion dynamics. We formulate a hypergraph model in which both individual agents and groups of 3 agents have opinions, and we examine how opinions evolve through both dyadic interactions and group memberships. In some parameter regimes, we find that the presence of group opinions can lead to oscillatory and excitable opinion dynamics. In the oscillatory regime, the mean opinion of the agents in a network has self-sustained oscillations. In the excitable regime, finite-size effects create large but short-lived opinion swings (as in social fads). We develop a mean-field approximation of our model and obtain good agreement with direct numerical simulations. We also show -- both numerically and via our mean-field description -- that oscillatory dynamics occur only when the number of dyadic and polyadic interactions per agent are not completely correlated. Our results illustrate how polyadic structures, such as groups of agents, can have important effects on collective opinion dynamics.</description>

      <title>Self-organized institutions in evolutionary dynamical-systems game</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07249v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Social institutions are systems of shared norms and rules that regulate people's behaviors, often emerging without external enforcement. They provide criteria to distinguish cooperation from defection and establish rules to sustain cooperation, shaped through long-term trial and error. While principles for successful institutions have been proposed, the mechanisms underlying their emergence remain poorly understood. Here, we introduce the evolutionary dynamical-systems game, a framework that couples game actions with environmental dynamics and explores the evolution of cognitive frameworks for decision-making. We analyze a minimal model of common-pool resource management, where resources grow naturally and are harvested. Players use decision-making functions to determine whether to harvest at each step, based on environmental and peer monitoring. As these functions evolve, players detect selfish harvesting and punish it by degrading the environment through harvesting. This process leads to the self-organization of norms that classify harvesting actions as cooperative, defective, or punitive. The emergent norms for ``cooperativeness'' and rules of punishment serve as institutions. The environmental and players' states converge to distinct modes characterized by limit-cycles, representing temporal regularities in socio-ecological systems. These modes remain stable despite slight variations in decision-making, illustrating the stability of institutions. The evolutionary robustness of decision-making functions serves as a measure of the evolutionary favorability of institutions, highlighting the role of plasticity in responding to diverse opponents. This work introduces foundational concepts in evolutionary dynamical-systems games and elucidates the mechanisms underlying the self-organization of institutions by modeling the interplay between ecological dynamics and human decision-making.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Society Caused by Collective and Individual Decisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00471v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decision-making societies may vary in their level of cooperation and degree of conservatism, both of which influence their overall performance. Moreover, these factors are not fixed -- they can change based on the decisions agents in the society make in their interests. But can these changes lead to cyclical patterns in societal evolution? To explore this question, we use the ViSE (Voting in Stochastic Environment) model. In this framework, the level of cooperation can be measured by group size, while the degree of conservatism is determined by the voting threshold. Agents can adopt either individualistic or group-oriented strategies when voting on stochastically generated external proposals. For Gaussian proposal generators, the expected capital gain (ECG) -- a measure of agents' performance -- can be expressed in standard mathematical functions. Our findings show that in neutral environments, societal evolution with open or democratic groups can follow cyclic patterns. We also find that highly conservative societies or conservative societies with low levels of cooperation can evolve into liberal (less conservative than majoritarian) societies and that mafia groups never let their members go when they want to.</description>

      <title>Co-evolution of cooperation and resource allocation in the advantageous environment-based spatial multi-game using adaptive control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In real-life complex systems, individuals often encounter multiple social dilemmas that cannot be effectively captured using a single-game model. Furthermore, the environment and limited resources both play a crucial role in shaping individuals' decision-making behaviors. In this study, we employ an adaptive control mechanism by which agents may benefit from their environment, thus redefining their individual fitness. Under this setting, a detailed examination of the co-evolution of individual strategies and resource allocation is carried. Through extensive simulations, we find that the advantageous environment mechanism not only significantly increases the proportion of cooperators in the system but also influences the resource distribution among individuals. Additionally, limited resources reinforce cooperative behaviors within the system while shaping the evolutionary dynamics and strategic interactions across different dilemmas. Once the system reaches equilibrium, resource distribution becomes highly imbalanced. To promote fairer resource allocation, we introduce a minimum resource guarantee mechanism. Our results show that this mechanism not only reduces disparities in resource distribution across the entire system and among individuals in different dilemmas but also significantly enhances cooperative behavior in higher resource intervals. Finally, to assess the robustness of our model, we further examine the influence of the advantageous environment on system-wide cooperation in small-world and random graph network models.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we present new methods of measuring polarisation in social networks. We use Random Dot Product Graphs to embed social networks in metric spaces. Singular Value Decomposition of this social network then provider an embedded dimensionality which corresponds to the number of uncorrelated dimensions in the network. A decrease in the optimal dimensionality for the embedding of the network graph means that the dimensions in the network are becoming more correlated, and therefore the network is becoming more polarised.
  We demonstrate this method by analysing social networks such as communication interactions among New Zealand Twitter users discussing climate change issues and international social media discussions of the COP conferences. In both cases, the decreasing embedded dimensionality indicates that these networks have become more polarised over time. We also use networks generated by stochastic block models to explore how an increase of the isolation between distinct communities, or the increase of the predominance of one community over the other, in the social networks decrease the embedded dimensionality and are therefore identifiable as polarisation processes.</description>
