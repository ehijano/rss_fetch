      <title>Teen TITANS simulations -- I. Inefficient intermediate-mass black hole seeding via stellar collisions in young massive clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Young massive clusters (YMCs) provide favorable environments for frequent stellar collisions, potentially leading to the formation of very massive stars (VMSs) and seeds of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs). We investigate the role of repeated stellar collisions in YMCs using TITANS, a new suite of 18 direct $N$-body simulations. Our models span cluster masses $10^5 - 10^6\,\rm M_\odot$, half-mass densities $\rho_{\rm h}=100 - 10^5\,\rm M_\odot\,pc^{-3}$, and include high primordial binary fractions, consistent with observations of massive stars in young clusters. Overall, our simulations assume cluster properties that are typical of YMCs in the low-redshift Universe. We find that repeated stellar collisions are efficient only in the densest clusters with short relaxation times and are absent in systems with $\rho_{\rm h}&lt;500\,\rm M_\odot\,pc^{-3}$ and $t_{\rm rh}&gt;1.3\,\rm Gyr$. Rapid mass segregation allows massive stars to sink to the cluster center, merge, and undergo subsequent collisions, even in clusters with long core-collapse times. However, collision chains are typically triggered by primordial binary mergers and usually involve only two collisions. In our simulations, only three VMSs form through repeated collisions and reach $m_*&gt;330\,\rm M_\odot$, while most VMSs have $m_*&lt;300\,\rm M_\odot$ and form through primordial binary mergers. None constitute viable IMBH seeds, as their helium cores fall in the (pulsational) pair-instability regime. We form five IMBHs from stellar collisions involving stars at different evolutionary stages, while the dominant channel is the merger of stellar-mass black holes, producing twelve IMBHs. For properties typical of local YMCs, stellar collision chains are therefore inefficient in producing IMBHs more massive than $140\,\rm M_\odot$, as most collisionally formed VMSs attain masses that fall in the pair-instability regime.</description>

      <title>Bonnor-Ebert sphere collapse in filamentary structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Star formation within filaments may arise due to the growth of cores according to linear perturbation theory. This implies a minimum core separation, as shorter modes would not be able to grow. While many observations agree with core separations by theoretical predictions, some observations also show star forming cores which lie closer together than the minimum wavelength given by perturbation theory. We explore whether non-linear effects during the late stages of core growth can explain the discrepancy between theory and observations. We perform three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations with the Ramses code to follow the evolution of initial perturbations within filaments and compare the measured growth rates to expectations from theoretical models. Non-linear evolution sets in as soon as the core mass reaches a value where the gravitational potential is not any longer dominated by the cylindrical potential of the filament but by the spherical potential of the Bonnor-Ebert sphere. Consequently, core collapse is not triggered by the loss of hydrostatic stability of the filament but by the loss of hydrostatic stability of the Bonnor-Ebert sphere. As the core is embedded in the filament, the maximum core mass is given by the pressure within the filament which results in a constant line-mass threshold for core collapse. As core collapse is triggered as soon as overdensities reach a certain line-mass, cores which form as large line-mass perturbations during filament formation can go into direct collapse even if their separation is closer than predicted by linear perturbation theory. Therefore, our result can explain the discrepancy between theory and observations.</description>

      <title>Molecular Gas Excitation in z ~ 0.7 Gas-Rich Post-starburst Galaxies from SQuIGGLE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many post-starburst galaxies at $z\sim0.7$ have been shown to retain substantial molecular gas reservoirs yet host low ongoing star formation, suggesting that the remaining gas may be inefficient at forming stars during the early post-burst phase. We present new Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array CO(5-4) observations of nine gas-rich post-starburst galaxies at $z\sim0.7$ from the Studying Quenching in Intermediate-z Galaxies: Gas, angu$\vec{L}$ar momentum, and Evolution (SQuIGG$\vec{L}$E) survey, providing a view of the molecular gas excitation in these systems. Combined with existing CO(2-1) data, we detect CO(5-4) in 8/9 targets and find that most have moderate CO excitation with $r_{52}\equiv L'_{\rm CO(5-4)}/L'_{\rm CO(2-1)}\approx0.1-0.3$. These systems show no clear trend between $r_{52}$ and either total or surface-density of star formation. Specifically, all objects have $\Sigma_{\mathrm{SFR}} \sim 0.01-1\ \text{M}_\odot\ \text{yr}^{-1}\ \text{kpc}^{-2}$, consistent with compact, modest star formation, even when allowing for buried activity, as these galaxies decline from their peak. One object J1448+1010, which has clear optical, mid-infrared, and radio indicators of an active galactic nucleus, is an outlier with $r_{52}\approx0.6$; its elevated excitation likely requires significant non-stellar heating, with a contribution from potentially obscured star formation. Together, most gas-rich SQuIGG$\vec{L}$E post-starbursts have moderately excited molecular gas alongside little to modest star-forming activity, indicating that the remaining gas hosts relatively suppressed star formation efficiencies instead of strong buried starburst activity.</description>

      <title>There and back again? Neutral outflows in z~3.5 quiescent galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutral gas outflows play a crucial role in the baryon cycle of galaxies, their properties provide key insights into the transition from star formation to quiescence. In this work, we investigate the neutral gas outflow of 23 massive ($M_\star = 10^{10.1-11.6}\,\rm M_\odot$) quiescent galaxies (QGs) at z=2.82--4.61, selected from the JWST NIRSpec (R~1000) and NIRCam program DeepDive. We trace the neutral gas outflows using the NaI Doublet absorption lines and detect excess NaI D in 13/23 (57%) targets, of which 7/23 (30%) show blueshifted absorption with velocity offsets $|{\Delta}v|$ &gt;~ 150 km/s. The z ~ 3.5 targets have ${\Delta}v$ similar to those of their local counterparts; they are also equivalent when compared in SFR--${\Delta}v$ space. We derive mass outflow rates and identify the most extreme neutral gas outflow rate $\log(\dot M_{\rm out} / \mathrm{M_\odot \, yr}^{-1})=2.68\pm0.27$ beyond the local Universe, coincident with an X-ray AGN. For all NaI D detected systems, the inferred mass outflow rate can, in principle, suppress ongoing star formation; however, the outflows are unlikely to escape their hosts, suggesting recycling on relatively short timescales (~3--180 Myr), depending on the assumed potential and launching radius. All NaI D detected targets occupy the LI(N)ER region of the BPT diagram and/or are X-ray detected, but we find no strong correlation between ongoing AGN and the neutral outflow: 2/4 broad-line/X-ray AGNs are NaI D undetected -- yet, the outflows can be powered by fossil/episodic AGNs, and one broad-line target shows a possible P-Cygni profile that indicates strong outflows. As neutral outflows alone are not able to permanently quench star formation by removing gas in our sample at z ~ 3.5, the presence of gas cycling in and out of massive passive systems may instead be the signature of feedback-regulated quenching-maintenance processes.</description>

      <title>Scaling Relations across Galaxy Classification Schemes: I. Star Formation Rate-Stellar Mass Plane of CALIFA Nearby Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To gain deeper insights into galaxy evolution and the mechanisms driving transitions between different galaxy morphologies, we analyse the connection between star formation rate and stellar mass for 231 galaxies spanning Hubble types E1-Sdm from the Calar Alto Legacy Integral Field Spectroscopy Area survey using three complementary classification schemes. The Hubble classification provides structural information, the circular velocity curve classification$-$based on principal component analysis$-$ traces the total gravitational potential, and the Quenching classification$-$derived from H$_{\alpha}$ equivalent width maps$-$indicates the spatial extent of quenched regions relative to star-forming areas. We find a clear separation of galaxy populations on the star formation rate-stellar mass plane. Late-type spirals with slow-rising circular velocity curves, represented by star-forming and quiescent-nuclear-ring galaxies, dominate the blue cloud. Early-type spirals with flat or round-peaked circular velocity curves belonging to centrally quiescent or mixed class populate the green valley, representing a transitional stage. Elliptical and lenticular galaxies with round- or sharp-peaked circular velocity curves from nearly retired or fully retired QSs reside on the red sequence. Furthermore, our results indicate that the morphological groups Sc-Scd, Sd-Sdm, and E1-E3 are characterized by a unique set of QSs and circular velocity curves, while galaxies with morphologies such as Sa-Sbc spread over multiple QSs and circular velocity curves. The distribution of the classification classes shows a tight link between galaxy structure, gravitational potential, and suppression of star-formation in the galaxies.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian Exploration of the Mass of Ursa Major III: Kinematics, Rotation and their influence on the Mass to Light Ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the kinematics of the potential ultra-faint dwarf galaxy (UFD) UMa III/U1 using Bayesian inference to search for the signal of any potential intrinsic rotation. The magnitude of rotation is relevant to estimating the total mass of UMa III/U1, which is critical in determining whether or not UMa III/U1 is in fact a UFD, or possibly a star cluster home to a significant binary fraction. A non-rotating model and a rotational model are fitted for the current total population of member stars of UMa III/U1, finding that a non-rotating model was preferred by a factor of $\sim 5-12 \times$. This was repeated on a reduced population of UMa III/U1, where potential contaminant stars were removed. A similar preference for non-rotation was found for these reduced populations. We calculate a lower-bound rotational mass estimate for UMa III/U1 and a corresponding lower bound mass-to-light ratio of $ 734.4^{+339.0}_{-176.2} \mathrm{M_\odot} / \mathrm{L_\odot} $ for the total population. We conclude that UMa III/U1 still remains an ambiguous object with viable arguments for both the UFD and self-gravitating star cluster scenarios, however under both, UMa III/U1 is unlikely to be supported by rotational pressure.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Catalog of Radio Sources and Rotation Measures in the Perseus Molecular Cloud from Very Large Array Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive radio polarization study of the Perseus molecular cloud using wideband L-band observations from the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array. Our survey covers $\sim13.8$~deg$^2$ with a mean Stokes~$I$ sensitivity of $\sim80~\mu$Jy~beam$^{-1}$, enabling the detection of 1410 compact radio sources. From this population, we construct a catalog of source properties, including positions, integrated flux densities, and spectral indices measured across nine spectral windows. The majority of sources exhibit negative spectral indices, consistent with non-thermal synchrotron emission. Using RM Synthesis and RM CLEAN techniques, we detect 205 polarized background sources above an $8\sigma$ threshold. This corresponds to a sampling density of $\sim14.8$~deg$^{-2}$, representing more than an order-of-magnitude increase compared to previous NVSS-based measurements. The resulting rotation measures exhibit coherent large-scale variations across the surveyed region, with additional small-scale structure superimposed. The enhanced sensitivity, frequency coverage, and sampling density of our observations enable a substantially improved mapping of the line-of-sight magnetic field component toward the Perseus molecular cloud compared to previous surveys.</description>

      <title>MATLAS-42, A Globular Cluster-Rich Ultra-Diffuse Galaxy That Diverges from the "Failed Galaxy'' Formation Pathway</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To date, there has been significant interest in globular cluster (GC)-rich ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) and the evidence that they have formed via an unexpected, ``failed galaxy'' formation pathway. The majority of the evidence for ``failed galaxy'' UDGs originates from spectroscopic observations targeting passive GC-rich UDGs, with a focus on those residing in galaxy clusters. In this work, we study the gas-rich, GC-rich group UDG MATLAS-42 and derive its stellar population properties using the Keck Cosmic Web Imager. We measure a redshift for the galaxy ($V_{\rm R, \star}=2433\pm8$~km s$^{-1}$), confirming the previous assumptions that it is both part of the NGC~502 group and has an associated HI-reservoir ($V_{\rm R,HI}=2423\pm 15$~km s$^{-1}$). We measure integrated stellar populations and find the galaxy to be both young (mass-weighted age $=3.2^{+2.6}_{-1.5}$Gyr) and of average-to-low metallicity ($[M/H]=-1.19^{+0.42}_{-0.30}$ dex). When considering these properties in the context of the galaxy's formation, we note it likely does not follow the ``failed galaxy'' formation pathway commonly attributed to GC-rich, cluster UDGs, as it has experienced recent star formation. At most it started failed, however, it has recently rejuvenated its star formation. Finally, we build a toy model of the passive evolution of this galaxy, finding that its relative GC-richness (i.e., $M_{\rm GC}/M_\star$) will likely decrease with time as GCs slowly evaporate/disrupt to contribute to the stellar mass of the galaxy. Due to this, we hypothesise that it is likely not a low redshift analogue of the progenitor to a ``failed galaxy'' UDGs.</description>

      <title>Investigating the role of mergers in galaxy assembly in the early Universe (z &gt; 5)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy mergers play a crucial role in shaping the morphology, the star formation, and the mass growth of galaxies across cosmic time. While mergers have been extensively investigated in the local Universe, the evolution of their frequency and physical properties in the early Universe has yet to be fully understood. We investigate the role of mergers in a large spectroscopic sample of 1233 galaxies in the range 5&lt;z&lt;14 with good detection (S/N-pixel &gt; 3) in JWST imaging, covering six different extragalactic fields. We identify mergers from rest-frame optical disturbances in F444W, using a combination of Gini, M-20, and Asymmetry parameters. We find a morphological merger fraction f_m that does not strongly evolve with redshift from z=0 to z ~ 8. The average f_m of our primary major merger condition (Gini+0.14xM-20 &gt; 0.33, A&gt;0.35) is ~ 5 %, which increases to ~13 % for major+minor merger tracers. Accounting for the evolving observability timescale of each tracer, we find that the merger rate is strongly increasing from z=1 to 7 by more than 1 dex, averaging ~ 2 merger/galaxy/Gyr at 5&lt;z&lt;10 for major mergers (in agreement with photometric pair studies), and a factor of 3 higher for minor+major mergers. We also perform SED modeling using available HST+JWST photometry to infer stellar masses and SFRs, using a non parametric star-formation history. We find that mergers at z &gt; 5 have a significant impact, although significantly lower than at z&lt;1, on the SFR of galaxies. When averaged over 10 Myr (comparable to the observability timescale of morphological disturbances), their SFRs are a factor of 1.7 higher than a mass and redshift matched sample of non-mergers, suggesting that mergers trigger new star-formation through short-lived powerful bursty episodes. Despite this, mergers contribute only by 5% - 10% to the mass build-up of galaxies in the redshift range explored.</description>

      <title>MIGHTEE HI observations of low surface brightness and ultra-diffuse galaxies in the XMM-LSS field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Untargeted neutral hydrogen (HI) surveys are well suited to identifying low surface brightness galaxies (LSBGs) that are gas rich, and they offer a complementary view to optically selected populations. We examined the LSBG population as identified via stellar and gaseous content using the MIGHTEE HI XMM-LSS early science data and the publicly available catalogs of optically identified LSBGs. There is currently little overlap between these datasets, with only three galaxies commonly detected. We performed surface brightness photometry of selected MIGHTEE HI detections to find 29 LSBGs, and 26 of these meet the size requirement (R_eff &gt; 1.5 kpc) to be ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs). Furthermore, we extracted HI spectra at the location of all optically identified galaxies, placing upper limits on the HI-to-stellar mass ratio in these systems. While the HI-identified population overall tends toward bluer colors, the HI-identified and the optically selected samples mostly overlap in mean effective surface brightness, effective radii, and color. Although it is not straightforward to discern why the HI-identified LSBGs were missed in optical searches, this work highlights the utility of HI surveys in finding these faint systems. The HI-identified LSBGs are gas rich compared to the general HI-selected population. Furthermore, three out of four HI-selected UDGs with available kinematics show no systematic offset from the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation, although we are biased away from sources with low rotational velocities due to the low spectral resolution of the data. This work demonstrates the utility of HI observations for finding and characterizing the low surface brightness Universe.</description>

      <title>The GUAPOS project -- VII: Physical structure and molecular environment of the G31.41+0.31 HII region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ionised regions around OB-type stars are formed at an early stage of their evolution and are important to investigate the formation process of these objects. However, so far only few observations of their physical structure and interaction with the parental molecular cloud have been made. The high resolution and sensitivity of new instruments such as ALMA and the upgraded VLA allow us to fill this gap in our knowledge. We investigate the well known core-halo ultracompact HII region G31.41+0.31 and the surrounding molecular clump with the aim to determine the density and temperature of both the ionised and neutral gas, and possibly obtain a 3D picture of their spacial distribution. We take advantage of the full-band frequency coverage at 3 mm obtained with ALMA for the GUAPOS project to image the emission of a plethora of hydrogen recombination lines towards the G31.41+0.31 HII region as well as several molecular transitions which are tracers of medium-density ($\sim$$10^4$--$10^6$ cm$^{-3}$) gas. The line data are complemented by continuum measurements obtained with the VLA at 1 cm and 7 mm. By fitting these lines also using a model that takes into account non-LTE effects we can investigate the density and temperature structure and the velocity field of the region. Our findings, based on a model fit accounting for non-LTE effects, indicate that the electron temperature of the HII region is mostly spanning a range between 5000 and 6000 K, while the density varies between 2500 and 7500 cm$^{-3}$. All in all, the distribution of these parameters as well as the corresponding velocity field hint at a cometary shaped HII region expanding away from the observer to the NW. The molecular gas appears to be still infalling towards the peak of the UC HII region, and its density and temperature are consistent with pressure confinement of the ionised gas to the SE.</description>

      <title>Single and double headed ORCs in the LOFAR surveys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep radio surveys are now producing catalogues with millions of radio sources. Radio sources can have complex morphologies that depend both on the production mechanisms and the local environment. Recently, an unusual class of circular radio sources have been identified that were named "odd radio circles" (ORC). They have sizes of about 1', a circular/elliptical shape and appear edge brightened. Subsequent observations have suggested that this class may comprise a variety of sources. Despite various attempts to explain these sources, their origin remains unclear. The main goal of this work is to increase the number of known ORCs and derive common characteristics that can help identify the origin of these sources. We searched the LOFAR Two Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) data release 3 (DR3) at 144 MHz for ORCs using a combination of parameter filtering on catalogue entries and visual inspection. We then identified possible optical counterparts and derived information such as redshift, physical size, and spectral index using further radio data at 54 and 1400 MHz. We isolated 18 sources with ORC structures. Four of these are double headed ORCs (ORCs with two rings), and two are new discoveries. We also found 5 new single headed ORCs and 9 candidate ORCs. With this work we significantly expanded the population of known ORCs. Our findings confirms that ORCs are a rare and heterogenous population of radio sources. We confirm the association with large ellipticals in most cases and we note a relation between the ORCs physical size and their integrated spectral index with small ORCs avoiding steep spectra.</description>

      <title>Linear filament and nested cluster evolution tomography (LANCET) I. Capture the evolution of dense gas in 14-parsec filament G316.8</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A dynamic view of mass assembly is essential for understanding the formation of massive stars and clusters. Interpreting evolutionary diagnostics from Galactic-wide surveys, however, requires careful control of distance and environmental variations. The G316.8 filament provides an ideal laboratory: a 14-pc nearly linear structure composed of three contiguous subregions with comparable molecular gas reservoirs (~10,000 $M_\odot$ each) but spanning a clear evolutionary sequence from an infrared dark cloud (young) through a massive young stellar object (intermediate) to an HII region (evolved). As part of the Linear filament and nested cluster evolution tomography (LANCET) project, we mapped the full filament with the Atacama Compact Array at 1.3 mm, achieving 0.08 pc resolution over 17.1 pc$^2$. Combined with Herschel and APEX/ArT\'eMiS data, we derived high-resolution temperature and column-density maps. We quantify structural evolution using dense-fragment statistics, column-density PDFs, and $\Delta$-variance analysis. From young to evolved regions, the maximum fragment mass increases from 8 to 490 $M_\odot$, while the dense-gas mass fraction ($&gt;0.5$ g cm$^{-2}$) rises from 0.4% to 9.6%. The N-PDF develops a secondary power-law tail and the $\Delta$-variance slope becomes progressively shallower, indicating ongoing assembly of dense sub-parsec structures. Our further ALMA 12m continuum and spectral line data will extend this dynamic scenarios down to 800 AU scale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integral Field Spectroscopy (IFS) surveys offer a unique new landscape in which to learn in both spatial and spectroscopic dimensions and could help uncover previously unknown insights into galaxy evolution. In this work, we demonstrate a new unsupervised deep learning framework using Convolutional Long-Short Term Memory Network Autoencoders to encode generalized feature representations across both spatial and spectroscopic dimensions spanning $19$ optical emission lines (3800A $&lt; \lambda &lt;$ 8000A) among a sample of $\sim 9000$ galaxies from the MaNGA IFS survey. As a demonstrative exercise, we assess our model on a sample of $290$ Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and highlight scientifically interesting characteristics of some highly anomalous AGN.</description>

      <title>Addressing the Impact of Solar Modulation Systematic Uncertainties on Cosmic-Ray Propagation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive analysis of cosmic-ray propagation using the time-dependent AMS-02 flux measurements covering a full solar cycle, with particular emphasis on the role of solar modulation. We fit two representative Galactic propagation scenarios, convection- and re-acceleration-dominated models, in combination with three solar modulation prescriptions: the standard force-field approximation, an extended force-field model with a rigidity break, and the heliospheric propagation code $\texttt{HelMod}$. The inclusion of time-resolved antiproton data provides a unique probe of charge-sign-dependent modulation effects and low-energy systematics. We find that the force-field approximation can describe positively charged nuclei reasonably well outside the solar maximum in convection-dominated models, but fails during periods of high solar activity and for antiprotons at all times. In re-acceleration scenarios, strong degeneracies between solar modulation and low-energy propagation lead to unphysical results when simple modulation models are employed. Across all models, we identify systematic uncertainties of order 10-15% in the reconstructed local interstellar spectra and propagation parameters, driven by limitations in current solar modulation modelling. Compared to the percent level error of current measurements, these uncertainties significantly limit the precision of cosmic-ray studies. Future time-dependent measurements spanning a full 22-year solar cycle will be crucial to reduce these uncertainties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astronomical images often show sharp features that are caused by cosmic ray (CR) hits, hot pixels, or non-Gaussian noise. L.A.Cosmic (van Dokkum 2001) is a widely used edge detection algorithm that identifies and replaces such features. Here we describe dfcosmic, a direct python port of L.A.Cosmic utilizing PyTorch and C++ to enable efficient performance on both CPUs and GPUs. The code was developed for the MOTHRA array, which is projected to produce more than 1000 large format CMOS images every 15 minutes. Compared to previous python implementations, dfcosmic achieves a speed gain of at least 20%.</description>

      <title>A method to derive self-consistent NLTE astrophysical parameters for 4 million high-resolution 4MOST stellar spectra in half a day with invertible neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern spectroscopic surveys obtain spectra for millions of stars. However, classical spectroscopic methods can often be computationally expensive, rendering them impractical for the analysis of large datasets. We introduce a novel simulation-based deep-learning approach for the efficient analysis of high-resolution stellar spectra to be obtained with the upcoming high-resolution 4MOST spectrograph. We used a suite of synthetic non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) spectra generated with Turbospectrum to mimic 4MOST observations and trained a conditional invertible neural network (cINN) for the purpose of predicting self-consistently stellar surface parameters and chemical abundances. The cINN is a neural network architecture that estimates full posterior distributions for the target stellar properties, providing an intrinsic uncertainty estimate. We evaluated the predictive performance of the trained cINN model on both synthetic data and observed spectra of stars. We found that our new cINN trained on NLTE synthetic spectra is capable of recovering stellar parameters with average errors ($\sigma$) of $33$ K for $T_\mathrm{eff}$, $0.16$ dex for $\log(g)$, and $0.12$ dex for [Fe/H], $0.1$ dex for [Ca/Fe], $0.11$ for [Mg/Fe], and $0.51$ dex for [Li/Fe], respectively, at a signal to noise ratio of 250 per Angstrom. From the analysis of the observed spectra of Gaia-ESO / 4MOST / PLATO benchmark stars, we verified that our NLTE estimates for stellar parameters and abundances are consistent with results obtained with the independent code TSFitPy. We conclude that the NLTE cINN is robust and can, theoretically, evaluate 4 million high-resolution 4MOST spectra in less than a day, using GPU acceleration.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Electron Density Profile in Nearby Galaxies using SDSS MaNGA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13677v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most observational studies of galactic-scale magnetic fields using Faraday rotation rely on estimates of thermal electron densities in galaxies and their radial variations. However, the spatial distribution of electrons in the interstellar medium (ISM) is not clearly known. In this study, we propose and utilize collision-excited doublet emission line ratios of [S II] $\lambda\lambda$ 6716, 6731 $\r{A}$ to estimate the electron densities ($n_e$). To map their distribution in the galaxies, we employ IFU spectroscopic observations from the SDSS MaNGA survey, utilising data products from both the MaNGA Data Analysis Pipeline (DAP). We present a spatially resolved analysis of $66$ face-on galaxies (inclination, $i \leq 15^\circ$), including $46$ star-forming galaxies (SFGs) and $20$ Non-SFGs. Azimuthally averaged radial profiles of $n_e$ are obtained. We found that both SFGs and Non-SFGs exhibit $n_e$ gradients, with higher densities of $n_e$(S II) = $52.87 \pm 8.32$ cm$^{-3}$ and $99.39 \pm 24.37$ cm$^{-3}$, respectively, in the inner disk region (r/R$_e$ $\leq$ 1.5), which decreases to $n_e$(S II) = $20.92 \pm 4.2$ cm$^{-3}$ in SFGs and $34.64 \pm 11.24$ cm$^{-3}$ in Non-SFGs, in the outer disk region (r/R$_e$ $&gt;$ 1.5). We have also analysed these sources with Pipe3D fluxes. We translated $n_e$ to electron column densities ($N_e$) by assuming a typical disk of thickness 1 kpc and note that $N_e \sim 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ at $\sim$14 kpc in the disk outer region. We have also discussed the profiles obtained using [O II] $\lambda\lambda$ 3726, 3729 $\r{A}$ doublet. These electron density estimates at different radii provide valuable insights for resolving ambiguities in current and future studies of magnetic fields in galaxies.</description>

      <title>The Cosmic Owl: Twin Active Collisional Ring Galaxies with Starburst Merging Front at $z=1.14$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galaxy mergers play a critical role in driving galaxy evolution, especially by transforming galaxy morphology, redistributing gas around galaxies, triggering active galactic nuclei (AGN), and stimulating star formation. We present the Cosmic Owl, a galaxy merger at $z=1.14$, identified in the COSMOS field. Deep imaging and spectroscopy from JWST, ALMA, and VLA reveal a complex system of twin collisional ring galaxies, exhibiting nearly identical morphologies. The grism spectra from the JWST COSMOS-3D program confirm that both galaxies host an AGN. A bipolar radio jet from one AGN extends to strike the merging front. In addition, we detect a starburst at the merging front, characterized by luminous extended nebular line emission and a massive cold gas reservoir. This starburst is likely triggered by interstellar shocks induced by galaxy collision and the AGN jet. The twin ring structure of the Cosmic Owl requires further numerical simulations to clarify the precise conditions that lead to the formation of this rare morphology. This system exemplifies how shock-induced star formation, driven by galaxy collision or AGN jet, can act as a crucial mechanism for triggering intense starbursts in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>No evidence for Keplerian taper of far-out galactic rotation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12120v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a statistical analysis of the 175 SPARC galactic rotation curves to test the hypothesis of whether the Keplerian velocity tapering at large radii ($V(r)\propto 1/\sqrt{r}$) germane to a convergent mass distribution in typical spherical halo models agrees with observational data. The null hypothesis is Rubin's flat-rotation curve, $V(r)=\text{constant}$ -such as can be obtained from a spherical, isothermal-like density profile, or alternatively with a very prolate halo-. To decide whether we adopt the null (Rubin behaviour) or alternative (Keplerian behaviour) hypothesis, we evaluate the derivative in each galaxy of $V(r)$ with its last data points. The test is model independent inasmuch we are testing for the \emph{slope} of the dark matter rotation curve, whether it is or not compatible with zero. We conclude that the data is presently compatible with the null hypothesis -no taper off, no decline of $V(r)$ is seen. Separately, beyond SPARC, our own Milky Way galaxy, for which recent data sets have been reported, does show clear $V(r)$ fall-off at the level of 20\%.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Baryonic Effects on the Dynamical Masses Inferred Using Satellite Kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Satellite kinematics offers a powerful method to infer dynamical halo masses and has been demonstrated to yield tight constraints on the galaxy-halo connection. However, previous studies have assumed that the halos in which the satellites orbit are composed solely of dark matter, neglecting the role of baryons. Here, we develop an analytical model incorporating stars, gas, and the adiabatic response of dark matter to assess the impact of baryonic effects on the inference from satellite kinematics. The model covers halos in the mass range $10^{12}-10^{15}M_\odot$ and is tuned to agree with well-established observational scaling relations. In addition, the model uses simple functional forms for the mass fractions of ejected baryons and diffuse halo stars, calibrated to the median trends in the EAGLE hydrodynamical simulations. We find that baryonic effects mainly result in a reduction of the satellite line-of-sight velocity dispersion due to the ejection of baryons and the resulting response of the dark matter halo. The effect is minimal (less than 1%) for the most massive halos, but reaches ~5-6% for halos in the mass range $10^{12}-10^{13}M_\odot$, and up to 8% in extreme cases. We propose a simple formalism for correcting the satellite line-of-sight velocity dispersion for baryonic effects, and for marginalizing over the uncertainties. We integrate this correction function into BASILISK, a Bayesian hierarchical inference method applied to satellite kinematics data extracted from large redshift surveys, and find that this shifts central galaxies to higher inferred halo masses at fixed luminosity by up to ~0.3 dex. In a forthcoming work, we demonstrate that these few-percent level baryonic effects can have a non-negligible impact on the inference of cosmological parameters, motivating a novel approach to constraining the efficiency of feedback processes associated with galaxy formation.</description>

      <title>The Galaxy Activity, Torus, and Outflow Survey (GATOS): N. Unveiling physical processes in local active galaxies. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of JWST MIRI/MRS observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14019v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rise of the integral field spectroscopy, we are currently dealing with large amounts of spatially resolved data, whose analysis has become challenging, especially when observing complex objects such as nearby galaxies. We aim to develop a method to automatically separate different physical regions within the central parts (1"~160 pc, on average) of galaxies. This can allow us to better understand the systems, and provide an initial characterisation of the main ionisation sources affecting its evolution. We have developed an unsupervised hierarchical clustering algorithm to analyse data cubes based on spectral similarity. It clusters together spaxels with similar spectra, which is useful to disentangle between different physical processes. We have applied this method to a sample of 15 nearby (distances &lt;100 Mpc) galaxies, 7 from the Galaxy Activity, Torus, and Outflow Survey (GATOS) and 8 archival sources, all observed with the medium resolution spectrometer (MRS) of the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) on board of the JWST. From the clusters, we computed their median spectrum and measured the line and continuum properties. We used these measurements to train random forest models and create several empirical mid-IR diagnostic diagrams for the MRS channel 3 wavelength range, including among others the bright [Ne II], [Ne III], and [Ne V] lines, several H2 transitions, and PAH features. The clustering technique allows to differentiate emission coming from an AGN, the disc, and star forming regions in galaxies, and other composite regions, potentially ionised by several sources simultaneously. This is supported by the results from the empirical diagnostic diagrams, that are indeed able to separate physically distinct regions. This innovative method serves as a tool to identify regions of interest in any data cube prior to an in-depth analysis of the sources. [abridged]</description>

Abstract: Now detected out to redshifts of $z\sim 14.5$, the rest-frame ultraviolet and optical spectra of galaxies encode numerous physical properties of the interstellar medium (ISM). Accurately extracting these properties from spectra remains a key challenge that numerical simulations are uniquely suited to address. We present a study of the observed ISM of galaxies in MEGATRON: a suite of cosmological radiation hydrodynamics simulations coupled to on-the-fly non-equilibrium thermochemistry, with multiple prescriptions for star formation/feedback and parsec-scale resolution; capable of directly predicting spectroscopic properties of early galaxies. We find that irrespective of feedback physics used, the ISM of high-redshift galaxies is denser, less metal enriched, and subject to higher ionization parameters and radiation fields compared to similar mass galaxies in the local Universe -- in agreement with interpretations of JWST observations. Using common observational techniques to infer bulk galaxy properties, we find that ISM gas density controls the slope of the mass-metallicity relation. Similarly, at the densities reached in some high-redshift galaxies, O32 becomes a density tracer rather than one of ionization parameter. This motivates the use of other line ratios like C43 and N43 to infer the ionization state of the gas. Finally, various feedback models populate different regions of strong-line diagnostic diagrams as the line ratios are sensitive to the feedback-modulated density-temperature structure of the ISM. Therefore, observed strong-line diagnostics can provide a strong constraint on the underlying physics of star formation and feedback in the high-redshift Universe.</description>

      <title>The Sunburst Arc with JWST. IV. The importance of interaction, turbulence, and feedback for Lyman-continuum escape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11702v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At present, the best opportunity for detailed Lyman Continuum escape studies is in gravitationally lensed galaxies at z &gt;~ 2. Only one such galaxy currently exists in the literature with sufficient spatial magnification: The Sunburst Arc at redshift z = 2.37. Here, we present rest-frame optical JWST NIRSpec integral field observations of the Sunburst Arc that cover a large fraction of the source plane. From this dataset, we generate precise maps of ISM kinematics, dust geometry, ionization, and chemical enrichment. We extract a stacked spectrum of five gravitationally lensed images of the Lyman-Continuum leaking cluster, as well as an magnification-corrected, integrated spectrum of most of the galaxy, enabling a direct comparison to other LyC leakers in the literature. We find that the galaxy rotates but also shows strong, possibly dominant, signatures of turbulence, which are indicative of recent or ongoing major interaction. The cluster that leaks ionizing photons shows little variation in kinematics or dust coverage, but dramatically elevated ionization, indicating that photoionization is the predominant mechanism that creates paths for LyC escape. We conjecture that tidal stripping of H I gas due to an interaction could have removed a large portion of the neutral ISM around the LyC emitting cluster, making it easier for the cluster to completely ionize the rest.</description>

      <title>The PAU Survey: The $i$-band galaxy luminosity function from the present-day to $z = 2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a measurement of the $i$-band galaxy luminosity function from the present-day to $z = 2$, using over 1.1 million galaxies from the Physics of the Accelerating Universe Survey (PAUS). PAUS combines broad-band imaging from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey with narrow-band photometry from PAUCam, enabling high-precision photometric redshifts with an accuracy of $\sigma_{68} (\Delta z) = 0.019$ down to $i_{\textrm{AB}} = 23$. A synthetic lightcone mock catalogue built using the \texttt{GALFORM} semi-analytic model is used to simulate PAUS selection effects and photometric uncertainties, and to derive a machine-learning based estimate of the $k$-correction. We recover rest-frame $i$-band luminosities using a random forest regressor trained on simulated $ugriz$ photometry and redshifts. Luminosity functions are estimated using the $1/V_{\textrm{max}}$ method, accounting for photometric redshift and magnitude errors, and validated against mock data. We find good agreement between observations and models at $z &lt; 1$, with increasing discrepancies at higher redshifts due to photometric redshift outliers. The bright-end of the luminosity function becomes flatter at high redshift, primarily driven by redshift errors. We show that the faint-end of the luminosity function becomes more incomplete with increasing redshift, but is still useful for constraining models. We analyze the red and blue galaxy populations separately, observing distinct evolutionary trends. The model overpredicts the number of both faint red and blue galaxies. Our study highlights the importance of accurate redshift estimation and selection modeling for robust luminosity function recovery, and demonstrates that PAUS can characterise the galaxy population with photometric redshifts across a wide redshift baseline.</description>

      <title>Simulating Disky Broad Line Region Reverberation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variability studies of the broad emission lines of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) and quasars show stochastic radial velocity variations (i.e., fluctuations in the centroid of the line), 'jitter', on timescales of weeks to months. This jitter may be intrinsic as the broad-line emitting region (BLR) reverberates from the AGN continuum. There are also coordinated variations in the width of the broad emission lines and the luminosity of the central source ('breathing' or 'anti-breathing') which remain unexplained. These can be used as a tool for testing models of the BLR. We have constructed a pipeline to simulate a disk-like BLR geometry that reverberates in response to various chosen continuum light curves and produce synthetic emission line profiles. These profiles can then be characterized by measured shape parameters (centroid velocity shift, velocity dispersion, and Pearson skewness coefficient) and compared to observed time series of those same parameters. We have found that through our pipeline, we can recreate the velocity jitter at similar variations found in observations. The computational tools presented in this paper will also be applicable to case studies of quasars observed under the Sloan Digital Sky Survey V (SDSS-V) Black Hole Mapper reverberation mapping program. This paper is the first in a series of papers -- in this paper, we present the model and pipeline, and in future papers, we will present applications.</description>

      <title>PDRs4All XXI. JWST-NIRCam Photometric properties of protoplanetary disks in the Orion Nebula Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16262v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the high angular resolution NIRCam images from the PDRs4All program, combined with those of GTO program 1256, to extract key properties of disks in the Orion Nebula Cluster. We measure disk radii in silhouette against the bright background, identify dissociation fronts (DFs) and ionization fronts (IFs), determine Paschen $\alpha$ intensities, and derive near-infrared spectral energy distributions (SEDs). From these diagnostics we define a typology of ONC disks. Type I sources show merged IFs and DFs close to the disk surface. Type II sources have DFs at the disk surface and IFs located tens of astronomical units away. Type III sources show a DF at the disk surface but no IF. For all types, PAH emission traces the PDR. We find that the disk radius $r_{\rm disk}$ increases with projected distance to the ionizing source $d_{\rm proj}$, following $r_{\rm disk} \propto d_{\rm proj}^{0.30}$, consistent with disk truncation by photoevaporation. Disk radii measured in the infrared are larger than those measured at millimeter wavelengths, suggesting radial dust segregation within the disks. In agreement with PDR models, the thermal pressure in the disk PDR increases with the FUV radiation field $G_0$, but with a flatter slope. Finally, the SEDs of candidate Jupiter Mass Binary Objects (JuMBOs) are similar to those of Type III disks, except for JuMBO24, which resembles a Type I or Type II source. Its SED is consistent with a young low-mass binary hosting an unresolved ionized disk.</description>

      <title>The dramatic transition of the extreme Red Supergiant WOH G64 to a Yellow Hypergiant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19329v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Red Supergiants (RSGs) are cool, evolved massive stars in their final evolutionary stage before exploding as a supernova. However, the evolution and fate of the most luminous RSGs remain uncertain. Observational evidence for luminous warm, post-RSG objects and the apparent lack of luminous RSGs as supernova progenitors suggest a blueward evolution. Since the 1980s, WOH G64 has been considered the most extreme RSG in the Large Magellanic Cloud, given its large obscuration, outstanding size, luminosity, and mass-loss rate. Here we report a sudden, yet smooth change in its apparent nature. Time-series photometry and subsequent spectroscopy revealed the most extreme transition ever seen in the optical spectral features of a RSG. We discovered that WOH G64 is a rare, massive symbiotic binary system where the RSG transitioned to a Yellow Hypergiant. The dramatic transition can be explained either by the partial ejection of the pseudo-atmosphere during a common-envelope phase, or the return to a quiescent state after an outstanding eruption exceeding 30 years. WOH G64 offers a unique opportunity to witness stellar evolution in real-time and assess the role of binarity on the final phases of massive stars and their resulting supernovae.</description>

      <title>Redshift Assessment Infrastructure Layers (RAIL): Rubin-era photometric redshift stress-testing and at-scale production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02928v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Virtually all extragalactic use cases of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) require the use of galaxy redshift information, yet the vast majority of its sample of tens of billions of galaxies will lack high-fidelity spectroscopic measurements thereof, instead relying on photometric redshifts (photo-$z$) subject to systematic imprecision and inaccuracy best encapsulated by photo-$z$ probability density functions (PDFs). We present the version 1 release of Redshift Assessment Infrastructure Layers (RAIL), an open source Python library for at-scale probabilistic photo-$z$ estimation, initiated by the LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC) with contributions from the LSST Interdisciplinary Network for Collaboration and Computing (LINCC) Frameworks team. RAIL's three subpackages provide modular tools for end-to-end stress-testing, including a forward modeling suite to generate realistically complex photometry, a unified API for estimating per-galaxy and ensemble redshift PDFs by an extensible set of algorithms, and built-in metrics of both photo-$z$ PDFs and point estimates. RAIL serves as a flexible toolkit enabling the derivation and optimization of photo-$z$ data products at scale for a variety of science goals and is not specific to LSST data. We thus describe to the extragalactic science community, including and beyond Rubin the design and functionality of the RAIL software library so that any researcher may have access to its wide array of photo-$z$ characterization and assessment tools.</description>

      <title>HOLISMOKES XVII: Detecting strongly lensed SNe Ia from time series of multi-band LSST-like imaging data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22076v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strong gravitationally lensed supernovae (LSNe), though rare, are exceptionally valuable probes for cosmology and astrophysics. Upcoming time-domain surveys like the Vera Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) offer a major opportunity to discover them in large numbers. Early identification is crucial for timely follow-up observations. We develop a deep learning pipeline to detect LSNe using multi-band, multi-epoch image cutouts. Our model is based on a 2D convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM2D) architecture, designed to capture both spatial and temporal correlations in time-series imaging data. Predictions are made after each observation in the time series, with accuracy improving as more data arrive. We train the model on realistic simulations derived from Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) data, which closely matches LSST in depth and filters. This work focuses exclusively on Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). LSNe Ia are injected onto HSC luminous red galaxies (LRGs) at various phases of evolution to create positive examples. Negative examples include variable sources from HSC Transient Survey (including unclassified transients), and simulated unlensed SNe Ia in LRG and spiral galaxies. Our multi-band model shows rapid classification improvements during the initial few observations and quickly reaches high detection efficiency: at a fixed false-positive rate (FPR) of $0.01\%$, the true-positive rate (TPR) reaches $\gtrsim 60\%$ by the 7th observation and exceeds $\gtrsim 70\%$ by the 9th. Among the negative examples, SNe in LRGs remain the primary source of FPR, as they can resemble their lensed counterparts under certain conditions. The model detects quads more effectively than doubles and performs better on systems with larger image separations. Although trained and tested on HSC-like data, our approach applies to any cadenced imaging survey, particularly LSST.</description>

      <title>DRAGNs in the Forest: Identifying Artifacts with Random Forest Models in the VLASS DRAGNs Catalog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20999v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Quick Look data products from the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS) contain widespread imaging artifacts arising from the simplified imaging algorithm used in their production. The catalog of double radio sources associated with active galactic nuclei (DRAGNs) found in the VLASS first epoch Quick Look release using the DRAGNhunter algorithm suffers from contamination from these artifacts. These sources contain two or three individual components, each of which can be an artifact. We train random forest models to classify these DRAGNs based on the number of artifacts they contain, ranging from zero to three artifacts. We optimize our models and mitigate the class imbalance of our dataset with judicious training set selection, and the best of our models achieves a weighted F1 score of $97.01\%^{+1.12\%}_{-1.32\%}$. Using our classifications, we produce a catalog of VLASS DRAGNs from which an estimated 99.3% complete catalog of 97.7% artifact-free sources can be extracted.</description>
