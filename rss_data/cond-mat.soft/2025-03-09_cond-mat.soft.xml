      <title>Giant mobility of surface-trapped ionic charges following liquid tribocharging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sliding motion of aqueous droplets on hydrophobic surfaces leads to charge separation at the trailing edge, with implications from triple-line friction to hydrovoltaic energy generation. Charges deposited on the solid surface have been attributed to stem from ions or electrons ripped off from the liquid drop. However, the dynamics and exact physicochemical nature of these surface-trapped charges remains poorly explored. Here, we take advantage of a scanning-based electrostatic mapping technique, to directly quantify the spatiotemporal dynamics of surface deposited charges in the wake of droplets sliding on hydrophobic surfaces. We confirm the ionic nature of these interfacially trapped charges, and evidence that they undergo very fast bidimensional diffusive transport, gliding with low friction at the solid/gas interface. We rationalize our observations through molecular dynamics simulation of hydrated ions adsorbed on solid surfaces, revealing a peculiar transport mechanism limited by purely interfacial friction of the ionic solvation shell with the solid surface. By uncovering the unexpected dynamics of these ionic puddles - a new state of interfacial ionic matter - our findings have general implications for molecular-scale ionic transport and electrified matter at interfaces.</description>

      <title>Multi-phase-field Models of Biological Tissues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of complex multicellular organisms from a single parent cell is a highly orchestrated process that cells conduct collectively without central guidance, creating intricate dynamic patterns essential for development and regeneration. Despite significant advances in imaging spatiotemporal dynamics of cell collectives and mechanical characterization techniques, the role of physical forces in biological functions remains poorly understood. Physics-based models are crucial in complementing experiments, providing high-resolution spatiotemporal fields in three dimensions. This review focuses on dense, soft multicellular systems, such as tissues, where mechanical deformation of one cell necessitates the re-organization of neighboring cells. The multi-phase-field model offers a rich physics-based framework to advance our understanding of biological systems and provides a robust playground for non-equilibrium physics of active matter. We discuss the foundational aspects of the multi-phase-field model and their applications in understanding physics of active matter. We also explore the integration of biological physics with experimental data, covering cell migration, heterogeneous cell populations, and confined systems. Finally, we highlight current trends, the importance of multi-phase-field models in biological and physics research, and future challenges.</description>

      <title>Collective Dynamics and Topological Locking in Knotted Ring Polymers: A Novel Phenomenological Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel phenomenological theory describing how topological constraints in prime-knot ring polymers induce collective (cooperative) modes of motion. In low-complexity knots, chain segments can move quasi-independently. However, as the crossing number increases, the ring's degrees of freedom become collectively coupled: distinct arc segments must move in coordinated, out-of-phase patterns to preserve the knot. We formulate this using an arc-based model in which each crossing imposes constraints that generate a coupling matrix among subchain displacements. We show how strong couplings emerge at higher knot complexity, eventually leading to topologically driven dynamical arrest. We demonstrate that torus and twist knots belong to distinct universality classes of topologically driven dynamical arrest: torus knots exhibit a gradual, stretched-exponential slowdown, while twist knots undergo a sharp, jamming-like transition. These findings establish a topological control parameter for relaxation dynamics, independent of steric effects or bending rigidity. Our results offer a unified framework connecting number of conformations, cooperative motion, and final arrested states, thus extending our fundamental understanding of entanglement in soft matter systems.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the dual chemotaxis strategy of bacteria in porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chemotaxis of bacterial swimmers that move in a run-and-turn pattern is well studied in uniform bulk fluid. It is primarily based on modulating the run time in dependence on the swimming direction with respect to the source of chemoattractant (run time bias). Here, we provide evidence that the lophotrichously flagellated soil bacterium Pseudomonas putida may also perform chemotaxis in porous media where the free path length is severely restricted. Besides the classical run time bias, we identify a second chemotactic strategy: the change in swimming direction upon a turn event is adjusted, so that the direction of the next run phase is biased towards the source of chemoattractant (turn angle bias). Agent based simulations, based on the experimentally observed statistical properties of the swimming pattern, indicate that turn angle bias is the predominant chemotaxis strategy of bacteria in porous environments.</description>

      <title>First-passage-time statistics of active Brownian particles: A perturbative approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the first-passage-time (FPT) properties of active Brownian particles to reach an absorbing wall in two dimensions. Employing a perturbation approach we obtain exact analytical predictions for the survival and FPT distributions for small P\'eclet numbers, measuring the importance of self-propulsion relative to diffusion. While randomly oriented active agents reach the wall faster than their passive counterpart, their initial orientation plays a crucial role in the FPT statistics. Using the median as a metric, we quantify this anisotropy and find that it becomes more pronounced at distances where persistent active motion starts to dominate diffusion.</description>

      <title>Geometric Optimization of Patterned Conductive Polymer Composite-based Strain Sensors Toward Enhanced Sensing Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The patterned design of flexible sensors enables customized performance to meet diverse application demands. However, when multiple geometric parameters and sensing metrics are involved, experimental approaches to establish structure-performance relationships become costly and inefficient. Here, a novel universal piezoresistive model--overcoming limitations of commonly used models that are only applicable to small strains and linear responses--is developed to capture the relationship between conductivity tensor components and strain. A numerical method incorporating this model simulates the electromechanical properties of conductive composites and predicts patterned strain sensors' behavior. To validate this approach, a flexible strain sensor based on laser-induced graphene technology is fabricated and tested. Additionally, a rapid, cost-effective workflow combining Latin hypercube sampling and Pareto-optimal solutions is demonstrated for multi-parameter and multi-objective optimization of the sinusoidal-patterned sensor. This study provides valuable insights for investigating the structure-performance relationship of strain sensors and advances optimization methods for sensor designs.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium phases and phase transitions in multicritical magnetic polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic polymers are examples of composite soft materials in which the competition between the large configurational entropy of the soft substrate (polymer) and the magnetic interaction may give rise to rich equilibrium phase diagrams as well as non-standard critical phenomena. Here, we study a self-avoiding walk model decorated by Ising spins of value $0$ and $\pm 1$ that interact according to a Blume-Emery-Griffith-like Hamiltonian. By using mean-field approximations and Monte Carlo simulations, we report the existence of three distinct equilibrium phases: swollen disordered, compact ordered, and compact disordered. Notably, these phases are separated by phase boundaries that meet at multicritical points, whose nature and location are tunable and depend on the strength of the interactions. In our conclusion, we discuss the relevance of the phase diagrams we have obtained to the physics of magnetic polymers and their application to chromatin biophysics.</description>

      <title>Global graph features unveiled by unsupervised geometric deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphs provide a powerful framework for modeling complex systems, but their structural variability makes analysis and classification challenging. To address this, we introduce GAUDI (Graph Autoencoder Uncovering Descriptive Information), a novel unsupervised geometric deep learning framework that captures both local details and global structure. GAUDI employs an innovative hourglass architecture with hierarchical pooling and upsampling layers, linked through skip connections to preserve essential connectivity information throughout the encoding-decoding process. By mapping different realizations of a system - generated from the same underlying parameters - into a continuous, structured latent space, GAUDI disentangles invariant process-level features from stochastic noise. We demonstrate its power across multiple applications, including modeling small-world networks, characterizing protein assemblies from super-resolution microscopy, analyzing collective motion in the Vicsek model, and capturing age-related changes in brain connectivity. This approach not only improves the analysis of complex graphs but also provides new insights into emergent phenomena across diverse scientific domains.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the phonon theory of liquid heat capacity: low-frequency shear modes and intramolecular vibrations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modeling the heat capacity of liquids present fundamental difficulties due to the strong intermolecular particle interactions and large diffusive-like displacements. Based on the experimental evidence that the microscopic dynamics of liquids closely resemble those of solids, a phonon theory of liquid thermodynamics has been developed. Despite its success, the phonon theory of liquids relies on the questionable assumption that low-frequency shear excitations are propagating in nature and follow a Debye density of states. Furthermore, the same framework does not capture the contribution of intramolecular vibrations, which play a significant role in molecular liquids. In this work, we revisit the phonon theory of liquid heat capacity, introducing alternative approaches to model low-frequency shear modes. In particular, we consider the recently proposed idea of treating such modes as pure kinetic and we propose a novel approach based on identifying those low-frequency excitations as overdamped liquid-like modes with linear in frequency density of states. Moreover, we complete the theory by incorporating the effects of intramolecular vibrations. By comparing the theoretical predictions from these different approaches with the available data for the heat capacity of several liquids, we present a comprehensive evaluation of the original model and the newly proposed extensions. Despite all approaches perform well at low-temperatures, our results indicate that modeling low-frequency modes as overdamped liquid-like excitations yields the most accurate agreement with the data in the whole temperature range. Conversely, we demonstrate that treating these excitations as purely gas-like leads to significant inaccuracies, particularly at high temperatures.</description>

      <title>Biomass transfer on autocatalytic reaction network: a delay differential equation formulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.09470v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a biological system to grow and expand, mass must be transferred from the environment to the system and be assimilated into its reaction network. Here, I characterize the biomass transfer process for growing autocatalytic systems. By track biomass along reaction pathways, an n-dimensional ordinary differential equation (ODE) of the reaction network can be reformulated into a one-dimensional delay differential equation (DDE) for its long-term dynamics. The kernel function of the DDE summarizes the overall amplification and transfer delay of the system and serves as a signature for autocatalysis dynamics. The DDE formulation allows reaction networks of various topologies and complexities to be compared and provides rigorous estimation scheme for growth rate upon dimensional reduction of reaction networks.</description>

      <title>Arrested on heating: controlling the motility of active droplets by temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.13442v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-propelling active matter relies on the conversion of energy from the undirected, nanoscopic scale to directed, macroscopic motion. One of the challenges in the design of synthetic active matter lies in the control of dynamic states, or motility gaits. Here, we present an experimental system of self-propelling droplets with thermally controllable and reversible dynamic states, from unsteady over meandering to persistent to arrested motion. These states are known to depend on the P\'eclet number of the molecular process powering the motion, which we can now tune by using a temperature sensitive mixture of surfactants as propulsion fuel. We quantify the droplet dynamics by analyzing flow and chemical fields for the individual states, comparing them to canonical models for autophoretic particles. In the context of these models, we experimentally observe, in situ, the fundamental first broken symmetry that translates an isotropic, immotile base state to self-propelled motility.</description>
