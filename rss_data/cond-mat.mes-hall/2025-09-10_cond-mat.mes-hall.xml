      <title>Quantum control of exciton motion in electric field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study quantum control of classical motion of a two-dimensional exciton by optimizing the time-dependent electric field of a stripe-like gate acting on the exciton and inducing its time-dependent quantum dipole moment. We propose a search method that significantly reduces computational requirements while efficiently identifying optimal control parameters. By leveraging this method, one can precisely manipulate the exciton's final position and velocity over a specified evolution time. These results can be applied for control of exciton fluxes and population, and for spatially resolved light emission in two-dimensional semiconducting structures.</description>

      <title>Quantum Theory of Exciton Magnetic Moment: Interaction and Topological Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combining magnetometry with optical spectroscopy has uncovered novel quantum phenomena and is emerging as a platform for quantum information science. Yet, the theory of magnetic response of excitons, correlated electron-hole pairs in semiconductors, remains incomplete due to insufficient treatment of electron-hole interaction and topological effects. In biased bilayer graphene, for instance, theoretical predictions of valley g-factor for p-excitons deviate from experiment by nearly an order of magnitude. Here, we develop a quantum theory of exciton orbital magnetic moment that reveals several conceptually new terms absent in prior theories, including an unforeseen contribution from exciton band quantum geometry. Our ab initio calculations yield results in excellent agreement with measurements, establishing the importance of a full theory including interaction and topological effects for the magnetic response of excitons.</description>

      <title>Spin-Orbit Coupling Effect on the Seebeck Coefficient in Dirac Electron Systems in $\alpha$-(BETS)$_2$I$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Seebeck coefficient, $S=L_{12}/(TL_{11})$, which is proportional to a ratio of the thermoelectric conductivity $L_{12}$ to the electric conductivity $L_{11}$ with $T$ being temperature is examined for two-dimensional Dirac electrons in a three-quarter filled organic conductor, $\alpha$-(BETS)$_2$I$_3$, [BETS = BEDT-TSeF = bis(ethylenedithio)tetraselenafulvalene] at ambient pressure.Using a tight-binding (TB) model obtained by first-principles relativistic density-functi onal theory method [Eur. Phys. J. B 94, 17 (2021)], we calculate $S$ in the presence of the impurity and electron--phonon (e--p) scatterings. It is shown that $S_x &lt; 0$ and $S_y &gt;0$ at high temperatures, where $S_x$ ($S_y$) denotes $S$ perpendicular (parallel) to the molecular stacking axis. There is a sign change of $S_y$ with increasing $T$. It is found that, at low temperatures the absolute value of $S$ is enhanced by the spin-orbit coupling. The Seebeck coefficient is examined by dividing into components of the conduction and valence bands to find that the electron and hole contributions compete each other. Such $T$ dependence of $S$ is clarified using the spectral conductivity, which determines $L_{12}$ and $L_{11}$.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic resistivity of a $p$-wave magnet candidate CeNiAsO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Certain noncollinear antiferromagnets host momentum-dependent spin-splitting bands with odd-parity $p$-wave symmetry, termed $p$-wave magnets. Metallic $p$-wave magnets offer a unique platform for spintronic applications, yet experimental realizations remain scarce. CeNiAsO, featuring a tetragonal structure and developing a commensurate coplanar noncollinear antiferromagnetic order at low temperatures, has been theoretically proposed as such a magnet. Here, we show that its resistivity exhibits strong two-fold in-plane anisotropy -- a key signature of its proposed $p$-wave magnetism. Reversible and nonvolatile switching between high- and low-resistance states is achieved by alternating the in-plane magnetic field direction, indicating potential for field-controlled memory devices. Our results not only provide critical experimental evidence for $p$-wave magnetism in CeNiAsO but also open new avenues for high-performance antiferromagnetic spintronics based on resistivity anisotropy.</description>

      <title>Longitudinal spin current absorption in bilayers composed of ferromagnetic and highly-resistive non-magnetic layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin Hall magnetoresistance (SMR) is an intriguing spin-dependent transport phenomenon in bilayers consisting of non-magnetic and magnetic layers. Here, we report on the influence of longitudinal spin current absorption by the magnetic layer on SMR in bilayers composed of Co$_{20}$Fe$_{60}$B$_{20}$ (CoFeB) and epitaxial SrIrO$_{3}$, where SrIrO$_{3}$ is used as a highly-resistive spin current source. We observed a clear SMR signal and an enhancement in the SMR ratio with increasing CoFeB layer thickness, in qualitative agreement with an SMR model that incorporates the spin current absorption. The effective spin Hall angle is corrected from 0.07 to 0.12 with consideration of the spin current absorption, corresponding to a relative correction of ~71%. Our findings highlight the pronounced impact of the spin current absorption by the magnetic layer on the SMR mechanism when employing highly-resistive non-magnetic layer such as SrIrO$_{3}$, as well as other emerging quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Janus Skyrmion: Interfacial Quasiparticle with Two-Faced Helicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Janus particles are functional particles with at least two surfaces showing asymmetric properties. We show at the interface between two magnetic regions with different antisymmetric exchange interactions, a new species of topological quasiparticles can emerge, in which different helicity structures can coexist. We name such an interfacial quasiparticle a "Janus skyrmion", in analogy to the Janus particle. As the Janus skyrmion shows helicity asymmetry, its size could vary with both the in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic fields. A vertical spin current could drive the Janus skyrmion into one-dimensional motion along the interface without showing the skyrmion Hall effect, at a speed which depends on both the spin polarization angle and current density. Thermal fluctuations could also lead to one-dimensional random walk of a Brownian Janus skyrmion. This work uncovers unique dynamics of interfacial quasiparticles with exotic helicity structures, which may be realized in interface-engineered magnetic layers.</description>

      <title>Tunneling resonances through periodically driven quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Periodic driving of quantum dots is analyzed as a basis for developing dynamic switching devices. We study transport through periodically modulated energy levels which are coupled to leads via tunneling coefficients. Utilizing Floquet theory a full analytic solution is found in terms of continued fractions, enabling us to efficiently calculate and analyze the transmission through the quantum dot in relevant parameter regimes. By considering levels at higher energy outside the spectrum of the transmitted particles a resonant switching effects is identified, where a very small oscillating control signal on a weakly connected quantum dot can induce perfect transmission. We also find closed form expressions using Bessel functions in the limit of small tunnel couplings. The results predict and explain resonant tunneling in nano-electronic devices as well as in corresponding setups using magnonic systems, photonic waveguides, or ultra-cold gases in optical lattices.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation-dissipation bounds for time-dependently driven conductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the noise in a multi-terminal multi-channel conductor under arbitrary time-dependent driving and subject to -- possibly large -- static potential and temperature biases. We show that the full out-of-equilibrium zero-frequency noise is constrained by a fluctuation-dissipation bound. It consists of an upper bound expressed in terms of weighted current components of the separate Floquet bands arising from the time-dependent driving. In the limit of large static temperature bias, it has an intuitive interpretation in terms of the dissipated powers due to the static potential bias and due to the time-dependent driving. Furthermore, we show the existence of a second bound that relies on the specific shape of the electron distribution resulting from the driving, which is often even tighter than the fluctuation-dissipation bound. We show the implications of our bounds at the simple, but experimentally relevant example of a two-terminal conductor in the presence of an ac bias.</description>

      <title>Chirality-Induced Orbital Selectivity through Linear-Orbital Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates electron transport through chiral electrostatic potentials by modeling the system in three spatial dimensions and demonstrates that chirality-induced orbital selectivity (CIOS) produces pronounced enantiospecific transmission, dependent on the electron's initial orbital angular momentum (OAM) state. The results show that transverse electron motion in a chiral environment, captured by OAM dynamics, gives rise to strong orbital selectivity that reverses upon inversion of the handedness of the chiral potential. This behavior originates from a coupling between the electron's linear and orbital angular momenta, leading to effects that are significantly stronger than those arising from spin-phonon and bare spin-orbit interactions under realistic physical conditions. Moreover, the CIOS effect is shown to increase with the length of the chiral region and remains robust against static disorder. The orbital selectivity can give rise to spin selectivity when initial correlations exist between spin and OAM states. These findings underscore the importance of orbital contributions to enantiospecific electron transport in chiral systems and suggest that CIOS plays a critical role alongside existing spin-based mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Efficient Generation of Second-Harmonic Propagating Spin Waves in a Thin, Out-of-Plane-Magnetized Ferromagnetic Film</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin waves are attractive information carriers owing to their gigahertz-to-terahertz frequencies, nanometric wavelengths, and negligible Joule heating. Yet the efficient excitation of short-wavelength, high-frequency spin waves and the exploitation of nonlinear effects remain challenging. We propose a hybrid ferromagnetic nanostructure composed of a small, in-plane-magnetized rim (a magnonic nanocavity) exchange-coupled to an out-of-plane-magnetized region. Micromagnetic simulations show that a spatially uniform out-of-plane microwave field excites the rim's fundamental mode; its second harmonic is then coherently and efficiently launched into the second region of the structure, yielding propagating spin waves. The process can be realized in strip or disk geometries, providing excitation of plane-wave or radial spin waves, respectively. The conversion efficiency grows nonlinearly with the pump amplitude and can be further improved when the frequency of a higher-order standing wave in the nanocavity matches the second-harmonic frequency. The emission frequency is tunable via the bias magnetic field or the width of the nanocavity, suggesting a compact route toward on-chip, short-wavelength, high-frequency spin-wave sources for artificial neural networks.</description>

      <title>Phonon-Limited Mobility in H/F-functionalized Nanotubes with 1D $\pi$-chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron mobility due to electron-phonon interaction is investigated for fully fluorinated/hydrogenated zig-zag carbon nanotubes containing one-dimensional alternating chains of carbon atoms with $\pi$-bonds. The behavior of mobility associated with changes in the tube diameter, coating type (F/H) and temperature is revealed. In particular, it is shown that the dependence of mobility on the diameter in such tubes is periodic with the chirality index, which is associated with the absence of scattering on TA phonons in the tubes with an even number of conducting chains due to mirror symmetry. The obtained small values of phonon-limited mobility indicate that tubes with one-dimensional conducting chains are more promising for use as gas sensors than as elements of electronic devices. Calculations are performed within the self-energy relaxation time approximation (SERTA) using the non-orthogonal tight-binding approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reservoir computing (RC), a neural network designed for temporal data, enables efficient computation with low-cost training and direct physical implementation. Recently, quantum RC has opened new possibilities for conventional RC and introduced novel ideas to tackle open problems in quantum physics and advance quantum technologies. Despite its promise, it faces challenges, including physical realization, output readout, and measurement-induced back-action. Here, we propose to implement quantum RC through quantum transport in mesoscopic electronic systems. Our approach possesses several advantages: compatibility with existing device fabrication techniques, ease of output measurement, and robustness against measurement back-action. Leveraging universal conductance fluctuations, we numerically demonstrate two benchmark tasks, spoken-digit recognition and time-series forecasting, to validate our proposal. This work establishes a novel pathway for implementing on-chip quantum RC via quantum transport and expands the mesoscopic physics applications.</description>

      <title>Valley Order in Moir\'e Topological Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moir\'e materials with opposite non-zero miniband Chern numbers in time-reversal-partner valleys are two-dimensional topological insulators at band filling $\nu=2$. We explore the possibility that in this class of moir'e materials intervalley coherence can sometimes be present in interaction induced insulators at band filling $\nu=1$ , using Landau levels with opposite signs of the magnetic field as a convenient generic model. In the absence of intravalley interactions the mean-field ground state at filling factor $\nu=1$ is a gapless intervalley coherent state that maps under a particle-hole transformation of one valley to a strong-field superconducting vortex-lattice state that has been studied previously. When the ratio $\lambda$ of intravalley to intervalley interactions is increased, gapped states appear, one with broken time-reversal symmetry and a quantized Hall effect but no valley polarization and one with broken parity symmetry and zero Hall conductivity. We discuss the possibility that the latter state could be related to the fractional quantum spin Hall effect recently observed at an odd filling factor in a moir'e topological insulator and comment on related systems in which correlations between electrons in bands with opposite Chern numbers might play a key role.</description>

      <title>Physical origin of current-induced switching angle shift in magnetic heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate quantification of the spin-orbit torques (SOTs) is critical for the identification and applications of new spin-orbitronic effects. One of the most popular techniques to qualify the SOTs is the switching angle shift, where the applied direct current was assumed to shift, via domain wall depinning during the anti-domain expansion, the switching angle of a perpendicular magnetization in a linear proportion manner under a large rotating magnetic field. Here, we report that, for the most commonly employed perpendicular magnetization heterostructures in spintronics (e.g., those based on FeCoB, Co, and Co/Ni multilayers), the switching angle shift considerably misestimates the SOT within the domain wall depinning analysis of the slope of the linear-in-current scaling and may also have a non-zero residual value at zero direct current. Our experiments and simulations unveil that the switching angle shift is most likely dominated by the chiral asymmetric nucleation rather than the expansion of the anti-domains. The in-plane field from external magnet and current-induced SOTs lower the perpendicular nucleation field and thus the required switching angle, ultimately leading to underestimation of the SOTs by the domain wall depinning analysis. These results have advanced the understanding of magnetization switching of spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometry for fractional excitations: Unified framework and dip width scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extending Hong--Ou--Mandel (HOM) interferometry to the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) promises direct access to anyonic statistics, yet remains challenging: on-demand anyon injection is hindered by integer-charged minimal excitations, and recent HOM experiments in the FQHE lack a fully consistent theoretical framework. Here we provide a general theory of time-resolved HOM interferometry in quantum Hall systems. Combining the nonequilibrium bosonized edge theory (NEBET) with the unifying non-equilibrium perturbative theory (UNEPT), we derive exact and perturbative relations obeyed by the relevant cross-correlations of chiral currents valid for spatially extended tunneling operators and generic quadratic edge dynamics. Then, within the Tomonaga--Luttinger liquid (TLL) framework, we analyze the width of the HOM dip for injected pulses carrying integer and fractional charges. We show that it is governed by the width of the pulses and, for the fractional charge, by a non-trivial power-law behavior of the scaling dimension. Our results establish a robust theoretical foundation for interpreting recent experiments on anyonic statistics and electronic interferometry in the quantum Hall regime.</description>

      <title>Linking thermodynamic correlation signatures and superconductivity in twisted trilayer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisted graphene multilayers exhibit strong electronic correlations, which manifest in a range of experimental signatures. Yet how these signatures relate to each other and the microscopic ground states-and how twist angle and band structure reshape them-remains poorly understood. Here we study this interplay by correlating local thermodynamic and transport measurements in a twisted trilayer graphene (TTG) sample with unequal angles and flat electronic bands. We use a scanning single-electron transistor to map the impact of electron-electron interactions in a region of the sample where the local twist angle evolves smoothly. We observe gapped correlated insulators and a sawtooth in electronic compressibility, both exhibiting pronounced electron-hole (e-h) asymmetry with distinct magic angles for conduction and valence bands. Subsequent transport measurements in the same region reveal robust superconductivity with a similar e-h asymmetry. Our measurements indicate that superconductivity is not directly tied to the correlated insulators. Instead, its critical temperature correlates closely with the strength of the sawtooth in compressibility, suggesting a common origin or link between the two. By combining a local probe with transport measurements, we uncover connections between superconductivity and thermodynamic correlation signatures that are not apparent from either technique in isolation, highlighting the power of our dual approach and establishing their dependence on interlayer twist angles in TTG.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetism revealed by polarized neutrons in MnF$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by possible spintronics applications in antiferromagnets, it was recently observed that symmetry admits magnets that combine attractive features of both ferromagnets and antiferromagnets. These systems, dubbed altermagnets, have been the subject of intense study with direct spectroscopic evidence, from ARPES and RIXS, techniques reported in a handful of materials in the last year. Inelastic neutron scattering (INS) is one of the most powerful direct probes of magnetism and has recently been used to witness a splitting of magnon bands in MnTe that is compatible with altermagnetism although the nature and origin of the splitting remain to be fully characterized. However, the full power of neutron scattering for such systems comes from using polarized neutrons to measure the chirality of the magnon bands. Such a measurement provides a direct characterization of altermagnetism directly from the spin wave excitations. In this article, we present results on MnF$_2$ once thought to be an archetypal antiferromagnet. We present a polarized INS data that demonstrate the material is, in fact, altermagnetic. It had long been realized that the magnon bands in this material should have a weak splitting coming from the long-range dipolar coupling. Our data is the first to visualize this splitting directly. While the dipolar splitting on its own is not altermagnetic, using a domain biased sample, the data reveals a nonzero chirality in the neutron scattering cross section that reverses sign between the two magnon modes. It is this feature that clearly demonstrates altermagnetism in MnF$_2$. This finding highlights the potential for polarized INS to characterize altermagnets not least through its exquisite sensitivity to fine-structure in the magnon spectrum.</description>

      <title>Exploring the nature of the emergent gauge field in composite-fermion metals: A large-scale microscopic study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Field theories of the composite-fermion (CF) metal model it as a Fermi sea of composite fermions coupled to an emergent gauge field. Within a random phase approximation, these theories predict that the Landau damping of the gauge field resulting from its coupling to the low-energy, long-wavelength CF particle-hole excitations modifies the electrons' density-density correlation function related to the static structure factor $S(q)$ at wave vector $q$. This produces a non-analytic correction $\propto q^{3}\ln q$ to $S(q)$ (with the magnetic length $\ell_{B}=1$). Thanks to the recently developed quaternion formulation for Jain-Kamilla projection of CF wave functions, the evaluation of $S(q)$ from the accurate microscopic theory of composite fermions has now become possible for systems containing as many as $N=900$ CFs, which enables a reliable determination of the small-$q$ behavior of $S(q)$. We study CF metals corresponding to electrons at Landau level filling factors $\nu=1/2$ and $1/4$, and for completeness, also of bosons at $\nu=1$ and $1/3$. In the $q\rightarrow0$ limit, our microscopic calculation reveals a $q^{3}$ term in $S(q)$ of the CF metals rather than $q^{3} \ln q$. This behavior is well-predicted by a model of a non-interacting Fermi sea of dipolar CFs, which also obtains its coefficient accurately.</description>

      <title>Green's Function Methods for Computing Supercurrents in Josephson Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interest in Josephson junctions (JJs) has increased rapidly in recent years not only because of their use in qubits and other quantum devices but also due to the unique physics supported by the JJs. The advent of various novel quantum materials for both the barrier region and the superconducting leads has led to the possibility of adding new functionalities to the JJs. Thus, there is a growing need for accurate modeling of the JJs and related systems to enable their predictive control and atomistic level understanding. This review presents an in-depth discussion of a Green's function-based formalism for computing supercurrents in JJs. The formulation is tailored for large-scale atomistic simulations and encompasses both dc and ac supercurrents. We hope that this review will provide a timely and comprehensive reference for researchers as well as beginning practitioners interested in Green's-function-based methods to model supercurrents in JJs.</description>

      <title>High-current p-type transistors from precursor-engineered synthetic monolayer WSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monolayer tungsten diselenide (WSe$_2$) is a leading candidate for nanoscale complementary logic. However, high defect densities introduced during thin-film growth and device fabrication have limited p-type transistor performance. Here, we report a combined strategy of precursor-engineered chemical vapor deposition and damage-minimizing fabrication to overcome this limitation. By converting tungsten trioxide and residual oxyselenides into reactive suboxides before growth, and precisely regulating selenium delivery during deposition, we synthesize uniform, centimeter-scale monolayer WSe$_2$ films with charged defect densities as low as $5 \times 10^{9}$ cm$^{-2}$. Transistors fabricated from these films achieve record p-type on-state current up to $888 \mu$A$\cdot\mu$m$^{-1}$ at $V_{\mathrm{DS}}=-1$ V, matching leading n-type devices. This leap in material quality closes the p-type performance gap without exotic doping or contact materials, marking a critical step towards complementary two-dimensional semiconductor circuits.</description>

      <title>Coherent Transport in Two-Dimensional Disordered Potentials under Spatially Uniform SU(2) Gauge Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study interference effects in the dynamics of a spin 1/2 particle propagating in two dimensions in a disordered potential and subject to a generalized spin--orbit coupling. With the particle initially in a spin-polarized plane wave state, in the short-time regime, before the spin and momentum distributions reach their steady states, we observe a transient backscattering peak offset from the exact backscattering direction, coexisting with a coherent backscattering dip. We present an intuitive explanation of this momentum offset using a non-Abelian gauge transformation. We also describe the full time evolution of the transient peak, from its buildup to its decay with a precise prediction of the dephasing time within a perturbative framework for multiple scattering. Our results can be applied to general spatially uniform SU(2) gauge fields, including the synthetic gauge field in ultracold atoms.</description>

      <title>Polarizability of a Wigner crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a calculation of the imaginary part of the polarizability of a Wigner crystal using the Fluctuation-Dissipation theorem. The oscillations of the localized electrons about their equilibrium positions are treated in the harmonic approximation and the electric dipole-moment -- dipole-moment correlator is computed by a normal mode expansion. The amplitudes and phases of the different normal modes are assumed to be statistically independent. In the first case, polarizability is computed in the high temperature limit, $k_B T&gt;&gt;\hbar \Omega_W$ (here, $\Omega_W$ is the Wigner frequency, analogous to the Debye frequency of the phonon case). In the second case, a general expression (valid both at high and low temperature limits) is obtained using a phenomenological damping model. The connection between our general expression and that of the Lorentz oscillator model is discussed. It turns out that the Wigner crystal would be transparent for applied frequencies greater than the Wigner frequency. A standard ellipsometry set-up can test the predictions of the theory.</description>

      <title>Process Tensor Approaches to Non-Markovian Quantum Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paradigm of considering open quantum systems -- i.e. focusing only on the system of interest, and treating the rest of the world as an effective environment -- has proven to be a highly effective way to understand a range of quantum systems, across areas of study such as quantum optics, cold atoms, superconducting qubits, and impurities in solid-state systems. A common approach in many of these contexts has been to consider simplified approaches based on the Born and Markov approximations. While these approximations are indeed often appropriate in contexts such as quantum optics, the widespread application of these approximations has been driven more by simplicity than by accuracy. In particular, these Markovian treatments will fail in many cases, such as when coupling to the environment is not weak, when the environment is structured and has resonances, when the system couples to low-frequency modes of the environment, or when the questions of interest involve the propagation of information through the environment. Despite the fact that many real problems are non-Markovian, the Markov approximation is still widely used, as it is often assumed that a fully non-Markovian treatment is too complex to be practical. In this perspective we discuss a recently developed set of techniques that address this challenge. Centering our discussion around the notion of the process tensor, we demonstrate that the generality of the process tensor concept, coupled with efficient tensor-network methods, opens the door to the description of a wide range of observable non-Markovian processes in a wide range of open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Temperature and magnetic field dependent $g$-factors in electron spin resonance spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose that phonons coupled to electrons play an important role in both the fundamental phenomenology of electron spin resonance as well as the interpretation of such measurements. By including spin-dependent electron-phonon interactions originating from spin-orbit coupling, we demonstrate that the g-factor acquires emergent temperature dependencies that are in excellent agreement with experimental observations. Moreover, we predict that at low temperatures, the $g$-factor will exhibit a non-trivial dependence on the magnetic field, indicating a dynamic property that has not been previously considered in electron-phonon systems. We further predict the influence of phonons to be negligible at very low and very high temperatures, with the former requiring experimental verification.</description>

      <title>High-temperature growth of ultra thin NbTiN films on lithium niobate for integrated single photon detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lithium niobate-on-insulator (LNOI) is an emerging photonic platform with high potential for scalable quantum information processing due to its strong second-order nonlinearity. However, little progress has been made in developing on-chip single-photon detectors on LNOI. Niobium titanium nitride (NbTiN) superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) are a promising candidate for this application. In this work, we use DC reactive magnetron sputtering to grow high-quality NbTiN thin films using an ultra-high vacuum deposition system with a base pressure lower than $2\times 10^{-10}$ mbar. Enabled by the low concentration of background impurities in this system, we investigate the impact of substrate temperature during NbTiN growth. We achieve four nm thick superconducting films with a critical temperature ($T_{c}$) of 12.3 K grown at a substrate temperature of 825 K. We find that the NbTiN films grow in the (111) orientation and evolve from a porous pillar structure when grown at low temperatures to densely packed fibrous grains at higher temperatures. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the increased substrate temperature reduces the oxygen concentration in our films and improves the overall stoichiometry. In addition, we integrate these films with the LNOI platform and investigate the obtained interface quality. Lastly, we fabricate SNSPDs from the NbTiN film on LNOI and characterize the detector performance.</description>

      <title>Grain boundary-limited thermal transport in suspended thin graphite across an unexplored thickness regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.10704v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present systematic thermal conductivity measurements of suspended thin graphite ribbons, 234-527 nm thick, using a four-probe 3-omega method. Unlike recent reports of phonon hydrodynamics and exceptionally high thermal conductivity in micrometer-thick graphite (Science, 2020),we observe significantly lower thermal conductivity and no signatures of collective phonon flow in this intermediate thickness regime. Instead, our measured thermal conductivity lies between few-layer graphene and bulk graphite.These results agree with a first-principles-informed Peierls-Boltzmann transport model with spatially resolved Monte Carlo sampling. Additionally, the temperature for the peak thermal conductivity shifts lower with increasing thickness, due to the interplay of phonon-boundary and phonon-isotope scattering. Incorporating grain boundary scattering into simulations is necessary to replicate the experimental trends. These findings delineate the boundary between ballistic, hydrodynamic, and diffusive transport regimes in graphite, and underscore the dominant role of disorder and geometry in phonon transport in quasi-two-dimensional materials, offering insights for nanoscale thermal management.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11586v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The electrical conductivity of metallic crystals exhibits size effects when the electron mean free path exceeds the sample thickness. One such phenomenon, known as Sondheimer oscillations, was discovered decades ago. These oscillations, periodic in magnetic field, have been hitherto treated with no reference to Landau quantization. Here, we present a study of longitudinal and transverse conductivity in cadmium single crystals with thicknesses ranging from 12.6 to 475 $\mu$m, and demonstrate that the amplitude of the first ten oscillations is determined by the quantum of conductance and a length scale that depends on the sample thickness, the magnetic length and the Fermi surface geometry. We argue that this scaling is unexpected in semiclassical scenarios and it arises from the degeneracy of the momentum derivative of the cross-sectional area $A$ along the orientation of the magnetic field $\frac{\partial A}{\partial k_z}$ in cadmium, which couples Landau quantization to the discretization of $k_z$ imposed by the finite sample thickness. We show that the oscillating component of the conductivity is uniquely governed by fundamental constants and the ratio of two degeneracies, which acts as an inverted filling factor. Our conjecture is supported by the absence of such scaling in thin copper crystals.</description>

Abstract: Phonon polaritons (PhPs) are hybrid light-matter modes. We investigate them in two-dimensional (2D) materials with twisted moir\'{e} structures, revealing that the moir\'{e} potential creates a new class of `moir\'{e} PhPs'. These exhibit a fundamental spectral reconstruction into multiple branches and, crucially, electromagnetic wavefunctions that are nano-patterned by the superlattice. Through numerical simulations based on realistic lattice models, we confirm the existence of these intriguing modes. The inherent nanoscale structuring produces a robust, spatially varying near-field response, establishing moir\'{e} superlattices as a platform for engineering light-matter interactions.</description>

      <title>Correlated helimagnetic configuration in a nonsymmorphic magnetic nodal semimetal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03832v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonsymmorphic magnetic Weyl semimetal materials such as ReAlX (Re=rare earth, X=Si/Ge) provide a unique opportunity to explore the correlated phenomena between Weyl fermions and nontrivial magnetic configurations. To be specific, we study a lattice model in which the magnetic configuration is determined by the competition among ferromagnetic (FM) interaction, the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, and the Kondo coupling $K_0$ to the Weyl fermion. Both quantum and finite-temperature phase transitions between FM and correlated nesting helical configurations are found. Different from the uncorrelated helimagnet that decouples from the Weyl fermions, this correlated helimagnet induces a magnetic Brillouin zone with a $K_0$-dependent nesting in the band structure of the conduction electrons instead of the monopole-like Weyl cone. By measuring the current induced by the chiral magnetic effect on the conduction electron with nesting Weyl nodes, one can distinguish the correlated nesting helical order from the ferromagnetism because the chiral magnetic effect is considerably suppressed in the former case. These properties we find here may explain the experimental observations in ReAlX.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study charge and spin transport in systems composed of itinerant electrons and localized magnetic moments of a Kitaev quantum spin liquid (QSL) phase. For example, $\alpha-{\rm RuCl}_3$ either intrinsically doped or in proximity to graphene. Our analysis reveals distinct temperature-dependent transport behaviors due to the QSL gap and the Majorana excitation spectrum, which are greatly enhanced when the velocities of itinerant-electrons and QSL excitations become comparable. These transport characteristics could potentially be employed to reveal the fractionalized excitations of the spin liquid.</description>

      <title>Tunable spin-orbit splitting in bilayer graphene/WSe$_2$ quantum devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bilayer graphene (BLG)-based quantum devices represent a promising platform for emerging technologies, such as quantum computing and spintronics. However, their intrinsically weak spin-orbit coupling (SOC) complicates spin and valley manipulation. Integrating BLG with transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) enhances the SOC via proximity effects. While this enhancement has been demonstrated in 2D-layered structures, 1D and 0D nanostructures in BLG/TMD remain unrealized, with open questions regarding SOC strength and tunability. Here, we investigate quantum point contacts and quantum dots in two BLG/WSe$_2$ heterostructures with different stacking orders. Across multiple devices, we reproducibly demonstrate spin-orbit splitting up to 1.5 meV - more than 1 order of magnitude higher than in pristine BLG. Furthermore, we show that the induced SOC can be tuned in situ from its maximum value to near-complete suppression via the perpendicular electric field. This enhancement and in situ tunability establish the SOC as a control mechanism for dynamic spin and valley manipulation.</description>

      <title>Engineering topological exciton structures in two-dimensional semiconductors by a periodic electrostatic potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04597v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose to engineer topological exciton structures in layered transition metal dichalcogenides through hybridizing different Rydberg states, which can be induced by a periodic electrostatic potential remotely imprinted from charge distributions in adjacent layers. Topological phase diagrams are obtained for potentials with various strengths and wavelengths. We find the lowest band of the interlayer exciton can become topologically nontrivial, which exhibits a small bandwidth as well as quantum geometries well suited for realizing the bosonic fractional Chern insulator. For monolayer excitons, topological bands and in-gap helical edge states can emerge near the energy of 2p states.</description>

      <title>Optical selection rules of topological excitons in flat bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03601v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological excitons are superpositions of electron-hole pair states, characterized by an envelope function with finite vorticity in momentum space. This vorticity is determined by the underlying topology of the electronic bands. We derive the optical selection rules for topological excitons in flat bands, considering different topological two-band models: a family of Hamiltonians with skyrmion pseudo-spin textures, the flattened BHZ model for a single spin and the flattened Haldane model. We derive the selection rules for these three models accounting for short-range interactions. We also consider the non-hydrogenic spectrum of excitons in the single-spin flattened BHZ model with Coulomb interactions. We show that for the case of two flat bands with skyrmion pseudo-spin textures, all excitons are bright, and the handedness of the light that couples to them is fixed by the vorticity of the pseudo-spin texture. For the single-spin flattened BHZ model, we show that bright excitons couple to circularly polarized light, regardless of the range of the interactions. In the flattened Haldane model, topological excitons couple to elliptically polarized light. We obtain the phase diagram for the polarization of light in this model as a function of microscopic parameters of the Hamiltonian. Our results demonstrate how band topology affects exciton properties, offering a framework for predicting light-matter interactions in topological materials with flat bands.</description>

      <title>Seeing Beyond Dark-Field RGB Capabilities: Deep Spectral Extrapolation of Ultrasmall Plasmonic Nanogaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Localized surface plasmons can confine light within a deep-subwavelength volume comparable to the scale of atoms and molecules, enabling ultrasensitive responses to near-field variations. On the other hand, this extreme localization also inevitably amplifies the unwanted noise from the response of local morphological imperfections, leading to complex spectral variations and reduced consistency across the plasmonic nanostructures. Seeking uniform optical responses has therefore long been a sought-after goal in nanoplasmonics. However, conventional probing techniques by dark-field (DF) confocal microscopy, such as image analysis or spectral measurements, can be inaccurate and time-consuming, respectively. Here, we introduce SPARX, a deep-learning-powered paradigm that surpasses conventional imaging and spectroscopic capabilities. In particular, SPARX can batch-predict broadband DF spectra (e.g., 500-1000 nm) of numerous nanoparticles simultaneously from an information-limited RGB image (i.e., below 700 nm). It achieves this extrapolative inference beyond the camera's capture capabilities by learning the underlying physical relationships among multiple orders of optical resonances. The spectral predictions only take milliseconds, achieving a speedup of three to four orders of magnitude compared to traditional spectral acquisition, which may take from hours to days. As a proof-of-principle demonstration for screening identical resonances, the selection accuracy achieved by SPARX is comparable to that of conventional spectroscopy techniques. This breakthrough paves the way for consistent plasmonic applications and next-generation microscopies.</description>

      <title>Signatures of the Fermi surface reconstruction of a doped Mott insulator in a slab geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a hole-doped Mott insulator in a slab geometry using the dynamical cluster approximation. We show that the enhancement of the correlation strength at the surface results in the remarkable evolution of the layer-projected Fermi surface, which exhibits hole-like pockets in the superficial layers, but gradually evolves into a single electron-like surface in the innermost layers. We further analyze the behavior of the Friedel oscillations induced by the surface and identify distinct signatures of the Fermi surface reconstruction as function of hole-doping. In addition, we introduce a computationally tractable quantity that diagnoses the same Fermi surface variation by the concurrent breakdown of Luttinger's theorem. Both the latter quantity and the Friedel oscillations serve as reliable indicators of the change in Fermi surface topology, without the need for any periodization in momentum space.</description>

      <title>Noise-induced Zeno-like effect in a spin-chain quantum battery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01603v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum batteries, which are energy-storage or state-storage devices that exploit unique quantum effects, are sensitive to environmental noise. Here, we demonstrate that suitably engineered noise can induce a "Zeno-like" stabilization effect of the charging process in a spin-chain quantum battery within the Heisenberg XYZ model. Focusing on a system size N=6, which balances computational cost and storage capacity, we find that the ergotropy-to-energy ratio W(t)/E_B(t) attains a maximum value of about 0.99 at a certain time parameter value. Then, by varying the noise strength in each channel, we find that not only does decoherence merely degrade performance but it may also stabilize stored energy and ergotropy in the high noise strength regime. For instance, the phase-flip channel slows charging and reduces charging power, but its discharging behavior releases energy and ergotropy more slowly, allowing the battery to be used for longer times compared to bit-flip and bit-phase-flip channels. In contrast, the bit-flip channel enables fast charging, but yields low storage and rapid energy release. Remarkably, the bit-phase-flip channel can combine the advantages of both bit-flip and phase-flip channels in the high-noise-strength regime. The bit-phase-flip channel supports accelerated charging together with enhanced storage capacity, while its discharging behavior resembles that of the bit-flip channel with rapid energy release. These results reveal that, under sufficiently strong noise, environmental decoherence induces a Zeno-like stabilization, allowing it to achieve enhanced charging performance and to stabilize stored energy and ergotropy in the spin-chain quantum battery.</description>
