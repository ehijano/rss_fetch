      <title>An improved version of Kac's Central Limit Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical Central Limit Theorem (CLT) states that for a sequence of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) random variables with finite mean and variance, the normalized sample mean converges to the standard normal distribution.
  In $1946$, Victor Kac proved a Central Limit type theorem for a sequence of random variables that were not independent. The random variables under consideration were obtained from the angle-doubling map. The idea behind Kac's proof was to show that although the random variables under consideration were not independent, they were what he calls \textit{statistically independent} (in modern terminology, this concept is called long range independence). The final conclusion of his paper was that the sample averages of the random variables, suitably normalized converges to the standard normal distribution.
  In the 1970's, Charles Stein revolutionized the field of probability by discovering a new method to obtain the limiting distribution for a sequence of random variables. Among other things, his method gave an alternative proof of the classical Central Limit Theorem.
  We obtain an improvement of Victor Kac's result by applying Stein's method. We show that the normalized sample averages converge to the standard normal distribution in the Wasserstein metric, which is stronger than the convergence in distribution.</description>

      <title>Stochastic functional partial differential equations with monotone coefficients: Poisson stability measures, exponential mixing and limit theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines Poisson stable (including stationary, periodic, almost periodic, Levitan almost periodic, Bohr almost automorphic, pseudo-periodic, Birkhoff recurrent, pseudo-recurrent, etc.) measures and limit theorems for stochastic functional partial differential equations(SFPDEs) with monotone coefficients. We first show the existence and uniqueness of entrance measure $\mu _{t}$ for SFPDEs by dissipative method (or remoting start). Then, with the help of Shcherbakov's comparability method in character of recurrence, we prove that the entrance measure inherits the same recurrence of coefficients. Thirdly, we show the tightness of the set of measures $\mu _{t}$. As a result, any sequence of the average of $\{\mu _{t}\}_{t\in\mathbb{R} }$ have the limit point $\mu ^{*}$. Further, we study the uniform exponential mixing of the measure $\mu ^{*}$ in the sense of Wasserstein metric. Fourthly, under uniform exponential mixing and Markov property, we establish the strong law of large numbers, the central limit theorem and estimate the corresponding rates of convergence for solution maps of SFPDEs. Finally, we give applications of stochastic generalized porous media equations with delay to illustrate of our results.</description>

      <title>The behavior of renormalization and related observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce new reference observables to establish a scaling formula in the renormalization group equation. Using the transfer matrix method, we calculate the two point observables of the one dimensional Ising model without an external field under general boundary conditions. The results indicate that the two point observables exhibit exponential decay as the distance between these two sites tends to infinity, except at the critical point. Corresponding to the renormalization procedure underlying the correlation function, we establish a similar procedure for new observables, which aligning with findings in physics. Additionally, from the dynamic point of view, we construct a random system using the stochastic quantization method. We calculate the new observables of this random system under the initial distribution that satisfies Dobrushin Lanford Ruelle(DLR) equations. Furthermore, we formulate a new renormalization scaling equation with respect to the two point observables. Finally, these results can be extended to a more general case of finite point observables, and demonstrating independence from the choice of system parameters.</description>

      <title>Geometric functionals of polyconvex excursion sets of Poisson shot noise processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excursion sets of Poisson shot noise processes are a prominent class of random sets. We consider a specific class of Poisson shot noise processes whose excursion sets within compact convex observation windows are almost surely polyconvex. This class contains, for example, the Boolean model. In this paper, we analyse the behaviour of geometric functionals such as the intrinsic volumes of these excursion sets for growing observation windows. In particular, we study the asymptotics of the expectation and the variance, derive a lower variance bound and show a central limit theorem.</description>

      <title>Commutation relations for two-sided radial SLE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the commutation relation for 2-radial SLE in the unit disc starting from two boundary points. We follow the framework introduced by Dub\'{e}dat. Under an additional requirement of the interchangeability of the two curves, we classify all locally commuting 2-radial SLE$_\kappa$ for $\kappa\in (0,4]$: it is either a two-sided radial SLE$_\kappa$ with spiral of constant spiraling rate or a chordal SLE$_\kappa$ weighted by a power of the conformal radius of its complement. Namely, for fixed $\kappa$ and starting points, we have exactly two one-parameter continuous families of locally commuting 2-radial SLE. Two-sided radial SLE with spiral is a generalization of two-sided radial SLE (without spiral) which satisfies the resampling property. We define it by weighting two independent radial SLEs by a two-time parameter martingale. However, unlike in the chordal case, the resampling property does not uniquely determine the pair due to the additional degree of freedom in the spiraling rate. We also discuss the semiclassical limit of the commutation relation as $\kappa \to 0$.</description>

      <title>Modulus of continuity of Kerov transition measure for continual Young diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition measure is a foundational concept introduced by Sergey Kerov to represent the shape of a Young diagram as a centered probability measure on the real line. Over a period of decades the transition measure turned out to be an invaluable tool for many problems of the asymptotic representation theory of the symmetric groups. Kerov also showed how to expand this notion for a wider class of continual diagrams so that the transition measure provides a homeomorphism between a subclass of continual diagrams (having a specific support) and a class of centered probability measures with a support contained in a specific interval. We quantify the modulus of continuity of this homeomorphism. More specifically, we study the dependence of the cumulative distribution function of Kerov transition measure on the profile of a diagram at the locations where the profile is not too steep.</description>

      <title>Uniform Hanson-Wright Type Deviation Inequalities for $\alpha$-Subexponential Random Vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to uniform versions of the Hanson-Wright inequality for a random vector with independent centered $\alpha$-subexponential entries, $0&lt;\alpha\le 1$. Our method relies upon a novel decoupling inequality and a comparison of weak and strong moments. As an application, we use the derived inequality to prove the restricted isometry property of partial random circulant matrices generated by standard $\alpha$-subexponential random vectors, $0&lt;\alpha\le 1$.</description>

      <title>Improved bounds for polylogarithmic graph distances in scale-free percolation and related models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study graph distances in the geometric random graph models scale-free percolation SFP, geometric inhomogeneous random graphs GIRG, and hyperbolic random graphs HRG. Despite the wide success of the models, the parameter regime in which graph distances are polylogarithmic is poorly understood. We provide new and improved lower bounds. In a certain portion of the parameter regime, those match the known upper bounds.
  Compared to the best previous lower bounds by Hao and Heydenreich, our result has several advantages: it gives matching bounds for a larger range of parameters, thus settling the question for a larger portion of the parameter space. It strictly improves the lower bounds by Hao and Heydenreich for all parameters settings in which those bounds were not tight. It gives tail bounds on the probability of having short paths, which imply shape theorems for the $k$-neighbourhood of a vertex whenever our lower bounds are tight, and tight bounds for the size of this $k$-neighbourhood. And last but not least, our proof is much simpler and not much longer than two pages, and we demonstrate that it generalizes well by showing that the same technique also works for first passage percolation.</description>

      <title>Sharp estimates for the Cram\'{e}r transform of log-concave measures and geometric applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a new comparison between the Legendre transform of the cumulant generating function and the half-space depth of an arbitrary log-concave probability distribution on the real line, that carries on to the multidimensional setting. Combined with sharp estimates for the Cram\'{e}r transform of rotationally invariant measures, we are led to some new phase-transition type results for the asymptotics of the expected measure of random polytopes. As a byproduct of our analysis, we address a question on the sharp exponential separability constant for log-concave distributions, in the symmetric case.</description>

      <title>Notes on hyperbolic branching Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Euclidean branching Brownian motion (BBM) has been intensively studied during many decades by renowned researchers. BBM on hyperbolic space has received less attention. A profound study of Lalley and Sellke (1997) provided insight on the recurrent, resp. transient regimes of BBM on the Poincare' disk. In particular, they determined the Hausdorff dimension of the limit set on the boundary circle in dependance on the fission rate of the branching particles. In the present notes, some further features are exhibited, such as the rate of the maximal hyperbolic distance to the starting point and the behaviour of the empiricial distributions of the branching population, as time goes to infinity.</description>

      <title>Critical probabilities for positively associated, finite-range dependent percolation models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On a locally finite, infinite tree $T$, let $p_c(T)$ denote the critical probability for Bernoulli percolation. We prove that every positively associated, finite-range dependent percolation model on $T$ with marginals $p &gt; p_c(T)$ must percolate. Among finite-range dependent models on trees, positive association is thus a favourable property for percolation to occur.
  On general graphs of bounded degree, Liggett, Schonmann and Stacey (1997) proved that finite-range dependent percolation models with sufficiently large marginals stochastically dominate product measures. Under the additional assumption of positive association, we prove that stochastic domination actually holds for arbitrary marginals. Our result thereby generalises Proposition 3.4 in Liggett, Schonmann and Stacey (1997) which was restricted to the special case $G = \mathbb{Z}$.
  Studying the class of 1-independent percolation models has proven useful in bounding critical probabilities of various percolation models via renormalization. In many cases, the renormalized model is not only 1-independent but also positively associated. This motivates us to introduce the smallest parameter $p_a^+(G)$ such that every positively associated, 1-independent bond percolation model on a graph $G$ with marginals $p &gt; p_a^+(G)$ percolates. We obtain quantitative upper and lower bounds on $p_a^+(\mathbb{Z}^2)$ and on $p_a^+(\mathbb{Z}^n)$ as $n\to \infty$, and also study the case of oriented bond percolation. In proving these results, we revisit several techniques originally developed for Bernoulli percolation, which become applicable thanks to a simple but seemingly new way of combining positive association with finite-range dependence.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations of Eigenvalues for Generalized Patterned Gaussian Random Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study a class of random matrices which interpolate between the Wigner matrix model and various types of patterned random matrices such as random Toeplitz, Hankel, and circulant matrices. The interpolation mechanism is through the correlations of the entries, and thus these interpolating models are highly inhomogeneous in their correlation structure. Historically, the study of random matrices has focused on homogeneous models, i.e., those with imposed structure (such as independence of the entries), as such restrictions significantly simplify computations related to the models. However, in this paper we demonstrate that for these interpolating inhomogenous models, the fluctuations of the linear eigenvalue statistics are approximately Gaussian. To handle the difficulties that come with inhomogeneity in the entries, we incorporate combinatorial arguments and recent tools from non-asymptotic random matrix theory.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the stability equivalence problem for stochastic differential delay equations, the auxiliary stochastic differential equations and their corresponding Euler-Maruyama (EM) methods under $G$-framework. More precisely, for $p\geq 2$, we prove the equivalence of practical exponential stability in $p$-th moment sense among stochastic differential delay equations driven by $G$-Brownian motion ($G$-SDDEs), the auxiliary stochastic differential equations driven by $G$-Brownian motion ($G$-SDEs), and their corresponding Euler-Maruyama methods, provided the delay or the step size is small enough. Thus, we can carry out careful simulations to examine the practical exponential stability of the underlying $G$-SDDE or $G$-SDE under some reasonable assumptions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The diffusion of charged particles in a graph can be modeled using random walks on a weighted graph. We give strategies to hide (or cloak) changes in a subgraph from the perspective of measurements of expected net particle charges made at nodes away from the cloaked subgraph. We distinguish between passive and active strategies, depending on whether the strategy involves injecting particles. The passive strategy can hide topology and edge weight changes. In addition to these capabilities, the active strategy can also hide sources of particles, at the cost of prior knowledge of the expected net particle charges in the reference graph. The strategies we present rely on discrete analogues of classic potential theory, that include a Calder\'on calculus on graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the Liouville Flow Importance Sampler (LFIS), an innovative flow-based model for generating samples from unnormalized density functions. LFIS learns a time-dependent velocity field that deterministically transports samples from a simple initial distribution to a complex target distribution, guided by a prescribed path of annealed distributions. The training of LFIS utilizes a unique method that enforces the structure of a derived partial differential equation to neural networks modeling velocity fields. By considering the neural velocity field as an importance sampler, sample weights can be computed through accumulating errors along the sample trajectories driven by neural velocity fields, ensuring unbiased and consistent estimation of statistical quantities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LFIS through its application to a range of benchmark problems, on many of which LFIS achieved state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>Positive formula for the product of conjugacy classes on the unitary group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The convolution product of two generic conjugacy classes of the unitary group $U_n$ is described by a probability distribution on the space of central measures which admits a density. Relating the convolution to the quantum Littlewood-Richardson coefficients and using recent results describing those coefficients, we give a manifestly positive formula for this density. In the same flavor as the hive model of Knutson and Tao, this formula is given in terms of a subtraction-free sum of volumes of explicit polytopes. As a consequence, this expression also provides a positive formula for the volume of moduli spaces of $SU_n$-valued flat connections on the three-holed two dimensional sphere, which was first given by Witten in terms of an infinite sum of characters.</description>

      <title>Coherent Risk Measure on $L^0$: NA Condition, Pricing and Dual Representation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The NA condition is one of the pillars supporting the classical theory of financial mathematics. We revisit this condition for financial market models where a dynamic risk-measure defined on $L^0$ is fixed to characterize the family of acceptable wealths that play the role of non negative financial positions. We provide in this setting a new version of the fundamental theorem of asset pricing and we deduce a dual characterization of the super-hedging prices (called risk-hedging prices) of a European option. Moreover, we show that the set of all risk-hedging prices is closed under NA. At last, we provide a dual representation of the risk-measure on $L^0$ under some conditions.</description>

      <title>Statistical Error of Numerical Integrators for Underdamped Langevin Dynamics with Deterministic And Stochastic Gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel discrete Poisson equation approach to estimate the statistical error of a broad class of numerical integrators for the underdamped Langevin dynamics. The statistical error refers to the mean square error of the estimator to the exact ensemble average with a finite number of iterations. With the proposed error analysis framework, we show that when the potential function $U(x)$ is strongly convex in $\mathbb R^d$ and the numerical integrator has strong order $p$, the statistical error is $O(h^{2p}+\frac1{Nh})$, where $h$ is the time step and $N$ is the number of iterations. Besides, this approach can be adopted to analyze integrators with stochastic gradients, and quantitative estimates can be derived as well. Our approach only requires the geometric ergodicity of the continuous-time underdamped Langevin dynamics, and relaxes the constraint on the time step.</description>

      <title>Method of Successive Approximations for Stochastic Optimal Control: Contractivity and Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Method of Successive Approximations (MSA) is a fixed-point iterative method used to solve stochastic optimal control problems. It is an indirect method based on the conditions derived from the Stochastic Maximum Principle (SMP), an extension of the Pontryagin Maximum Principle (PMP) to stochastic control problems. In this study, we investigate the contractivity and the convergence of MSA for a specific and interesting class of stochastic dynamical systems (when the drift coefficient is one-sided-Lipschitz with a negative constant and the diffusion coefficient is Lipschitz continuous). Our analysis unfolds in three key steps: firstly, we prove the stability of the state process with respect to the control process. Secondly, we establish the stability of the adjoint process. Finally, we present rigorous evidence to prove the contractivity and then the convergence of MSA. This study contributes to enhancing the understanding of MSA's applicability and effectiveness in addressing stochastic optimal control problems.</description>

      <title>A Pair of Bayesian Network Structures has Undecidable Conditional Independencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a Bayesian network structure (directed acyclic graph), the celebrated d-separation algorithm efficiently determines whether the network structure implies a given conditional independence relation. We show that this changes drastically when we consider two Bayesian network structures instead. It is undecidable to determine whether two given network structures imply a given conditional independency, that is, whether every collection of random variables satisfying both network structures must also satisfy the conditional independency. Although the approximate combination of two Bayesian networks is a well-studied topic, our result shows that it is fundamentally impossible to accurately combine the knowledge of two Bayesian network structures, in the sense that no algorithm can tell what conditional independencies are implied by the two network structures. We can also explicitly construct two Bayesian network structures, such that whether they imply a certain conditional independency is unprovable in the ZFC set theory, assuming ZFC is consistent.</description>

      <title>Extreme Distance Distributions of Poisson Voronoi Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Poisson point processes provide a versatile framework for modeling the distributions of random points in space. When the space is partitioned into cells, each associated with a single generating point from the Poisson process, there appears a geometric structure known as Poisson Voronoi tessellation. These tessellations find applications in various fields such as biology, material science, and communications, where the statistical properties of the Voronoi cells reveal patterns and structures that hold key insights into the underlying processes generating the observed phenomena.
  In this paper, we investigate a distance measure of Poisson Voronoi tessellations that is emerging in the literature, yet for which its statistical and geometrical properties remain explored only in the asymptotic case when the density of seed points approaches infinity. Our work, specifically focused on homogeneous Poisson point processes, characterizes the cumulative distribution functions governing the smallest and largest distances between the points generating the Voronoi regions and their respective vertices for an arbitrary density of points in $\mathbb{R}^2$. For that, we conduct a Monte-Carlo type simulation with $10^8$ Voronoi cells and fit the resulting empirical cumulative distribution functions to the Generalized Gamma, Gamma, Log-normal, Rayleigh, and Weibull distributions. Our analysis compares these fits in terms of root mean-squared error and maximum absolute variation, revealing the Generalized Gamma distribution as the best-fit model for characterizing these distances in homogeneous Poisson Voronoi tessellations. Furthermore, we provide estimates for the maximum likelihood and the $95$\% confidence interval of the parameters of the Generalized Gamma distribution along with the algorithm implemented to calculate the maximum and minimum distances.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Langevin dynamics of rigid inclusions on curved surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stochastic dynamics of a rigid inclusion constrained to move on a curved surface has many applications in biological and soft matter physics, ranging from the diffusion of passive or active membrane proteins to the motion of phoretic particles on liquid-liquid interfaces. Here we construct intrinsic Langevin equations for an oriented rigid inclusion on a curved surface using Cartan's method of moving frames. We first derive the Hamiltonian equations of motion for the translational and rotational momenta in the body frame. Surprisingly, surface curvature couples the linear and angular momenta of the inclusion. We then add to the Hamiltonian equations linear friction, white noise and arbitrary configuration-dependent forces and torques to obtain intrinsic Langevin equations of motion in phase space. We provide the integrability conditions, made non-trivial by surface curvature, for the forces and torques to admit a potential, thus distinguishing between passive and active stochastic motion. We derive the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation in geometric form and obtain fluctuation-dissipation relations that ensure Gibbsian equilibrium. We extract the overdamped equations of motion by adiabatically eliminating the momenta from the Fokker-Planck equation, showing how a peculiar cancellation leads to the naively expected Smoluchowski limit. The overdamped equations can be used for accurate and efficient intrinsic Brownian dynamics simulations of passive, driven and active diffusion processes on curved surfaces. Our work generalises to the collective dynamics of many inclusions on curved surfaces.</description>

      <title>On Joint Marginal Expected Shortfall and Associated Contribution Risk Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Systemic risk is the risk that a company- or industry-level risk could trigger a huge collapse of another or even the whole institution. Various systemic risk measures have been proposed in the literature to quantify the domino and (relative) spillover effects induced by systemic risks such as the well-known CoVaR, CoES, MES and CoD risk measures, and associated contribution measures. This paper proposes another new type of systemic risk measure, called the joint marginal expected shortfall (JMES), to measure whether the MES of one entity's risk-taking adds to another one or the overall risk conditioned on the event that the entity is already in some specified distress level. We further introduce two useful systemic risk contribution measures based on the difference function or relative ratio function of the JMES and the conventional ES, respectively. Some basic properties of these proposed measures are studied such as monotonicity, comonotonic additivity, non-identifiability and non-elicitability. For both risk measures and two different vectors of bivariate risks, we establish sufficient conditions imposed on copula structure, stress levels, and stochastic orders to compare these new measures. We further provide some numerical examples to illustrate our main findings. A real application in analyzing the risk contagion among several stock market indices is implemented to show the performances of our proposed measures compared with other commonly used measures including CoVaR, CoES, MES, and their associated contribution measures.</description>

Abstract: In this note we complete the analysis carried on in [CGSV] about the topological synchronisation of unimodal maps of the interval coupled in a master-slave configuration, by answering to the questions raised in that paper. Namely, we compute the weak limits of the invariant measure of the coupled system as the coupling strength $k \in (0,1)$ tends to $0$ and to $1$ and discuss the uniqueness of the invariant measure of its random dynamical system counterpart.

      <description>arXiv:2405.07688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we are mainly concerned with $(\mathbb{G},\mu)$-harmonic functions that grow at most polynomially, where $\mathbb{G}$ is a finitely generated group with a probability measure $\mu$. In the initial part of the paper, we focus on Lipschitz harmonic functions and how they descend onto finite index subgroups. We discuss the relations between Lipschitz harmonic functions and harmonic functions of linear growth and conclude that for groups of polynomial growth, they coincide. In the latter part of the paper, we specialise to positive harmonic functions and give a characterisation for strong Liouville property in terms of the Green's function. We show that the existence of a non-constant positive harmonic function of polynomial growth guarantees that the group cannot have polynomial growth.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, a general framework is developed for continuous-time financial market models defined from simple strategies through conditional topologies that avoid stochastic calculus and do not necessitate semimartingale models. We then compare the usual no-arbitrage conditions of the literature, e.g. the usual no-arbitrage conditions NFL, NFLVR and NUPBR and the recent AIP condition. With appropriate pseudo-distance topologies, we show that they hold in continuous time if and only if they hold in discrete time. Moreover, the super-hedging prices in continuous time coincide with the discrete-time super-hedging prices, even without any no-arbitrage condition.</description>

      <title>Measuring dependence between a scalar response and a functional covariate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the scope of a recently introduced dependence coefficient between a scalar response $Y$ and a multivariate covariate $X$ to the case where $X$ takes values in a general metric space. Particular attention is paid to the case where $X$ is a curve. While on the population level, this extension is straight forward, the asymptotic behavior of the estimator we consider is delicate. It crucially depends on the nearest neighbor structure of the infinite-dimensional covariate sample, where deterministic bounds on the degrees of the nearest neighbor graphs available in multivariate settings do no longer exist. The main contribution of this paper is to give some insight into this matter and to advise a way how to overcome the problem for our purposes. As an important application of our results, we consider an independence test.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain a central limit theorem for bulk counting statistics of free fermions in smooth domains of $\mathbb{R}^n$ with an explicit description of the covariance structure. This amounts to a study of the asymptotics of norms of commutators between spectral projectors of semiclassical Schr\"odinger operators and indicator functions supported in the bulk. In the spirit of the Widom conjecture, we show that the squared Hilbert-Schmidt norm of these commutators is of order $\hbar^{-n+1}\log(\hbar)$ as the semiclassical parameter $\hbar$ tends to $0$. We also give a new upper bound on the trace norm of these commutators and applications to estimations of the entanglement entropy for free fermions.</description>

Abstract: The classical Toda flow is a well-known integrable Hamiltonian system that diagonalizes matrices. By keeping track of the distribution of entries and precise scattering asymptotics, one can exhibit matrix models for log-gases on the real line. These types of scattering asymptotics date back to fundamental work of Moser.
  More precisely, using the classical Toda flow acting on symmetric real tridiagonal matrices, we give a "symplectic" proof of the fact that the Dumitriu-Edelman tridiagonal model has a spectrum following the Gaussian $\beta$-ensemble.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2004.03177v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we obtain rates of convergence for two moderately interacting stochastic particle systems with singular kernels associated to the viscous Burgers and Keller-Segel equations. The main novelty of this work is to consider a non-locally integrable kernel. Namely for the viscous Burgers equation in $\mathbb{R}$, we obtain almost sure convergence of the mollified empirical measure to the solution of the PDE in some Bessel space with a rate of convergence of order $N^{-1/8}$, on any time interval. The same holds for the genuine empirical measure in Wasserstein distance. In the case of the Keller-Segel equation on a $d$-dimensional torus, we obtain almost sure convergence of the mollified empirical measure to the solution of the PDE in some $L^q$ space with a rate of order $N^{-\frac{1}{2d+1}}$. The result holds up to the maximal existence time of the PDE, for any value of the chemo-attractant sensitivity $\chi$.</description>

      <title>A martingale approach to time-dependent and time-periodic linear response in Markov jump processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2201.02982v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a Markov jump process on a general state space to which we apply a time-dependent weak perturbation over a finite time interval. By martingale-based stochastic calculus, under a suitable exponential moment bound for the perturbation we show that the perturbed process does not explode almost surely and we study the linear response (LR) of observables and additive functionals. When the unperturbed process is stationary, the above LR formulas become computable in terms of the steady state two-time correlation function and of the stationary distribution. Applications are discussed for birth and death processes, random walks in a confining potential, random walks in a random conductance field. We then move to a Markov jump process on a finite state space and investigate the LR of observables and additive functionals in the oscillatory steady state (hence, over an infinite time horizon), when the perturbation is time-periodic. As an application we provide a formula for the complex mobility matrix of a random walk on a discrete $d$-dimensional torus, with possibly heterogeneous jump rates.</description>

      <title>Characterization of exchangeable measure-valued P\'olya urn sequences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.10083v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measure-valued P\'olya urn sequences (MVPS) are a generalization of the observation processes generated by $k$-color P\'olya urn models, where the space of colors $\mathbb{X}$ is a complete separable metric space and the urn composition is a finite measure on $\mathbb{X}$, in which case reinforcement reduces to a summation of measures. In this paper, we prove a representation theorem for the reinforcement measures $R$ of all exchangeable MVPSs, which leads to a characterization result for their directing random measures $\tilde{P}$. In particular, when $\mathbb{X}$ is countable or $R$ is dominated by the initial distribution $\nu$, then any exchangeable MVPS is a Dirichlet process mixture model over a family of probability distributions with disjoint supports. Furthermore, for all exchangeable MVPSs, the predictive distributions converge on a set of probability one in total variation to $\tilde{P}$. Importantly, we do not restrict our analysis to balanced MVPSs, in the terminology of $k$-color urns, but rather show that the only non-balanced exchangeable MVPSs are sequences of i.i.d. random variables.</description>

      <title>Convergence of local times of stochastic processes associated with resistance forms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.13224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, it is shown that if a sequence of resistance metric spaces equipped with measures converges with respect to the local Gromov-Hausdorff-vague topology, and certain non-explosion and metric-entropy conditions are satisfied, then the associated stochastic processes and their local times also converge. The metric-entropy condition can be checked by applying volume estimates of balls. Whilst similar results have been proved previously, the approach of this article is more widely applicable. Indeed, we recover various known conclusions for scaling limits of some deterministic self-similar fractal graphs, critical Galton-Watson trees, the critical Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph and the configuration model (in the latter two cases, we prove for the first time the convergence of the models with respect to the resistance metric and also, for the configuration model, we overcome an error in the existing proof of local time convergence). Moreover, we derive new ones for scaling limits of uniform spanning trees and random recursive fractals. The metric-entropy condition also implies convergence of associated Gaussian processes.</description>

      <title>Second order quantitative bounds for unadjusted generalized Hamiltonian Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.09513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper provides a convergence analysis for generalized Hamiltonian Monte Carlo samplers, a family of Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods based on leapfrog integration of Hamiltonian dynamics and kinetic Langevin diffusion, that encompasses the unadjusted Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method. Assuming that the target distribution $\pi$ satisfies a log-Sobolev inequality and mild conditions on the corresponding potential function, we establish quantitative bounds on the relative entropy of the iterates defined by the algorithm, with respect to $\pi$. Our approach is based on a perturbative and discrete version of the modified entropy method developed to establish hypocoercivity for the continuous-time kinetic Langevin process. As a corollary of our main result, we are able to derive complexity bounds for the class of algorithms at hand. In particular, we show that the total number of iterations to achieve a target accuracy $\varepsilon &gt;0$ is of order $d/\varepsilon^{1/4}$, where $d$ is the dimension of the problem. This result can be further improved in the case of weakly interacting mean field potentials, for which we find a total number of iterations of order $(d/\varepsilon)^{1/4}$.</description>

      <title>The friendship paradox for sparse random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15105v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G_n$ be an undirected finite graph on $n\in\mathbb{N}$ vertices labelled by $[n] = \{1,\ldots,n\}$. For $i \in [n]$, let $\Delta_{i,n}$ be the friendship bias of vertex $i$, defined as the difference between the average degree of the neighbours of vertex $i$ and the degree of vertex $i$ itself when $i$ is not isolated, and zero when $i$ is isolated. Let $\mu_n$ denote the friendship-bias empirical distribution, i.e., the measure that puts mass $\frac{1}{n}$ at each $\Delta_{i,n}$, $i \in [n]$. The friendship paradox says that if $G_n$ has no self-loops, then $\int_{\mathbb{R}} x\mu_n(\mathrm{d}x) \geq 0$, with equality if and only if in each connected component of $G_n$ all the degrees are the same.
  We show that if $(G_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ is a sequence of sparse random graphs that converges to a rooted random tree in the sense of convergence locally in probability, then $\mu_n$ converges weakly to a limiting measure $\mu$ that is expressible in terms of the law of the rooted random tree. We study $\mu$ for four classes of sparse random graphs: the homogeneous Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph, the inhomogeneous Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph, the configuration model and the preferential attachment model. In particular, we compute the first two moments of $\mu$, identify the right tail of $\mu$, and argue that $\mu([0,\infty))\geq\tfrac{1}{2}$, a property we refer to as friendship-paradox significance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the deviation inequality for the spectral norm of structured random matrices with non-gaussian entries. In particular, we establish an optimal bound for the $p$-th moment of the spectral norm by transfering the spectral norm into the suprema of canonical processes. A crucial ingredient of our proof is a comparison of weak and strong moments. As an application, we show a deviation inequality for the smallest singular value of a rectangular random matrix.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14860v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain a $p$-th moment bound for the suprema of a log-concave-tailed nonhomogeneous chaos process, which is optimal in some special cases. A crucial ingredient of the proof is a novel decoupling inequality, which may be of independent interest. With this $p$-th moment bound, we show two uniform Hanson-Wright type deviation inequalities for $\alpha$-subexponential entries ($1\le \alpha\le 2$), which recover some known results. As applications, we prove the restricted isometry property of partial random circulant matrices and time-frequency structured random matrices induced by standard $\alpha$-subexponential vectors ($1\le \alpha\le 2$), which extends the previously known results for the subgaussian case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17446v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X$ and $Y$ be independent variance-gamma random variables with zero location parameter; then the exact probability density function of the product $XY$ is derived. Some basic distributional properties are also derived, including formulas for the cumulative distribution function and the characteristic function, as well as asymptotic approximations for the density, tail probabilities and the quantile function. As special cases, we deduce some key distributional properties for the product of two independent asymmetric Laplace random variables as well as the product of four jointly correlated zero mean normal random variables with a particular block diagonal covariance matrix. As a by-product of our analysis, we deduce some new reduction formulas for the Meijer $G$-function.</description>

      <title>Operation with Concentration Inequalities and Conjugate of Parallel Sum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08206v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Following the concentration of the measure theory formalism, we consider the transformation $\Phi(Z)$ of a random variable $Z$ having a general concentration function $\alpha$. If the transformation $\Phi$ is $\lambda$-Lipschitz with $\lambda&gt;0$ deterministic, the concentration function of $\Phi(Z)$ is immediately deduced to be equal to $\alpha(\cdot/\lambda)$. If the variations of $\Phi$ are bounded by a random variable $\Lambda$ having a concentration function (around $0$) $\beta: \mathbb R_+\to \mathbb R$, this paper sets that $\Phi(Z)$ has a concentration function analogous to the so-called parallel produuct of $\alpha$ and $\beta$: $(\alpha^{-1} \cdot \beta^{-1})^{-1}$. We apply this result to (i) express the concentration of large-tailed random vectors, (ii) generalize Hanson Wright inequality, and (iii) provide useful insights on the so-called "multilevel concentration" that appears when $\Lambda$ is the product of $n$ random variables. This last result is obtained when we formulate the conjugate functions of the parallel sum of $n$ real mappings.</description>

      <title>The distribution on permutations induced by a random parking function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11529v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A parking function on $[n]$ creates a permutation in $S_n$ via the order in which the $n$ cars appear in the $n$ parking spaces. Placing the uniform probability measure on the set of parking functions on $[n]$ induces a probability measure on $S_n$. We initiate a study of some properties of this distribution. Let $P_n^{\text{park}}$ denote this distribution on $S_n$ and let $P_n$ denote the uniform distribution on $S_n$. In particular, we obtain an explicit formula for $P_n^{\text{park}}(\sigma)$ for all $\sigma\in S_n$. Then we show that for all but an asymptotically $P_n$-negligible set of permutations, one has $P_n^{\text{park}}(\sigma)\in\left(\frac{(2-\epsilon)^n}{(n+1)^{n-1}},\frac{(2+\epsilon)^n}{(n+1)^{n-1}}\right)$. However, this accounts for only an exponentially small part of the $P_n^{\text{park}}$-probability. We also obtain an explicit formula for $P_n^{\text{park}}(\sigma^{-1}_{n-j+1}=i_1,\sigma^{-1}_{n-j+2}=i_2,\cdots, \sigma^{-1}_n=i_j)$, the probability that the last $j$ cars park in positions $i_1,\cdots, i_j$ respectively, and show that the $j$-dimensional random vector $(n+1-\sigma^{-1}_{n-j+l}, n+1-\sigma^{-1}_{n-j+2},\cdots, n+1-\sigma^{-1}_{n})$ under $P_n^{\text{park}}$ converges in distribution to a random vector $(\sum_{r=1}^jX_r,\sum_{r=2}^j X_r,\cdots, X_{j-1}+X_j,X_j)$, where $\{X_r\}_{r=1}^j$ are IID with the Borel distribution. We then show that in fact for $j_n=o(n^\frac16)$, the final $j_n$ cars will park in increasing order with probability approaching 1 as $n\to\infty$.</description>

      <title>Optimal and instance-dependent guarantees for Markovian linear stochastic approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.12770v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study stochastic approximation procedures for approximately solving a $d$-dimensional linear fixed point equation based on observing a trajectory of length $n$ from an ergodic Markov chain. We first exhibit a non-asymptotic bound of the order $t_{\mathrm{mix}} \tfrac{d}{n}$ on the squared error of the last iterate of a standard scheme, where $t_{\mathrm{mix}}$ is a mixing time. We then prove a non-asymptotic instance-dependent bound on a suitably averaged sequence of iterates, with a leading term that matches the local asymptotic minimax limit, including sharp dependence on the parameters $(d, t_{\mathrm{mix}})$ in the higher order terms. We complement these upper bounds with a non-asymptotic minimax lower bound that establishes the instance-optimality of the averaged SA estimator. We derive corollaries of these results for policy evaluation with Markov noise -- covering the TD($\lambda$) family of algorithms for all $\lambda \in [0, 1)$ -- and linear autoregressive models. Our instance-dependent characterizations open the door to the design of fine-grained model selection procedures for hyperparameter tuning (e.g., choosing the value of $\lambda$ when running the TD($\lambda$) algorithm).</description>

      <title>Spiked eigenvalues of high-dimensional sample autocovariance matrices: CLT and applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2201.03181v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-dimensional autocovariance matrices play an important role in dimension reduction for high-dimensional time series. In this article, we establish the central limit theorem (CLT) for spiked eigenvalues of high-dimensional sample autocovariance matrices, which are developed under general conditions. The spiked eigenvalues are allowed to go to infinity in a flexible way without restrictions in divergence order. Moreover, the number of spiked eigenvalues and the time lag of the autocovariance matrix under this study could be either fixed or tending to infinity when the dimension p and the time length T go to infinity together. As a further statistical application, a novel autocovariance test is proposed to detect the equivalence of spiked eigenvalues for two high-dimensional time series. Various simulation studies are illustrated to justify the theoretical findings. Furthermore, a hierarchical clustering approach based on the autocovariance test is constructed and applied to clustering mortality data from multiple countries.</description>

      <title>On Erd\H{o}s sums of almost primes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.08277v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1935, Erd\H{o}s proved that the sums $f_k=\sum_n 1/(n\log n)$, over integers $n$ with exactly $k$ prime factors, are bounded by an absolute constant, and in 1993 Zhang proved that $f_k$ is maximized by the prime sum $f_1=\sum_p 1/(p\log p)$. According to a 2013 conjecture of Banks and Martin, the sums $f_k$ are predicted to decrease monotonically in $k$. In this article, we show that the sums restricted to odd integers are indeed monotonically decreasing in $k$, sufficiently large. By contrast, contrary to the conjecture we prove that the sums $f_k$ increase monotonically in $k$, sufficiently large. Our main result gives an asymptotic for $f_k$ which identifies the (negative) secondary term, namely $f_k = 1 - (a+o(1))k^2/2^k$ for an explicit constant $a= 0.0656\cdots$. This is proven by a refined method combining real and complex analysis, whereas the classical results of Sathe and Selberg on products of $k$ primes imply the weaker estimate $f_k=1+O_{\varepsilon}(k^{\varepsilon-1/2})$. We also give an alternate, probability-theoretic argument related to the Dickman distribution. Here the proof reduces to showing a sequence of integrals converges exponentially quickly to $e^{-\gamma}$, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.13443v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The semi-random graph process is a single player game in which the player is initially presented an empty graph on $n$ vertices. In each round, a vertex $u$ is presented to the player independently and uniformly at random. The player then adaptively selects a vertex $v$, and adds the edge $uv$ to the graph. For a fixed monotone graph property, the objective of the player is to force the graph to satisfy this property with high probability in as few rounds as possible. In this paper, we investigate the following three properties: containing a complete graph of order $k$, having the chromatic number at least $k$, and not having an independent set of size at least $k$.</description>

      <title>Properties of Discrete Sliced Wasserstein Losses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.10352v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Sliced Wasserstein (SW) distance has become a popular alternative to the Wasserstein distance for comparing probability measures. Widespread applications include image processing, domain adaptation and generative modelling, where it is common to optimise some parameters in order to minimise SW, which serves as a loss function between discrete probability measures (since measures admitting densities are numerically unattainable). All these optimisation problems bear the same sub-problem, which is minimising the Sliced Wasserstein energy. In this paper we study the properties of $\mathcal{E}: Y \longmapsto \mathrm{SW}_2^2(\gamma_Y, \gamma_Z)$, i.e. the SW distance between two uniform discrete measures with the same amount of points as a function of the support $Y \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$ of one of the measures. We investigate the regularity and optimisation properties of this energy, as well as its Monte-Carlo approximation $\mathcal{E}_p$ (estimating the expectation in SW using only $p$ samples) and show convergence results on the critical points of $\mathcal{E}_p$ to those of $\mathcal{E}$, as well as an almost-sure uniform convergence and a uniform Central Limit result on the process $\mathcal{E}_p(Y)$. Finally, we show that in a certain sense, Stochastic Gradient Descent methods minimising $\mathcal{E}$ and $\mathcal{E}_p$ converge towards (Clarke) critical points of these energies.</description>

      <title>Convergence Rates for Stochastic Approximation: Biased Noise with Unbounded Variance, and Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02828v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the convergence properties of the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) method for finding a stationary point of a given objective function $J(\cdot)$. The objective function is not required to be convex. Rather, our results apply to a class of ``invex'' functions, which have the property that every stationary point is also a global minimizer. First, it is assumed that $J(\cdot)$ satisfies a property that is slightly weaker than the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz (KL) condition, denoted here as (KL'). It is shown that the iterations $J({\boldsymbol \theta}_t)$ converge almost surely to the global minimum of $J(\cdot)$. Next, the hypothesis on $J(\cdot)$ is strengthened from (KL') to the Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) condition. With this stronger hypothesis, we derive estimates on the rate of convergence of $J({\boldsymbol \theta}_t)$ to its limit. Using these results, we show that for functions satisfying the PL property, the convergence rate of SGD is the same as the best-possible rate for convex functions. While some results along these lines have been published in the past, our contributions contain two distinct improvements. First, the assumptions on the stochastic gradient are more general than elsewhere, and second, our convergence is almost sure, and not in expectation. We also study SGD when only function evaluations are permitted. In this setting, we determine the ``optimal'' increments or the size of the perturbations. Using the same set of ideas, we establish the global convergence of the Stochastic Approximation (SA) algorithm under more general assumptions on the measurement error, compared to the existing literature. We also derive bounds on the rate of convergence of the SA algorithm under appropriate assumptions.</description>

      <title>Probability Tools for Sequential Random Projection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14026v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the first probabilistic framework tailored for sequential random projection, an approach rooted in the challenges of sequential decision-making under uncertainty. The analysis is complicated by the sequential dependence and high-dimensional nature of random variables, a byproduct of the adaptive mechanisms inherent in sequential decision processes. Our work features a novel construction of a stopped process, facilitating the analysis of a sequence of concentration events that are interconnected in a sequential manner. By employing the method of mixtures within a self-normalized process, derived from the stopped process, we achieve a desired non-asymptotic probability bound. This bound represents a non-trivial martingale extension of the Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) lemma, marking a pioneering contribution to the literature on random projection and sequential analysis.</description>

      <title>About the Moments of the Generalized Ulam Problem</title>

Abstract: Given $\pi \in S_n$, let $Z_{n,k}(\pi)=\sum_{1\leq i_1&lt;\dots&lt;i_k\leq n} \mathbf{1}(\{ \pi_{i_1}&lt;\dots&lt;\pi_{i_k}\}$ denote the number of increasing subsequences of length $k$. Consider the "generalized Ulam problem," studying the distribution of $Z_{n,k}$ for general $k$ and $n$. For the 2nd moment, Ross Pinsky initiated a combinatorial study by considering a pair of subsequences $i^{(r)}_1&lt;\dots&lt;i^{(r)}_k$ for $r \in \{1,2\}$, and conditioning on the size of the intersection $j = |\{i_1^{(1)},\dots,i^{(1)}_k\} \cap \{i^{(2)}_1,\dots,i^{(2)}_k\}|$. We obtain the exact large deviation rate function for $\mathbf{E}[Z_{n,k} Z_{n,\ell}]$ in the asymptotic regime $k\sim \kappa n^{1/2}$, $\ell \sim \lambda n^{1/2}$ as $n \to \infty$, for $\kappa,\lambda \in (0,\infty)$. This uses multivariate generating function techniques, as found in the textbook of Pemantle and Wilson. The requisite generating function enumerates pairs of up-right paths in $d=2$, which both end at $(k,\ell)$ with a given number of intersections. We also evaluate the analogous generating function for pairs of $(+\boldsymbol{i},+\boldsymbol{j},+\boldsymbol{k})$ paths in $d=3$, which both end at $(k,\ell,m)$, which has some utility in calculating the 3rd moment. Finally, we consider a simpler problem involving partitions instead of permutations, where all moments are calculable and the replica symmetric ansatz can be stated if not proved.</description>

      <title>Local convergence rates for Wasserstein gradient flows and McKean-Vlasov equations with multiple stationary solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-linear versions of log-Sobolev inequalities, that link a free energy to its dissipation along the corresponding Wasserstein gradient flow (i.e. corresponds to Polyak-Lojasiewicz inequalities in this context), are known to provide global exponential long-time convergence to the free energy minimizers, and have been shown to hold in various contexts. However they cannot hold when the free energy admits critical points which are not global minimizers, which is for instance the case of the granular media equation in a double-well potential with quadratic attractive interaction at low temperature. This work addresses such cases, extending the general arguments when a log-Sobolev inequality only holds locally and, as an example, establishing such local inequalities for the granular media equation with quadratic interaction either in the one-dimensional symmetric double-well case or in higher dimension in the low temperature regime. The method provides quantitative convergence rates for initial conditions in a Wasserstein ball around the stationary solutions. The same analysis is carried out for the kinetic counterpart of the gradient flow, i.e. the corresponding Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation. The local exponential convergence to stationary solutions for the mean-field equations, both elliptic and kinetic, is shown to induce for the corresponding particle systems a fast (i.e. uniform in the number or particles) decay of the particle system free energy toward the level of the non-linear limit.</description>

      <title>Single-seed generation of Brownian paths and integrals for adaptive and high order SDE solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06464v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the success of adaptive time-stepping in ODE simulation, it has so far seen few applications for Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs). To simulate SDEs adaptively, methods such as the Virtual Brownian Tree (VBT) have been developed, which can generate Brownian motion (BM) non-chronologically. However, in most applications, knowing only the values of Brownian motion is not enough to achieve a high order of convergence; for that, we must compute time-integrals of BM such as $\int_s^t W_r \, dr$. With the aim of using high order SDE solvers adaptively, we extend the VBT to generate these integrals of BM in addition to the Brownian increments. A JAX-based implementation of our construction is included in the popular Diffrax library (https://github.com/patrick-kidger/diffrax).
  Since the entire Brownian path produced by VBT is uniquely determined by a single PRNG seed, previously generated samples need not be stored, which results in a constant memory footprint and enables experiment repeatability and strong error estimation. Based on binary search, the VBT's time complexity is logarithmic in the tolerance parameter $\varepsilon$. Unlike the original VBT algorithm, which was only precise at some dyadic times, we prove that our construction exactly matches the joint distribution of the Brownian motion and its time integrals at any query times, provided they are at least $\varepsilon$ apart.
  We present two applications of adaptive high order solvers enabled by our new VBT. Using adaptive solvers to simulate a high-volatility CIR model, we achieve more than twice the convergence order of constant stepping. We apply an adaptive third order underdamped or kinetic Langevin solver to an MCMC problem, where our approach outperforms the No U-Turn Sampler, while using only a tenth of its function evaluations.</description>
