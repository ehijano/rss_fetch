      <title>Unraveling hydrodynamization using ultracold 1D gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the quantum evolution of 1D Bose gases immediately after several variants of high-energy quenches, both experimentally and theoretically. Using the advantages conveyed by the relative simplicity of these nearly integrable many-body systems, we are able to differentiate the behavior of two distinct but often temporally overlapping processes, hydrodynamization and local prethermalization. There is a universal character to our findings, which can be applied to the short-time behavior of any interacting many-body quantum system after a sudden high-energy quench. We specifically discuss its potential relevance to heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Recurrent neural network wave functions for Rydberg atom arrays on kagome lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rydberg atom array experiments have demonstrated the ability to act as powerful quantum simulators, preparing strongly-correlated phases of matter which are challenging to study for conventional computer simulations. A key direction has been the implementation of interactions on frustrated geometries, in an effort to prepare exotic many-body states such as spin liquids and glasses. In this paper, we apply two-dimensional recurrent neural network (RNN) wave functions to study the ground states of Rydberg atom arrays on the kagome lattice. We implement an annealing scheme to find the RNN variational parameters in regions of the phase diagram where exotic phases may occur, corresponding to rough optimization landscapes. For Rydberg atom array Hamiltonians studied previously on the kagome lattice, our RNN ground states show no evidence of exotic spin liquid or emergent glassy behavior. In the latter case, we argue that the presence of a non-zero Edwards-Anderson order parameter is an artifact of the long autocorrelations times experienced with quantum Monte Carlo simulations. This result emphasizes the utility of autoregressive models, such as RNNs, to explore Rydberg atom array physics on frustrated lattices and beyond.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Quantum Phase Transitions in Driven Dissipative Spin Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open driven quantum systems have defined a powerful paradigm of non-equilibrium phases and phase transitions; however, quantum phase transitions are generically not expected in this setting due to the decohering effect of dissipation. In this work, we show that a driven-dissipative quantum spin chain exhibits a peculiar sensitivity to the ground-state quantum phase transition. Specifically, we consider a quantum Ising model subject to bulk dissipation (at rate $\Gamma$) and show that, although the correlation length remains finite (hence no phase transition), it develops a pronounced peak close to the ground-state quantum critical point. While standard techniques seem to fail in this regime, we develop a versatile analytical approach that becomes exact with vanishing dissipation ($\Gamma \to 0$ but finite $\Gamma t$). On a technical level, our approach builds on previous work where the state of the system is described by a slowly evolving generalized Gibbs ensemble that accounts for the integrability of the Hamiltonian (described by free fermions) while treating dissipation perturbatively which leads to nontrivial, nonlinear equations for fermionic correlators. Finally, we demonstrate a kind of universality in that integrability-breaking perturbations of the Hamiltonian lead to the same behavior.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Moir\'e Systems in Twisted Bilayer Optical Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moir\'e related physics in twisted bilayer two-dimensional (2D) materials has attracted widespread interest in condensed matter physics. Simulation of moir\'e related physics in cold atom platform is expected to outperform the 2D materials thanks to its advantage of higher tunablility. Here, we point out, the cold atom platform enables a new mechanism of moir\'e lattice formation, with intrinsic "dynamical" character arising from interlayer interaction, in contrast to conventional moir\'e lattice induced by single-particle interlayer tunneling. Specifically, we consider a twisted bilayer Bose-Hubbard model with vanishing interlayer tunneling, and the bilayer is solely coupled through interlayer interaction that originates from contact interaction of atoms. We find that this system hosts a plethora of novel phases unique to this dynamical lattice, including a variety of Mott insulator (MI) and superfluid (SF) phases either preserving or breaking moir\'e lattice symmetry, phases with one layer in SF and the other in MI, "interlocked" MI, and self-localized phases at commensurate twist angles. Our prediction can be readily observed in current experimental setup of twisted bilayer optical lattices, opening up new avenues for exploring the rich physics of dynamical moir\'e systems in cold atoms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.21065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultracold atoms are crucial for unlocking truly precise and accurate quantum metrology, and provide an essential platform for quantum computing, communication and memories. One of the largest ongoing challenges is the miniaturization of these quantum devices. Here, we show that the typically macroscopic optical lattice architecture at the heart of many ultra-precise quantum technologies can be realized with a single input laser beam on the same diffractive chip already used to create the ultracold atoms. Moreover, this inherently ultra-stable platform enables access to a plethora of new lattice dimensionalities and geometries, ideally suited for the design of high-accuracy, portable quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Coherent coupling of circular Rydberg qubits to inner shell excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Divalent atoms provide excellent means for advancing control in Rydberg atom-based quantum simulation and computing, due to the second optically active valence electron available. Particularly promising in this context are circular Rydberg atoms, for which long-lived ionic core excitations can be exploited without suffering from detrimental autoionization. Here, we report measurements of the electric quadrupole coupling between the metastable 4D$_{3/2}$ level and a very high-$n$ ($n=79$) circular Rydberg qubit, realized in doubly excited $^{88}$Sr atoms. We measure the kHz-scale differential level shift on the circular Rydberg qubit via beat-node Ramsey interferometry comprising spin echo. Observing this coupling requires coherent interrogation of the Rydberg states for more than one hundred microseconds, which is assisted by tweezer trapping and circular state lifetime enhancement in a black-body radiation suppressing capacitor. Our results demonstrate access to weak electron-electron interactions in Rydberg atoms and expand the quantum simulation toolbox for optical control of highly excited circular state qubits via ionic core manipulation.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic Efimov effect of quantized vortex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The three-body problem, from the chaotic motions of celestial bodies to complex microscopic particle interactions, has always been one of the most foundational yet intricate challenges in physics since its establishment. A key breakthrough in this domain is the Efimov effect, which represents a significant stride in what is now known as Efimov physics. Our study uncovers a macroscopic Efimov effect in a three-component Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC) system. Through theoretical analysis and numerical simulation, it is verified that under certain conditions, three vortices form a bound state, while removing one vortex causes the others to unbind, demonstrating topological characteristics similar to the Borromean rings, hence termed the `vortex Efimov effect', signifying a novel topological phase transition. We propose several experimental approaches to realize this macroscopic Efimov effect, paving new paths not only in many-body physics but also in exploring quantum phase transitions and applications in quantum information.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.21073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A topological quantum number, the Witten index, characterizes supersymmetric models by probing for zero energy modes and the possibility of supersymmetry breaking. We propose an averaging method to infer the Witten index in quantum analogue simulators. Motivated by recent work on Rydberg atoms trapped in optical tweezer arrays, we consider a related supersymmetric XXZ spin model. We show how to infer the Witten index from open system averaging and numerically demonstrate its topological robustness in this model. Our work defines a route for quantum analogue simulators to directly identify many-body topological physics.</description>

Abstract: Matter-wave jets are ejected from a Bose-Einstein condensate subjected to a modulation of the interaction strength. For sufficiently strong modulation additional higher harmonic matter-wave jets emerge. Here we report the first experimental observation of incommensurable "golden" $\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}$ matter-wave jets in a Bose-Einstein condensate exposed to a single frequency interaction modulation. We study the formation of higher-order jets and the corresponding incommensurable density waves in quasi-one-dimensional geometry with numerical one dimensional (1D) Gross-Pitaevskii equation simulation. We explore the process of jet formation experimentally and theoretically for a wide range of modulation amplitudes and frequencies and establish a phase diagram delineating different regimes of jet formation.</description>

      <title>Quench-induced spontaneous currents in rings of ultracold fermionic atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15348v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have observed the spontaneous appearance of currents in a ring of ultracold fermionic atoms (6Li) with attractive interactions, following a quench to a BCS-like pair superfluid. We have measured the winding number probability distribution for a range of quench rates, with a quench protocol using simultaneous forced evaporation and interaction ramps to achieve faster effective quench rates with less atom loss than a purely evaporative quench. We find that for the fastest quenches the mean square winding number of the current follows a scaling law in the quench rate with exponent {\sigma} = 0.24(2), which is somewhat lower than that predicted by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM) for the three-dimensional XY model (1/3), and unexpectedly closer to the value obtained from mean-field theory (1/4). For slower quenches non-universal effects become significant, and we observe a lower rate of spontaneous current formation that does not follow a simple scaling law.</description>

Abstract: Wavefunction effects in uncorrelated systems are characterized by the Berry curvature and quantum metric. Beyond those, we propose gauge-independent tensors describing Bloch wavefunction effects on local interaction between correlated particles. We derive an effective hydrodynamic theory for ultracold bosons in optical lattices. Ground states and collective modes of superfluids in isotropic harmonic traps are solved for highly symmetric lattices. In a dynamic process, the wavefunction effects are featured by the eigenfrequency, amplitude, and phase shift of an excited breathing mode and can be observed in experiments. We also give a tight-binding model of a bipartite square lattice with nontrivial wavefunction effects. Our discovery advances the connections between the modern band theory and quantum many-body physics.</description>

      <title>Interaction-Induced Dimensional Crossover through Full 3D to 1D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13295v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The exploration of dimensional crossover carries profound fundamental significance, serving as a crucial bridge in comprehending the remarkable disparities observed in transitional phenomena across the two distinct dimensions of a physical system. The prevalent strategy for manipulating the dimensionality involves meticulously controlling the external trapping geometry, thereby restricting the degrees of freedom of the kinetic energy from three-dimensional (3D) to lower-dimensional spaces, while maintaining the 3D nature of the interaction energy degrees of freedom. The aim of this work is to introduce an innovative scenario to achieve dimensional crossover, characterized by lower-D nature of both the kinetic and the interaction energy degrees of freedom. To accomplish this objective, we delve deeply into the realm of a 2D optically trapped Bose gas, focusing specifically on its finite-range interaction. Our emphasis lies in exploring the lattice-induced dimensional crossover from full 3D to 1D in both kinetic and interaction terms. Utilizing the functional path integral method, we derive the equation of states of the model system, encompassing crucial quantities such as the ground state energy and quantum depletion. These equations enable us to analyze the combined effects of finite range interaction and an optical lattice on quantum fluctuations of the BEC system. Notably, our analytical findings reconcile the Lee-Huang-Yang (LHY) correction to the ground state energy in 3D and Lieb-Liniger (LL) ones in 1D limit, thereby providing fresh insights into the intriguing disparities between LHY and LL corrections.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study transport in the one-dimensional mass-imbalanced Fermi-Hubbard model at infinite temperature, focusing on the case of strong interactions. Prior theoretical and experimental investigations have revealed unconventionally long transport timescales, with complications due to strong finite size effects. We compute the dynamical current-current correlation function directly in the thermodynamic limit using infinite tensor network techniques. We show that transport in the strong-imbalance limit is dominated by AC resonances, which we compute with an analytic expansion. We study the dephasing of these resonances with mass imbalance, $\eta$. In the small-imbalance limit, the model is nearly integrable. We connect these unusual limits by computing the DC conductivity and transport decay time as a function of $\eta$ and the interaction strength $U/t$. We propose an experimental protocol to measure these correlation functions in cold atom experiments.</description>

      <title>Exact Diagonalization of $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ Fermi-Hubbard Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how to perform exact diagonalizations of $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ Fermi-Hubbard models on $L$-site clusters separately in each irreducible representation ({irrep}) of $\mathrm{SU}(N)$. Using the representation theory of the unitary group $\mathrm{U}(L)$, we demonstrate that a convenient orthonormal basis, on which matrix elements of the Hamiltonian are very simple, is given by the set of {\it semistandard Young tableaux} (or, equivalently the Gelfand-Tsetlin patterns) corresponding to the targeted irrep. As an application of this color factorization, we study the robustness of some $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ phases predicted in the Heisenberg limit upon decreasing the on-site interaction $U$ on various lattices of size $L \leq 12$ and for $2 \leq N \leq 6$. In particular, we show that a long-range color ordered phase emerges for intermediate $U$ for $N=4$ at filling $1/4$ on the triangular lattice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14793v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the unitary Fermi gas in a harmonic trapping potential starting from a microscopic theory in the limit of large charge and large number of fermion flavors N. In this regime, we present an algorithmic procedure for extracting data from perturbation theory, order-by-order, without the need for other assumptions. We perform a gradient expansion in the interior of the particle cloud, sufficiently far from the cloud edge where the particle density drops rapidly to zero. In this latter region we present the first microscopic computation characterizing the contribution of the edge terms. The microscopic theory reproduces the predictions of the superfluid EFT, including the action, the form of the gap equation, and the energy of the system in a harmonic trap (which maps, via the non-relativistic state-operator correspondence, to the scaling dimension of the lowest operator of charge Q). We additionally give the Wilsonian coefficients at leading order in N up to NNLO in the large-charge expansion.</description>

      <title>Quantum dynamics of the effective field theory of the Calogero-Sutherland model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10011v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the known effective field theory of the Calogero-Sutherland model in the thermodynamic limit of large number of particles, obtained from the standard procedure in conformal field theory: the Hilbert space is constructed a priori in terms of irreducible representations of the symmetry algebra, and not by diagonalization of the hamiltonian, which is given in terms of fields that carry representations of the W-infinity algebra (representing the incompressibility of the Fermi sea). Nevertheless, the role of the effective hamiltonian of the theory is to establish a specific dynamics, which deserves further consideration. We show that the time evolution of the (chiral or antichiral) density field is given by the quantum Benjamin-Ono equation, in agreement with previous results obtained from the alternative description of the continuous limit of the model, based on quantum hydrodynamics. In this study, all calculations are performed at the quantum operator level, without making any assumption on the semiclassical limit of the fields and their equations of motion. This result may be considered as a reliable indication of the equivalence between the quantum field theoretic and quantum hydrodynamical formulations of the effective theories of the model. A one-dimensional quantum compressible fluid that includes both chiralities is the physical picture that emerges for the continuous limit of the Calogero-Sutherland model.</description>
