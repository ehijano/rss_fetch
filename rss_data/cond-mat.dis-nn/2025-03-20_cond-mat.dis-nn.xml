      <title>Josephson effect in strongly disordered metallic wires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study localization effects in Josephson junctions with two superconductors connected by a strongly disordered metallic wire of length $L$. The conventional description of the Josephson effect in such systems, based on the quasiclassical Usadel equation, neglects electron interference and is only applicable when $L$ is shorter than the localization length $\xi$ in the wire. We develop a more general theory for the Josephson effect using the non-linear sigma model that fully accounts for electron interference, and hence localization. We show that for $L \gg \xi$, three qualitatively different regimes of the Josephson current arise depending on the ratio of the superconducting order parameter $\Delta$ and the mean level spacing in the localization volume $\Delta_\xi$. We derive the average supercurrent as a function of the phase difference for all three regimes. Quite unexpectedly, we observe that the Ambegaokar-Baratoff relation between the average critical current and the normal-state conductance still holds in the strongly localized state when $\Delta_\xi \gg \Delta$ and $\xi \ll L \ll (\xi/\pi^2) \ln^2(\Delta_\xi/\Delta)$.</description>

      <title>Large positive magnetoconductance in carbon nanoscrolls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03518v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically demonstrate that carbon nanoscrolls -- spirally wrapped graphene layers with open endpoints -- can be characterized by a large positive magnetoconductance. We show that when a carbon nanoscroll is subject to an axial magnetic field of several Tesla, the ballistic conductance at low carrier densities of the nanoscroll has an increase of about 200%. Importantly, we find that this positive magnetoconductance is not only preserved in an imperfect nanoscroll (with disorder or mild inter-turn misalignment) but can even be enhanced in the presence of on-site disorder. We prove that the positive magnetoconductance comes about the emergence of magnetic field-induced zero energy modes, specific of rolled-up geometries. Our results establish curved graphene systems as a new material platform displaying sizable magnetoresistive phenomena.</description>

      <title>A Monte Carlo Tree Search approach to QAOA: finding a needle in the haystack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12648v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The search for quantum algorithms to tackle classical combinatorial optimization problems has long been one of the most attractive yet challenging research topics in quantum computing. In this context, variational quantum algorithms (VQA) are a promising family of hybrid quantum-classical methods tailored to cope with the limited capability of near-term quantum hardware. However, their effectiveness is hampered by the complexity of the classical parameter optimization which is prone to getting stuck either in local minima or in flat regions of the cost-function landscape. The clever design of efficient optimization methods is therefore of fundamental importance for fully leveraging the potential of VQAs. In this work, we approach QAOA parameter optimization as a sequential decision-making problem and tackle it with an adaptation of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), a common artificial intelligence technique designed for efficiently exploring complex decision graphs. We show that leveraging regular parameter patterns deeply affects the decision-tree structure and allows for a flexible and noise-resilient optimization strategy suitable for near-term quantum devices. Our results shed further light on the interplay between artificial intelligence and quantum information and provide a valuable addition to the toolkit of variational quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Synaptic Field Theory for Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08827v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Theoretical understanding of deep learning remains elusive despite its empirical success. In this study, we propose a novel "synaptic field theory" that describes the training dynamics of synaptic weights and biases in the continuum limit. Unlike previous approaches, our framework treats synaptic weights and biases as fields and interprets their indices as spatial coordinates, with the training data acting as external sources. This perspective offers new insights into the fundamental mechanisms of deep learning and suggests a pathway for leveraging well-established field-theoretic techniques to study neural network training.</description>
