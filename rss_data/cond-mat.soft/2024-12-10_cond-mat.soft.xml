      <title>Tunable entanglement and strength in "granular metamaterials" based on staple-like particles: Experiments and discrete element models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entangled matter displays unusual and attractive properties and mechanisms: tensile strength, capabilities for assembly and disassembly, damage tolerance. While some of the attributes and mechanisms share some traits with traditional granular materials, fewer studies have focused on entanglement and strength and there are large gaps in our understanding of the mechanics of these materials. In this report we focus on the tensile properties and mechanics of bundles made of staple-like particles, and particularly on the effect of adjusting the angle between the legs and the crown in individual staples. Our experiments, combined with discrete element models, show competing mechanisms between entanglement strength and geometric engagement between particles, giving rise to an optimum crown-leg angle that maximizes strength. We also show that tensile forces are transmitted by a small fraction of the staples, which is organized in only 1-3 force chains. The formation and breakage of these chains is highly dynamic: as force chains break, they are replaced by fresh ones which were previously mechanically invisible. Entangled matter as "granular metamaterials" offer interesting perspectives in terms of materials design, and a vast design space for individual particles. Since their properties can be tuned with the shape of the staple, we interpret these entangled materials are "granular metamaterials" with unusual combination of properties: simultaneous strength and toughness, controlled assembly and disassembly, re-conformability, recyclability.</description>

      <title>Facile "Pick-up" experiments and Monte Carlo simulations for the entanglement of tunable staple-like particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entangled matter provides intriguing perspectives in terms of deformation mechanisms, mechanical properties, assembly and disassembly. However, collective entanglement mechanisms are complex, occur over multiple length scales, and they are not fully understood to this day. In this report, we propose a simple pick-up test to measure the entanglement in staple-like particles with various leg lengths, crown-leg angles, and backbone thickness. We also present a new "throw-bounce-tangle" model based on a 3D geometrical entanglement criterion between two staples, and a Monte Carlo approach to predict the probabilities of entanglement in a bundle of staples. This relatively simple model is computationally efficient and it predicts an average density of entanglement which is consistent with the entanglement strength measured experimentally. Entanglement is very sensitive to the thickness of the backbone of the staples, even in regimes where that thickness is a small fraction (&lt;0.04) of the other dimensions. We demonstrate an interesting use for this model to optimize staple-like particles for maximum entanglement. New designs of tunable "entangled granular metamaterials" can produce attractive combinations of strength, extensibility, and toughness that may soon outperform lightweight engineering materials such as solid foams and lattices.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the hallmark freezing and melting points in colloidal dispersions and the search for the elusive coexistence region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Colloidal dispersions undergo phase transitions upon changes in volume fraction and interparticle forces, but exploration of when and how such phase transitions occur raises paradoxes. Phase behavior of purely repulsive hard-sphere (PRHS) colloids is frequently modeled following atomic theory. But such theory predicts phase transitions with no internal energy, in conflict with fundamental phase transition theory. A second paradox is that no PRHS simulations have explicitly produced spontaneous phase coexistence. We speculated that Frenkel's assertion could clear things up: that long-range and short-range entropy are the competing forces during free-energy minimization that cause phase separation - which would require a very large model system. Our large-scale Brownian dynamics model of solvent-suspended PRHS colloids produced liquid states, crystalline states, and a spontaneously formed coexistence phase with macroscopic crystalline and liquid-structure domains. We found freezing and melting points at $\phi_F\approx0.502$ and $\phi_M\approx0.550$, respectively. Osmotic pressure plots give liquid and crystal lines that qualitatively match atomic models, with quantitative differences corresponding to $kT/2$, the thermal energy driving Brownian motion subsequently dissipated viscously back into the fluid, lowering osmotic pressure in the colloidal-liquid phase and setting the phase boundaries. Coexisting crystal structure drives osmotic pressure up, due to surface tension required to maintain crystal/liquid interfaces, reflecting an increase in the chemical potential's cost to insert a diffusing particle into a crystalline interface. Brownian motion seeks to randomize the interfaces, requiring increased osmotic pressure to maintain them. These effects on osmotic pressure lessen as crystal fraction grows, owing to the decreasing importance of Brownian motion.</description>

      <title>The role of substrate mechanics in osmotic biofilm spreading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bacteria invade surfaces by forming dense colonies encased in a polymer matrix. Successful settlement of founder bacteria, early microcolony development and later macroscopic spreading of these biofilms on surfaces rely on complex physical mechanisms. Recent data show that on soft hydrogels, substrate rigidity is an important determinant for biofilm initiation and spreading, through mostly unknown mechanisms. Using a thermodynamically consistent thin-film approach for suspensions on soft elastic surfaces supplemented with biomass production we investigate in silico the role of substrate softness in the osmotic spreading of biofilms. We show that on soft substrates with an imposed osmotic pressure spreading is considerably slowed down and may be completely halted depending on the biomass production rate. We find, that the critical slowing down of biofilm spreading on soft surfaces is caused by a reduced osmotic influx of solvent into the biofilm at the edges, which results from the thermodynamic coupling between substrate deformation and interfacial forces. By linking substrate osmotic pressure and mechanical softness through scaling laws, our simple model semi-quantitatively captures a range of experimentally observed biofilm spreading dynamics on hydrogels with different architectures, underscoring the importance of inherent substrate properties in the spreading process.</description>

      <title>Elasto-frictional reduced model of a cyclically sheared container filled with particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article explores the hysteretic behavior and the damping features of sheared granular media using discrete element method (DEM) simulations. We consider polydisperse non-cohesive frictional spherical particles, enclosed in a container with rigid but moving walls, submitted to a cyclic simple shear superimposed to a confining pressure. The mechanical response of the grains is analyzed in the permanent regime, by fitting the macroscopic stress-strain relation applied to the box with a Dahl-like elasto-frictional model. The influence of several parameters such as the amplitude of the strain, the confining pressure, the elasticity, the friction coefficient, the size and the number of particles are explored. We find that the fitted parameters of our macroscopic Ansatz qualitatively rely on both a well-established effective medium theory of confined granular media and a well-documented rheology of granular flow. Quantitatively, we demonstrate that the single degree-of-freedom elasto-frictional reduced model reliably describes the nonlinear response of the granular layer over a wide range of operating conditions. In particular, we show that the mechanical response of a granular slab under simple shear depends on an unique dimensionless parameter, akin to an effective Coulomb threshold, at low shear/high pressure. Further, exploring higher shear/lower pressure, we evidence an optimal damping at the crossover between a loose unjammed regime and a dense elastic regime.</description>

      <title>The effects of network architecture on the photomechanical performance of azo-acrylate liquid crystal elastomers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Azo-containing liquid crystal elatomers are photomechanical materials which can be actuated by illumination. The photomechanical response is a result of the photoisomerization of the azo moiety, which produces bulk stresses in the material. These stresses arise via two distinct and competing mechanisms: order parameter change induced stress and direct contractile stress. We describe thermomechanical and photomechanical experiments aimed at assessing the relative contributions of these. we discuss our results and summarize our findings.</description>

      <title>Extending Granular Resistive Force Theory to Cohesive Powder-scale Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intrusions into granular media are common in natural and engineered settings (e.g. during animal locomotion and planetary landings). While intrusion of complex shapes in dry non-cohesive granular materials is well studied, less is known about intrusion in cohesive powders. Granular resistive force theory (RFT) -- a reduced-order frictional fluid model -- quantitatively predicts intrusion forces in dry, non-cohesive granular media by assuming a linear superposition of angularly dependent elemental stresses acting on arbitrarily shaped intruders. Here we extend RFT's applicability to cohesive dry powders, enabling quantitative modeling of forces on complex shapes during intrusion. To do so, we first conduct intrusion experiments into dry cornstarch powder to create stress functions. These stresses are similar to non-cohesive media; however, we observe relatively higher resistance to horizontal intrusions in cohesive powder compared to non-cohesive media. We use the model to identify geometries that enhance resistance to intrusion in such materials, aiming to minimize sinkage. Our calculations, supported by experimental verification, suggest that a flat surface generates the largest stress across various intrusion angles while a curved surface exhibits the largest resistance for vertical intrusion. Our model can thus facilitate optimizing design and movement strategies for robotic platforms (e.g. extraterrestrial landers) operating in such environments.</description>

      <title>Theory of Microphase Separation in Elastomers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by recent experiments, we present a phase-field model of microphase separation in an elastomer swollen with a solvent. The imbalance between the molecular scale of demixing and the mesoscopic scale beyond which elasticity operates produces effective long-range interactions, forming stable finite-sized domains. Our predictions concerning the dependence of the domain size and transition temperature on the stiffness of the elastomer are in good agreement with the experiments. Analytical phase diagrams, aided by numerical findings, capture the richness of the microphase morphologies, paving the way to create stable, patterned elastomers for various applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deployable structures, essential across various engineering applications ranging from umbrellas to satellites, are evolving to include soft, morphable designs where geometry drives transformation. However, a major challenge for soft materials lies in achieving reliable actuation and stable shape retention in their deployed state. Drawing inspiration from biological growth processes, we demonstrate that irreversible plastic deformations can be leveraged to create cellular metamaterials with permanent morphing capabilities. By employing a simple actuation method, stretching and releasing the structure's ends, our approach facilitates the design of structures capable of sequential, multi-target configurations and mechanical multistability. Our methodology augments additive manufacturing to transform flat, printable designs into intricate 3D forms, with broad applications in consumer goods, healthcare, and architecture.</description>

      <title>Beating of eukaryotic flagella via Hopf bifurcation of a system of stalled molecular motors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The modeling of the beating of cilia and flagella in fluids is a particularly active field of study, given the biological relevance of these organelles. Various mathematical models have been proposed to represent the nonlinear dynamics of flagella, whose motion is powered by the work of molecular motors attached to filaments composing the axoneme. Here, we formulate and solve a nonlinear model of activation based on the sliding feedback mechanism, capturing the chemical and configurational changes of molecular motors driving axonemal motion. This multiscale model bridges microscopic motor dynamics with macroscopic flagellar motion, providing insight into the emergence of oscillatory beating. We validate the framework through linear stability analysis and fully nonlinear numerical simulations, showing the onset of spontaneous oscillations. To make the analysis more comprehensive, we compare our approach with two established sliding feedback models.</description>

      <title>Cell aspect ratio important for bacterial rheotaxis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When placed in flows with local shear, flagellated bacteria commonly display reorientations towards the local vorticity direction, a chirality-induced rheotactic behavior of great importance for many biological functions. As the observed reorientational dynamics arises from the interplay between the Jeffery dynamics controlled by the cell aspect ratio and the chirality-induced reorientation controlled by the chiral strength, in this work we quantitatively study how cell aspect ratio can become a key factor in tuning the reorientational dynamics, through numerical and theoretical analysis. Our results reveal that, for sphere-like bacteria the rheotactic behavior sensitively depends on the cell aspect ratio and totally disappears in the limiting case with cell aspect ratio being 1, in very good agreement with our predicted analytic functional form. For needle-like bacteria with cell aspect ratio much larger than 1, the rheotactic behavior becomes insensitive to cell aspect ratio, in agreement with previous experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Molecular adsorption induces normal stresses at frictional interfaces of hydrogels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Friction experiments were conducted on hydrogel thin films sliding against a rigid sphere in a low velocity regime where molecular adsorption at the sliding interface sets the friction force, through a dissipative adsorption-stretching-desorption mechanism initially postulated by Schallamach. By carefully imaging the contact from the initial indentation step of the sphere into the hydrogel to steady state sliding, we evidence for the first time that this very same adsorption mechanism also results in a normal force pulling the sphere further into the hydrogel. Observations of this tangential-normal coupling is made on a variety of chemically modified silica spheres, over 3 decades in velocity and at varied normal load, thereby demonstrating its robustness. Quantitative measurements of the extra normal force and of the friction-velocity relationship versus normal load are well rationalized within a theoretical model based on the thermal actuation of molecular bonds. To do so, we account for the finite non-zero thickness of the sliding interface at which molecular adsorption and stretching events produce an out-of-plane force responsible for both friction and normal pull-in.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy of acoustic properties of magnetized magnetic fluids with ellipsoidal aggregates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A model of sound propagation in a magnetized magnetic fluid containing ellipsoidal aggregates is proposed. The model quantitatively describes the geometry of the aggregates formed from nanoparticles. Expressions for the attenuation coefficient and the sound velocity have been derived, taking into account dipole-dipole interaction between the aggregates. The model demonstrates good agreement with the experimental data. In limiting cases, the derived expressions reduce to classical ones, and the fitting parameters are merely geometric characteristics of the aggregates. The developed model enables the determination of aggregate sizes and the distances between them from an experiment that can be conducted without direct contact. The results obtained can also be used to analyze the field dependencies of acoustic properties and to model the kinetics of aggregate growth in a magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Instabilities govern the low-frequency vibrational spectrum of amorphous solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amorphous solids exhibit an excess of low-frequency vibrational modes beyond the Debye prediction, contributing to their anomalous mechanical and thermal properties. Although a $\omega^4$ power-law scaling is often proposed for the distribution of these modes, the precise exponent remains a subject of debate. In this study, we demonstrate that boundary-condition-induced instabilities play a key role in this variability. We identify two distinct types of elastic branches that differ in the nature of their energy landscape: Fictitious branches, where shear minima cannot be reached through elastic deformation alone and require plastic instabilities, and True branches, where elastic deformation can access these minima. Configurations on Fictitious branches show a vibrational density of states (VDoS) scaling as $D(\omega) \sim \omega^3$, while those on True elastic branches under simple and pure shear deformations exhibit a scaling of $D(\omega) \sim \omega^{5.5}$. Ensemble averaging over both types of branches results in a VDoS scaling of $D(\omega) \sim \omega^4$. Additionally, solids relaxed to their shear minima, with no residual shear stress, display a steeper scaling of $D(\omega) \sim \omega^{6.5}$ in both two and three dimensions. We propose two limiting behaviors for amorphous solids: if the system size is increased without addressing instabilities, the low-frequency VDoS scales with an exponent close to $3$. Conversely, by removing residual shear stress before considering large system sizes, the VDoS scales as $D(\omega) \sim \omega^{6.5}$.</description>

      <title>Effect of simple shear on knotted polymer coils and globules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the effect of Couette flow on knotted linear polymer chains with extensive Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. Hydrodynamic interactions are accounted for by means of Multi-Particle Collision Dynamics (MPCD). The polymer chain, containing originally a simple trefoil knot at rest, is described by a coarse-grained bead-spring model in a coil or globular state. We demonstrate that under shear existing loosely localized knots in polymer coils typically tighten to several segments beyond a certain shear rate threshold. At large shear rates the polymer undergoes a tumbling-like motion during which knot sizes can fluctuate. In contrast, sheared knotted globules unwind into a convoluted pearl-necklace structure of sub-globules that folds back onto itself and in which knot types change over time.</description>

      <title>Lower and upper bounds for configurations of points on a sphere</title>

Abstract: We present a new proof (based on spectral decomposition) of a bound originally proved by Sidelnikov~\, for the frame potentials $\sum_{ij} \left( {\bf P}_i \cdot {\bf P}_j \right)^\ell $ on a unit--sphere in $d$ dimensions. Sidelnikov's bound is a special case of the lower bound for the weighted sums $\sum_{ij} f_i f_j \left( {\bf P}_i \cdot {\bf P}_j \right)^\ell$, where $f_i&gt;0$ are scalar quantities associated to each point on the sphere, which we also prove using spectral decomposition. Moreover, in three dimensions, again using spectral decomposition, we find a sharp upper bound for $\sum_{ijk}^N \left[ \left( {\bf P}_i \times {\bf P}_j\right) \cdot {\bf P}_k \right]^2$.
  We explore two applications of these bounds: first, we examine configurations of points corresponding to the local minima of the Thomson problem for $N=972$; second, we analyze various distributions of points within a three-dimensional volume, where a suitable weighted sum is defined to satisfy a specific bound.</description>

      <title>Active nematic liquid crystals under a quenched random field</title>

Abstract: Coupling between flow and orientation is a central issue in understanding the collective dynamics of active biofilaments and cells. Active stressess generated by motor activity destroy (quasi-)long-range orientational order and induce chaotic vortex flows. In cellular and subcellular environment, alignment is also hindered by heterogeneous filamentous structures in extracellular matrix and various organelles in a cell. Here we address the effects of a quenched random field on the flow patterns and orientational order in two-dimensional active nematic liquid crystals. We found that the director dynamics is frozen above a critical disorder strength. For sufficiently strong randomness, the orientational correlation function decays exponentially with the distance, reproducing the behavior of passive random-field nematics. In contrast, the flow velocity decreases only gradually as the randomness is increased, and develops a logarithmic spatial correlation for strong disorder. The threshold between the activity- and disorder-dominated regimes is specified and its dependence on the activity parameter is discussed.</description>

      <title>Similarity Equivariant Graph Neural Networks for Homogenization of Metamaterials</title>

Abstract: Soft, porous mechanical metamaterials exhibit pattern transformations that may have important applications in soft robotics, sound reduction and biomedicine. To design these innovative materials, it is important to be able to simulate them accurately and quickly, in order to tune their mechanical properties. Since conventional simulations using the finite element method entail a high computational cost, in this article we aim to develop a machine learning-based approach that scales favorably to serve as a surrogate model. To ensure that the model is also able to handle various microstructures, including those not encountered during training, we include the microstructure as part of the network input. Therefore, we introduce a graph neural network that predicts global quantities (energy, stress stiffness) as well as the pattern transformations that occur (the kinematics). To make our model as accurate and data-efficient as possible, various symmetries are incorporated into the model. The starting point is an E(n)-equivariant graph neural network (which respects translation, rotation and reflection) that has periodic boundary conditions (i.e., it is in-/equivariant with respect to the choice of RVE), is scale in-/equivariant, can simulate large deformations, and can predict scalars, vectors as well as second and fourth order tensors (specifically energy, stress and stiffness). The incorporation of scale equivariance makes the model equivariant with respect to the similarities group, of which the Euclidean group E(n) is a subgroup. We show that this network is more accurate and data-efficient than graph neural networks with fewer symmetries. To create an efficient graph representation of the finite element discretization, we use only the internal geometrical hole boundaries from the finite element mesh to achieve a better speed-up and scaling with the mesh size.</description>

      <title>Activity-driven polymer knotting for macromolecular topology engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Macromolecules can gain special properties by adopting knotted conformations, but engineering knotted macromolecules is a challenging task. Here we surprisingly observed that knotting can be very effectively produced in active polymers. When one end of an actively reptative polymer is anchored, it can undergo continual self-knotting as a result of intermittent giant conformation fluctuations and the outward reptative motion. Once a knot is formed, it migrates to the anchored point due to a non-equilibrium ratchet effect. Moreover, when the active polymer is grafted on the end of a passive polymer, it can function as a self-propelling soft needle to either transfer its own knots to the passive polymer or directly braid knots on the passive polymer. We further show that these active needles can create inter-molecular bridging knots between two passive polymers. Our finding highlights the non-equilibrium effects in modifying the dynamic pathways of polymer systems, which have potential applications in macromolecular topology engineering, e.g., manipulating topological states of proteins and nucleic acids, as well as macromolecular braiding.</description>

      <title>Effects of Photopatterning Conditions on Azimuthal Surface Anchoring Strength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13835v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spatially varying alignment of liquid crystals is essential for research and applications. One widely used method is based on the photopatterning of thin layers of azo-dye molecules, such as Brilliant Yellow (BY), that serve as an aligning substrate for a liquid crystal. In this study, we examine how photopatterning conditions, such as BY layer thickness (b), light intensity (I), irradiation dose, and age affect the alignment quality and the strength of the azimuthal surface anchoring. The azimuthal surface anchoring coefficient, W, is determined by analyzing the splitting of integer disclinations into half-integer disclinations at pre patterned substrates. The strongest anchoring is achieved for b in the range of 5-8 nm. W increases with the dose, and within the same dose, W increases with I. Aging of a non-irradiated BY coating above 15 days reduces W. Our study also demonstrates that sealed photopatterned cells filled with a conventional nematic preserve their alignment quality for up to four weeks, after which time W decreases. This work suggests the optimization pathways for photoalignment of nematic liquid crystals.</description>

      <title>Ornstein-Uhlenbeck information swimmers with external and internal feedback controls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using an underdamped active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particle, we propose two information swimmer models having either external or internal feedback control and perform their numerical simulations. Depending on the velocity that is measured after every fixed time interval (measurement time), the friction coefficient is modified in the externally controlled model, whereas the persistence time for the activity is changed in the internally controlled one. In the steady state, both of these information swimmers acquire finite average velocities in the noisy environment, and the efficiency can be maximized by tuning the measurement time. The internally controlled swimmer is more relevant to biological systems and can generally achieve larger average velocity and efficiency than the externally controlled model.</description>

      <title>Stokes flow of incompressible liquid through a conical diffuser with partial slip boundary condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15853v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An alternative form of the general solution of the linearized stationary Navier-Stokes equations for an incompressible fluid in spherical coordinates is obtained by the vector potential method. A previously published solution to this problem, dating back to the paper by Sampson, is given in terms of a stream function, which leads to formulas that are difficult to apply in practice. The presented form of solution is applied to the problem of liquid flowing through a conical diffuser under a partial slip boundary condition for a certain slip length lambda. Recurrent relations are obtained that allow us to determine the velocity, pressure and stream function. The solution is analyzed in the first order of decomposition with respect to a small dimensionless parameter (lambda divided by r). It is shown that the sliding of the liquid over the surface of the cone leads to a vorticity of the flow. At zero slip length, we obtain the well-known solution to the problem of a diffuser with no-slip boundary condition corresponding to strictly radial streamlines.</description>
