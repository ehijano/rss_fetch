      <title>Stochastic control for Backward Stochastic Differential Equations with semi-Markov chain noises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the results of Elliott and Yang \cite{elliott3} and discuss the control of a stochastic process for which the driving noise is provided by a martingale associated with a semi-Markov Chain. An existence and a comparison theorem are obtained. In our discrete time setting, adjoint processes are provided by backward stochastic difference equations. Technical results from partial differential equation theory to establish a verification theorem are not required.</description>

      <title>Central Limit Theorem for ergodic averages of Markov chains \&amp; the comparison of sampling algorithms for heavy-tailed distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Establishing central limit theorems (CLTs) for ergodic averages of Markov chains is a fundamental problem in probability and its applications. Since the seminal work~\cite{MR834478}, a vast literature has emerged on the sufficient conditions for such CLTs. To counterbalance this, the present paper provides verifiable necessary conditions for CLTs of ergodic averages of Markov chains on general state spaces. Our theory is based on drift conditions, which also yield lower bounds on the rates of convergence to stationarity in various metrics.
  The validity of the ergodic CLT is of particular importance for sampling algorithms, where it underpins the error analysis of estimators in Bayesian statistics and machine learning. Although heavy-tailed sampling is of central importance in applications, the characterisation of the CLT and the convergence rates are theoretically poorly understood for almost all practically-used Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. In this setting our results provide sharp conditions on the validity of the ergodic CLT and establish convergence rates for large families of MCMC sampling algorithms for heavy-tailed targets. Our study includes a rather complete analyses for random walk Metropolis samplers (with finite- and infinite-variance proposals), Metropolis-adjusted and unadjusted Langevin algorithms and the stereographic projection sampler (as well as the independence sampler). By providing these sharp results via our practical drift conditions, our theory offers significant insights into the problems of algorithm selection and comparison for sampling heavy-tailed distributions (see short YouTube presentations~\cite{YouTube_talk} describing our \href{https://youtu.be/m2y7U4cEqy4}{\underline{theory}} and \href{https://youtu.be/w8I_oOweuko}{\underline{applications}}).</description>

      <title>A note on the planar Skorokhod embedding problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The planar Skorokhod embedding problem was first proposed and solved by R. Gross in 2019 [#gross2019]. Gross worked with probability distributions having finite second moment. In [#boudabra2019remarks, #Boudabra2020], the solutions extended to all distributions with a finite $p^{th}$ moment for $p&gt;1$. The case $p=1$ remained uncovered since then. In this note we show that the planar Skorokhod embedding problem is solvable for $p=1$ when the Hilbert transform of its quantile function is integrable, effectively closing this line of investigation.</description>

Abstract: Existence and uniqueness of mild solutions to a class of semilinear stochastic evolution equations with additive noise is proved. The linear part of the drift term is the generator of a compact semigroup of contractions, while the nonlinear part is only assumed to be the superposition operator associated to a decreasing function.</description>

      <title>Indistinguishability for recurrent clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a general framework to show the indistinguishability of infinite clusters (ergodicity of the cluster subrelation) in group-invariant percolation processes with a weaker version of the finite energy property: the possibility of moving infinite branches from one infinite cluster to another. Crucially, this removes the necessity for the infinite clusters to be transient, present in most previous works. Our method also applies to more general random graphs, whenever a stationary sequence of vertices is definable.
  We use this to show the indistinguishability of infinite clusters (or permutation cycles) in the interchange process (a.k.a.~random stirring process), the loop $O(n)$ model on amenable Cayley graphs, biased corner percolation on $\mathbb{Z}^2$, and the Poisson Zoo process.
  Finally, we show that infinite clusters in any invariant process on a Cayley graph are indistinguishable for any ``not essentially tail'' property, i.e., properties that depend only on the local structure of the cluster.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove Berry-Esseen theorems, almost sure invariance principle rates and large deviations for products of independent but not identically distributed invertible matrices with some average (logarithmic) projective contraction and uniform boundedness assumptions. We also characterize the divergence of the variance of the logarithm of the norm of the product. Our approach is based on verifying the conditions of \cite{NewBE} after reversing time.</description>

      <title>Derivation of stochastic Burgers on the line with a Dirichlet boundary condition at the origin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the \emph{equilibrium fluctuations} of a Hamiltonian chain of oscillators on \(\mathbb{Z}\) with an exponential potential, perturbed by a conservative, symmetric noise. Under the canonical \emph{diffusive scaling} \(t \mapsto t n^2\) and an interaction strength tuned by \(n^{-1/2}\), the fluctuation field is known to converge to the \emph{energy solution} of the stochastic Burgers equation (SBE) on the torus~\cite{ABGS22}. We introduce a \emph{coupled moving heat bath} of strength \(n^{-\delta}\) acting on the particle system. We prove that for \(\delta \leq 1\) (the \emph{strong-coupling regime}), the equilibrium fluctuation field converges to the \emph{energy solution of the SBE with a Dirichlet boundary condition at zero}. We provide two distinct analytical characterizations of these boundary solutions, corresponding to different spaces of test functions. Conversely, for \(\delta &gt; 1\) (the \emph{weak-coupling regime}), the heat bath becomes irrelevant in the scaling limit: the fluctuations converge to the standard SBE on the full line without any boundary condition, reproducing the full-line result of~\cite{GJ14}. Our analysis thus reveals a sharp \emph{critical scaling} in the coupling strength \(\delta\), which dictates the emergence -- or absence -- of a macroscopic boundary condition from the microscopic perturbation.</description>

      <title>On the subgaussian comparison theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this expository note is to prove that any $1$-subgaussian random vector is dominated in the convex ordering by a universal constant times a standard Gaussian vector. This strengthens Talagrand's celebrated subgaussian comparison theorem. The proof combines a tensorization argument due to J. Liu with ideas that date back to the work of Fernique.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a dimension-free, uniform-in-time reverse transportation inequality for Langevin dynamics with non-convex potentials. This inequality controls the R\'enyi divergence of arbitrary order between the process distributions starting from distinct initial points and serves as the dual version of the Harnack inequality. Notably, we prove that this inequality retains exponential decay in the long-time regime, thereby extending existing results for log-concave sampling to the non-convex setting.</description>

      <title>Convergence of the adapted empirical measure for mixing observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The adapted Wasserstein distance $\mathcal{AW}$ is a modification of the classical Wasserstein metric, that provides robust and dynamically consistent comparisons of laws of stochastic processes, and has proved particularly useful in the analysis of stochastic control problems, model uncertainty, and mathematical finance. In applications, the law of a stochastic process $\mu$ is not directly observed, and has to be inferred from a finite number of samples. As the empirical measure is not $\mathcal{AW}$-consistent, Backhoff, Bartl, Beiglb\"ock and Wiesel introduced the adapted empirical measure $\widehat{\mu}^N$, a suitable modification, and proved its $\mathcal{AW}$-consistency when observations are i.i.d.
  In this paper we study $\mathcal{AW}$-convergence of the adapted empirical measure $\widehat{\mu}^N$ to the population distribution $\mu$, for observations satisfying a generalization of the $\eta$-mixing condition introduced by Kontorovich and Ramanan. We establish moment bounds and sub-exponential concentration inequalities for $\mathcal{AW}(\mu,\widehat{\mu}^N)$, and prove consistency of $\widehat{\mu}^N$. In addition, we extend the Bounded Differences inequality of Kontorovich and Ramanan for $\eta$-mixing observations to uncountable spaces, a result that may be of independent interest. Numerical simulations illustrating our theory are also provided.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Approximations to Schr\"{o}dinger Bridges on Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a collection of explicit diffusion approximations to small temperature Schr\"{o}dinger bridges on manifolds. Our most precise results are when both marginals are the same and the Schr\"{o}dinger bridge is on a manifold with a reference process given by a reversible diffusion. In the special case that the reference process is the manifold Brownian motion, we use the small time heat kernel asymptotics to show that the gradient of the corresponding Schr\"{o}dinger potential converges in $L^2$, as the temperature vanishes, to a manifold analogue of the score function of the marginal. As an application of the previous result we show that the Euclidean Schr\"{o}dinger bridge, computed for the quadratic cost, between two different marginal distributions can be approximated by a transformation of a two point distribution of a stationary Mirror Langevin diffusion.</description>

      <title>The Most General Brownian Motion on the Line and on Two Closed Half-Lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the 1950s, W. Feller characterized the most general Brownian motion on the closed half-line. He showed that any such process is a mixture of reflected, sticky, and killed Brownian motions. By most general Brownian motion, we mean a strong Markov process whose excursions away from zero coincide with those of standard Brownian motion, and which may be sent to the cemetery state upon hitting zero. In this work, we fully characterize the most general Brownian motion on the whole real line and on the union of two closed half-lines. Our results are twofold. First, we show that the most general Brownian motion on the line is the process known in the literature as the Skew Sticky Brownian Motion Killed at Zero (see Borodin and Salminen's book). Second, we prove that the most general Brownian motion on two closed half-lines is a process, which we call the Skew Sticky Killed at Zero Snapping Out Brownian Motion. This process extends the Snapping Out Brownian Motion introduced by A. Lejay in 2016.</description>

      <title>Stochastic quantization of the weighted exponential QFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the stochastic quantization equation associated with the weighted exponential quantum field model (or the H{\o}egh-Krohn model) on the two dimensional torus. Unlike in the case of the usual (unweighted) exponential model, the drift term of the stochastic quantization equation can be both positive and negative, and that makes the equation more difficult to treat. We prove the unique existence of the time-global solution under a certain initial condition by a pathwise PDE argument in the so-called $L^2$-regime. We also see that this solution is properly associated with a Dirichlet form canonically constructed from the weighted exponential quantum field measure.</description>

      <title>The critical percolation window in growing random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the critical window for percolation in the universality class of sparse growing random graphs. In our models, vertices arrive sequentially and connect independently to each earlier vertex $v$ with probability proportional to a nonpositive power of the arrival time of $v$, continuing until the graph has $n$ vertices. This class includes uniformly grown random graphs and inhomogeneous random graphs of preferential-attachment type. Whenever the critical percolation threshold is positive, we show that the critical window has width of order $(\log n)^{-2}$ and a secondary phase transition at its finite upper boundary. Inside this window the largest component has size of order $\sqrt{n}/\log n$, and the susceptibility remains finite and independent of the position in the window. The proofs couple component explorations to branching random walks killed outside an interval of length $\log n$, allowing sharp control of the barely subcritical and critical regimes.</description>

Abstract: This paper is to investigate if the solution of a hybrid stochastic functional differential equation (SFDE) with infinite delay can be approximated by the solution of the corresponding hybrid SFDE with finite delay. A positive result is established for a large class of highly nonlinear hybrid SFDEs with infinite delay. Our new theory makes it possible to numerically approximate the solution of the hybrid SFDE with infinite delay, via the numerical solution of the corresponding hybrid SFDE with finite delay.</description>

      <title>The stability of log-supermodularity under convolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the behavior of log-supermodular functions under convolution. In particular we show that log-concave product densities preserve log-supermodularity, confirming in the special case of the standard Gaussian density, a conjecture of Zartash and Robeva. Additionally, this stability gives a ``conditional'' entropy power inequality for log-supermodular random variables. We also compare the Ahlswede-Daykin four function theorem and a recent four function version of the Prekopa-Leindler inequality due to Cordero-Erausquin and Maurey and giving transport proofs for the two theorems. In the Prekopa-Leindler case, the proof gives a generalization that seems to be new, which interpolates the classical three and the recent four function versions.</description>

      <title>Sharp Decoupling Inequalities for the Variances and Second Moments of Sums of Dependent Random Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Both complete decoupling and tangent decoupling are classical tools aiming to compare two random processes where one has a weaker dependence structure. We give a new proof for the complete decoupling inequality, which provides a lower bound for the sum of dependent square-integrable nonnegative random variables $\sum\limits^n_{i=1} d_i$ \[ \frac{1}{2} \mathbb E \left( \sum\limits^n_{i=1} z_i \right)^2 \leq \mathbb E \left( \sum\limits^n_{i=1} d_i \right)^2, \] where $z_i \stackrel{\mathcal{L}}{=} d_i$ for all $i\leq n$ and $z_i$'s are mutually independent. We will then provide the following sharp tangent decoupling inequalities \[\mathbb Var \left( \sum\limits^n_{i=1} d_i\right) \leq 2 \mathbb Var \left( \sum\limits^n_{i=1} e_i\right),\] and \[\mathbb E \left( \sum\limits^n_{i=1} d_i\right)^2 \leq 2 \mathbb E \left( \sum\limits^n_{i=1} e_i\right)^2 - \left[ \mathbb E \left( \sum\limits^n_{i=1} e_i\right) \right]^2,\] where $\{e_i\}$ is the decoupled sequences of $\{d_i\}$ and $d_i$'s are not forced to be nonnegative. Applications to construct Chebyshev-type inequality and Paley-Zygmund-type inequality, and to bound the second moments of randomly stopped sums will be provided.</description>

      <title>On a finite quasi birth-death process with catastrophes and its diffusion approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a multi-type Ehrenfest process modeled as a finite quasi-birth-death (QBD) process. We assume that the transitions are allowed only to the two adjacent levels of the same phase and are characterized by linear rates. The crucial element lies in the phase switching mechanism at the origin, which is governed by an irreducible stochastic matrix. The process evolution is interrupted by catastrophic events, whose occurrences are controlled by a Poisson process. Each catastrophe resets the system state to zero, initiating a new cycle of evolution until the next resetting event. We conduct a comprehensive analysis, addressing both the transient and long-term behavior of this process. Furthermore, we derive a diffusive approximation, by proving its convergence to a reflected Ornstein-Uhlenbeck jump diffusion process.</description>

      <title>Decoupling for Markov Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a Markov chain $(X_i)_{i\ge0}$ with invariant measure $\mu$ that admits the representation $X_{i+1}=\Phi(X_i,U_i)$, where $(U_i)_{i\ge0}$ are i.i.d. random variables and $\Phi$ is a measurable map. We introduce a tangent-decoupled process $(\widetilde X_i)_{i\ge0}$ obtained by replacing $(U_i)$ with an independent copy. Conditional on the realized backbone $(X_i)$, the sequence $(f(\widetilde X_i))$ is independent. Although $(\widetilde X_i)$ is not Markovian, under the same ergodicity assumptions that ensure a law of large numbers for $(X_i)$, the empirical averages $n^{-1}\sum_{i=1}^n f(\widetilde X_i)$ converge almost surely to $\mu(f)$. In addition, for every $f\in L^2(\mu)$ and every $N\ge1$, $$ \operatorname{Var}\!\Bigl(\sum_{i=1}^N f(X_i)\Bigr) \;\le\; 2\,\operatorname{Var}\!\Bigl(\sum_{i=1}^N f(\widetilde X_i)\Bigr), $$ and therefore $\sigma_f^2 \le 2\,\widetilde\sigma_f^{\,2}$ for the corresponding time-average variance constants. The inequality requires neither reversibility nor mixing assumptions. Its proof identifies the two sequences as tangent in the sense of decoupling theory and applies the sharp $L^2$ tangent decoupling inequality of de la Pe\~na, Yao, and Alemayehu (2025).</description>

      <title>Critical Poisson hyperplane percolation in hyperbolic space has no unbounded cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that tessellations of hyperbolic space by isometry-invariant Poisson processes of $(d-1)$-dimensional hyperplanes do not have an unbounded cell at the critical intensity. This extends a result by Porret-Blanc for the hyperbolic plane (C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris, Ser. I, Vol. 344 (2007)) to dimensions $d\ge3$. We also show that for intensities strictly below the critical intensity, infinitely many unbounded cells exist, while for intensities larger than or equal to the critical intensity, no unbounded cell exists. This completely describes the basic phase transition of this continuum percolation model. Our proof uses a method from discrete percolation theory which we adapt to the continuum and combine with specific computations for Poisson hyperplane processes.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional normal approximations for sums of Langevin Markov chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the well-known Langevin diffusion on $\mathbb{R}^d$ $$\mathrm{d} X_t = -\nabla U(X_t)\,\mathrm{d} t + \sqrt{2}\mathrm{d} B_t, $$ and its Euler-Maruyama discretization given by $$X_{k+1}=X_k-\eta \nabla U(X_k)+\sqrt{2\eta }\xi_{k+1},$$ where $\eta$ is the step size. Under mild conditions, the Langevin diffusion admits $\pi(\mathrm{d} x)\propto \exp(-U(x))\mathrm{d} x$ as its unique stationary distribution.
  In this paper, we mainly study the normal approximation of the normalized partial sum $$ W_n = \eta^{1/2} n^{-1/2} \left( \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} X_i- \int_{\mathbb{R}^d} x\,\pi(\mathrm{d} x) \right).$$ To the best of our knowledge, this work provides the first dimension-explicit convergence rates in high-dimensional settings. Our main tool is a novel upper bound for the 1-Wasserstein distance $W_1(W,\gamma)$ via the exchange pair approach, where $W$ is any random vector of interest and $\gamma$ is a $d$-dimensional standard normal random vector.</description>

      <title>Large deviations for stochastic evolution equations beyond the coercive case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the small-noise large deviation principle (LDP) for stochastic evolution equations in an $L^2$-setting. As the coefficients are allowed to be non-coercive, our framework encompasses a much broader scope than variational settings. To replace coercivity, we require only well-posedness of the stochastic evolution equation and two concrete, verifiable a priori estimates. Furthermore, we accommodate drift nonlinearities satisfying a modified criticality condition, and we allow for vanishing drift perturbations. The latter permits the inclusion of It\^o--Stratonovich correction terms, enabling the treatment of both noise interpretations. In another paper, our results have been applied to the 3D primitive equations with full transport noise. In the current paper, we give an application to a reaction-diffusion system which lacks coercivity, further demonstrating the versatility of the framework. Finally, we show that even in the coercive case, we obtain new LDP results for equations with critical nonlinearities that rely on our modified criticality condition, including the stochastic 2D Allen--Cahn equation in the weak setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a one-dimensional piecewise deterministic Markov process (PDMP) on $[0,1]$ with resetting at $0$ and depending on a small parameter $\varepsilon&gt;0$. In the singular vanishing limit $\varepsilon \to 0$ we prove that the `` resetting '' simple point process associated to the PDMP converges to a point process described by a jump Markov process decorated by ``spikes'' distributed as a time-space Poisson point process with intensity proportional to $dt \otimes x^{-2} dx$. This proves rigorously results appeared previously in \cite{SBDKC25} and also justifies partially a conjecture formulated there.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the small-noise large deviation principle for the three-dimensional primitive equations with transport noise and turbulent pressure. Transport noise is important for geophysical fluid dynamics applications, as it takes into account the effect of small scales on the large scale dynamics. The main mathematical challenge is that we allow for the transport noise to act on the full horizontal velocity, therefore leading to a non-trivial turbulent pressure, which requires an involved analysis to obtain the necessary energy bounds. Both Stratonovich and It\^o noise are treated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider percolation on the discrete torus $\mathbb{Z}_n^d$ at $p_c(\mathbb{Z}^d)$, the critical value for percolation on the corresponding infinite lattice $\mathbb{Z}^d$, and within the scaling window around it. We assume that $d$ is a large enough constant for the nearest neighbor model, or any fixed $d&gt;6$ for spread-out models. We prove that there exist constants $\mathbf{C},\mathbf{C}'$ depending only on the dimension and the spread-out parameter such that for any $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$ if the edge probability is $p_c(\mathbb{Z}^d)+\mathbf{C} \lambda n^{-d/3} + o(n^{-d/3})$, then the joint distribution of the largest clusters normalized by $\mathbf{C}' n^{-2d/3}$ converges as $n\to \infty$ to the ordered lengths of excursions above past minimum of an inhomogeneous Brownian motion started at $0$ with drift $\lambda-t$ at time $t\in[0,\infty)$. This canonical limit was identified by Aldous in the context of critical Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze a generalization of the self-affine carpets of Bedford and McMullen where the defining iterated function system includes coordinate reflections. We show that the Hausdorff dimension is invariant under such reflections. The upper bound follows from the standard covering argument using approximate squares, while the lower bound is established by constructing a dimension-maximizing Bernoulli measure and applying the Ledrappier-Young formula. The key to the proof is the observation that the fiber entropies determining the dimension are invariant under the action of the reflection group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In photorealistic image rendering, Monte Carlo methods form the foundation for the integration of the rendering equation in modern approaches. However, despite their effectiveness, traditional Monte Carlo methods often face challenges in controlling variance, resulting in noisy visual artifacts in regions that are difficult to render. In this work, we propose a new approach to the integration of the rendering equation by introducing a Voronoi tessellation reweighting scheme combined with a Poisson point process sampling strategy to address some of the limitations of standard Monte Carlo methods. From a theoretical point of view, we show that the variance induced by a Poisson-Voronoi tessellation is smaller than that of the Monte Carlo method when the intensity of the underlying process is arbitrarily large and when the function to be integrated satisfies a Holder continuity condition.</description>

      <title>Sampling from multimodal distributions with warm starts: Non-asymptotic bounds for the Reweighted Annealed Leap-Point Sampler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sampling from multimodal distributions is a central challenge in Bayesian inference and machine learning. In light of hardness results for sampling -- classical MCMC methods, even with tempering, can suffer from exponential mixing times -- a natural question is how to leverage additional information, such as a warm start point for each mode, to enable faster mixing across modes. To address this, we introduce Reweighted ALPS (Re-ALPS), a modified version of the Annealed Leap-Point Sampler (ALPS) that dispenses with the Gaussian approximation assumption. We prove the first polynomial-time bound that works in a general setting, under a natural assumption that each component contains significant mass relative to the others when tilted towards the corresponding warm start point. Similarly to ALPS, we define distributions tilted towards a mixture centered at the warm start points, and at the coldest level, use teleportation between warm start points to enable efficient mixing across modes. In contrast to ALPS, our method does not require Hessian information at the modes, but instead estimates component partition functions via Monte Carlo. This additional estimation step is crucial in allowing the algorithm to handle target distributions with more complex geometries besides approximate Gaussian. For the proof, we show convergence results for Markov processes when only part of the stationary distribution is well-mixing and estimation for partition functions for individual components of a mixture. We numerically evaluate our algorithm's mixing performance compared to ALPS on a mixture of heavy-tailed distributions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is the monograph on the theory and applications of copula entropy (CE). This book first introduces the theory of CE, including its background, definition, theorems, properties, and estimation methods. The theoretical applications of CE to structure learning, association discovery, variable selection, causal discovery, system identification, time lag estimation, domain adaptation, multivariate normality test, copula hypothesis test, two-sample test, change point detection, and symmetry test are reviewed. The relationships between the theoretical applications and their connections to correlation and causality are discussed. The framework based on CE for measuring statistical independence and conditional independence is compared to the other similar ones. The advantages of CE based methodologies over the other comparable ones are evaluated with simulations. The mathematical generalizations of CE are reviewed. The real applications of CE to every branch of science and engineering are briefly introduced.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive several criteria for (weak) synchronization by noise without the global swift transitivity property. Our sufficient conditions for (weak) synchronization are necessary and can be applied to scenarios involving degenerate or non-Gaussian noise. These results partially answer the open question posed by Flandoli et al. (Probab Theory Relat Fields 168:511-556, 2017). As an application, we prove that the weak attractor for stochastic Lorenz 63 systems driven by degenerate noise consists of a single random point provided the noise intensity is small, and there is no weak synchronization if the noise intensity is large. This indicates that a bifurcation occurs in relation to the intensity of the noise.</description>

      <title>Sampling elements of a finite group: efficiency of the product replacement algorithm with an accumulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group generated by $k$ elements. The well-known product replacement algorithm provides an effective method for sampling generating sets of $G$. We study a refinement of this algorithm that is designed to output individual elements of $G$. We show that after $O(k^2\log|G|)$ steps, the distribution of the output is close to uniform on $G$, which improves upon the best results known to date. The proof proceeds via spectral gap estimates and uses computer assisted calculations.</description>

      <title>From entropic constraints to reinforced processes: a probabilistic origin of multiscale measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate multiscale Gibbs measures from a variational and probabilistic viewpoint, focusing on the structural asymmetry among conditional entropies that characterizes their construction. We show how this asymmetry emerges both from variational principles with entropic constraints and from stochastic processes with reinforcement. We thus introduce the reinforced multinomial process and prove a large-deviation principle for its empirical histogram. The associated rate function reproduces precisely the entropy imbalance defining multiscale measures, thereby providing a genuine probabilistic mechanism for their emergence. The reinforced multinomial process thus offers a simple and rigorous stochastic foundation for multiscale Gibbs structures.</description>

      <title>Testing for latent structure via the Wilcoxon--Wigner random matrix of normalized rank statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of testing for latent structure in large symmetric data matrices. The goal here is to develop statistically principled methodology that is flexible in its applicability, computationally efficient, and insensitive to extreme data variation, thereby overcoming limitations facing existing approaches. To do so, we introduce and systematically study certain symmetric matrices, called Wilcoxon--Wigner random matrices, whose entries are normalized rank statistics derived from an underlying independent and identically distributed sample of absolutely continuous random variables. These matrices naturally arise as the matricization of one-sample problems in statistics and conceptually lie at the interface of nonparametrics, multivariate analysis, and data reduction. Among our results, we establish that the leading eigenvalue and corresponding eigenvector of Wilcoxon--Wigner random matrices admit asymptotically Gaussian fluctuations with explicit centering and scaling terms. These asymptotic results enable rigorous parameter-free and distribution-free spectral methodology for addressing two hypothesis testing problems, namely community detection and principal submatrix detection. Numerical examples illustrate the performance of the proposed approach. Throughout, our findings are juxtaposed with existing results based on the spectral properties of independent entry symmetric random matrices in signal-plus-noise data settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The entropy power inequality for independent random vectors is a foundational result of information theory, with deep connections to probability and geometric functional analysis. Several extensions of the entropy power inequality have been developed for settings with dependence, including by Takano, Johnson, and Rioul. We extend these works by developing a quantitative version of the entropy power inequality for dependent random vectors. A notable consequence is that an entropy power inequality stated using conditional entropies holds for random vectors whose joint density is log-supermodular.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Operator regular variation of a multivariate distribution can be decomposed into the operator tail dependence of the underlying copula and the regular variation of the univariate marginals. In this paper, we introduce operator tail densities for copulas and show that an operator-regularly-varying density can be characterized through the operator tail density of its copula together with the marginal regular variation. As an example, we demonstrate that although a Liouville copula is not available in closed form, it nevertheless admits an explicit operator tail-dependence function.</description>

      <title>Conditioning Accept-Desirability models in the context of AGM-like belief change</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss conditionalisation for Accept-Desirability models in an abstract decision-making framework, where uncertain rewards live in a general linear space, and events are special projection operators on that linear space. This abstract setting allows us to unify classical and quantum probabilities, and extend them to an imprecise probabilities context. We introduce a new conditioning rule for our Accept-Desirability models, based on the idea that observing an event introduces new indifferences between options. We associate a belief revision operator with our conditioning rule, and investigate which of the AGM axioms for belief revision still hold in our more general framework. We investigate two interesting special cases where all of these axioms are shown to still hold: classical propositional logic and full conditional probabilities.</description>

      <title>Mean-field optimal control with stochastic leaders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider interacting agent systems with a large number of stochastic agents (or particles) influenced by a fixed number of external stochastic lead agents. Such examples arise, for example in models of opinion dynamics, where a small number of leaders (influencers) can steer the behaviour of a large population of followers. In this context, we study a partial mean-field limit where the number of followers tends to infinity, while the number of leaders stays constant. The partial mean-field limit dynamics is then given by a McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equation (SDE) for the followers, coupled to a controlled It\^o-SDE governing the dynamics of the lead agents. For a given cost functional that the lead agents seek to minimise, we show that the unique optimal control of the finite agent system convergences to the optimal control of the limiting system. This establishes that the low-dimensional control of the partial (mean-field) system provides an effective approximation for controlling the high-dimensional finite agent system. In addition, we propose a stochastic gradient descent algorithm that can efficiently approximate the mean-field control. Our theoretical results are illustrated on opinion dynamics model with lead agents, where the control objective is to drive the followers to reach consensus in finite time.</description>

      <title>An alternative approach to well-posedness of McKean-Vlasov equations arising in Consensus-Based Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we study the mean-field description of Consensus-Based Optimization (CBO), a derivative-free particle optimization method. Such a description is provided by a non-local SDE of McKean-Vlasov type, whose fields lack of global Lipschitz continuity. We propose a novel approach to prove the well-posedness of the mean-field CBO equation based on a truncation argument. The latter is performed through the introduction of a cut-off function, defined on the space of probability measures, acting on the fields. This procedure allows us to study the well-posedness problem in the classical framework of Sznitman. Through this argument, we recover the established result on the existence of strong solutions, and we extend the class of solutions for which pathwise uniqueness holds.</description>

      <title>A Mathematical Framework for Misinformation Propagation in Complex Networks: Topology-Dependent Distortion and Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19465v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Misinformation is pervasive in natural, biological, social, and engineered systems, yet its quantitative characterization remains challenging. We develop a general mathematical framework for quantifying information distortion in distributed systems by modeling how local transmission errors accumulate along network geodesics and reshape each agent's perceived global state. Through a drift-fluctuation decomposition of pathwise binomial noise, we derive closed-form expressions for node-level perception distributions and show that directional bias induces only a uniform shift in the mean, preserving the fluctuation structure. Applying the framework to canonical graph ensembles, we uncover strong topological signatures of misinformation: Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs exhibit a double-peaked distortion profile driven by connectivity transitions and geodesic-length fluctuations, scale-free networks suppress misinformation through hub-mediated integration, and optimally rewired small-world networks achieve comparable suppression by balancing clustering with short paths. A direct comparison across regular lattices, Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs, Watts-Strogatz small-world networks, and Barab\'asi-Albert scale-free networks reveals a connectivity-dependent crossover. In the extremely sparse regime, scale-free and Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi networks behave similarly. At intermediate sparsity, Watts-Strogatz small-world networks exhibit the lowest misinformation. In contrast, Barab\'as-Albert scale-free networks maintain low misinformation in sparse and dense regimes, while regular lattices produce the highest distortion across connectivities. We additionally show how sparsity constraints, structural organization, and connection costs delineate regimes of minimal misinformation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study a class of invariant measures generated by a random homogeneous self-similar iterated function system. Unlike the deterministic setting, the random quantization problem requires controlling distortion errors across non-uniform scales. For $r&gt;0$, under a suitable separation condition, we precisely determine the almost sure quantization dimension $\kappa_r$ of this class, by utilizing the ergodic theory of the shift map on the symbolic space. By imposing an additional separation condition, we establish almost sure positivity of the $\kappa_r$-dimensional lower quantization coefficient. Furthermore, without assuming any separation condition, we provide a sufficient condition that guarantees almost sure finiteness of the $\kappa_r$-dimensional upper quantization coefficient. We also include some illustrative examples.</description>

      <title>Escape from heterogeneous diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many physical processes depend on the time it takes a diffusing particle to find a target. Though this classical quantity is now well-understood in various scenarios, little is known if the diffusivity depends on the location of the particle. For such heterogeneous diffusion, an ambiguity arises in interpreting the stochastic process, which reflects the well-known It\^{o} versus Stratonovich controversy. Here we analytically determine the mean escape time and splitting probabilities for an arbitrary heterogeneous diffusion in an arbitrary three-dimensional domain with small targets that can be perfectly or imperfectly absorbing. Our analysis reveals general principles for how search depends on heterogeneous diffusion and its interpretation (e.g. It\^{o}, Stratonovich, or kinetic). An intricate picture emerges in which, for instance, increasing the diffusivity can decrease, not affect, or even increase the escape time. Our results could be used to determine the appropriate interpretation for specific physical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article studies the temporal approximation of hyperbolic semilinear stochastic evolution equations with multiplicative Gaussian noise by Milstein-type schemes. We take the term hyperbolic to mean that the leading operator generates a contractive, not necessarily analytic $C_0$-semigroup. Optimal convergence rates are derived for the pathwise uniform strong error \[
  E_h^\infty := \Big(\mathbb{E}\max_{1\le j \le M}\|U_{t_j}-u_j\|_X^p\Big)^{1/p} \] on a Hilbert space $X$ for $p\in [2,\infty)$. Here, $U$ is the mild solution and $u_j$ its Milstein approximation at time $t_j=jh$ with step size $h&gt;0$ and final time $T=Mh&gt;0$. For sufficiently regular nonlinearity and noise, we establish strong convergence of order one, with the error satisfying $E_h^\infty\lesssim h\sqrt{\log(T/h)}$ for rational Milstein schemes and $E_h^\infty \lesssim h$ for exponential Milstein schemes. This extends previous results from parabolic to hyperbolic SPDEs and from exponential to rational Milstein schemes. Root-mean-square error estimates are strengthened to pathwise uniform estimates. Numerical experiments validate the convergence rates for the stochastic Schr\"odinger equation. Further applications to Maxwell's and transport equations are included.</description>

We also provide a sharp upper-bound for the tail of their heights. We also extend our results to P-trees, ICRT, and trees with random degree sequence. In passing we confirm a conjecture of Aldous, Miermont, and Pitman stating that L\'evy trees are ICRT with random parameters.</description>

      <title>Sharp upper tail behavior of line ensembles via the tangent method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.08922v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a new probabilistic and geometric method to obtain several sharp results pertaining to the upper tail behavior of continuum Gibbs measures on infinite ensembles of random continuous curves, also known as line ensembles, satisfying some natural assumptions. The arguments make crucial use of Brownian resampling invariance properties and correlation inequalities admitted by such Gibbs measures. We obtain sharp one-point upper tail estimates showing that the probability of the value at zero being larger than $\theta$ is $\exp(-\frac{4}{3}\theta^{3/2}(1+o(1)))$. A key intermediate step is developing a precise understanding of the profile when conditioned on the value at zero equaling $\theta$. Our method further allows one to obtain multi-point asymptotics which were out of reach of previous approaches. As an example, we prove sharp explicit two-point upper tail estimates. This framework is then used to establish the corresponding results for the KPZ equation, which are all new. Even for the zero-temperature case of the Airy$_2$ process, our arguments yield new proofs for one-point estimates previously known due to its connections to random matrix theory, as well as new two-point asymptotics. To showcase the reach of the method, we obtain the same results in a purely non-integrable setting under only assumptions of stationarity and extremality in the class of Gibbs measures. Our method bears resemblance to the tangent method introduced by Colomo-Sportiello and mathematically realized by Aggarwal in the context of the six-vertex model.</description>

      <title>Brownian bridge limit of path measures in the upper tail of KPZ models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12009v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For models in the KPZ universality class, such as the zero temperature model of planar last passage-percolation (LPP) and the positive temperature model of directed polymers, its upper tail behavior has been a topic of recent interest, with particular focus on the associated path measures (i.e., geodesics or polymers). For Exponential LPP, diffusive fluctuation had been established in Basu-Ganguly. In the directed landscape, the continuum limit of LPP, the limiting Gaussianity at one point, as well as of related finite-dimensional distributions of the KPZ fixed point, were established, using exact formulas in Liu and Wang-Liu. It was further conjectured in these works that the limit of the corresponding geodesic should be a Brownian bridge. We prove it in both zero and positive temperatures; for the latter, neither the one-point limit nor the scale of fluctuations was previously known. Instead of relying on formulas (which are still missing in the positive temperature literature), our arguments are geometric and probabilistic, using the results on the shape of the weight and free energy profiles under the upper tail from Ganguly-Hegde as a starting point. Another key ingredient involves novel coalescence estimates, developed using the recently discovered shift-invariance Borodin-Gorin-Wheeler in these models. Finally, our proof also yields insight into the structure of the polymer measure under the upper tail conditioning, establishing a quenched localization exponent around a random backbone.</description>

      <title>The critical disordered pinning measure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17642v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a disordered pinning model induced by a random walk whose increments have a finite $(2+\kappa)$-th moment for some $\kappa&gt;0$. It is known that this model is marginally relevant, and moreover, it undergoes a phase transition in an intermediate disorder regime. We show that, in the critical window, the point-to-point partition functions converge to a unique limiting random measure, which we call the critical disordered pinning measure. We also obtain an analogous result for a continuous counterpart to the pinning model, which is closely related to two other models: one is a critical stochastic Volterra equation that gives rise to a rough volatility model, and the other is a critical stochastic heat equation with multiplicative noise that is white in time and delta in space.</description>

      <title>Sharp one-point estimates and Minkowski content for the scaling limit of three-dimensional loop-erased random walk</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the scaling limit of loop-erased random walk (LERW) in three dimensions and prove that the limiting occupation measure is equivalent to its $\beta$-dimensional Minkowski content, where $\beta \in (1, 5/3]$ is its Hausdorff dimension. In doing this we also establish the existence of the two-point function and provide some sharp estimates on one-point function and ball-hitting probabilities for 3D LERW in any scale, which is a considerable improvement of previous results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01225v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work focuses on multivalued stochastic differential equations with jumps. First, by employing the weak convergence approach, we establish the Freidlin-Wentzell uniform large deviation principle and the Dembo-Zeitouni uniform large deviation principle for these equations. Subsequently, based on these results, we derive both upper and lower bounds for the large deviations of invariant measures associated with the equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04792v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents the strong law of large numbers for a function of the local times of a transient random walk on groups, extending the research of Asymont and Korshunov for random walks on the integer lattice $\mathbb{Z}^d$. Under some weaker conditions, we prove that certain function of the local times converges almost surely and in $L^1$ and $L^2$. The proof is mainly based on the subadditive ergodic theorem.</description>

      <title>The Offended Voter Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a variant of the voter model on a coevolving network in which interactions of two individuals with differing opinions only lead to an agreement on one of these opinions with a fixed probability $q$. Otherwise, with probability $1-q$, both individuals become offended in the sense that they never interact again, i.e. the corresponding edge is removed from the underlying network. Eventually, these dynamics reach an absorbing state at which there is only one opinion present in each connected component of the network. If globally both opinions are present at absorption we speak of "segregation'', otherwise of "consensus''. We rigorously show that segregation and a weaker form of consensus both occur with positive probability for every $q \in (0,1)$ and that the segregation probability tends to $1$ as $q \to 0$. Furthermore, we establish that, if $q \to 1$ fast enough, with high probability the population reaches consensus while the underlying network is still densely connected. We provide results from simulations to assess the obtained bounds and to discuss further properties of the limiting state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the $\ell_{\infty}$\textit{ directed spanning forest}(DSF), which is a directed forest with vertex set given by a homogeneous Poisson point process such that each Poisson point connects to the nearest Poisson point (in $\ell_{\infty}$ distance) with a strictly larger $y$-coordinate. In this paper, we prove that the $\ell_{\infty}$ DSF is connected and we find optimal estimates on the tail distribution of coalescing time of two $\ell_{\infty}$ DSF paths. Similar estimates were earlier obtained in \cite{coupier20212d} for the $\ell_2$ (Euclidean) DSF and showed that when properly scaled, it converges in distribution to the Brownian web. The geometry of $\ell_\infty$ balls compel us to develop new argument.</description>

      <title>A Block Reduction Method for Random Band Matrices with General Variance Profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11945v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel block reduction method for the study of a general class of random band matrices (RBM) defined on the $d$-dimensional lattice $\mathbb{Z}_{L}^d:=\{1,2,\ldots,L\}^{d}$ for $d\in \{1,2\}$, with band width $W$ and an almost arbitrary variance profile subject to a core condition. We prove the delocalization of bulk eigenvectors for such RBMs under the assumptions $W\ge L^{1/2+\varepsilon}$ in one dimension and $W\geq L^{\varepsilon}$ in two dimensions, where $\varepsilon$ is an arbitrarily small constant. This result extends the findings of arXiv:2501.01718 and arXiv:2503.07606 on block RBMs to models with general variance profiles. Furthermore, we generalize our results to Wegner orbital models with small interaction strength $\lambda\ll 1$. Under the sharp condition $\lambda\gg W^{-d/2}$, we establish optimal lower bounds for the localization lengths of bulk eigenvectors, thereby extending the results of arXiv:2503.11382 to settings with nearly arbitrary potential and hopping terms. Our block reduction method provides a powerful and flexible framework that reduces both the dynamical analysis of the loop hierarchy and the derivation of deterministic estimates for general RBMs to the corresponding analysis of block RBMs, as developed in arXiv:2501.01718, arXiv:2503.07606 and arXiv:2503.11382.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22379v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the linear stochastic fractional heat equation $$
  \frac{\partial}{\partial t}u(t,x)=-(-\Delta)^{\frac{\alpha}2}u (t,x)+\dot{W}(t,x),\ \ t&gt; 0,\ \ x\in\RR, $$ where $-(-\Delta)^{\frac{\alpha}{2}}$ denotes the fractional Laplacian with power $\alpha\in (1, 2)$, and the driving noise $\dot W$ is a centered Gaussian field which is white in time and has the covariance of a fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter $H\in\left(\frac {2-\alpha}2,\frac 12\right)$. We establish exact asymptotics for the solution as both time and space variables tend to infinity and derive sharp growth rates for the H\"older coefficients. The proofs are based on Talagrand's majorizing measure theorem and Sudakov's minoration theorem.</description>

      <title>Multiscale analysis of the conductivity in the Lorentz mirrors model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24091v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the mirrors model in $d$ dimensions on an infinite slab and with unit density. This is a deterministic dynamics in a random environment. We argue that the crossing probability of the slab goes like $\kappa/(\kappa+N)$ where $N$ is the width of the slab. We are able to compute $\kappa$ perturbatively by using a multiscale approach. The only small parameter involved in the expansion is the inverse of the size of the system. This approach rests on an inductive process and a closure assumption adapted to the mirrors model. For $d=3$, we propose the recursive relation for the conductivity $\kappa_n$ at scale $n$ : $\kappa_{n+1}=\kappa_n(1+\frac{\kappa_n}{2^{n}}\alpha)$, up to $o(1/2^n)$ terms and with $\alpha\simeq 0.0374$. This sequence has a finite limit.</description>

      <title>Estimates of transport distance in the central limit theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X_1,\ldots,X_n$ be $d$-dimensional independent random vectors bounded with probability one. For simplicity, we assume that they have zero mean values: \begin{equation} \mathbf{P}\{\|X_{j}\|\le\tau\}=1,\quad\mathbf{E}\,X_{j}=0,\quad j=1,\ldots, n.\nonumber \end{equation} We study the distribution behavior of the sum $S=X_{1}+\cdots+X_{n}$ as a function of the bounding value $\tau$.
  From the non-uniform Bikelis estimate in the one-dimensional central limit theorem it follows that $$ W_1(F,\Phi_{\sigma})\le c\tau. $$ with an absolute constant $c$, where $W_1$ is the Kantorovich--Rubinstein--Wasserstein transport distance, $F$ is the distribution of the sum $S$, and $\Phi_{\sigma}$ is the corresponding normal distribution. The main result of the paper is significantly stronger and more precise. It is claimed that $$ \rho(F,\Phi_{\sigma}) =\inf\int\exp(|x-y|/c\tau)\,d\pi(x,y)\le c, $$ where the infimum is taken over all bivariate probability distributions $\pi$ with marginal distributions $F$ and $\Phi_{\sigma}$. The result has also been generalized to distributions with sufficiently slowly growing cumulants from the class $\mathcal{A}_{1}(\tau )$, introduced in the author's 1986 paper. The possibility of generalizing the result to the multivariate case is discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the long-time behaviour of solutions to a class of $d$-dimensional stochastic differential equations driven by fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter $H \in (0,1)$. The drift consists of a dissipative Lipschitz term and a singular term of regularity $\gamma &gt;1-1/(2H)$ in Besov-H\"older scales. We establish well-posedness and, through a Markovian enhancement, existence of an invariant measure. If the singular contribution is sufficiently small, we prove exponential contraction of solutions, and thereby, uniqueness of the invariant measure. Our methods rely on uniform pathwise estimates which utilise together the dissipativity of the drift and the regularisation effect of the noise.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Burgers Equation Driven by a Hermite Sheet with Additive Noise: Existence, Uniqueness, and Regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the stochastic Burgers equation driven by a Hermite sheet of order \( q \geq 1 \) with \textbf{additive noise}, establishing the well-posedness of mild solutions via a fixed-point argument in suitable Banach spaces. Under appropriate conditions on the Hurst parameters \( \mathbf{H} = (H_0, H_1, \dots, H_d) \in (1/2, 1)^{d+1} \), we prove existence and uniqueness of solutions through a Picard iteration scheme. The solution exhibits spatial and temporal H\"older regularity, with exponents determined by the Hurst parameters of the driving noise. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the solution inherits the self-similarity property from the Hermite sheet, providing explicit scaling exponents. Uniform moment estimates in space and time are derived, forming the foundation for the regularity analysis. The additive noise formulation allows us to use the standard Wiener integral construction for Hermite processes, thereby avoiding the technical complications of Malliavin calculus required for multiplicative noise. This restriction is mathematically justified as it circumvents the need for Malliavin derivative bounds essential for random integrands with Hermite processes of order \(q \geq 2\), a key difficulty highlighted in recent literature. The work develops the stochastic integration theory with respect to Hermite sheets for deterministic integrands and establishes a complete framework for analyzing nonlinear SPDEs with non-Gaussian noise, contributing to the understanding of stochastic systems with long-range dependence and non-Gaussian fluctuations.</description>

  We characterize the groups for which these generalized probabilities can be stationary, respectively invariant. Our results deviate from the setting of classical probability; this leads to a new criterion for amenability and for fixed points in cones.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09397v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the Variational Principle and develop thermodynamic formalism for correspondences. We define the measure-theoretic entropy for transition probability kernels and topological pressure for correspondences. Based on these two notions, we establish the following results:
  The Variational Principle holds and equilibrium states exist for continuous potential functions, provided that the correspondence satisfies some expansion property called forward expansiveness. If, in addition, the correspondence satisfies the specification property and the potential function is Bowen summable, then the equilibrium state is unique. On the other hand, for a distance-expanding, open, strongly transitive correspondence and a H\"{o}lder continuous potential function, there exists a unique equilibrium state, and the backward orbits are equidistributed. Furthermore, we investigate the Variational Principle for general correspondences.
  In complex dynamics, we establish the Variational Principle for the Lee-Lyubich-Markorov-Mukherjee anti-holomorphic correspondences, which are matings of some anti-ho\-lo\-mor\-phic rational maps with anti-Hecke groups and are not forward expansive. We also show a Ruelle-Perron-Frobenius theorem for a family of hyperbolic holomorphic correspondences of the form $\boldsymbol{f}_c (z)= z^{q/p}+c$.</description>

Abstract: We consider a so-called quantum graph with standard continuity and Kirchhoff vertex conditions where the Kirchhoff vertex condition is perturbed by Gaussian noise. We show that the quantum graph setting is very different from the classical one dimensional boundary noise setting, where the transition semigroup is known to be strong Feller, by giving examples and counterexamples to the strong Feller property. In particular, when the graph is a tree, and there is noise present in all of the boundary vertices except one, then the transition semigroup associated with the problem is strong Feller at any time T &gt; 0. This turns out to be also a necessary condition for equilateral star graphs. We also comment on the existence and uniqueness of the invariant measure and the regularity of the solution.</description>

      <title>Voting Profiles Admitting All Candidates as Knockout Winners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01382v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A set of $2^n$ candidates is presented to a commission. At every round, each member of this commission votes by pairwise comparison, and one-half of the candidates is deleted from the tournament, the remaining ones proceeding to the next round until the $n$-th round (the final one) in which the final winner is declared. The candidates are arranged on a board in a given order, which is maintained among the remaining candidates at all rounds. A study of the size of the commission is carried out in order to obtain the desired result of any candidate being a possible winner. For $2^n$ candidates with $n \geq 3$, we identify a voting profile with $4n -3$ voters such that any candidate could win simply by choosing a proper initial order of the candidates. Moreover, in the setting of a random number of voters, we obtain the same results, with high probability, when the expected number of voters is large.</description>

      <title>Fast convergence rates for estimating the stationary density in SDEs driven by a fractional Brownian motion with semi-contractive drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15904v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the estimation of the invariant density of additive fractional stochastic differential equations with Hurst parameter $H \in (0,1)$. We first focus on continuous observations and develop a kernel-based estimator achieving faster convergence rates than previously available. This result stems from a martingale decomposition combined with new bounds on the (conditional) convergence in total variation to equilibrium of fractional SDEs. For $H&lt;1/2$, we further refine the rates based on recent bounds on the marginal density. We then extend the methodology to discrete observations, showing that the same convergence rates can be attained. Moreover, we establish concentration inequalities for the estimator and introduce a data-driven bandwidth selection procedure that adapts to unknown smoothness. Numerical experiments for the fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process illustrate the estimator's practical performance. Finally, our results weaken the usual convexity assumptions on the drift component, allowing us to consider settings where strong convexity only holds outside a compact set.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04917v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate an optimal control problem motivated by neuroscience, where the dynamics is driven by a Poisson process with a controlled stochastic intensity and an unknown parameter. Given a prior distribution for the unknown parameter, we describe its evolution using Bayes' rule. We reformulate the optimization problem by applying Girsanov's theorem and establish a dynamic programming principle. Finally, we characterize the value function as the unique viscosity solution to a finite-dimensional Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, which can be solved numerically.</description>

      <title>On growth of Sobolev norms for periodic nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger and generalised Korteweg-de Vries equations under critical Gibbs dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08630v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove logarithmic growth bounds on Sobolev norms of the focusing mass-critical NLS and gKdV equations on the torus, which hold almost surely under the focusing Gibbs measure with optimal mass threshold constructed by Oh, Sosoe, and Tolomeo [Invent. Math. 227 (2022), no. 3, 1323--1429]. More precisely, we will establish almost sure growth bounds for solutions $u(t)$ of the equations of the form \[ \sup_{t \in [-T,T]} \lVert u(t) \rVert_{H^s(\mathbb{T})} \lesssim_{s, u_0} \log(2+T)\] with initial data $u_0 \in H^s(\mathbb{T})$ for $s&lt; \frac{1}{2}$. The proof uses a generalisation of Bourgain's invariant measure argument for measures in a suitable Orlicz space.</description>

      <title>Universal approximation on non-geometric rough paths and applications to financial derivatives pricing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16009v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel perspective on the universal approximation theorem for rough path functionals, introducing a polynomial-based approximation class. We extend universal approximation to non-geometric rough paths within the tensor algebra. This development addresses critical needs in finance, where no-arbitrage conditions necessitate It\^o integration. Furthermore, our findings motivate a hypothesis for payoff functionals in financial markets, allowing straightforward analysis of signature payoffs proposed in \cite{arribas2018derivativespricingusingsignature}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00254v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study in detail the class of even polynomials and their behavior with respect to finite free convolutions. To this end, we use some specific hypergeometric polynomials and a variation of the rectangular finite free convolution to understand even real-rooted polynomials in terms of positive-rooted polynomials. Then, we study some classes of even polynomials that are of interest in finite free probability, such as even hypergeometric polynomials, symmetrizations, and finite free commutators. Specifically, we provide many new examples of these objects, involving classical families of special polynomials (such as Laguerre, Hermite, and Jacobi). Finally, we relate the limiting root distributions of sequences of even polynomials with the corresponding symmetric measures that arise in free probability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove normal typicality and dynamical typicality for a (centered) random block-band matrix model with block-dependent variances. A key feature of our model is that we achieve intermediate equilibration times, an aspect that has not been proven rigorously in any model before. Our proof builds on recently established concentration estimates for products of resolvents of Wigner type random matrices [arXiv:2403.10359] and an intricate analysis of the deterministic approximation.</description>

      <title>On Random Fields Associated with Analytic Wavelet Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10495v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the broad application of the analytic wavelet transform (AWT), a systematic statistical characterization of its magnitude and phase as inhomogeneous random fields on the time-frequency domain when the input is a random process remains underexplored. In this work, we study the magnitude and phase of the AWT as random fields on the time-frequency domain when the observed signal is a deterministic function plus additive stationary Gaussian noise. We derive their marginal and joint distributions, establish concentration inequalities that depend on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and analyze their covariance structures. Based on these results, we derive an upper bound on the probability of incorrectly identifying the time-scale ridge of the clean signal, explore the regularity of scalogram contours, and study the relationship between AWT magnitude and phase. Our findings lay the groundwork for developing rigorous AWT-based algorithms in noisy environments.</description>

      <title>Nested superposition principle for random measures and the geometry of the Wasserstein on Wasserstein space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07523v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the geometric structure of the space of random measures $\mathcal{P}_p(\mathcal{P}_p(X))$, endowed with the Wasserstein on Wasserstein metric, where $(X, d)$ is a complete separable metric space. In this setting, we prove a metric superposition principle, in the spirit of the result by S. Lisini, that will allow us to recover important geometric features of the space. When $X$ is $\mathbb{R}^d$, we study the differential structure of $\mathcal{P}_p(\mathcal{P}_p(\mathbb{R}^d))$ in analogy with the simpler Wasserstein space $\mathcal{P}_p(\mathbb{R}^d)$. We show that continuity equations for random measures involving the abstract concept of derivation acting on cylinder functions can be more conveniently described by suitable non-local vector fields $b:[0,T]\times \mathbb{R}^d \times \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R}^d) \to \mathbb{R}^d$. In this way, we can: 1) characterize the absolutely continuous curves on the Wasserstein on Wasserstein space; 2) define and characterize its tangent bundle; 3) prove a superposition principle for the solutions to the standard non-local continuity equation in terms of solutions of interacting particle systems.</description>

      <title>Quadratic Mean-Field BSDEs and Exponential Utility Maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17214v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a class of real-valued mean-field backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) with generator of quadratic growth in the control variable and the mean-field term. Under this assumption, together with a bounded terminal condition, we establish existence and uniqueness of solutions. Our approach departs from classical fixed-point arguments and instead combines Malliavin calculus with refined BMO and stability estimates. The result bridges the gap between the quadratic BSDE results of Cheridito and Nam (2017) and Hao et al. (2025). Moreover, motivated by the structure of the mean-field exponential utility maximization problem introduced in our paper, we extend our framework to generators satisfying a weaker quadratic condition on the generator. This relaxation is designed to accommodate the additional mean-field terms that arise in our utility maximization setting and that fall outside the scope of previous quadratic assumptions. Within this more general regime, we establish existence and uniqueness of solutions under a smallness condition on the terminal random variable. We then apply this extended theory to solve a mean-field exponential utility maximization problem, thereby generalizing the classical framework of Hu et al. (2005)to a fully coupled quadratic mean-field setting.</description>

      <title>Universality of high-dimensional scaling limits of stochastic gradient descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13634v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider statistical tasks in high dimensions whose loss depends on the data only through its projection into a fixed-dimensional subspace spanned by the parameter vectors and certain ground truth vectors. This includes classifying mixture distributions with cross-entropy loss with one and two-layer networks, and learning single and multi-index models with one and two-layer networks. When the data is drawn from an isotropic Gaussian mixture distribution, it is known that the evolution of a finite family of summary statistics under stochastic gradient descent converges to an autonomous ordinary differential equation (ODE), as the dimension and sample size go to $\infty$ and the step size goes to $0$ commensurately. Our main result is that these ODE limits are universal in that this limit is the same whenever the data is drawn from mixtures of arbitrary product distributions whose first two moments match the corresponding Gaussian distribution, provided the initialization and ground truth vectors are coordinate-delocalized. We complement this by proving two corresponding non-universality results. We provide a simple example where the ODE limits are non-universal if the initialization is coordinate aligned. We also show that the stochastic differential equation limits arising as fluctuations of the summary statistics around their ODE's fixed points are not universal.</description>
