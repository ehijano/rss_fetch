      <title>Symmetry breaking of rotating convection due to Non-Oberbeck-Boussinesq effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-Oberbeck-Boussinesq (NOB) effects arising from variations in thermal expansivity are theoretically and numerically studied in the context of rotating Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard convection under 2D configuration. The thermal expansivity increases from top to bottom, and its variation is measured by a dimensionless factor $\epsilon$. Utilizing an asymptotic expansion with weak nonlinearity, we derive an amplitude equation, revealing that NOB effects amplify the magnitude of convection. An order-$\epsilon^2$ NOB correction leads to a symmetry breaking about the horizontal mid-plane, manifested in the strengthening of convection near the bottom and its weakening near the top, forming a bottom-heavy profiles. At order $\epsilon^3$, the conjunction of NOB effects and nonlinear advection leads to a horizontal symmetry breaking. The downward cold plumes become stronger and more concentrated compared to the upward warm plumes. Numerical simulations validate the theoretical analyses in the weak nonlinear regime and confirm robust horizontal asymmetry and stronger downward plumes at very large Rayleigh numbers. This work advances our understanding of hydrothermal plumes in the subglacial oceans on icy moons as well as tracer transport from the seafloor to the ice shell.</description>

      <title>An analysis and solution of ill-conditioning in physics-informed neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have recently emerged as a novel and popular approach for solving forward and inverse problems involving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, achieving stable training and obtaining correct results remain a challenge in many cases, often attributed to the ill-conditioning of PINNs. Nonetheless, further analysis is still lacking, severely limiting the progress and applications of PINNs in complex engineering problems. Drawing inspiration from the ill-conditioning analysis in traditional numerical methods, we establish a connection between the ill-conditioning of PINNs and the ill-conditioning of the Jacobian matrix of the PDE system. Specifically, for any given PDE system, we construct its controlled system. This controlled system allows for adjustment of the condition number of the Jacobian matrix while retaining the same solution as the original system. Our numerical findings suggest that the ill-conditioning observed in PINNs predominantly stems from that of the Jacobian matrix. As the condition number of the Jacobian matrix decreases, the controlled systems exhibit faster convergence rates and higher accuracy. Building upon this understanding and the natural extension of controlled systems, we present a general approach to mitigate the ill-conditioning of PINNs, leading to successful simulations of the three-dimensional flow around the M6 wing at a Reynolds number of 5,000. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that PINNs have been successful in simulating such complex systems, offering a promising new technique for addressing industrial complexity problems. Our findings also offer valuable insights guiding the future development of PINNs.</description>

      <title>The atomizing pulsed jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct Numerical Simulations of the injection of a pulsed round liquid jet in a stagnant gas are performed. The Reynolds and Weber numbers and the density ratio are sufficiently large for reaching a complex high-speed atomization regime. The Weber number based on grid size is small, an indication that the simulations are very well resolved. Computations are performed using octree adaptive mesh refinement using the Basilisk free-code platform, down to a specified minimum grid size $\Delta$. Qualitative analysis of the flow and its topology reveal a complex structure of ligaments, sheets, droplets and bubbles that evolve and interact through impacts, ligament breakup, sheet rupture and engulfment of air bubbles in the liquid. A rich gallery of images of entangled structures is produced. Most processes occurring in this type of atomization are reproduced in detail, except at the instant of thin sheet perforation or breakup. We analyze drop statistics, showing that as the grid resolution is increased, the small-scale part of the distribution does not converge, and contains a large number of droplets close in order of magnitude to the minimum grid size with a significant peak at $d = 3\Delta$ . This non-convergence arises from the {\em numerical sheet breakup} effect, in which the interface becomes rough just before it breaks. The rough appearance of the interface is associated to a high-wavenumber oscillation of the curvature. To recover convergence, we apply the controlled "manifold death" numerical procedure, in which thin sheets are detected, and then pierced by fiat before they reach a set critical thickness $h_c$ that is always larger than $6 \Delta$. This allows convergence of the droplet frequency above a certain critical diameter $d_c$ above and close to $h_c$. A unimodal distribution is observed in the converged range.</description>

      <title>Simulation of stopping vortices in the flow past a mounted wedge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is concerned with the numerical investigation of the dynamics of stopping vortex formation in the uniform flow past a wedge mounted on a wall for channel Reynolds number $Re_c=1560$. The streamfunction-vorticity ($\psi$-$\omega$) formulation of the transient Navier-Stokes (N-S) equations have been utilized for simulating the flow and has been discretized using a fourth order spatially and second order temporally accurate compact finite difference method on a nonuniform Cartesian grid developed by the author. The results are validated by comparing the simulated results of the early evolution of the flow with the experimental visualization of a well-known laboratory experiment of \cite{pullin1980} and a grid-independence study. The development of the stopping vortex and its effect on the starting vortex are discussed in details. The stopping flow is analysed in the light of the time interval through which the inlet velocity of the flow is decelerated. The criterion for the development of a clean vortex is provided in terms of the impulse associated with the deceleration. Our study revealed that the strength of the stopping vortex depends upon the rapidity of deceleration. The vorticity distribution along the diameter of the core of the stopping vortex is seen to follow a Gaussian profile.</description>

      <title>Experimental jet control with Bayesian optimization and persistent data topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study experimentally optimizes the mixing of a turbulent jet at $Re=10000$ with the surrounding air by targeted shear layer actuation. The forcing is composed of superposed harmonic signals of different azimuthal wavenumber $m$ generated by eight loudspeakers circumferentially distributed around the nozzle lip. Amplitudes and frequencies of the individual harmonic contributions serve as optimization parameters and the time-averaged centerline velocity downstream of the potential core is used as a metric for mixing optimization. The actuation is optimized through Bayesian optimization. Three search spaces are explored - axisymmetric forcing, $m=0$, superposed axisymmetric and helical forcing, $m \in \{0,1\}$, and axisymmetric actuation combined with two counter-rotating helical modes, $m \in \{-1,0,1\}$. High-speed PIV is employed to analyze the jet response to the optimized forcing. The optimization processes are analyzed by persistent data topology. In the search space of axisymmetric excitation, the routine identifies an actuation at the natural frequency of the flow to be most efficient, with the centerline velocity being decreased by $15\%$. The optimal solutions in both the two-mode and three-mode search space converge to a similar forcing with one axial and one helical mode combined at a frequency ratio of around $2.3$. Spectral analysis of the PIV images reveals that for the identified optimal forcing frequencies, a non-linear interaction between forced and natural structures in the jet flow is triggered, leading to a reduction in centerline velocity of around $35\%$. The topology of the most complex search space from the discrete data reveals four basins of attractions, classified into three forcing patterns including axisymmetric, axisym.-helical, and axisym.-flapping. Two deep basins are related to the optimal axisym.-helical pattern, and the others are shallower.</description>

      <title>Intermittent thermal convection in jammed emulsions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the process of thermal convection in jammed emulsions with a yield-stress rheology. We find that heat transfer occurs via an intermittent mechanism, whereby intense short-lived convective "heat bursts" are spaced out by long-lasting conductive periods. This behaviour is the result of a sequence of fluidization-rigidity transitions, rooted in a non-trivial interplay between emulsion yield-stress rheology and plastic activity, which we characterize via a statistical analysis of the dynamics at the droplet scale. We also show that droplets' coalescence induced during heat bursts leads to a spatially heterogeneous phase-inversion of the emulsion which eventually supports a sustained convective state.</description>

      <title>On the origin of circular rolls in rotor-stator flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rotor-stator flows are known to exhibit instabilities in the form of circular and spiral rolls. While the spirals are known to emanate from a supercritical Hopf bifurcation, the origin of the circular rolls is still unclear. In the present work we suggest a quantitative scenario for the circular rolls as a response of the system to external forcing. We consider two types of axisymmetric forcing: bulk forcing (based on the resolvent analysis) and boundary forcing using direct numerical simulation. Using the singular value decomposition of the resolvent operator the optimal response is shown to take the form of circular rolls. The linear gain curve shows strong amplification at non-zero frequencies following a pseudo-resonance mechanism. The optimal energy gain is found to grow rapidly with the Reynolds number (based on the rotation rate and interdisc spacing $H$) in connection with huge levels of non-normality. The results for both types of forcing are compared with former experimental works and previous numerical studies. Our findings suggest that the circular rolls observed experimentally are the combined effect of the high forcing gain and the roll-like form of the leading response of the linearised operator. For high enough Reynolds number it is possible to delineate between linear and nonlinear response. For sufficiently strong forcing amplitudes, the nonlinear response is consistent with the self-sustained states found recently for the unforced problem. The onset of such non-trivial dynamics is shown to correspond in state space to a deterministic leaky attractor, as in other subcritical wall-bounded shear flows.</description>

      <title>Spatio-temporal spectral transfers in fluid dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by previous work on kinetic energy cascades in the ocean and atmosphere, we develop a spatio-temporal spectral transfer tool that can be used to study scales of variability in generalized dynamical systems. In particular, we use generalized time-frequency methods from signal analysis to broaden the applicability of frequency transfers from theoretical to practical applications such as the study of ocean or atmosphere data or simulation output. We also show that triad interactions in wavenumber used to study kinetic energy and enstrophy cascades can be generalized to study triad interactions in frequency or wavenumber-frequency. We study the effects of sweeping on the locality of frequency transfers and frequency triad interactions to better understand the locality of spatio-temporal frequency transfers. As an illustrative example, we use the spatio-temporal spectral transfer tool to study the results of a simulation of two-dimensional homogeneous isotropic turbulence. This simulated fluid is forced at a well-defined wavenumber and frequency with dissipation occurring at both large and small scales, making this one of the first studies of "modulated turbulence" in two dimensions. Our results show that the spatio-temporal transfers we develop in this paper are robust to potential practical problems such as low sampling rates or nonstationarity in time series of interest. We anticipate that this method will be a useful tool in studying scales of spatio-temporal variability in a wide range of fluids applications as higher resolution data and simulations become more widely available.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Magnetized Asteroseismic Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We solve for waves in a polytropic, stratified medium with a spatially varying background magnetic field that points along a horizontal $x$-direction, and with gravity that is directed along the vertical $z$-direction. Force balance determines the magnitude of the background magnetic field, $B_0^2 \sim z^{n+1}$, where $n$ is the polytropic index. Using numerical and asymptotic methods, we deduce an accurate and explicit dispersion relation for fast pressure-driven waves: $\Omega^2 \sim K\left(2m+n\right) \left[1 + (1/M_\mathrm{A})^2 (4-2\gamma+\cos^2\theta-3\cos^4\theta)/4 \right]$. Here, $\Omega$ is the frequency, $K$ the wavenumber, $\theta$ the angle the wave-vector makes with the background magnetic field, $M_\mathrm{A}$ the Alfv\'enic Mach number, and $m$ an integer representing the eigen state. Applications of our result are in magnetoseismology and nonlinear asteroseismology.</description>

      <title>Modelling the evolution of an ice sheet's weathering crust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The weathering crust is a layer of porous ice that can form at the surface of an ice sheet. It grows and decays in response changing weather and climate conditions, affecting the albedo, the melt rate, and the transport of meltwater across the surface. To understand this behaviour, we seek time-dependent solutions to a continuum, thermodynamic model for the porosity, temperature and thickness of the weathering crust, and the internal and surface melt rates. We find solutions using a numerical enthalpy method, presented in this study. We use idealised `switching' and sinusoidal forcings to explore the different dynamics exhibited during growth and decay, the timescales involved, and the impact of diurnal vs. annual variations. The results demonstrate qualitative agreement with observations, and provide insight into the relative importance of different surface heat fluxes during the growth and decay of the crust. The model therefore provides a useful tool for exploring the response of the weathering crust to climate change.</description>

      <title>Nonlocality of Mean Scalar Transport in Two-Dimensional Rayleigh-Taylor Instability Using the Macroscopic Forcing Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13911v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The importance of nonlocality of mean scalar transport in 2D Rayleigh-Taylor Instability (RTI) is investigated. The Macroscopic Forcing Method (MFM) is utilized to measure spatio-temporal moments of the eddy diffusivity kernel representing passive scalar transport in the ensemble averaged fields. Presented in this work are several studies assessing the importance of the higher-order moments of the eddy diffusivity, which contain information about nonlocality, in models for RTI. First, it is demonstrated through a comparison of leading-order models that a purely local eddy diffusivity is insufficient in capturing the mean field evolution of the mass fraction in RTI. Therefore, higher-order moments of the eddy diffusivity operator are not negligible. Models are then constructed by utilizing the measured higher-order moments. It is demonstrated that an explicit operator based on the Kramers-Moyal expansion of the eddy diffusivity kernel is insufficient. An implicit operator construction that matches the measured moments is shown to offer improvements relative to the local model in a converging fashion.</description>

      <title>Shear flow of non-Brownian rod-sphere mixtures near jamming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01508v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the discrete element method, taking particle contact and hydrodynamic lubrication into account, to unveil the shear rheology of suspensions of frictionless non-Brownian rods in the dense packing fraction regime. We find that, analogously to the random close packing volume fraction, the shear-driven jamming point of this system varies in a non-monotonic fashion as a function of the rod aspect ratio. The latter strongly influences how the addition of rod-like particles affects the rheological response of a suspension of frictionless non-Brownian spheres to an external shear flow. At fixed values of the total (rods plus spheres) packing fraction, the viscosity of the suspension is reduced by the addition of "short" ( $\leq 2$) rods but is instead increased by the addition of "long" ( $\geq2$) rods. A mechanistic interpretation is provided in terms of packing and excluded-volume arguments.</description>
