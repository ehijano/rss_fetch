      <title>Ferrohydrodynamic Microfluidics for Bioparticle Separation and Single-Cell Phenotyping: Principles, Applications, and Emerging Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ferrohydrodynamic microfluidics relies on magnetic field gradients to manipulate diamagnetic particles in ferrofluid-filled microenvironments. It has emerged as a promising tool for label-free manipulation of bioparticles, including their separation and phenotyping. This perspective reviews recent progress in the development and applications of ferrofluid-based microfluidic platforms for multiscale bioparticle separation, ranging from micron-scale cells to submicron extracellular vesicles. We highlight the fundamental physical principles for ferrohydrodynamic manipulation, including the dominant magnetic buoyancy force resulting from the interaction of ferrofluids and particles. We then describe how these principles enable high-resolution size-based bioparticle separation, subcellular bioparticle enrichment, and phenotypic screening based on physical traits. We also discuss key challenges in ferrohydrodynamic microfluidics from the aspects of ferrofluid biocompatibility, system throughput, and nanoparticle depletion. Finally, we outline future research directions involving machine learning, 3D printing, and multiplexed detection. These insights chart a path for advancing ferrofluid-based technologies in precision biomedicine, diagnostics, and cellular engineering.</description>

      <title>Querying functional and structural niches on spatial transcriptomics data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10652v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cells in multicellular organisms coordinate to form functional and structural niches. With spatial transcriptomics enabling gene expression profiling in spatial contexts, it has been revealed that spatial niches serve as cohesive and recurrent units in physiological and pathological processes. These observations suggest universal tissue organization principles encoded by conserved niche patterns, and call for a query-based niche analytical paradigm beyond current computational tools. In this work, we defined the Niche Query Task, which is to identify similar niches across ST samples given a niche of interest (NOI). We further developed QueST, a specialized method for solving this task. QueST models each niche as a subgraph, uses contrastive learning to learn discriminative niche embeddings, and incorporates adversarial training to mitigate batch effects. In simulations and benchmark datasets, QueST outperformed existing methods repurposed for niche querying, accurately capturing niche structures in heterogeneous environments and demonstrating strong generalizability across diverse sequencing platforms. Applied to tertiary lymphoid structures in renal and lung cancers, QueST revealed functionally distinct niches associated with patient prognosis and uncovered conserved and divergent spatial architectures across cancer types. These results demonstrate that QueST enables systematic, quantitative profiling of spatial niches across samples, providing a powerful tool to dissect spatial tissue architecture in health and disease.</description>

      <title>The cell as a token: high-dimensional geometry in language models and cell embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20278v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Single-cell sequencing technology maps cells to a high-dimensional space encoding their internal activity. Recently-proposed virtual cell models extend this concept, enriching cells' representations based on patterns learned from pretraining on vast cell atlases. This review explores how advances in understanding the structure of natural language embeddings informs ongoing efforts to analyze single-cell datasets. Both fields process unstructured data by partitioning datasets into tokens embedded within a high-dimensional vector space. We discuss how the context of tokens influences the geometry of embedding space, and how low-dimensional manifolds shape this space's robustness and interpretation. We highlight how new developments in foundation models for language, such as interpretability probes and in-context reasoning, can inform efforts to construct cell atlases and train virtual cell models.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Software System for Low-Cost, Brightfield Segmentation: Algorithmic Implementation for Cytometric Auto-Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11354v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bright-field microscopy, a cost-effective solution for live-cell culture, is often the only resource available, along with standard CPUs, for many low-budget labs. The inherent challenges of bright-field images -- their noisiness, low contrast, and dynamic morphology -- coupled with a lack of GPU resources and complex software interfaces, hinder the desired research output. This article presents a novel microscopy image analysis framework designed for low-budget labs equipped with a standard CPU desktop. The Python-based program enables cytometric analysis of live, unstained cells in culture through an advanced computer vision and machine learning pipeline. Crucially, the framework operates on label-free data, requiring no manually annotated training data or training phase. It is accessible via a user-friendly, cross-platform GUI that requires no programming skills, while also providing a scripting interface for programmatic control and integration by developers. The end-to-end workflow performs semantic and instance segmentation, feature extraction, analysis, evaluation, and automated report generation. Its modular architecture supports easy maintenance and flexible integration while supporting both single-image and batch processing. Validated on several unstained cell types from the public dataset of livecells, the framework demonstrates superior accuracy and reproducibility compared to contemporary tools like Cellpose and StarDist. Its competitive segmentation speed on a CPU-based platform highlights its significant potential for basic research and clinical applications -- particularly in cell transplantation for personalised medicine and muscle regeneration therapies. The access to the application is available for reproducibility</description>

      <title>Validation of contact mechanics models for Atomic Force Microscopy via Finite Elements Analysis and nanoindentation experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17157v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we have validated the application of Hertzian contact mechanics models and corrections for the analysis of force vs indentation curves, acquired using spherical indenters on linearly elastic samples, by means of finite elements simulations and AFM nanomechanical measurements of polyacrylamide gels possessing a thickness gradient. We have systematically investigated the impact of both large indentations and vertical spatial confinement (bottom effect) on the accuracy of the nanomechanical analysis performed with the Hertz model for the parabolic indenter compared to the Sneddon model for the spherical indenter. We demonstrated the accuracy of the combined correction of large indentation and bottom effects for the Hertz model proposed in the literature in the framework of linearized force vs indentation curves acquired using spherical indenters, as well as a validation of a new linearized form of the Sneddon model. Our results show that the corrected Hertz model allows to accurately quantify the Young's modulus of elasticity of linearly elastic samples with variable thickness at arbitrarily large indentations.</description>

      <title>Reaction-diffusion models of invasive tree pest spread: quantifying the expansion of oak processionary moth in the UK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14166v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: UK woodlands, forests, and urban treescapes are under threat from invasive species, exacerbated by climate change, trade, and transport. Invasive tree pests debilitate their host and disrupt forest ecosystems, thus it is imperative to quantitatively model and predict their spread. Addressing this, we model the spread of an invasive pest using a spatiotemporal reaction-diffusion equation, representing the spatial distribution as a population density field. We solve this intractable equation numerically and, from the solution, we determine first arrival times of the pest at locations in the field. The adopted model permits us to obtain the expansion rate of pest spread directly from the model parameters, which we infer in the Bayesian paradigm, using a Markov chain Monte Carlo scheme. We apply our framework to the ongoing spread of oak processionary moth in the UK, an outbreak which continues to grow despite management efforts. We demonstrate that our approach effectively captures the spread of the pest and that this has occurred at a non-constant expansion rate. The proposed framework is a powerful tool for quantitatively modelling the spread of an invasive tree pest and could underpin future prediction and management approaches.</description>
