      <title>Deformation of a one dimensional ferromagnetic domain wall due to double exchange interaction with a free electron system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using an S-matrix formulation we evaluate the energy and conductance of a Bloch or N\'eel magnetic wall interacting with a one dimensional free electron system via a double exchange interaction. We find that for chemical potential larger than the magnetic interaction the domain wall is greatly deformed towards larger width. For double magnetic wall systems the electronic energy depends on the relative chirality of the domain walls while the conductance is basically independent of it. The energy and conductance are identical for Bloch and N\'eel magnetic domain walls within this prototype model.</description>

      <title>MASKE: A kinetic simulator of coupled chemical and mechanical processes driving microstructural evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06533v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The microstructure of materials evolves through chemical reactions and mechanical stress, often strongly coupled in phenomena such as pressure solution or crystallization pressure. This article presents MASKE: a simulator to address the challenge of modelling coupled chemo-mechanical processes in microstructures. MASKE represents solid phases as agglomerations of particles whose off-lattice displacements generate mechanical stress through interaction potentials. Particle precipitation and dissolution are sampled using Kinetic Monte Carlo, with original reaction rate equations derived from Transition State Theory and featuring contributions from mechanical interactions. Molecules in solution around the solid are modelled implicitly, through concentrations that change during microstructural evolution and define the saturation indexes for user-defined chemical reactions. The structure and implementation of the software are explained first. Then, two examples on a nanocrystal of calcium hydroxide address its chemical equilibrium and its mechanical response under a range of imposed strain rates, involving stress-driven dissolution and recrystallization. These examples highlight MASKE's distinctive ability to simulate strongly coupled chemo-mechanical processes. MASKE is available, open-source, on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Simulating the quantum Fourier transform, Grover's algorithm, and the quantum counting algorithm with limited entanglement using tensor-networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.01751v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms reformulate computational problems as quantum evolutions in a large Hilbert space. Most quantum algorithms assume that the time-evolution is perfectly unitary and that the full Hilbert space is available. However, in practice, the available entanglement may be limited, leading to a reduced fidelity of the quantum algorithms. To simulate the execution of quantum algorithms with limited entanglement, tensor-network methods provide a useful framework, since they allow us to restrict the entanglement in a quantum circuit. Thus, we here use tensor-networks to analyze the fidelity of the quantum Fourier transform, Grover's algorithm, and the quantum counting algorithm as the entanglement is reduced, and we map out the entanglement that is generated during the execution of each algorithm. In all three cases, we find that the algorithms can be executed with high fidelity even if the entanglement is somewhat reduced. Our results are promising for the execution of these algorithms on future quantum computers, and our simulation method based on tensor networks may also be applied to other quantum algorithms.</description>

      <title>HamLib: A library of Hamiltonians for benchmarking quantum algorithms and hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.13126v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In order to characterize and benchmark computational hardware, software, and algorithms, it is essential to have many problem instances on-hand. This is no less true for quantum computation, where a large collection of real-world problem instances would allow for benchmarking studies that in turn help to improve both algorithms and hardware designs. To this end, here we present a large dataset of qubit-based quantum Hamiltonians. The dataset, called HamLib (for Hamiltonian Library), is freely available online and contains problem sizes ranging from 2 to 1000 qubits. HamLib includes problem instances of the Heisenberg model, Fermi-Hubbard model, Bose-Hubbard model, molecular electronic structure, molecular vibrational structure, MaxCut, Max-$k$-SAT, Max-$k$-Cut, QMaxCut, and the traveling salesperson problem. The goals of this effort are (a) to save researchers time by eliminating the need to prepare problem instances and map them to qubit representations, (b) to allow for more thorough tests of new algorithms and hardware, and (c) to allow for reproducibility and standardization across research studies.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the limits of controllability for the nitrogen-vacancy electron spin defect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03120v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solid-state electron spin qubits, like the nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond, rely on control sequences of population inversion to enhance sensitivity and improve device coherence. But even for this paradigmatic system, the fundamental limits of population inversion and potential impacts on applications like quantum sensing have not been assessed quantitatively. Here, we perform high accuracy simulations beyond the rotating wave approximation, including explicit unitary simulation of neighboring nuclear spins. Using quantum optimal control, we identify analytical pulses for the control of a qubit subspace within the spin-1 ground state and quantify the relationship between pulse complexity, control duration, and fidelity. We find exponentially increasing amplitude and bandwidth requirements with reduced control duration and further quantify the emergence of non-Markovian effects for multipulse sequences using sub-nanosecond population inversion. From this, we determine that the reduced fidelity and non-Markovianity is due to coherent interactions of the electron spin with the nuclear spin environment. Ultimately, we identify a potentially realizable regime of nanosecond control duration for high-fidelity multipulse sequences. These results provide key insights into the fundamental limits of quantum information processing using electron spin defects in diamond.</description>

      <title>Testing the equivalence between the planar Gross-Neveu and Thirring models at $N=1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03480v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is known that the Fierz identities predict that the Gross-Neveu and Thirring models should be equivalent when describing systems composed of a single fermionic flavor, $N=1$. Here, we consider the planar version of both models within the framework of the optimized perturbation theory at the two-loop level, in order to verify if the predicted equivalence emerges explicitly when different temperature and density regimes are considered. At vanishing densities, our results indicate that both models indeed describe exactly the same thermodynamics, provided that $N=1$. However, at finite chemical potentials we find that the $N=1$ Fierz equivalence no longer holds. After examining the relevant free energies, we have identified the contributions which lead to this puzzling discrepancy. Finally, we discuss different frameworks in which this (so far open) problem could be further understood and eventually circumvented.</description>
