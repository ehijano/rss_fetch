      <title>Linear Risk Sharing on Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decade alternatives to traditional insurance and banking have grown in popularity. The desire to encourage local participation has lead products such as peer-to-peer insurance, reciprocal contracts, and decentralized finance platforms to increasingly rely on network structures to redistribute risk among participants. In this paper, we develop a comprehensive framework for linear risk sharing (LRS), where random losses are reallocated through nonnegative linear operators which can accommodate a wide range of networks. Building on the theory of stochastic and doubly stochastic matrices, we establish conditions under which constraints such as budget balance, fairness, and diversification are guaranteed. The convex order framework allows us to compare different allocations rigorously, highlighting variance reduction and majorization as natural consequences of doubly stochastic mixing. We then extend the analysis to network-based sharing, showing how their topology shapes risk outcomes in complete, star, ring, random, and scale-free graphs. A second layer of randomness, where the sharing matrix itself is random, is introduced via Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi and preferential-attachment networks, connecting risk-sharing properties to degree distributions. Finally, we study convex combinations of identity and network-induced operators, capturing the trade-off between self-retention and diversification. Our results provide design principles for fair and efficient peer-to-peer insurance and network-based risk pooling, combining mathematical soundness with economic interpretability.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Threats to Credible Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A seller wants to sell a good to a set of bidders using a credible mechanism. We show that when the seller has private information about her cost, it is impossible for a static mechanism to achieve the optimal revenue. In particular, even the optimal first-price auction is not credible. We show that the English auction can credibly implement the optimal mechanism, unlike the optimal Dutch auction. For symmetric mechanisms in which only winners pay, we also characterize all the static auctions that are credible: They are first-price auctions that depend only on the seller's cost ex post via a secret reserve, and may profitably pool bidders via a bid restriction. Our impossibility result highlights the role of public institutions and helps explain the use of dynamic mechanisms in informal auctions.</description>

      <title>On fairness of multi-center allocation problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate Ekici (2024b)'s multi-center allocation problems, focusing on fairness in this context. We introduce three fairness notions that respect centers' priorities: internal fairness, external fairness, and procedural fairness. The first notion eliminates envy among agents within the same center, the second prohibits envy across different centers, and the third rules out envy from an ex-ante perspective through agents' trading opportunities. We provide two characterizations of a natural extension of the top-trading-cycles mechanism (TTC) through our fairness notions. Precisely, we show that in the presence of strategy-proofness and pair efficiency, internal fairness and external fairness together characterize TTC (Theorem 1). Also, strategy-proofness combined solely with procedural fairness also characterizes TTC (Theorem 2). Furthermore, by adding internal fairness, we establish our third TTC characterization, by relaxing Ekici's queuewise rationality to another voluntary participation condition, the center lower bound (Theorem 3). Finally, we define a core solution within this model and characterize it through TTC (Theorem 4). Our findings offer practical insights for market designers, particularly in contexts such as international cooperation in medical programs and worker exchange programs.</description>

      <title>Comparisons of Experiments in Moral Hazard Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12476v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I use a novel geometric approach to compare information in moral hazard problems. I study three nested geometric orders on information, namely the column space, the conic span, and the zonotope orders. The orders are defined by the inclusion of the column space, the conic span, and the zonotope of the matrices representing the experiments. For each order, I establish four equivalent characterizations of the orders (i) inclusion of feasible state dependent utility sets, (ii) matrix factorizations, (iii) posterior belief distributions, and (iv) improved incentives in certain moral hazard problems. The column space order characterizes the comparison of implementability in all moral hazard problems. The conic span order characterizes the comparison of costs in all moral hazard problems with a risk neutral agent and limited liability. The zonotope order characterizes the comparison of costs in all moral hazard problems when the agent can have any utility exhibiting risk aversion.</description>

      <title>Expert Incentives under Partially Contractible States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I study whether and which expert incentives can be provided at what cost when the states of the world become non-contractible, but there is some noisy observation about the states that can be contracted upon. A principal hires an agent to acquire costly information about the states, but it is not possible to pay the agent based on the realized states. Instead, the principal has access to a noisy (Blackwell) experiment about the states, and can pay bonuses based on its realization. The agent is risk neutral and protected by limited liability. I completely characterize what the principal can incentivize the agent to learn, and how to design contracts to minimize the costs to provide such incentives. I then study which contractible information is always better at incentive provision. This gives rise to a novel order on information. In the binary-binary case, this order is characterized by larger differences in the likelihood ratios of the two realizations. My results provide insights into what information is better for evaluating expert predictions.</description>

      <title>Closed-Form of Two-Agent New Keynesian Model with Price and Wage Rigidities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12073v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper argues and analytically demonstrates that, in a fully analytical Two-Agent New Keynesian model with Rotemberg-type nominal rigidities, monetary transmission is amplified if and only if two conditions hold: first, the heterogeneity-induced IS-slope effect dominates; second, the price-stickiness channel is active. We also show when amplification weakens or disappears, most notably under pure wage stickiness, where the price channel shuts down and the heterogeneity-driven term vanishes. The framework features household heterogeneity between savers and hand-to-mouth households and adheres strictly to microeconomic foundations while avoiding restrictive assumptions on relative wages or labor supply across types that are common in prior analytical work. The closed-form solution makes transparent how price stickiness, wage stickiness, and the share of hand-to-mouth households jointly shape amplification. We further derive a modified aggregate welfare loss function that quantifies how heterogeneity, operating through distributional effects from firm profits, re-weights the relative importance of stabilizing inflation. Overall, the tractable yet micro-founded analytical framework clarifies the interaction between household heterogeneity and nominal rigidities and pinpoints the precise conditions under which monetary policy gains or loses traction.</description>

      <title>The Cost of Secure Restaking vs. Proof-of-Stake</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24440v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compare the efficiency of secure restaking and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) protocols in terms of stake requirements. First, we consider the sufficient condition for the restaking graph to be secure. We show that the condition implies that it is always possible to transform such a restaking graph into separate secure PoS protocols. Next, we derive two main results, giving upper and lower bounds on required extra stakes that one needs to add to validators of the secure restaking graph to be able to transform it into secure PoS protocols. In particular, we show that the restaking savings compared to PoS protocols can be very large and can asymptotically grow in the worst case as a square root of the number of validators. We also study a complementary question of aggregating secure PoS protocols into a secure restaking graph and provide lower and upper bounds on the PoS savings compared to restaking.</description>
