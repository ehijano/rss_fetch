      <title>Symmetry breaking in time-dependent billiards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate symmetry breaking in a time-dependent billiard that undergoes a continuous phase transition when dissipation is introduced. The system presents unlimited velocity, and thus energy growth for the conservative dynamics. When inelastic collisions are introduced between the particle and the boundary, the velocity reaches a plateau after the crossover iteration. The system presents the expected behavior for this type of transition, including scale invariance, critical exponents related by scaling laws, and an order parameter approaching zero in the crossover iteration. We analyze the velocity spectrum and its averages for dissipative and conservative dynamics. The transition point in velocity behavior caused by the physical limit of the boundary velocity and by the introduced dissipation coincides with the crossover interaction obtained from the Vrms curves. Additionally, we examine the velocity distributions, which lose their symmetry once the particle's velocity approaches the lower limit imposed by the boundary's motion and the system's control parameters. This distribution is also characterized analytically by an expression P(V,n), which attains a stationary state, with a well-defined upper bound, only in the dissipative case.</description>

      <title>Conserved Quantities in the Lorenz System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lorenz system, a seminal model in chaos theory, is renowned for its complex dynamics and sensitive dependence on initial conditions. This work investigates conserved quantities within the standard Lorenz equations. The system exhibits phase space volume contraction, a characteristic of dissipative systems. Despite the common understanding suggesting an absence of conserved quantities in its typical chaotic parameter regimes, this study demonstrates that the Lorenz system possesses at least three dynamical constants of motion. Implications of these conserved quantities for the system's chaotic behavior are discussed.</description>

      <title>Insights on structure and influence from the adjacency and Laplacian eigenspectra of intersecting ring networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synchronisation is a pervasive phenomenon of emerging collective behaviour observed to develop spontaneously across both natural and engineered systems. The process and patterns of synchronisation are highly influenced by initial conditions and network topology. Synchronisation follows a network's hierarchal structure; developing first at a local level before conglomeration of local clusters typically drives synchronisation at a global scale. The structure and influence of global and local features play a key role in node synchronisation. These differing insights are shown to be uncovered through eigenspectra analyses of ring networks. These network topologies exhibit complex patterns of stable and unstable synchronisation - despite apparently simple coupling schemes - as well as distinctive spectral fingerprints. Intersecting ring networks, with a common focal point, combine to produce hubs of high connectivity at the intersections whose spectral analyses can denote the characteristics and distinctions of structure and influence. The adjacency eigenspectrum detects salient network structures, for example hubs of high connectivity, whilst the Laplacian spectrum indentifies the relative influence of nodes due to their associated spanning trees within the network constituent structures.</description>

      <title>Turbulence spreading and anomalous diffusion on combs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04411v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a simple model for such processes as chaos spreading or turbulence spillover into stable regions. In this simple model the essential transport occurs via inelastic resonant interactions of waves on a lattice. The process is shown to result universally in a subdiffusive spreading of the wave field. The dispersion of this spreading process is found to depend exclusively on the type of the interaction process (three- or four-wave), but not on a particular instability behind. The asymptotic transport equations for field spreading are derived with the aid of a specific geometric construction in the form of a comb. The results can be summarized by stating that the asymptotic spreading pursues as a continuous-time random walk (CTRW) and corresponds to a kinetic description in terms of fractional-derivative equations. The fractional indexes pertaining to these equations are obtained exactly using the comb model. A special case of the above theory is a situation when two waves with oppositely directed wave vectors couple together to form a bound state with zero momentum. This situation is considered separately and associated with the self-organization of wave-like turbulence into banded flows or staircases. Overall, we find that turbulence spreading and staircasing could be described based on the same mathematical formalism, using the Hamiltonian of inelastic wave-wave interactions and a mapping procedure into the comb space. Theoretically, the comb approach is regarded as a substitute for a more common description based on quasilinear theory. Some implications of the present theory for the fusion plasma studies are discussed and a comparison with the available observational and numerical evidence is given.</description>

      <title>Attention-Enhanced Reservoir Computing as a Multiple Dynamical System Approximator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reservoir computing has proven effective for tasks such as time-series prediction, particularly in the context of chaotic systems. However, conventional reservoir computing frameworks often face challenges in achieving high prediction accuracy and adapting to diverse dynamical problems due to their reliance on fixed weight structures. A concept of an attention-enhanced reservoir computer has been proposed, which integrates an attention mechanism into the output layer of the reservoir computing model. This addition enables the system to prioritize distinct features dynamically, enhancing adaptability and prediction performance. In this study, we demonstrate the capability of the attention-enhanced reservoir computer to learn and predict multiple chaotic attractors simultaneously with a single set of weights, thus enabling transitions between attractors without explicit retraining. The method is validated using benchmark tasks, including the Lorenz system, R\"ossler system, Henon map, Duffing oscillator, and Mackey-Glass delay-differential equation. Our results indicate that the attention-enhanced reservoir computer achieves superior prediction accuracy, valid prediction times, and improved representation of spectral and histogram characteristics compared to traditional reservoir computing methods, establishing it as a robust tool for modeling complex dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Dissipative chaos and steady state of open Tavis-Cummings dimer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00776v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a coupled atom-photon system described by the Tavis-Cummings dimer (two coupled cavities) in the presence of photon loss and atomic pumping, to investigate the quantum signature of dissipative chaos. The appropriate classical limit of the model allows us to obtain a phase diagram identifying different dynamical phases, especially the onset of chaos. Both classically and quantum mechanically, we demonstrate the emergence of a steady state in the chaotic regime and analyze its properties. The interplay between quantum fluctuation and chaos leads to enhanced mixing dynamics and dephasing, resulting in the formation of an incoherent photonic fluid. The steady state exhibits an intriguing phenomenon of subsystem thermalization even outside the chaotic regime; however, its effective temperature increases with the degree of chaos. Moreover, the statistical properties of the steady state show a close connection with the random matrix theory. Finally, we discuss the experimental relevance of our findings, which can be tested in cavity and circuit quantum electrodynamics setups.</description>

      <title>Comparative study of the butterfly velocity in holographic QCD models at finite temperature and chemical potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15357v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study quantum chaos in a variety of holographic QCD models at finite temperature and chemical potentials. This includes the 1 R-Charge black hole (1RCBH) model, the 2 R-Charge black hole (2RCBH) model, a potential reconstruction-based analytic bottom-up model, and a numerical bottom-up model. All these models are different avatars of the Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton gravity action, distinguished by their specific choices of dilaton potentials and gauge-kinetic coupling functions. We focus on computing the chaos parameter, the butterfly velocity, using three distinct methods: entanglement wedge reconstruction, out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs), and pole-skipping. We show that all three methods yield identical results for the butterfly velocity across all the holographic QCD models considered, further establishing the equivalence between the three approaches. Furthermore, we analyze in detail the behavior of the butterfly velocity as a function of chemical potential and temperature. Interestingly, a universal trend emerges across all models: the butterfly velocity increases/decreases with temperature/chemical potential for thermodynamically stable phases. Additionally, in the high-temperature limit, the butterfly velocity in all models approaches that of the chargeless plasma.</description>

      <title>The influence of data gaps and outliers on resilience indicators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19034v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The resilience, or stability, of major Earth system components is increasingly threatened by anthropogenic pressures, demanding reliable early warning signals for abrupt and irreversible regime shifts. Widely used data-driven resilience indicators based on variance and autocorrelation detect `critical slowing down', a signature of decreasing stability. However, the interpretation of these indicators is hampered by poorly understood interdependencies and their susceptibility to common data issues such as missing values and outliers. Here, we establish a rigorous mathematical analysis of the statistical dependency between variance- and autocorrelation-based resilience indicators, revealing that their agreement is fundamentally driven by the time series' initial data point. Using synthetic and empirical data, we demonstrate that missing values substantially weaken indicator agreement, while outliers introduce systematic biases that lead to overestimation of resilience based on temporal autocorrelation. Our results provide a necessary and rigorous foundation for preprocessing strategies and accuracy assessments across the growing number of disciplines that use real-world data to infer changes in system resilience.</description>
