      <title>Superconductivity enhancement and doping-dependent phase diagram of Sm-based oxypnictides by high-pressure growth technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A series of SmFeAsO1-xFx (Sm1111) bulk samples are synthesized using an in-situ cubic-anvil high-pressure (CA-HP) technique at 4 GPa and are characterized through structural, microstructural, Raman, transport, and magnetic measurements. A systematic reduction of lattice parameters and unit-cell volume confirms effective fluorine substitution at oxygen sites, while Raman spectroscopy reveals electron doping and subtle changes in local bonding environments. In the underdoped regime, the superconducting transition temperature (Tc) is enhanced by 10-17 K and the critical current density (Jc) is increased by up to an order of magnitude. The upper critical field (Hc2), estimated using the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg model, reaches ~200 T, indicating strong spin paramagnetic effects and multiband superconductivity. Resistive broadening under applied fields follows Arrhenius behavior, with the activation energy showing a power-law field dependence that decreases rapidly at higher fields, consistent with collective vortex pinning. The superconducting phase diagram constructed from Tc and Jc versus fluorine content reveals a dome-like trend, with a maximum Tc of 57 K and Jc of 10^4 A-cm^-2 at the optimal doped region. A direct comparison with CSP samples demonstrates that high-pressure synthesis simultaneously enhances both Tc and Jc across the entire fluorine-doping range. These findings establish high-pressure growth as a highly effective approach for optimizing iron-based superconductors and underscore its potential for both fundamental research and future high field applications.</description>

      <title>Zero-field superconducting diode effect induced by magnetic flux in a van der Waals superconductor trigonal PtBi$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The superconducting diode effect is one of the nonreciprocal transport phenomena, where the critical current depends on the current direction. This effect is typically realized in superconductors with broken spatial-inversion and time-reversal symmetry. To break the time-reversal symmetry, external magnetic fields are commonly used. Here, we demonstrate a sign-controllable superconducting diode effect under zero external magnetic field in a van der Waals superconductor trigonal PtBi$_2$. The sign of the zero-field superconducting diode effect is controlled by the poling magnetic field, that is a large magnetic field applied prior to measurements. This result indicates that trapped magnetic flux are responsible for breaking the time-reversal symmetry. Our findings highlight the crucial role of trapped magnetic flux in generating the superconducting diode effect and provide a general pathway for realizing a zero-field superconducting diode effect.</description>

      <title>Guest metal-driven quantum anharmonic effects on stability and two-gap superconductivity in carbon-boron clathrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditionally, strong quantum anharmonic effects have been considered a characteristic of hydrogen-rich compounds. Here we propose that these effects also play a decisive role in boron-carbon clathrates. The stability and superconducting transition temperature (Tc) of carbon-boron clathrates XYB6C6, whose metal atoms have an average oxidation state of +1.5, have long remained under debate. At this oxidation state, some combinations (e.g., RbSrB6C6) are dynamically stable, whereas others (e.g., RbPbB6C6) are not. Using the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation combined with machine learning, we find that the anharmonicity originates primarily from guest metal atoms. For comparison, we find that quantum fluctuations have negligible influence on SrB3C3, but remove the lattice instability of RbPbB6C6. The predicted Tc of RbPbB6C6 (88 K) is nearly twice that of SrB3C3. Moreover, RbPbB6C6 exhibits two-gap superconductivity due to the higher C/B ratio in the density of states at the Fermi level compared to SrB3C3, weakening the sp3 hybridization. These findings demonstrate that quantum anharmonicity crucially governs the stability and superconductivity of XYB6C6 clathrates.</description>

      <title>Interplay of ferroelectricity and interlayer superconductivity in van der Waals bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the distinctive features of the interplay between the interlayer superconductivity and ferroelectricity in van der Waals heterostructures. Corresponding analysis is carried out within the framework of the quasiclassical Eilenberger equations for a tunnel coupled bilayer with inhomogeneous relative shift of the conduction bands between the layers, which describes the net charge transfer in sliding ferroelectrics. It is shown that the critical temperature of the interlayer superconductivity can be significantly enhanced for superconducting nuclei localized in the vicinity of ferroelectric domain walls. We demonstrate that the increase in the tunneling amplitude leads to the decrease (increase) in the difference between the critical temperatures for localized and homogeneous superconducting states for the spin-singlet (spin-triplet) interlayer superconductivity. We also perform an extensive analysis of the effects of the in-plane magnetic field on the interlayer superconductivity. It is shown that the orbital effect can result in the suppression of the spin-singlet interlayer superconductivity and to the enhancement of the spin-triplet one. We find that possible manifestations of the paramagnetic effect include the suppression of the interlayer superconductivity by rather weak Zeeman fields, the two-fold anisotropy of the critical magnetic field for the spin-triplet states as well as the appearance of the reentrant superconducting phases. It is shown that the joint influence of the orbital and paramagnetic mechanisms on the spin-triplet interlayer superconductivity can even lead to a nonmonotonic behavior of the superconducting critical temperature as a function of the external magnetic field. The obtained results are discussed in the context of recent experimental data on van der Waals structures with coexisting superconductivity and sliding ferroelectricity.</description>

      <title>Interplay of Rashba and Dresselhaus Spin-Orbit Couplings on the Stability of Topological FFLO Phases in 1D Fermi Gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the stabilization of topological Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) phases, with a specific emphasis on the intraband FFLO phase, in a one-dimensional (1D) Fermi gas subjected to an external magnetic field. This research highlights the crucial role of the interplay between Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) and Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling (DSOC). Employing a Fermi-Hubbard model alongside the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method, we examine the combined effects of RSOC and DSOC on these exotic superfluid phases, taking into account attractive fermionic interactions. Our principal finding reveals that while RSOC primarily stabilizes conventional zero-momentum pairing, DSOC performs a distinct and crucial role in selectively stabilizing the intraband FFLO phase. This stabilization is achieved by enhancing spin polarization within a single helicity band and suppressing interband coherence, thereby facilitating the formation of finite-momentum FFLO pairs within the same band and resulting in the emergence of a topologically nontrivial superfluid. This targeted control of intraband FFLO pairing paves the way for new strategies in the manipulation of superfluid phases in spin-orbit coupled systems and offers essential insights for experimental realizations in ultracold atomic gases, with implications for topological quantum computing and Majorana fermions.</description>

      <title>Minimal two band model and experimental proposals to distinguish pairing mechanisms of the high-T$_c$ superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of high-T$_c$ superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has opened the door to a new route to high temperature superconductivity, distinct from that in cuprates and iron-based materials. Yet, despite intense recent activity, we lack experimentally testable protocols for distinguishing between different pairing scenarios. In this Letter, we construct a minimal two-band model that reproduces the Fermi-surface topology observed in recent ARPES measurements and DFT calculations, and we analyze superconductivity arising from two distinct pairing mechanisms. We show that these mechanisms yield sharply different responses to an applied perpendicular electric field. Thus, La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ offers the unique opportunity to cleanly distinguish between different pairing scenarios. Finally, we propose three concrete experimental proposals designed to distinguish these scenarios and thereby identify the pairing mechanism most relevant to the real material.</description>

      <title>Family of multilayer graphene superconductors with tunable chirality: Momentum-space vortices nucleated by a ring of Berry curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21616v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent experiments in rhombohedrally-stacked multilayer graphene heterostructures have reported signatures of chiral superconductivity, emerging from a spin and valley-polarized normal state with broken time-reversal symmetry and an associated anomalous Hall effect. These findings bring into focus the role of the electronic Bloch wavefunction and the quantum geometric tensor in determining the superconducting pairing channel. In this work, we examine superconducting instabilities of a model of $N$-layer rhombohedral graphene that possesses an enhanced Berry curvature distribution on an extended ring in momentum space $-$ that we dub the 'Berry ring of fire' $-$ in the presence of an isotropic attractive interaction with a parametrically controlled spatial range. We determine that local interactions favor a $N$-fold winding in the order parameter phase for odd-$N$ layered systems, with even-$N$ layers requiring a spatially extended attraction range to achieve pairing. For generic interaction lengths, we discover a family of chiral superconductors and, remarkably, momentum-space vortices nucleated on the Berry ring of fire. The existence of these vortices can be traced to a momentum-space flux quantization condition involving the Berry curvature, with the phase winding dictated by a combination of the Berry flux and a 'statistical flux' to enforce Fermi-Dirac statistics. Such an order parameter structure allows for the possibility of in-situ tuning between various chiral superconducting phases through changes in the electron density or the displacement field. We discuss ways in which these predictions can be experimentally tested and potentially exploited in future devices.</description>
