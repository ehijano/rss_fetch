      <title>Learning from metastable grain boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grain boundaries (GBs) govern critical properties of polycrystals. Although significant advancements have been made in characterizing minimum energy GBs, real GBs are seldom found in such states, making it challenging to establish structure-property relationships. This diversity of atomic arrangements in metastable states motivates using data-driven methods to establish these relationships. In this study, we utilize a vast atomistic database (~5000) of minimum energy and metastable states of symmetric tilt copper GBs, combined with physically-motivated local atomic environment (LAE) descriptors (Strain Functional Descriptors, SFDs) to predict GB properties. Our regression models exhibit robust predictive capabilities using only 19 descriptors, generalizing to atomic environments in nanocrystals. A significant highlight of our work is integration of an unsupervised method with SFDs to elucidate LAEs at GBs and their role in determining properties. Our research underscores the role of a physics-based representation of LAEs and efficacy of data-driven methods in establishing GB structure-property relationships.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectricity in oxygen-terminated 2D carbides of lanthanide elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of oxygen-functionalized carbides of lanthanide elements with the composition M2CO2 (M=Gd, Tb,Dy) that form two-dimensional (2D) structures. Our ab initio calculations reveal that oxygen termination turns M2C monolayers into semiconductors with two dynamically stable phases. Of these, the energetically favored alpha-phase becomes ferroelectric, whereas the beta-phase turns anti-ferroelectric. Applying in-plane biaxial strain may transform one phase into the other, changes the ferroelectric polarization of the alpha-phase in a linear fashion, and modifies the size and nature of the fundamental band gap from direct to indirect. The structure with a direct band gap exhibits in-plane isotropic electronic and optical properties. This previously unexplored class of systems also exhibits excellent photon absorption in the ultraviolet range.</description>

      <title>Magnetic ground state of monolayer CeI$_{2}$: occupation matrix control and DFT+U calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic ground state is crucial for the applications of the two-dimension magnets as it decides fundamental magnetic properties of the material, such as magnetic order, magnetic transition temperature, and low-energy excitation of the spin waves. However, the simulations for magnetism of local-electron systems are challenging due to the existence of metastable states. In this study, occupation matrix control (OMC) and density functional theory plus Hubbard $U$ calculations are applied to investigate the magnetic ground state of monolayer CeI$_{2}$. Following the predicted ferrimagnetic (FM) order, the FM ground state and the FM metastable states are identified and found to have different values of the magnetic parameters. Based on the calculated magnetic parameters of the FM ground state, the Curie temperature is estimated to be $128$ K for monolayer CeI$_{2}$. When spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is considered,the FM ground state is further confirmed to contain both off-plane and in-plane components of magnetization. SOC is shown to be essential for reasonably describing not only magnetic anisotropy but also local electronic orbital state of monolayer CeI$_{2}$.</description>

      <title>Molecular Modelling of Aqueous Batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aqueous batteries play an increasingly important role for the development of sustainable and safety-prioritised energy storage solutions. Compared to conventional lithium-ion batteries, the cell chemistry in aqueous batteries share many common features with those of electrolyzer and pseudo-capacitor systems because of the involvement of aqueous electrolyte and proton activity. This imposes the needs for a better understanding of the corresponding ion solvation, intercalation and electron transfer processes at atomistic scale. Therefore, this chapter provides an up-to-date overview of molecular modelling techniques and their applications in aqueous batteries. In particular, we emphasize on the dynamical and reactive description of aqueous battery systems brought in by density functional theory-based molecular dynamics simulation (DFTMD) and its machine-learning (ML) accelerated counterpart. Moreover, we also cover the recent advancement of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in molecular and materials design of aqueous batteries. Case studies presented here include popular aqueous battery systems, such as water-in-salt electrolytes, proton-coupled cathode materials, Zn-ion batteries as well as organic redox flow batteries.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new approach toward characterizing local structural features of two-dimensional particle systems. The approach can accurately identify and characterize defects in high-temperature crystals, distinguish a wide range of nominally disordered systems, and robustly describe complex structures such as grain boundaries. This paper also introduces two-dimensional functionality into the open-source software program VoroTop which automates this analysis. This software package is built on a recently-introduced multithreaded version of VORO++, enabling the analysis of systems with billions of particles on high-performance computer architectures.</description>

      <title>Emergent Ferroelectric Nematic and Heliconical Ferroelectric Nematic States in an Achiral "Straight" Polar Rod Mesogen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals (NFLCs) are distinguished by their remarkable polarization characteristics and diverse physical phenomena, sparking significant interest and excitement within the scientific community. To date, over 150 NFLC molecules have been developed; however, there are no reports regarding straight linear polar molecules with a parallel alignment of the permanent dipole moment and the molecular axis. The straight polar mesogen nBOE exhibited an enantiotropic NF phase with a wide temperature window (up to 100 K) despite having a longer alkyl chain (up to n = 6) than the critical alkyl chain length of conventional models. Interestingly, nBOE with a medium length alkyl chain displayed an exotic phase sequence of NF-HCNF-SmCF during the elimination of positional displacement among adjacent molecules. Furthermore, we demonstrate the reflective color modulation of the HCNFLC over the entire VIS-NIR spectral regime by ultralow E-field (up to 0.14 V um^-1).</description>

      <title>Room-temperature bulk plasticity and tunable dislocation densities in KTaO3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report room-temperature bulk plasticity mediated by dislocations in single-crystal cubic KTaO3, contrasting the conventional knowledge that single-crystal KTaO3 is susceptible to brittle cleavage. A mechanics-based combinatorial experimental approach using cyclic Brinell indentation, scratching, and uniaxial bulk compression consistently demonstrates room-temperature dislocation plasticity in KTaO3 from the mesoscale to the macroscale. This approach also delivers tunable dislocation densities and plastic zone sizes. Scanning transmission electron microscopy analysis underpins the activated slip system to be &lt;110&gt;{1-10}. Given the growing significance of KTaO3 as an emerging electronic oxide and the increasing interest in dislocations for tuning physical properties of oxides, our findings are expected to trigger synergistic research interest in KTaO3 with dislocations.</description>

      <title>Interplay between thermal and compositional gradients decides the microstructure during thermomigration: a phase-field study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of thermal gradients in alloys often leads to non-uniformity in concentration profiles, which can induce the thermomigration of microstructural features such as precipitates. To investigate such microstructural changes, we present a phase-field model that incorporates coupling between concentration and thermal gradients. First, we simulated the evolution of non-uniform concentration profiles in the single-phase regions of Fe-C and Fe-N alloy systems due to imposed thermal gradients. To validate our model with the classical experiments performed by Darken and Oriani, we studied the evolution of spatially varying concentration profiles where thermal gradients encompass single-phase and two-phase regions. We developed a parameterized thermodynamic description of the two-phase region of a binary alloy to systematically study the effect of interactions between chemically-driven and thermal gradient-driven diffusion of solute on the evolution of precipitates. Our simulations show how thermal gradient, precipitate size, and interparticle distance influence the migration and associated morphological changes of precipitates. The composition profiles and migration rates obtained from single-particle simulations show an exact match with our analytical model. We use twoparticle simulations to show conditions under which thermomigration induces the growth of the smaller particle and shrinkage of the larger one in contrast to the isothermal Ostwald ripening behavior. Our multiparticle simulations show similar behavior during coarsening. Moreover, in the presence of a thermal gradient, there is a shift in the center of mass of the precipitates towards the high-temperature region. Thus, our study offers new insights into the phenomena of microstructure evolution in the presence of thermal gradient.</description>

      <title>Dependence of Exchange Bias on Interparticle Interactions in Co/CoO Core/shell Nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article reports dependence of exchange bias (EB) effect on interparticle interactions in nanocrystalline Co/CoO core/shell structures, synthesized using conventional sol-gel technique. Analysis via powder X-Ray diffraction (PXRD) studies and transmission electron microscope (TEM) images confirm absence of crystalline phases other than core-shell Co-CoO with average particle size $\approx$18 nm. Volume fraction ($\varphi$) is varied (from 20\% to 1\%) by introduction of stoichiometric amount of non-magnetic amorphous silica matrix (SiO$_2$) which leads to a change in interparticle separation/interaction. The influence of exchange and dipolar interactions on the EB effect, caused by the variation in interparticle interaction/separation is studied for a series of Co/CoO core/shell nanoparticle systems. Studies of thermal variation of magnetization ($M- T$) and magnetic hysteresis loops ($M- H$) for the series point towards strong dependence of magnetic properties on dipolar interaction in concentrated assemblies whereas individual nanoparticle response is dominant in isolated nanoparticle systems. The analysis of the EB effect reveals a monotonic increase of coercivity ($H_C$) and EB field ($H_E$) with increasing volume fraction. When the nanoparticles are close enough and the interparticle interaction is significant, collective behavior leads to an increase in the effective antiferromagnetic (AFM) CoO shell thickness which results in high $H_C$, $H_E$. Moreover, in concentrated assemblies, the dipolar field superposes to the local exchange field and enhances the EB effect contributing as an additional source of unidirectional anisotropy.</description>

      <title>Harvesting room-temperature plasticity in ceramics by mechanically seeded dislocations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quest for room-temperature ductile ceramics has been repeatedly fueled by hopes for large-scale applications but so far has been not successful. Recent demonstrations of enhanced functional properties in ceramics through judicious dislocation imprint, however, have been sparking renewed interest in dislocation plasticity in brittle ceramics. Here, we propose a facile approach using room-temperature mechanically seeded mobile dislocations with a density of ~10^14/m^2 to significantly improve the room-temperature plasticity of ceramics with a large plastic strain beyond ~30%. The seeded mobile dislocations trigger profuse dislocation multiplication via cross slip and motion. Hence, they offer an avenue to suppress brittle fracture and harvest plasticity in ceramics without any additional high-temperature process. We employ both in situ nano-/micromechanical deformation and ex situ bulk deformation to bridge the length scales. This finding tackles the pressing bottleneck of dislocation engineering in ceramics for achieving ductile ceramics and harvesting both versatile mechanical and functional properties.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Photoelectron Momentum Microscope at the Soft X-ray Beamline I09 of the Diamond Light Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft X-ray momentum microscopy of crystalline solids is a highly efficient approach to map the photoelectron distribution in four-dimensional (E,k) parameter space over the entire Brillouin zone. The fixed sample geometry eliminates any modulation of the matrix element otherwise caused by changing the angle of incidence. We present a new endstation at the soft X-ray branch of beamline I09 at the Diamond Light Source, UK. The key component is a large single hemispherical spectrometer combined with a time-of-flight analyzer behind the exit slit. The photon energy ranges from hv = 105 eV to 2 keV, with circular polarization available for hv &gt; 150 eV, allowing for circular dichroism measurements in angle-resolved photoemission (CD-ARPES). A focused and monochromatized He lamp is used for offline measurements. Under k-imaging conditions, energy and momentum resolution are 10.2 meV (FWHM) and 0.010 angstroms^-1 (base resolution 4.2 meV with smallest slits and a pass energy of 8 eV). The large angular filling of the entrance lens and hemisphere (225 mm path radius) allows k-field-of-view diameters &gt; 6 angstroms^-1. Energy filtered X-PEEM mode using synchrotron radiation revealed a resolution of 300 nm. As examples we show 2D band mapping of bilayer graphene, 3D mapping of the Fermi surface of Cu, CD-ARPES for intercalated indenene layers and the sp valence bands of Cu and Au, and full-field photoelectron diffraction patterns of Ge.</description>

      <title>Molecular-Resolution Imaging of Ice Crystallized from Liquid Water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the ubiquity of ice, a molecular-resolution image of ice crystallized from liquid water or the resulting defect structure has never been obtained. Here, we report the stabilization and angstrom-resolution electron imaging of ice Ih crystallized from liquid water. We combine lattice mapping with molecular dynamics simulations to reveal that ice formation is highly tolerant to nanoscale defects such as misoriented subdomains and trapped gas bubbles, which are stabilized by molecular-scale structural motifs. Importantly, bubble surfaces adopt low-energy nanofacets and create negligible strain fields in the surrounding crystal. These bubbles can dynamically nucleate, grow, migrate, dissolve, and coalesce under electron irradiation and be monitored in situ near a steady state. This work opens the door to understanding water crystallization behaviors at an unprecedented spatial resolution.</description>

      <title>Real-space tilting method for atomic resolution STEM imaging of nanocrystalline materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) characterization requires precise tilting of the specimen to high symmetric zone axis, which is usually processed in reciprocal space by following the diffraction patterns. However, for small-sized nanocrystalline materials, their diffraction patterns are too faint to guide the tilting process. Here, a simple and effective tilting method is developed based on the diffraction contrast change of the shadow image in the Ronchigram. We can calculate the misorientation angle of the specimen and tilt it to the zone axis based on the position of the shadow image with lowest intensity. This method requires no prior knowledge of the sample and the maximum misorientation angle we can correct is greater than +-6.9 degree with sub-mrad accuracy. It is processed in real space, without recording the diffraction patterns of the specimens, which can effectively apply to nanocrystalline materials. Combined with the scripting to control the microscope, we can automatically tilt the sample to the zone axis under low dose condition (&lt;0.17 e-/A2/s), which could facilitate the imaging of beam sensitive materials such as zeolites or metal organic frameworks. This automated tilting method could contribute to the atomic-scale characterization of the nanocrystalline materials by STEM imaging.</description>

      <title>Ta2Pd3Te5 topological thermometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent decades, there has been a persistent pursuit of applications for surface/edge states in topological systems, driven by their dissipationless transport effects. However, there have been limited tangible breakthroughs in this field. This work demonstrates the remarkable properties of the topological insulator Ta2Pd3Te5, as a thermometer. This material exhibits a power-law correlation in temperature-dependent resistance at low temperatures, stemming from its Luttinger liquid behavior of edge states, while exhibiting semiconductor behavior at high temperatures. The power-law behavior effectively addresses the issue of infinite resistance in semiconductor thermometers at ultra-low temperatures, thereby playing a crucial role in enabling efficient thermometry in refrigerators supporting millikelvin temperatures or below. By employing chemical doping, adjusting thickness, and controlling gate voltage, its power-law behavior and semiconductor behavior can be effectively modulated. This enables efficient thermometry spanning from millikelvin temperatures to room temperature, and allows for precise local temperature measurement. Furthermore, this thermometer exhibits excellent temperature sensitivity and resolution, and can be fine-tuned to show small magnetoresistance. In summary, the Ta2Pd3Te5 thermometer, also referred to as a topological thermometer, exhibits outstanding performance and significant potential for measuring a wider range of temperatures compared to conventional low-temperature thermometers.</description>

      <title>Time Dependent Density Functional Theory calculations of the optical properties of charge-transfer complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charge transfer complexes are materials with a wide range of interesting optical and electronic properties. They have seen a great deal of research over the past decade, both in device development as well as research to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of charge transfer and transport. Here we present time dependent density-functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations of the energy levels of the donor-acceptor complexes perylene-TCNQ (7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane) and hexamethylbenzene-chloranil. The calculations show a good match to the experimentally measured optical absorption spectra, and indicate that low energy CT absorption bands appear at the dimer/tetramer stage of cocrystal formation. We also report the degree of charge transfer for these complexes in various stoichiometries and compare them.</description>

      <title>Memory effects on the current induced propagation of spin textures in NdCo$_5$/Ni$_8$Fe$_2$ bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bilayers of NdCo$_5$/Ni$_8$Fe$_2$ can act as reconfigurable racetracks thanks to the parallel stripe domain configuration present in the hard magnetic material with weak perpendicular anisotropy (NdCo$_5$), and its imprint on the soft magnetic layer (Ni$_8$Fe$_2$). This pattern hosts spin textures with well defined topological charges and establishes paths for their deterministic propagation under the effect of pulsed currents, which has been studied as a function of externally applied fields by using Magnetic Transmission X-ray Microscopy. The experiments show guided vortex/antivortex propagation events within the Ni$_8$Fe$_2$ above a threshold current of $3\cdot10^{11}$ A/m$^2$. Opposite propagation senses have been observed depending on the topological charge of the spin texture, both in the remnant state and under an applied external field. Micromagnetic simulations of our multilayer reveal that the guiding effect and asymmetric propagation sense are due to the magnetic history of the hard magnetic layer. An exchange-bias-based memory effect acts as a magnetic spring and controls the propagation sense by favoring a specific orientation of the in plane magnetization, leading to a system which behaves as a hard-soft magnetic composite with reconfigurable capabilities for a controlled propagation of magnetic topological textures.</description>

      <title>Ineffectiveness of Formamidine in Suppressing Ultralow Thermal Conductivity in Cubic Hybrid Perovskite FAPbI3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We comprehensively investigate the thermal transport behavior in cubic hybrid perovskite FAPbI3, utilizing a combination of first principles-based anharmonic lattice dynamics and a linearized Wigner transport formula. By employing the Temperature Dependent Effective Potential (TDEP) technique, we stabilize the negative soft modes, primarily dominated by organic cations, at finite temperatures in cubic FAPbI3. We predict an ultra-low thermal conductivity of ~0.63 Wm^(-1) K^(-1) in cubic FAPbI3 at 300 K, characterized by a temperature dependence of T^(-0.740), suggesting a good crystalline nature of phonon transport. Importantly, we find that the ultra-low thermal conductivity in cubic FAPbI3 is primarily attributed to the [PbI3]1- units rather than the FA+ cations. This challenges the prevailing understanding and can be attributed to the presence of Pb(s)-I(p) anti-bonding sates in the [PbI3]1- units. Furthermore, thermal transport in cubic FAPbI3 is predominantly governed by the particle-like phonon propagation channel across the entire temperature range of 300-500 K. This observation can be attributed to the reduced suppression of low-frequency phonons by FA+ cations and the presence of large inter-branch spacings. Finally, our results demonstrate that the anharmonic force constants are highly sensitive to temperature effects, resulting in an underestimation of thermal conductivity when 0-K anharmonic force constants are used. Our study not only elucidates the microscopic mechanisms of thermal transport in cubic FAPbI3 but also establishes a foundational basis for the discovery, design, and understanding of hybrid organic-inorganic compounds with ultra-low thermal conductivity.</description>

      <title>Local structural distortions drive magnetic molecular field in a compositionally complex spinel oxide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A core challenge in understanding high entropy oxides (HEOs) is how these systems, with five or more cations at a crystallographic site, can withstand local distortions while preserving a uniform structure on a larger scale. We address this for spinel HEO by comparatively examining extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) on (Mn$_{0.2}$Co$_{0.2}$Ni$_{0.2}$Cu$_{0.2}$Zn$_{0.2}$)Cr$_2$O$_4$ ($A^5$Cr$_2$O$_4$) and its parent counterparts $A$Cr$_2$O$_4$ ($A$= Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn). Unlike the HEO with rock-salt structure, the element-specific distortions in disordered sublattice go beyond the first neighbor here. Moreover, the tetragonal distortion around the Cu$^{2+}$ ion, known as a textbook example of the Jahn-Teller effect, is highly reduced in $A^5$Cr$_2$O$_4$ compared to CuCr$_2$O$_4$. Despite variations in the A-O bond lengths, the inter-cationic distances remained remarkably similar. This affirms a high level of flexibility in the positioning of oxygen, enabling them to adapt to the overall cubic symmetry. Despite containing multiple magnetic ions, the Curie-Weiss temperature and effective magnetic moments of $A^5$Cr$_2$O$_4$ are similar to those of NiCr$_2$O$_4$. This can be attributed to both materials' comparable local bond lengths around Cr, as evidenced by EXAFS analysis. This study conclusively presents a method for elucidating how local structural distortions influence the macroscopic properties of compositionally complex quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the potential of thermoplastic polymers for cryogenic sealing applications: strain rate and temperature effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cryogenic fuels, such as liquid hydrogen and liquid natural gas, emerge as versatile and sustainable energy carriers that are revolutionising various industries including aerospace, automotive, marine, and power generation. Thermoplastic polymers can be a suitable alternative to metal seals in cryogenic fuel systems. However, there is limited study about the behaviours of thermoplastics at cryogenic temperatures, especially at liquid hydrogen temperature of 20 Kelvin (K). This paper measured the tensile properties and coefficient of thermal expansion of three popular thermoplastics: PTFE, PEEK and UHMWPE at room temperature (RT), 77 K and 20 K and at four strain rates. Further microscopic analysis was also conducted to understand the failure mechanisms occurring when combining reduced temperature with varying strain rate. The tensile strength of each polymer increased from RT to 77 K and decreased from 77 K to 20 K. Elastic modulus tended to increase, and the strain recorded at failure decreased when reducing temperature from RT to 20 K. From microscopic observation of PEEK and UHMWPE, a reduction in temperature from 77 K to 20 K resulted in a larger instantaneous fracture, with multi-faceted fracture surfaces containing many small mirror like and opaque or misty sub-regions within the fracture zone. For PTFE, the surface morphology exhibited an insensitivity to the increase in strain rate at cryogenic temperatures, and the microscopy showed how the size of dimples found within the fracture interface became smaller when temperature was reduced from 77 K to 20 K. Finally, PEEK was found to contract much less than PTFE and UHMWPE at 20 K, in agreement to it having the highest glass transition temperature of the three polymers, which is normally a good indicator when attempting to identify polymers that will tend to exhibit smaller contraction at cryogenic temperatures.</description>

      <title>Lattice-distortion couplings in antiferroelectric perovskite $\rm AgNbO_3$ and comparison with $\rm PbZrO_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lead-free antiferroelectric perovskite $\rm AgNbO_3$ is nowadays attracting extensive research interests due to its promising applications in energy storage. Although great progress has been made in optimizing the material performance, fundamental questions remain regarding the mechanism stabilizing the antiferroelectric $Pbcm$ phase. Here, combining structural symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations, we identified crucial anharmonic couplings of oxygen octahedra rotations and cation antipolar motions which contribute significantly to lowering the energy of the $Pbcm$ phase. The stabilization of this phase shows close similarities with the stabilization of the $Pbam$ phase in $\rm PbZrO_3$ except that in $\rm AgNbO_3$ the octahedra rotations are the primary distortions while the antipolar cation motions appear to be secondary. The appearance and significant amplitude of the latter are explained from the combination of hybrid-improper and triggered mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Kinetic Parameters analysis of GdAlO$_3$ based on thermoluminescent phenomenon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: {We herein report on the calculation of thermoluminescence (TL) kinetic parameters determined from the TL emission of synthetic GdAlO3 (GAO) phosphors prepared by the co-precipitation method. The sample, characterized by means of X-ray diffraction with an orthorhombic phase structure (space group Pnma (62), shows complex glow curves consisting of at least four groups of components peaked at 100, 140, 240, and 290 {\deg}C where the two lower overlapped temperature peaks are difficult to identify using the $T_M-T_{stop}$. The coexistence of a continuum in the trap distribution (linked to the lower temperature peaks) and a discrete trap system (associated with the components at temperatures higher than 200 {\deg}C) can be distinguished. The estimation of the TL kinetic parameters is performed using GlowFit, TLAnal, the spreadsheet Origin, Computing Glow Curve Deconvolution (CGCD), and various heating rate (VHR) methods. However, only CGCD appears as the suitable technique for such purpose since it provides information on the TL physical process supported by mathematical models based on a linear combination of functions related to the First Order Kinetic approach.</description>

      <title>Mn$_2$C MXene Functionalized by Oxygen is a Semiconducting Antiferromagnet and Efficient Visible Light Absorber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Manganese-based MXenes are promising two-dimensional materials due to the broad palette of their magnetic phases and the possibility of experimental preparation because the corresponding MAX phase was already prepared. Here, we systematically investigated geometrical conformers and spin solutions of oxygen-terminated Mn$_2$C MXene and performed subsequent many-body calculations to obtain reliable electronic and optical properties. Allowing energy-lowering using the correct spin ordering via supercell magnetic motifs is essential for the Mn$_2$CO$_2$ system. The stable ground-state Mn$_2$CO$_2$ conformation is antiferromagnetic (AFM) one with zigzag lines of up and down spins on Mn atoms. The AFM nature is consistent with the parent MAX phase and even the clean depleted Mn$_2$C sheet. Other magnetic states and geometrical conformations are energetically very close, providing state-switching possibilities in the material. Subsequent many-body GW and Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) calculations provide indirect semiconductor characteristics of AFM Mn$_2$CO$_2$ with a fundamental gap of 2.1 eV (and a direct gap of 2.4 eV), the first bright optical transition at 1.3 eV and extremely strongly bounded (1.1 eV) first bright exciton. Mn$_2$CO$_2$ absorbs efficiently the whole visible light range and near ultraviolet range (between 10 - 20%).</description>

      <title>Remote-Controlled Activation of the Release through Drug-Loaded Magnetic Electrospun Fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of magnetic nanoparticles within fibrillar structures represents an interesting avenue for the remotely controlled release of therapeutic agents. This work presents a novel drug release platform based on electrospun magnetic fibers (EMFs) combining drugs, magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) and mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) for controlled drug delivery via alternating magnetic fields (AMF). The platform was demonstrated to be versatile and effective for hydrophilic ketorolac (KET) and hydrophobic curcumin (CUR) encapsulation and the major response observed for AMF-triggered release was reached using drug-loaded MSNs within the fibers, providing fine control over drug release patterns. The EMFs exhibited excellent inductive heating capabilities, showing a temperature increase up to 8 {\deg}C within a 5 min AMF pulse. The system is shown to be promising for applications like transdermal pain management, oncological drug delivery, tissue engineering, and wound healing, enabling precise control over drug release in both spatial and temporal dimensions. The findings of this study offer valuable insights into the development of the next generation of smart drug delivery systems, based in multifunctional materials that can be remotely regulated and potentially revolutionize the field of nanomedicine.</description>

      <title>Optimized effective potential forces with the plane-wave and pseudopotential method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optimized effective potential (OEP) approach has so far mainly been used in benchmark studies and for the evaluation of band gaps. In this work, we extend the application of the OEP by determining the analytical ionic forces within the plane-wave and pseudopotential framework. It is first shown that, due to the constrained optimization inherent to the OEP approach, an extra term needs to be added to the standard Hellmann-Feynman expression for the forces, whenever nonlocal pseudopotentials are employed. Computing this term for functionals based on Hartree-Fock and the hybrid PBE0 functional yields forces with excellent numerical accuracy. Furthermore, results for equilibrium geometries and vibrational frequencies on a set of molecules and solids confirm that the local exchange OEP is able to reproduce results obtained with the nonlocal exchange potential. Our work opens up the possibility to study lattice dynamics using advanced orbital functionals for describing exchange and correlation effects.</description>

      <title>Interplay between ferroelectricity and metallicity in hexagonal YMnO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use first-principles density functional theory to investigate how the polar distortion is affected by doping in multiferroic hexagonal yttrium manganite, h-YMnO$_3$. While the introduction of charge carriers tends to suppress the polar distortion in conventional ferroelectrics, the behavior in improper geometric ferroelectrics, of which h-YMnO$_3$ is the prototype, has not been studied to date. Using both background charge doping and atomic substitution, we find an approximately linear dependence of the polar distortion on doping concentration, with hole doping suppressing and electron doping enhancing it. We show that this behavior is a direct consequence of the improper geometric nature of the ferroelectricity. In addition to its doping effect, atomic substitution can further suppress or enhance the polar distortion through changes in the local chemistry and geometry.</description>

      <title>Pinpointing Lattice-Matched Conditions for Wurtzite ScxAl1-xN/GaN Heterostructures with X-Ray Reciprocal Space Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using comprehensive x-ray reciprocal space mapping, we establish the precise lattice-matching composition for wurtzite $Sc_xAl_{1-x}N$ layers on (0001) GaN to be x = 0.14+/-0.01. 100-nm thick $Sc_xAl_{1-x}N$ films (x = 0.09 - 0.19) were grown in small composition increments on c-plane GaN templates by plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy. The alloy composition was estimated from the fit of the (0002) x-ray peak positions assuming the c-lattice parameter of ScAlN films coherently-strained on GaN increases linearly with Sc-content determined independently by Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry. Reciprocal space maps obtained from high-resolution x-ray diffraction measurements of the (10-15) reflection reveal that $Sc_xAl_{1-x}N$ films with x = 0.14+/-0.01 are coherently strained with the GaN substrate while the other compositions show evidence of relaxation. The in-plane lattice-matching with GaN is further confirmed for a 300-nm thick $Sc_{0.14}Al_{0.86}N$ layer. The full-width-at-half-maximum of the (0002) reflection rocking curve for this $Sc_{0.14}Al_{0.86}N$ film is 106 arcseconds and corresponds to the lowest value reported in the literature for wurtzite ScAlN films.</description>

      <title>Polycatenated Architected Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Architected materials derive their properties from the geometric arrangement of their internal structural elements, rather than solely from their chemical composition. They can display remarkable behaviors such as high strength while being lightweight, negative Poisson's ratios, and shear-normal coupling. However, architected materials so far have either exhibited solid-like or fluid-like behavior, but not both. Here, we introduce a class of materials that consist of linked particles assembled in three-dimensional domains, forming polycatenated architected materials (PAMs). We propose a general framework for PAMs that translates arbitrary crystalline networks into particles' concatenations and design particles' geometry. The resulting materials are cohesive, yet the individual particles retain some kinematic freedom. In response to small external loads, PAMs behave like non-Newtonian fluids, showing both shear-thinning and shear-thickening responses. At larger strains, PAMs behave like solids, showing a nonlinear stress-strain relation, like lattices and foams. These responses are regulated by a jamming transition determined by the particles' arrangement and the direction of loading. PAMs are scalable, showing comparable mechanical responses at both millimeter- and micrometer-scales. However, micro-PAMs can change shape in response to electrostatic charges. PAM's properties are relevant for developing stimuli-responsive materials, energy-absorbing systems and morphing architectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a spectral scheme for atomic structure calculations in pseudopotential Kohn-Sham density functional theory. In particular, after applying an exponential transformation of the radial coordinates, we employ global polynomial interpolation on a Chebyshev grid, with derivative operators approximated using the Chebyshev differentiation matrix, and integrations using Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature. We demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the scheme through spin-polarized and unpolarized calculations for representative atoms, while considering local, semilocal, and hybrid exchange-correlation functionals. In particular, we find that $\mathcal{O}$(200) grid points are sufficient to achieve an accuracy of 1 microhartree in the eigenvalues for optimized norm conserving Vanderbilt pseudopotentials spanning the periodic table from atomic number $Z = 1$ to $83$.</description>

      <title>For passive radiative cooling, are wavelength-selective emitters the best choice?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For passive cooling via thermal radiation toward the sky, it is known that an ideal selective emitter (SE) with high emissivity only in the 8 - 13 um atmospheric transparency window can reach a lower equilibrium temperature than an ideal broadband emitter (BE) across the mid infrared. Here, we evaluate whether this principle should guide the development of practical passive radiative cooling technologies. We model and compare the cooling performance of SEs and BEs at various locations on Earth, accounting for the distributions of atmospheric temperature and gas composition at specific dates and times. We find that for emitter temperatures at or higher than the ambient temperature, an ideal broadband emitter always provides higher net cooling power, while for sub-ambient cooling, an ideal selective emitter is slightly better: the difference in cooling power is small, at most on the order of ~2% of the incident solar power during daytime. Our conclusion is that large-scale deployment of passive radiative cooling technologies should focus on design and manufacturing of scalable low-cost surfaces with the lowest possible solar absorption without worrying too much whether the emitter is broadband or selective.</description>

      <title>Impact of rotational symmetry breaking on $d$-wave superconductivity in Hubbard models for cuprate and nickelate superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments have revealed the substantial impact of broken rotational symmetry on the superconductivity. In the pursuit of understanding the role played by this symmetry breaking particularly in cuprate and nickelate superconductors on their superconductivity, we investigated two characteristic symmetry breaking mechanisms arising from (1) structurally orthogonal distortions from $C_4$ to $C_2$ symmetry and (2) anisotropic hybridization between $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital and an additional metallic band within the framework of the Hubbard model by employing dynamic cluster quantum Monte Carlo calculations. We discovered that the anisotropy is generically detrimental to the $d$-wave pairing so that the experimental findings of much lower superconducting $T_c$ of infinite-layer nickelates compared with the cuprates may be connected to the intrinsic anisotropy. Our exploration sheds light on the fundamental anisotropy factors governing superconductivity in nickelates and cuprates and offer insights contributing to the broader understanding of unconventional superconductors in anisotropic environment.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic conformal order revealed in geometrically confined long-range repulsive particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Elucidating long-range interaction guided organization of matter is a fundamental question in physical systems covering multiple length scales. Here, based on the hexagonal disk model, we analyze the characteristic inhomogeneity created by long-range repulsions, and reveal the intrinsic conformal order in particle packings in mechanical equilibrium. Specifically, we highlight the delicate angle-preserved bending of the lattice to match the inhomogeneity condition. The revealed conformal order is found to be protected by the surrounding topological defects. These results advance our understanding on long-range interacting systems, and open the promising possibilities of using long-range forces to create particle packings not accessible by short-range forces, which may have practical consequences.</description>

      <title>Antiferromagnetic order in a layered magnetic topological insulator MnBi$_2$Se$_4$ probed by resonant soft x-ray scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quasi-two-dimensional magnetic topological insulator MnBi$_2$Se$_4$, stabilized via non-equilibrium molecular beam epitaxy, is investigated by resonant soft x-ray scattering. Kiessig fringes are observed, confirming a high sample quality and a thin film thickness of 10 septuple layers ($\sim$13 nm). An antiferromagnetic Bragg peak is observed at the structurally forbidden reflection, whose magnetic nature is validated by studying its temperature, energy, and polarization dependence. Through a detailed analysis, an A-type antiferromagetic order with in-plane moments is implied. This alternative spin structure in MnBi$_2$Se$_4$, in contrast to the Ising antiferromagnetic states in other magnetic topological insulators, might be relevant for hosting new topological states.</description>

      <title>Improved Three-Dimensional Reconstructions in Electron Ptychography through Defocus Series Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A detailed analysis of ptychography for 3D phase reconstructions of thick specimens is performed. We introduce multi-focus ptychography, which incorporates a 4D-STEM defocus series to enhance the quality of 3D reconstructions along the beam direction through a higher overdetermination ratio. This method is compared with established multi-slice ptychography techniques, such as conventional ptychography, regularized ptychography, and multi-mode ptychography. Additionally, we contrast multi-focus ptychography with an alternative method that uses virtual optical sectioning through a reconstructed scattering matrix ($\mathcal{S}$-matrix), which offers more precise 3D structure information compared to conventional ptychography. Our findings from multiple 3D reconstructions based on simulated and experimental data demonstrate that multi-focus ptychography surpasses other techniques, particularly in accurately reconstructing the surfaces and interface regions of thick specimens.</description>

      <title>Optical heterodyne microscopy of operating spin Hall nano-oscillator arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical heterodyne detection is a powerful technique for characterizing a wide range of physical excitations. Here, we use two types of optical heterodyne detection techniques (fundamental and parametric pumping) to microscopically characterize the high-frequency auto-oscillations of single and multiple nano-constriction spin Hall nano-oscillators (SHNOs). To validate the technique and demonstrate its robustness, we study SHNOs made from two different material stacks, NiFe/Pt and W/CoFeB/MgO, and investigate the influence of both the RF injection power and the laser power on the measurements, comparing the optical results to conventional electrical measurements. To demonstrate the key features of direct, non-invasive, submicron, spatial, and phase-resolved characterization of the SHNO magnetodynamics, we map out the auto-oscillation magnitude and phase of two phase-binarized SHNOs used in Ising Machines. This proof-of-concept platform establishes a strong foundation for further extensions, contributing to the ongoing development of crucial characterization techniques for emerging computing technologies based on spintronics devices</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The review unveils the diverse applications of concerted polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)-carbon nanomaterial (CNM) systems, spanning from electromagnetic interference shielding, including elimination of 5G-interference, to piezoelectrics and a variety of sensing modalities (breathing, movement, health monitoring, structural integrity assessments, home monitoring, and seismic acceleration). These materials also excel in biomaterials with applications like tactile skin and COVID-preventing facemasks through sunlight sterilization. Moreover, PVDF-CNMs demonstrate excellence in radar absorption, solar-assisted electricity generation, triboelectric energy harvesting, 3D-4D printing materials, anti-icing covers, anti-stealth materials, and heat-dissipating solids in electronics. Across diverse scientific disciplines, the research merges materials chemistry and engineering, yielding materials with multimodal functionalities. The demand for a comprehensive review stems from the need to synthesize insights from fundamental sciences and technologies, capturing the cutting-edge nature of these materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The autofluorescence of calabrian Opuntia ficus-indica bioactive extract upon UV illumination is explored by fluorescence spectroscopy enabling to investigate the typology and distribution of responsible molecules within green cladodes. The spectroscopic analysis of the extract shows a significative red emission, suggesting an abundance of chlorophylls in the sample. Such molecules show pronounced fluorescence in the visible range (400-800 nm) with a very large Stokes shift, when excited with UV light source. The fluorescence profiling is performed also in the case of polymers, such as poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), enriched with OFI extract with a signal improvement up to 40 times greater than the extract alone. This by-product fluorescent molecule can replace commercial dyes into several applications spanning from nano-optics to anti-counterfeiting and bioimaging.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Design of High Pressure Hydride Superconductors using DFT and Deep Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12694v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The observation of superconductivity in hydride-based materials under ultrahigh pressures (for example, H$_3$S and LaH$_{10}$) has fueled the interest in a more data-driven approach to discovering new high-pressure hydride superconductors. In this work, we performed density functional theory (DFT) calculations to predict the critical temperature ($T_c$) of over 900 hydride materials under a pressure range of (0 to 500) GPa, where we found 122 dynamically stable structures with a $T_c$ above MgB$_2$ (39 K). To accelerate screening, we trained a graph neural network (GNN) model to predict $T_c$ and demonstrated that a universal machine learned force-field can be used to relax hydride structures under arbitrary pressures, with significantly reduced cost. By combining DFT and GNNs, we can establish a more complete map of hydrides under pressure.</description>

      <title>Elastic Softening in Synthetic Diamonds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03377v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study reveals a novel phenomenon demonstrating the elastic softening of synthetic diamonds when cooled to very low temperatures below 1 K. We present the results of ultrasonic measurements of single-crystalline synthetic diamonds without irradiation, namely type-IIa (colorless) and Ib (yellow) diamonds grown by high-pressure-high-temperature synthesis as well as type-IIa diamond grown by chemical vapor deposition. We observed divergent decreasing of the elastic stiffness constant $C_{44}$ in all samples at low temperatures down to 20 mK. We argue for the existence of electric quadrupolar degrees of freedom with the irreducible representation of T$_2$ in diamond as the origin of this elastic softening and the possible ground state preserves local T$_d$ symmetry down to around absolute zero. Of the ground states of atomic vacancies in diamond proposed thus far, the only relevant one is the positively charged single atomic vacancy V$^+$, which has not been observed in the previous optical measurements in the irradiated diamonds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00755v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological defects, such as Stone-Wales defects and grain boundaries, are common in 2D materials. In this study, we investigate the intricate interplay of topological defects and carbon contamination in hexagonal boron nitride revealing an intriguing class of color centers. We demonstrate that both carbon contamination and strain can stabilize Stone-Wales configurations and give rise to emitters with desirable optical properties in the visible spectral range. Inspired by these results, we further demonstrate that carbon atoms at grain boundaries can resolve energetic B-B and N-N bonds leading to highly favorable atomic structures that may facilitate the accumulation of carbon contamination at the boundaries. Similarly to contaminated Stone-Wales defects, carbon-doped grain boundaries can also give rise to color centers emitting in the visible spectral range with short radiative lifetime and high Debye-Waller factors. Our discoveries shed light on an exciting class of defects and pave the way toward the identification of color centers and single photon emitters in hBN.</description>

Abstract: The formation of plasmons through the collective excitation of charge density has generated intense discussions, offering insights to fundamental sciences and potential applications. While the underlying physical principles have been well-established, the effects of many-body interactions and orbital hybridization on plasmonic dynamics remain understudied. In this work, we present the observation of conventional metallic and correlated plasmons in epitaxial La1-xSrxNiO3 (LSNO) films with varying Sr doping concentrations (x = 0, 0.125, 0.25), unveiling their intriguing evolution. Unlike samples at other doping concentrations, the x = 0.125 intermediate doping sample does not exhibit the correlated plasmons despite showing high optical conductivity. Through a comprehensive experimental investigation using spectroscopic ellipsometry and X-ray absorption spectroscopy, the O2p-Ni3d orbital hybridization for LSNO with a doping concentration of x = 0.125 is found to be significantly enhanced, alongside a considerable weakening of its effective correlation U*. These factors account for the absence of correlated plasmons and the high optical conductivity observed in LSNO (0.125). Our results underscore the profound impact of orbital hybridization on the electronic structure and the formation of plasmon in strongly-correlated systems. This in turn suggest that LSNO could serve as a promising alternative material in optoelectronic devices.</description>

Abstract: CrI3 is a layered ferromagnetic insulator that has recently attracted enormous interest as it was the first example of a stand-alone monolayer ferromagnet, paving the way towards the study of two-dimensional magnetic materials and their use as building blocks of hybrid van der Waals layered heterostructures. Here we go one step down in the dimensionality ladder and report the synthesis and characterization of a tubular one-dimensional van der Waals heterostructure where CrI3 nanotubes are encapsulated within multiwall carbon nanotubes, integrating a magnetic insulator and a conductor. By means of the capillary filling of multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNT), we obtained single-wall CrI3 nanotubes with diameters ranging between 2 nm and 10 nm, with an average of 5.3 nm. Using aberration corrected electron microscopy in combination with spectroscopic techniques we confirm the structure and chemical composition of the nanotubes. SQUID measurements, combined with element-specific X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) indicate unequivocally that the Cr atoms in encapsulated CrI3 nanotubes are magnetic with a collective state compatible with a radial magnetization state predicted both by first-principles calculations and a model Hamiltonian. Our results represent a step forward in establishing 1D van der Waals heterostructures as a playground for the exploration of non-collinear magnetic states arising from the interplay between magnetic anisotropy and curvature in tubular geometries.</description>

Abstract: The process of polymer condensation, i.e. the formation of bonds between reactive end-groups, is ubiquitous in both industry and biology. Here we study generic systems undergoing polymer condensation in competition with cyclisation. Using a generalised Smoluchowski theory, molecular dynamics simulations and experiments using DNA and T4 ligase, we find that this system displays a transition, from a regime with finite-length chains at infinite time and dominated by rings to one dominated by linear polymers that grow in time. Finally, we show that fluids prepared close to the transition may have profoundly different compositions and rheology at large condensation times.</description>

      <title>Antisymmetric Planar Hall Effect in Rutile Oxide Films Induced by the Lorentz Force</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.06651v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The conventional Hall effect is linearly proportional to the field component or magnetization component perpendicular to a film. Despite the increasing theoretical proposals on the Hall effect to the in-plane field or magnetization in various special systems induced by the Berry curvature, such an unconventional Hall effect has only been experimentally reported in Weyl semimetals and in a heterodimensional superlattice. Here, we report an unambiguous experimental observation of the antisymmetric planar Hall effect (APHE) with respect to the in-plane magnetic field in centrosymmetric rutile RuO2 and IrO2 single-crystal films. The measured Hall resistivity is found to be linearly proportional to the component of the applied in-plane magnetic field along a particular crystal axis and to be independent of the current direction or temperature. Both the experimental observations and theoretical calculations confirm that the APHE in rutile oxide films is induced by the Lorentz force. Our findings can be generalized to ferromagnetic materials for the discovery of anomalous Hall effects and quantum anomalous Hall effects induced by in-plane magnetization. In addition to significantly expanding knowledge of the Hall effect, this work opens the door to explore new members in the Hall effect family.</description>

      <title>Fermi Surface Nesting with Heavy Quasiparticles in the Locally Noncentrosymmetric Superconductor CeRh$_2$As$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06732v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The locally noncentrosymmetric heavy fermion superconductor CeRh$_2$As$_2$ has attracted considerable interests due to its rich superconducting phases, accompanied by a quadrupole density wave and pronounced antiferromagnetic excitations. To understand the underlying physics, we here report measurements from high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission. Our results reveal fine splittings of the conduction bands related to the locally noncentrosymmetric structure, as well as a quasi-two-dimensional Fermi surface (FS) with strong $4f$ contributions. The FS exhibits nesting with an in-plane vector $({\pi}/a, {\pi}/a)$, which is facilitated by the van Hove singularity near $\bar X$ that arises from the characteristic conduction-$f$ hybridization. The FS nesting provides a natural explanation for the observed antiferromagnetic excitations at $({\pi}/a, {\pi}/a)$, which could be intimately connected to its unconventional superconductivity. Our experimental results are well supported by density functional theory plus dynamical mean field theory calculations, which can capture the strong correlation effects. Our study not only provides spectroscopic proof of the key factors underlying the field-induced superconducting transition, but also uncovers the critical role of FS nesting and lattice Kondo effect in the intertwined spin and charge fluctuations.</description>

Abstract: We comment on the recent paper ``Floquet non-Abelian topological insulator and multifold bulk-edge correspondence" by Tianyu Li and Haiping Hu, Nat. Comm. {\bf 14}, 6418 (2023). Apart from the fact that the authors unjustly imply to study multi-gap topology in Floquet systems for the first time, only known homotopic relations are presented. While such insights are used to present interesting Floquet phenomena and phases, which is an attractive result in itself, they cannot be used to deduce the total bulk characterization in the dynamical context without further proof. In fact, the authors essentially rephrase a Zak phase description. These results should in particular be contrasted to earlier results, arXiv:2208.12824, in which static-compatible Zak phases {\it and} dynamical Dirac strings were shown to be able to {\it distinguish} rather similar non-Abelian Floquet phases in $2+1$ dimensional systems. As a result, the claim of a sharp multifold bulk-edge correspondence cannot be concluded from the given arguments.</description>

      <title>Quantum Geometry Induced Third Order Nonlinear Transport Responses</title>

Abstract: Nonlinear transport phenomena offer an exciting probe into the band geometry and symmetry properties of a system. While most studies on nonlinear transport have looked at second-order nonreciprocal responses in noncentrosymmetric systems, the reciprocal third-order effects dominant in centrosymmetric systems remain largely uncharted. Here, we uncover two significant contributions to third-order charge conductivity: one affecting longitudinal resistance and another impacting the Hall effect. We demonstrate that these previously unexplored contributions arise in time-reversal symmetry-broken systems from band geometric quantities such as the Berry curvature and the symplectic connection. We prescribe a detailed symmetry dictionary to facilitate the discovery of these fundamental transport coefficients. Additionally, we unify our quantum kinetic results with the semiclassical wave-packet formalism to unveil all contributions to third-order charge transport. We illustrate our results in antiferromagnetic monolayer SrMnBi$_2$. Our comprehensive study significantly advances the fundamental understanding of reciprocal nonlinear responses.</description>

      <title>Rheology of bidisperse non-Brownian suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05696v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the rheology of bidisperse non-Brownian suspensions using particle-based simulation, mapping the viscosity as a function of the size ratio of the species, their relative abundance, and the overall solid content. The variation of the viscosity with applied stress exhibits shear thickening phenomenology irrespective of composition, though the stress-dependent limiting solids fraction governing the viscosity and its divergence point are non-monotonic in the mixing ratio. Contact force data demonstrate an asymmetric exchange in dominant stress contribution from large-large to small-small particle contacts as the mixing ratio of the species evolves. Combining a prior model for shear thickening with one for composition-dependent jamming, we obtain a full description of the rheology of bidisperse non-Brownian suspensions capable of predicting effects such as the viscosity reduction observed upon adding small particle fines to a suspension of large particles.</description>

      <title>LLaMP: Large Language Model Made Powerful for High-fidelity Materials Knowledge Retrieval and Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17244v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reducing hallucination of Large Language Models (LLMs) is imperative for use in the sciences, where reliability and reproducibility are crucial. However, LLMs inherently lack long-term memory, making it a nontrivial, ad hoc, and inevitably biased task to fine-tune them on domain-specific literature and data. Here we introduce LLaMP, a multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework of hierarchical reasoning-and-acting (ReAct) agents that can dynamically and recursively interact with computational and experimental data on Materials Project (MP) and run atomistic simulations via high-throughput workflow interface. Without fine-tuning, LLaMP demonstrates strong tool usage ability to comprehend and integrate various modalities of materials science concepts, fetch relevant data stores on the fly, process higher-order data (such as crystal structure and elastic tensor), and streamline complex tasks in computational materials and chemistry. We propose a simple metric combining uncertainty and confidence estimates to evaluate the self-consistency of responses by LLaMP and vanilla LLMs. Our benchmark shows that LLaMP effectively mitigates the intrinsic bias in LLMs, counteracting the errors on bulk moduli, electronic bandgaps, and formation energies that seem to derive from mixed data sources. We also demonstrate LLaMP's capability to edit crystal structures and run annealing molecular dynamics simulations using pre-trained machine-learning force fields. The framework offers an intuitive and nearly hallucination-free approach to exploring and scaling materials informatics, and establishes a pathway for knowledge distillation and fine-tuning other language models.

      <title>AlN Nanowire Based Vertically Integrated Piezoelectric Nanogenerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09771v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, detailed analysis of the direct piezo-response of AlN nanowire-based vertically integrated nanogenerators (VINGs) is undertaken as a function of mechanical excitation frequency. We show that the piezo-charge, piezo-voltage, and impedance measured at the same position of the devices can be directly correlated through an equivalent circuit model, in the whole frequency range of investigation. Our presented results are utilized to determine the performance figures of merit (FoM) of nanowire-based VINGs, namely the piezoelectric voltage constant (g) for sensing, and the product d g for energy harvesting, where d is the piezoelectric charge constant. By comparison of these metrics with those of freestanding single crystal GaN and quartz substrates, as well as sputtered AlN thin films, we suggest that the nanowires can outperform their rigid counterparts in terms of mechanical sensing and energy generation. This work provides experimental guidelines for understanding the direct piezo-characteristics of VINGs and facilitates a quantitative comparison between nanostructured piezoelectric devices fabricated using different materials or architectures.</description>

      <title>Laser Printing of Silver and Silver Oxide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09340v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that direct laser writing (DLW) in aqueous silver nitrate with a 1030 nm femtosecond (fs) laser results in deposition of a mixture of silver oxide and silver, in contrast to the pure silver deposition previously reported with 780 nm fs DLW. However, adding photoinitiator prevents silver oxide formation in a concentration-dependent manner. As a result, the resistivity of the material can also be controlled by photoinitiator concentration with resistivity being reduced from approximately 9e-3 $\Omega m$ to 3e-7 $\Omega m$. Silver oxide peaks dominate the X-ray diffraction spectra when no photoinitiator is present, while the peaks disappear with photoinitiator concentrations above 0.05wt%. While femtosecond pulses are needed to initiate deposition, a continues-wave laser when well overlapped with the previously written material and supplying enough average power can lead to further printing, suggesting thermal deposition can also occur where the photoinitiator molecule also acts as a general reducing agent that prevents oxide formation. We also compare the surface quality of printed lines for different photoinitiator concentrations and laser printing conditions. A THz polarizer and metamaterial are printed as a demonstration of silver oxide printing.</description>

      <title>Ferri-ionic Coupling in CuInP$_2$S$_6$ Nanoflakes: Polarization States and Controllable Negative Capacitance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14368v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider nanoflakes of van der Waals ferrielectric CuInP$_2$S$_6$ covered by an ionic surface charge and reveal the appearance of polar states with relatively high polarization ~5 microC/cm$^2$ and stored free charge ~10 microC/cm$%2$, which can mimic "mid-gap" states related with a surface field-induced transfer of Cu and/or In ions in the van der Waals gap. The change in the ionic screening degree and mismatch strains induce a broad range of the transitions between paraelectric phase, antiferroelectric, ferrielectric, and ferri-ionic states in CuInP$_2$S$_6$ nanoflakes. The states' stability and/or metastability is determined by the minimum of the system free energy consisting of electrostatic energy, elastic energy, and a Landau-type four-well potential of the ferrielectric dipole polarization. The possibility to govern the transitions by strain and ionic screening can be useful for controlling the tunneling barrier in thin film devices based on CuInP$_2$S$_6$ nanoflakes. Also, we predict that the CuInP$_2$S$_6$ nanoflakes reveal features of the controllable negative capacitance effect, which make them attractive for advanced electronic devices, such as nano-capacitors and gate oxide nanomaterials with reduced heat dissipation.</description>

      <title>Cephalo: Multi-Modal Vision-Language Models for Bio-Inspired Materials Analysis and Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Cephalo, a series of multimodal vision large language models (V-LLMs) designed for materials science applications, integrating visual and linguistic data for enhanced understanding and interaction within human-AI and multi-agent AI frameworks. A key innovation of Cephalo is its advanced dataset generation method, which employs a sophisticated algorithm to accurately detect and separate images and their corresponding textual descriptions from PDF documents, such as scientific papers. The method includes a careful refinement of image-text pairs through integrated vision and language processing, ensuring high-quality, contextually relevant, and well reasoned training data. Cephalo is trained on integrated image and text data extracted from thousands of scientific papers and science-focused Wikipedia pages demonstrates can interpret complex visual scenes, generate precise language descriptions, and answer queries about images effectively. The combination of a vision encoder with an autoregressive transformer supports complex natural language understanding in an integrated model, which can be coupled with other generative methods to create an image-to-text-to-image or image-to-text-to-3D pipeline. To explore the development of larger models from smaller ones, we report both mixture-of-expert methods and model merging. These hybrid approaches allow us to leverage the domain-specific expertise and general conversational capabilities to harness the strengths of multiple models. We examine the models in diverse use cases that incorporate biological materials, fracture and engineering analysis, protein biophysics, and bio-inspired design based on insect behavior. Generative applications include bio-inspired designs, including pollen-inspired architected materials, as well as the synthesis of bio-inspired material microstructures from a photograph of a solar eclipse.</description>
