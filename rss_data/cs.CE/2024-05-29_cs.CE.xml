      <title>DeepOKAN: Deep Operator Network Based on Kolmogorov Arnold Networks for Mechanics Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The modern digital engineering design often requires costly repeated simulations for different scenarios. The prediction capability of neural networks (NNs) makes them suitable surrogates for providing design insights. However, only a few NNs can efficiently handle complex engineering scenario predictions. We introduce a new version of the neural operators called DeepOKAN, which utilizes Kolmogorov Arnold networks (KANs) rather than the conventional neural network architectures. Our DeepOKAN uses Gaussian radial basis functions (RBFs) rather than the B-splines. The DeepOKAN is used to develop surrogates for different mechanics problems. This approach should pave the way for further improving the performance of neural operators. Based on the current investigations, we observe that DeepOKANs require a smaller number of learnable parameters than current MLP-based DeepONets to achieve comparable accuracy.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Feedback of AI Price Estimations on Actual Market Values</title>

Abstract: Public availability of Artificial Intelligence generated information can change the markets forever, and its factoring into economical dynamics may take economists by surprise, out-dating models and schools of thought. Real estate hyper-inflation is not a new phenomenon but its consistent and almost monotonous persistence over 12 years, coinciding with prominence of public estimation information from Zillow, a successful Mass Real Estate Estimator (MREE), could not escape unobserved. What we model is a repetitive theoretical game between the MREE and the home owners, where each player has secret information and expertise. If the intention is to keep housing affordable and maintain old American lifestyle with broad home-ownership, new challenges are defined. Simulations show that a simple restriction of MREE-style price estimation availability to opt-in properties may help partially reduce feedback loop by acting on its likely causes, as suggested by experimental simulation models. The conjecture that the MREE pressure on real estate inflation rate is correlated with the absolute MREE estimation errors, which is logically explainable, is then validated in simulations.</description>

      <title>Comparing Lazy Constraint Selection Strategies in Train Routing with Moving Block Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Railroad transportation plays a vital role in the future of sustainable mobility. Besides building new infrastructure, capacity can be improved by modern train control systems, e.g., based on moving blocks. At the same time, there is only limited work on how to optimally route trains using the potential gained by these systems. Recently, an initial approach for train routing with moving block control has been proposed to address this demand. However, detailed evaluations on so-called lazy constraints are missing, and no publicly available implementation exists. In this work, we close this gap by providing an extended approach as well as a flexible open-source implementation that can use different solving strategies. Using that, we experimentally evaluate what choices should be made when implementing a lazy constraint approach. The corresponding implementation and benchmarks are publicly available as part of the Munich Train Control Toolkit (MTCT) at https://github.com/cda-tum/mtct.</description>

      <title>A novel mesh regularization approach based on finite element distortion potentials: Application to material expansion processes with extreme volume change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.07582v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The accuracy of finite element solutions is closely tied to the mesh quality. In particular, geometrically nonlinear problems involving large and strongly localized deformations often result in prohibitively large element distortions. In this work, we propose a novel mesh regularization approach allowing to restore a non-distorted high-quality mesh in an adaptive manner without the need for expensive re-meshing procedures. The core idea of this approach lies in the definition of a finite element distortion potential considering contributions from different distortion modes such as skewness and aspect ratio of the elements. The regularized mesh is found by minimization of this potential. Moreover, based on the concept of spatial localization functions, the method allows to specify tailored requirements on mesh resolution and quality for regions with strongly localized mechanical deformation and mesh distortion. In addition, while existing mesh regularization schemes often keep the boundary nodes of the discretization fixed, we propose a mesh-sliding algorithm based on variationally consistent mortar methods allowing for an unrestricted tangential motion of nodes along the problem boundary. Especially for problems involving significant surface deformation (e.g., frictional contact), this approach allows for an improved mesh relaxation as compared to schemes with fixed boundary nodes. To transfer data such as tensor-valued history variables of the material model from the old (distorted) to the new (regularized) mesh, a structure-preserving invariant interpolation scheme for second-order tensors is employed, which has been proposed in our previous work and is designed to preserve important mechanical properties of tensor-valued data such as objectivity and positive definiteness... {continued see pdf}</description>

      <title>GPLaSDI: Gaussian Process-based Interpretable Latent Space Dynamics Identification through Deep Autoencoder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05882v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerically solving partial differential equations (PDEs) can be challenging and computationally expensive. This has led to the development of reduced-order models (ROMs) that are accurate but faster than full order models (FOMs). Recently, machine learning advances have enabled the creation of non-linear projection methods, such as Latent Space Dynamics Identification (LaSDI). LaSDI maps full-order PDE solutions to a latent space using autoencoders and learns the system of ODEs governing the latent space dynamics. By interpolating and solving the ODE system in the reduced latent space, fast and accurate ROM predictions can be made by feeding the predicted latent space dynamics into the decoder. In this paper, we introduce GPLaSDI, a novel LaSDI-based framework that relies on Gaussian process (GP) for latent space ODE interpolations. Using GPs offers two significant advantages. First, it enables the quantification of uncertainty over the ROM predictions. Second, leveraging this prediction uncertainty allows for efficient adaptive training through a greedy selection of additional training data points. This approach does not require prior knowledge of the underlying PDEs. Consequently, GPLaSDI is inherently non-intrusive and can be applied to problems without a known PDE or its residual. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the Burgers equation, Vlasov equation for plasma physics, and a rising thermal bubble problem. Our proposed method achieves between 200 and 100,000 times speed-up, with up to 7% relative error.</description>

      <title>Parameter identification and uncertainty propagation of hydrogel coupled diffusion-deformation using POD-based reduced-order modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08968v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores reduced-order modeling for analyzing the time-dependent diffusion-deformation of hydrogels. The full-order model describing hydrogel transient behavior consists of a coupled system of partial differential equations in which chemical potential and displacements are coupled. This system is formulated in a monolithic fashion and solved using the finite element method. We employ proper orthogonal decomposition as a model order reduction approach. The reduced-order model performance is tested through a benchmark problem on hydrogel swelling and a case study simulating co-axial printing. Then, we embed the reduced-order model into an optimization loop to efficiently identify the coupled problem's material parameters using full-field data. Finally, a study is conducted on the uncertainty propagation of the material parameter.</description>

      <title>Physics-based material parameters extraction from perovskite experiments via Bayesian optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11101v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability to extract material parameters of perovskite from quantitative experimental analysis is essential for rational design of photovoltaic and optoelectronic applications. However, the difficulty of this analysis increases significantly with the complexity of the theoretical model and the number of material parameters for perovskite. Here we use Bayesian optimization to develop an analysis platform that can extract up to 8 fundamental material parameters of an organometallic perovskite semiconductor from a transient photoluminescence experiment, based on a complex full physics model that includes drift-diffusion of carriers and dynamic defect occupation. An example study of thermal degradation reveals that the carrier mobility and trap-assisted recombination coefficient are reduced noticeably, while the defect energy level remains nearly unchanged. The reduced carrier mobility can dominate the overall effect on thermal degradation of perovskite solar cells by reducing the fill factor, despite the opposite effect of the reduced trap-assisted recombination coefficient on increasing the fill factor. In future, this platform can be conveniently applied to other experiments or to combinations of experiments, accelerating materials discovery and optimization of semiconductor materials for photovoltaics and other applications.</description>
