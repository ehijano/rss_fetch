      <title>ZapGPT: Free-form Language Prompting for Simulated Cellular Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human language is one of the most expressive tools for conveying intent, yet most artificial or biological systems lack mechanisms to interpret or respond meaningfully to it. Bridging this gap could enable more natural forms of control over complex, decentralized systems. In AI and artificial life, recent work explores how language can specify high-level goals, but most systems still depend on engineered rewards, task-specific supervision, or rigid command sets, limiting generalization to novel instructions. Similar constraints apply in synthetic biology and bioengineering, where the locus of control is often genomic rather than environmental perturbation.
  A key open question is whether artificial or biological collectives can be guided by free-form natural language alone, without task-specific tuning or carefully designed evaluation metrics. We provide one possible answer here by showing, for the first time, that simple agents' collective behavior can be guided by free-form language prompts: one AI model transforms an imperative prompt into an intervention that is applied to simulated cells; a second AI model scores how well the prompt describes the resulting cellular dynamics; and the former AI model is evolved to improve the scores generated by the latter.
  Unlike previous work, our method does not require engineered fitness functions or domain-specific prompt design. We show that the evolved system generalizes to unseen prompts without retraining. By treating natural language as a control layer, the system suggests a future in which spoken or written prompts could direct computational, robotic, or biological systems to desired behaviors. This work provides a concrete step toward this vision of AI-biology partnerships, in which language replaces mathematical objective functions, fixed rules, and domain-specific programming.</description>

      <title>Introduction to a Low-Cost AI-Powered GUI for Unstained Cell Culture Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article presents a novel microscopy image analysis framework designed for low-budget labs equipped with a standard CPU desktop. The Python-based program enables cytometric analysis of live, unstained cells in culture through an advanced computer vision and machine learning pipeline. Crucially, the framework operates on label-free data, requiring no manually annotated training data or training phase. It is accessible via a user-friendly, cross-platform GUI that requires no programming skills, while also providing a scripting interface for programmatic control and integration by developers. The end-to-end workflow performs semantic and instance segmentation, feature extraction, analysis, evaluation, and automated report generation. Its modular architecture supports easy maintenance and flexible integration while supporting both single-image and batch processing. Validated on several unstained cell types from the public dataset of livecells, the framework demonstrates superior accuracy and reproducibility compared to contemporary tools like Cellpose and StarDist. Its competitive segmentation speed on a CPU-based platform highlights its significant potential for basic research and clinical applications -- particularly in cell transplantation for personalized medicine and muscle regeneration therapies.</description>

      <title>Bistability of travelling waves and wave-pinning states in a mass-conserved reaction-diffusion system: From bifurcations to implications for actin waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12213</link>

Abstract: Eukaryotic cells demonstrate a wide variety of dynamic patterns of filamentous actin (F-actin) and its regulators. Some of these patterns play important roles in cell functions, such as distinct motility modes, which motivate this study. We devise a mass-conserved reaction-diffusion model for active and inactive Rho-GTPase and F-actin in the cell cortex. The mass-conserved Rho-GTPase system promotes F-actin, which feeds back to inactivate the former. We study the model on a 1D periodic domain (edge of thin sheet-like cell) using bifurcation theory in the framework of spatial dynamics, complemented with numerical simulations. Among several discussed bifurcations, the analysis centers on the study of the codimension-2 long wavelength and finite wavenumber Hopf instability, in which we describe a rich structure of steady wave-pinning states (a.k.a. mesas, obeying the Maxwell construction), propagating coherent solutions (fronts and excitable pulses), and travelling and standing waves, all distinguished by mass conservation regimes and classified by domain sizes. Specifically, we highlight the unexpected conditions for bistability between steady wave-pinning and travelling wave states on moderate domain sizes. These results uncover and exemplify possible mechanisms of coexistence, robustness, and transitions between distinct cellular motility modes, including directed migration, turning, and ruffling. More broadly, the results indicate that dissipative reaction-diffusion models comprising mass conservation have distinct pattern formation mechanisms that motivate further investigations, such as the unfolding of codimension-3 instabilities and T-points.</description>
