      <title>A Deep Dive into Function Inlining and its Security Implications for ML-based Binary Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A function inlining optimization is a widely used transformation in modern compilers, which replaces a call site with the callee's body in need. While this transformation improves performance, it significantly impacts static features such as machine instructions and control flow graphs, which are crucial to binary analysis. Yet, despite its broad impact, the security impact of function inlining remains underexplored to date. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of function inlining through the lens of machine learning-based binary analysis. To this end, we dissect the inlining decision pipeline within the LLVM's cost model and explore the combinations of the compiler options that aggressively promote the function inlining ratio beyond standard optimization levels, which we term extreme inlining. We focus on five ML-assisted binary analysis tasks for security, using 20 unique models to systematically evaluate their robustness under extreme inlining scenarios. Our extensive experiments reveal several significant findings: i) function inlining, though a benign transformation in intent, can (in)directly affect ML model behaviors, being potentially exploited by evading discriminative or generative ML models; ii) ML models relying on static features can be highly sensitive to inlining; iii) subtle compiler settings can be leveraged to deliberately craft evasive binary variants; and iv) inlining ratios vary substantially across applications and build configurations, undermining assumptions of consistency in training and evaluation of ML models.</description>

      <title>The Impact Market to Save Conference Peer Review: Decoupling Dissemination and Credentialing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Top-tier academic conferences are failing under the strain of two irreconcilable roles: (1) rapid dissemination of all sound research and (2) scarce credentialing for prestige and career advancement. This conflict has created a reviewer roulette and anonymous tribunal model - a zero-cost attack system - characterized by high-stakes subjectivity, turf wars, and the arbitrary rejection of sound research (the equivalence class problem). We propose the Impact Market (IM), a novel three-phase system that decouples publication from prestige. Phase 1 (Publication): All sound and rigorous papers are accepted via a PC review, solving the "equivalence class" problem. Phase 2 (Investment): An immediate, scarce prestige signal is created via a futures market. Senior community members invest tokens into published papers, creating a transparent, crowdsourced Net Invested Score (NIS). Phase 3 (Calibration): A 3-year lookback mechanism validates these investments against a manipulation-resistant Multi-Vector Impact Score (MVIS). This MVIS adjusts each investor's future influence (their Investor Rating), imposing a quantifiable cost on bad actors and rewarding accurate speculation. The IM model replaces a hidden, zero-cost attack system with a transparent, accountable, and data-driven market that aligns immediate credentialing with long-term, validated impact. Agent-based simulations demonstrate that while a passive market matches current protocols in low-skill environments, introducing investor agency and conviction betting increases the retrieval of high-impact papers from 28% to over 85% under identical conditions, confirming that incentivized self-selection is the mechanism required to scale peer review.</description>

      <title>The Functional Machine Calculus III: Control</title>

Abstract: The Functional Machine Calculus (Heijltjes 2022) is a new approach to unifying the imperative and functional programming paradigms. It extends the lambda-calculus, preserving the key features of confluent reduction and typed termination, to embed computational effects, evaluation strategies, and control flow operations. The first instalment modelled sequential higher-order computation with global store, input/output, probabilities, and non-determinism, and embedded both the call-by-name and call-by-value lambda-calculus, as well as Moggi's computational metalanguage and Levy's call-by-push-value. The present paper extends the calculus from sequential to branching and looping control flow. This allows the faithful embedding of a minimal but complete imperative language, including conditionals, exception handling, and iteration, as well as constants and algebraic data types.
  The calculus is defined through a simple operational semantics, extending the (simplified) Krivine machine for the lambda-calculus with multiple operand stacks to model effects and a continuation stack to model sequential, branching, and looping computation. It features a confluent reduction relation and a system of simple types that guarantees termination of the machine and strong normalization of reduction (in the absence of iteration). These properties carry over to the embedded imperative language, providing a unified functional-imperative model of computation that supports simple types, a direct and intuitive operational semantics, and a confluent reduction semantics.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Universes in Homotopy Type Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19176v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Awodey, later with Newstead, showed how polynomial functors with extra structure (termed ``natural models'') hold within them the categorical semantics for dependent type theory. Their work presented these ideas clearly but ultimately led them outside of the usual category of polynomial functors to a particular \emph{tricategory} of polynomials in order to explain all of the structure possessed by such models. This paper builds off that work -- explicating the categorical semantics of dependent type theory by axiomatizing them entirely in terms of the usual category of polynomial functors. In order to handle the higher-categorical coherences required for such an explanation, we work with polynomial functors in the language of Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT), which allows for higher-dimensional structures to be expressed purely within this category. The move to HoTT moreover enables us to express a key additional condition on polynomial functors -- \emph{univalence} -- which is sufficient to guarantee that models of type theory expressed as univalent polynomials satisfy all higher coherences of their corresponding algebraic structures, purely in virtue of being closed under the usual constructors of dependent type theory. We call polynomial functors satisfying this condition \emph{polynomial universes}. As an example of the simplification to the theory of natural models this enables, we highlight the fact that a polynomial universe being closed under dependent product types implies the existence of a distributive law of monads, which witnesses the usual distributivity of dependent products over dependent sums.</description>

      <title>Cyclic Proofs in Hoare Logic and its Reverse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14283v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the relationships between axiomatic and cyclic proof systems for the partial and total versions of Hoare logic and those of its dual, known as reverse Hoare logic (or sometimes incorrectness logic). In the axiomatic proof systems for these logics, the proof rules for looping constructs involve an explicit loop invariant, which in the case of the total versions additionally require a well-founded termination measure. In the cyclic systems, these are replaced by rules that simply unroll the loops, together with a principle allowing the formation of cycles in the proof, subject to a global soundness condition that ensures the well-foundedness of the circular reasoning. Interestingly, the cyclic soundness conditions for partial Hoare logic and its reverse are similar and essentially coinductive in character, while those for the total versions are also similar and essentially inductive. We show that these cyclic systems are sound, by direct argument, and relatively complete, by translation from axiomatic to cyclic proofs.</description>

      <title>Strong Dinatural Transformations and Generalised Codensity Monads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06777v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce dicodensity monads: a generalisation of pointwise codensity monads generated by functors to monads generated by mixed-variant bifunctors. Our construction is based on the notion of strong dinaturality (also known as Barr dinaturality), and is inspired by denotational models of certain types in polymorphic lambda calculi - in particular, a form of continuation monads with universally quantified variables, such as the Church encoding of the list monad in System F. Extending some previous results on Cayley-style representations, we provide a set of sufficient conditions to establish an isomorphism between a monad and the dicodensity monad for a given bifunctor. Then, we focus on the class of monads obtained by instantiating our construction with hom-functors and, more generally, bifunctors given by objects of homomorphisms (that is, internalised hom-sets between Eilenberg--Moore algebras). This gives us, for example, novel presentations of monads generated by different kinds of semirings and other theories used to model ordered nondeterministic computations.</description>
