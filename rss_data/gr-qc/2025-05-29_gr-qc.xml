      <title>Phase space analysis of cosmological models on $f(R,G,T)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present article, we developed a dynamical system in the context of modified $f(R,G,T)$ gravity, where $R$, $G$ and $T$ are Ricci scalar, Gauss-Bonnet term and energy-momentum tensor respectively. Development of the dynamical system is done by first defining 9 dimensionless variables and formulate a ordinary differential equations by taking derivative of the variables with respect to logarithmic time $N=\log a(t)$, where $a(t)$ is the scale factor. This formulation is applied to the model $f(R,G,T)=\alpha R^{l}+\beta G^{m} + \gamma T^{n} $, and its solutions and their corresponding stabilities are analysed in details. From the plot of density parameters vs $N=-log(1+z)$, we conclude that our Universe is currently dominated by dark energy, which is compatible with current observation. Taking $l=2$, cosmic parameters such as deceleration parameter $(q)$, equation of state $(\omega)$ and state finder parameters are also discussed by fixing one dimensionless variable, showing our Universe's expansion is accelerating with the present value of $q=-0.5$. Present value of $\omega=-0.66$ suggests that our Universe is in Quintessence phase. Lastly, the validity of the model with respect to the $\Lambda$CDM model is checked by using 77 Hubble, 15 BAO and 1024 pantheon datasets, which implies that our model is aligned with the $\Lambda$CDM model's bahaviour.</description>

      <title>Correspondence between particle creation and dark components interaction in the context of $f(\mathcal{G})$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the particle creation scenario in the context of $f(\mathcal{G})$ gravity in flat-FLRW metric. For this purpose, from the perspective of thermodynamics and considering an adiabatic universe, we obtain the modified continuity equation in terms of the dynamic number of particles $N$. On the other hand, we obtain Friedmann's equations in $f(\mathcal{G})$ gravity and then write down the continuity equations of the components of matter and dark energy, taking into account the interaction between them. In what follows, by establishing a correspondence between the particle production scenario and $f(\mathcal{G})$ gravity, we obtain the cosmological parameters in terms of $N$. After that, we find cosmological solutions using power-law cosmology and compare them with Hubble parameter data. Finally, we fit the current model with Hubble data and plot the best fit in terms of the redshift parameter.</description>

      <title>On the Probability of the Initial Conditions for Inflation and Slow Contraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some recent studies based on numerical relativity simulations claim that slow contraction/ekpyrosis is strongly preferred over inflation as the smoothing mechanism that brought the universe into the homogeneous, isotropic and flat state we observe today on large scales. In this paper, we evaluate the likelihood of the initial conditions employed in the aforementioned simulations by estimating the probability that a free scalar field dominating the universe at the beginning of inflation or ekpyrosis will be sufficiently homogeneous on scales comparable to the Hubble radius at that time. We explore the space of parameters that characterize the initial power spectrum of the scalar field, finding that either can be more likely than the other for a fixed choice of parameters. On the other hand, when we extremize over these parameters, we find that the maximal probability for inflation is much higher than that of ekpyrosis.</description>

      <title>Probing the existence of a minimal length through compact binary inspiral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existence of a minimal length in spacetime geometries avoids several singular situations involving quantum theory and gravity. In this work, we show that the existence of such a minimal length also affects the gravitational wave (GW) waveform of any inspiraling binary black hole (BH) system by introducing a minimum frequency, below which the BHs behave as perfectly reflecting compact objects, while above they are identical to classical BHs. This leads to a significant imprint on the tidal heating term, appearing in the GW waveform at 2.5 post Newtonian order. Based on these modifications to the inspiraling waveform, it turns out that the detection of highly spinning and highly absorbing, almost classical BH like compact objects, inspiraling around each other, would be in tension with the quantum properties of BH geometries. The same would also be true if the zero point length exceeds the Planck length by a significant amount, suggesting that the zero point length, if it exists, must be of the same order as the Planck length, or smaller, purely from GW observations.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Correlation of Spacetime Fluctuations in Laser Interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spacetime fluctuations (SFs), a common feature of different proposed gravity models, could be detected using laser interferometers. In the search for SFs, a correspondence between the expected output signals and different gravity models is needed, both for guiding the design of future interferometers, and for identifying the signal in experimental data. In this work, we provide such a correspondence for some classes of SFs and geometries of the interferometers. We consider three different classes of SFs, characterised by the decay behaviours and symmetries of their two-point correlation functions. Our approach applies to Michelson laser interferometers with Fabry-P\'erot arm cavities such as the km-long LIGO detectors and those without arm cavities such as the laboratory-scale setups QUEST and GQuEST. Analysing the expected interferometer output signals, we identify three characteristic signatures for each class of SF. The designed broadband sensitivity of the laboratory-scale instruments would allow all characteristic signatures of the different classes of SFs to be observed, and such observations could provide more information on the nature of the SFs than those from LIGO. On the other hand, we find that LIGO is better suited for detecting the bare presence or absence of SFs.</description>

      <title>Bounds on the minimum orbital periods of non-singular Hayward and Bardeen black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on previous studies, universal bounds $4\pi M \leqslant T_{min} \leqslant 6\sqrt{3}\pi M$ were conjectured to be characteristic properties of black hole spacetimes, where $M$ represents the mass of black holes and $T_{min}$ is the minimum orbital periods around black holes. In this work, we explore the minimum orbital periods of objects around Hayward and Bardeen black holes without central singularities. By combining analytical and numerical methods, we show that both Hayward and Bardeen black holes conform to these bounds. Our results imply that such bounds may be connected to the presence of the black hole horizon rather than the singularity.</description>

      <title>Taub-NUT-like Black Holes in Einstein-Bumblebee Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider Einstein-Bumblebee gravity and construct a novel Taub-NUT-like black hole solution within this theory. Different from the Taub-NUT black hole in Einstein gravity (which is Ricci-flat), our newly constructed Taub-NUT-like black hole is not Ricci-flat. Armed with the Wald formalism, we extensively study the thermodynamics of this black hole solution and confirm that both the first law of thermodynamics and the Smarr relation hold. We then take a further step by adding a cosmological constant to the Einstein-Bumblebee theory, and successfully construct a Taub-NUT-AdS-like black hole. We derive all the thermodynamic quantities, including treating the cosmological constant as a pressure, and confirm that the first law and Smarr relation hold as well.</description>

      <title>Shadows of naked singularity in Brans-Dicke gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the observational features of exact vacuum solutions in Brans-Dicke (BD) gravity, focusing on their implications for black hole shadow imaging. Motivated by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations, we revisit a class of BD solutions that exhibit a naked singularity. These solutions, despite lacking a conventional event horizon, exhibit photon spheres and produce shadow-like features. We analyze null geodesics and perform ray-tracing simulations under a simplified, optically thin accretion disk model to generate synthetic images. Our results show that BD naked singularities can cast shadows smaller than those of Schwarzschild black holes of equivalent mass. We identify the parameter space $-3/2 &lt; \omega &lt; 0$ as physically viable, ensuring attractive gravity and the absence of ghost fields. These findings suggest that BD naked singularities are possible candidates for compact astrophysical objects.</description>

      <title>Quantum circuit simulation of black hole evaporation and Maxwell demon interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We suggest a quantum circuit model which simulates the black-hole evaporation process. In particular, Almheiri-Marolf-Polchinski-Sully (AMPS) paradox and the ER=EPR correspondence are reconsidered regarding our proposed model, which assumes a Maxwell's demon operating within a black hole interior. In other words, we form a quantum circuit, mimicking the behavior of the entanglement structure of the near-horizon region and the early Hawking radiation located far from the black hole. Furthermore, we indicate how the demon, by applying nonlocal correlations, can mediate via Einstein-Rosen bridges for the purpose of simulating the transfer of quantum information across the horizon without violating the monogamy of entanglement. Finally, the thermodynamic cost of the demon's operations regarding Landauer's principle is analyzed. This indicates that the information erasure has an energy comparable to the black hole entropy.</description>

      <title>Black hole/de Sitter as the fastest transmitter/receiver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent progress on the black hole information paradox has reproduced the Page curve as required by the unitary evolution of the black hole entanglement entropy. In this Letter, we will argue that, the quantum speed limit on how fast a quantum system can evolve unitarily, when saturating the maximal information transmission bounds (Pendry's bound and Bremermann-Bekenstein bound), will slow down the would-be divergent rate of dynamical black hole entropy decreasing at the very end of the Hawking evaporation, during which the Penrose inequality from cosmic censorship conjecture is exactly saturated. Therefore, an evaporating Schwarzschild black hole is the fastest transmitter of information in nature. Further applying the Bremermann-Bekenstein bound on the de Sitter entanglement entropy exactly reproduces the trans-Planckian censorship conjecture, indicating that the would-be-ended inflating de Sitter space is the fastest receiver of information in nature.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of four-dimensional regular black holes with an infinite tower of regularized curvature corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the thermodynamics of a class of four-dimensional black hole solutions arising from the compactification of a higher-curvature gravity theory featuring an infinite tower of Lovelock-type invariants. For planar horizons, we identify two distinct branches: a regular black hole supported by a nontrivial scalar field and a non-regular general relativity (GR) solution with a trivial scalar profile. Despite their differing geometries, both branches share the same free energy at fixed temperature, revealing a thermodynamic degeneracy naturally linked to the enhanced symmetry and scale invariance of the planar base manifold. In the case of a spherical horizon, even if the scalarized branch is not obtained in closed form, one can see that the degeneracy persists in the absence of the quadratic curvature contribution. On the other hand, if this quadratic term is taken into account, the regular solution may be thermodynamically favored (or not) over the Schwarzschild-AdS solution depending on the values of the coupling constants of the theory.</description>

      <title>Structure Scalars for Charged Dissipative Spherical Collapse in $f(R, T)$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the structure scalars formed from the orthogonal splitting of the Riemann tensor of the spacetime metric describing the interior of a charged matter configuration undergoing dissipative collapse in $f(R,T)$ gravity, and how they influence the various physical parameters of the collapsing matter. A treatment is provided for the unspecified $f(R, T)$ function, and the nature of the results for a linear $f(R, T)$ function is presented. In the absence of dissipation, the energy density inhomogeneity is influenced by $X_{TF}$ and the mass function. Further, the presence of charge affects the structure scalars and the total mass-energy content. The dependence of various physical parameters, such as heat dissipation, energy density inhomogeneity, evolution of the expansion scalar, the shear scalar, effective homogeneous energy density, and pressure anisotropy, on the structure scalars has been clearly indicated.</description>

      <title>Boundary terms in cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the derivation of the Einstein field equations via Hamilton's principle, the inclusion of a boundary term is essential to render the variational problem well-posed, as it addresses variations that do not vanish at the boundary of the spacetime manifold. Typically, this term is chosen as the Gibbons-Hawking-York boundary term. In this work, we propose an alternative treatment of the boundary term within a cosmological framework by employing the Lagrange multiplier method. This approach enforces the vanishing of the boundary term throughout the evolution of the Universe, leading to the prediction of a fluid component that decays as the sixth power of the scale factor. This type of fluid has been studied in the context of the early universe under the name of stiff matter, and it can be related to a scalar field known as kination.</description>

      <title>Neutron Stars in Causal Scalar-Tensor Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study static, spherically symmetric neutron stars in a class of scalar-tensor theories with non-canonical kinetic terms (K-essence) obeying all causality and hyperbolicity conditions. These models have non-trivial dynamics that lead to a type of anti-screening of the scalar. They lead to small corrections in the solar system due to a small coupling, but can lead to large corrections in regimes of high densities, especially neutron stars. We solve the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations numerically using realistic equations of state (SLy4, WFF1, MS1, MPA1). For a given central density, we find that two distinct configurations may exist, forming two separate branches of solutions. We find that above a certain critical central density solutions with the correct asymptotic behavior at spatial infinity cannot be obtained. We obtain precise predictions for the mass-radius relation for neutron stars for different values of the parameters in the model and we compare to data.</description>

      <title>The Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background from Primordial Gravitational Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13385v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a scenario of primordial gravitational atoms (PGAs), which may exist in the current and past universe due to spinning primordial black holes (PBHs) and very light bosonic fields. In a monochromatic mass scenario with a sizable dimensionless spin, which may arise in a short matter dominated (MD) era, we analyze the resulting stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) signal. Its spectrum is approximately characterized by a rising $\propto f^3$ followed by a falling $\propto f^{-1}$ where $f$ is the frequency. Then, we investigate the constraints and prospects of such a SGWB, and find that PGAs with a core mass $M_{\rm BH}\sim {\cal O}(10)~M_{\odot}$ and a cloud of light scalar with mass $\mu \sim {\cal O} (10^{-13})$ eV could yield constraints even stronger than those from bare PBHs. Future detectors such as LISA, Taiji and TianQin are able to explore PGAs over a narrow and elongated strap in the $(\mu,M_{\rm BH})$ plane, spanning over 10 orders of magnitude for the maximum spin, $10^{-8}~M_{\odot}\lesssim M_{\rm BH}\lesssim 10^4~M_{\odot}$, $10^{-16}~{\rm eV}\lesssim \mu\lesssim 10^{-3}~\rm eV$. If the PGA is dressed with a vector cloud, the SGWB signal has a much better opportunity to be probed.</description>

      <title>Black hole thermodynamics at 4 derivatives, natural variables and BPS limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Einstein-Maxwell theory in $D \geq 3$ spacetime dimensions including all Lorentz-invariant parity-even four-derivative couplings. Building on the results of arXiv:2312.11610, we consider static, charged, asymptotically flat black hole solutions to first order in the higher-derivative expansion. In $D=4$ and $D=5$, we compute the corrected black hole thermodynamics and compare with the Reall-Santos prescription based on the two-derivative background, highlighting a subtlety when both inner and outer horizons are involved. By introducing natural variables, as in arXiv:2304.07320, we recast the on-shell actions in terms of left- and right-moving chemical potentials, which significantly simplifies the analysis.
  We also compute first-order thermodynamic corrections for the most general rotating black holes in $D=4$ and $D=5$, without modifying the background solutions. We identify a novel BPS-like limit in $D=4$, extending known supergravity results beyond their traditional domain of validity. Finally, in $D=5$, the analysis of BPS and almost BPS limits enables an independent verification of the five-dimensional BPS thermodynamics. We clarify the origin of a discrepancy in the literature concerning higher-derivative supergravity localization, sharpening the tension between direct computations and predictions based on the $D=4$/$D=5$ connection.</description>

      <title>Lorentz Violation with Gravitational Waves: Constraints from NANOGrav and IPTA Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore a theoretical framework in which Lorentz symmetry is explicitly broken by incorporating derivative terms of the extrinsic curvature into the gravitational action. These modifications introduce a scale-dependent damping effect in the propagation of gravitational waves (GWs), governed by a characteristic energy scale denoted as $M_{{LV}}$ . We derive the modified spectral energy density of GWs within this model and confront it with recent observational data from the NANOGrav 15-year dataset and the second data release of the International Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA). Our analysis yields a lower bound on the Lorentz-violating energy scale, finding $M_{{LV}} &gt; 10^{-19}$ GeV at 68\% confidence level. This result significantly improves upon previous constraints derived from LIGO/VIRGO binary merger observations. Our findings demonstrate the potential of pulsar timing arrays to probe fundamental symmetries of spacetime and offer new insights into possible extensions of general relativity.</description>

      <title>The Phase Space of Low-Mass Binary Compact Objects from LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Catalog: Hints on the Chances of Different Formation Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) observations have significantly advanced our understanding of binary compact object (BCO) formation, yet directly linking these observations to specific formation scenarios remains challenging. The BCO phase space provides a robust and data-driven approach to discover the likely formation scenarios of these binaries. In this study, we expand the previously introduced binary black hole phase-space technique to encompass low-mass compact objects (LMCOs), establishing a novel framework to investigate their diverse formation mechanisms. Applying this approach to selected low-mass events $(\lesssim 5 M_\odot)$ from the GWTC-3 catalog and the recently observed GW230529 event, we show for the first time the phase-space demonstration of the LMCOs and find the associated probabilities for different formation scenarios including neutron stars, astrophysical black holes, or primordial black holes. Our analysis includes the astrophysical modelling uncertainties in and how it causes degeneracy between different formation scenarios. In future, with improvements in GW detector sensitivity and with detection of more GW events, the LMCO phase-space framework will significantly strengthen our capacity to associate more likely formation scenarios over the other, thereby refining our understanding of compact object formation for both astrophysical and primordial scenarios, and its evolution across the cosmic redshift.</description>

      <title>An Accurate Modeling of Nano-Hertz Gravitational Wave Signal from Eccentric Supermassive Binary Black Holes: Essential Step Towards a Robust Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) in the nanohertz (nHz) regime, detectable by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs), offers a promising avenue to probe the cosmic population of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). These SMBHBs are expected to retain substantial eccentricity throughout their evolution due to their formation history. In this study, we propose a new modeling scenario of the nHz SGWB by incorporating the eccentricity of SMBHBs into a multi-scale adaptive simulation-based framework. We employ a time-domain eccentric waveform model, \esigmahm{}, to generate realistic gravitational wave (GW) signals from an astrophysical population of SMBHB, including physical effects from sub-parsec scales to Gpc scales. The eccentric inspiraling binary, unlike circular binaries, emits GW signal in multiple frequencies. As a consequence, the SGWB energy density in each frequency bin is not independent; instead, the presence of eccentricity introduces a spectral correlation between different frequencies. We show that these spectral correlations are absent for circular binaries but become increasingly significant for populations with higher eccentricities. Our novel approach can capture this effect and opens up the window towards measuring this with a high signal-to-noise ratio with future observations. This work develops the frontier of nHz signal modeling using eccentricity at small scales and can model realistic nHz signal, which will be essential for robust inference from future observations to shed light on the astrophysical properties of SMBHBs.</description>

Abstract: We examine the idea that our universe began as a baby universe and show that this is feasible in a $U(1)_{B-L}$ extension of the Standard Model with the classically conformal principle. The framework is consistent with current cosmological data and predicts a heavy neutral gauge boson, which could be detected at colliders.</description>

      <title>On the spectra of holographic QFTs on constant curvature manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze linear fluctuations of five-dimensional Einstein-Dilaton theories dual to holographic quantum field theories defined on four-dimensional de Sitter and Anti-de Sitter space-times. We identify the physical propagating scalar and tensor degrees of freedom. For these, we write the linearized bulk field equations as eigenvalue equations. In the dual QFT, the eigenstates correspond to towers of spin-0 and spin-2 particles propagating on $(A)dS_4$ associated to gauge-invariant composite states. Using particular care in treating special ``zero-modes,'' we show in general that, for negative curvature, the particle spectra are always discrete, whereas for positive curvature they always have a continuous component starting at $m^2 = (9/4)\alpha^{-2}$, where $\alpha$ is the $(A)dS_4$ radius. We numerically compute the spectra in a concrete model characterized by a polynomial dilaton bulk potential admitting holographic RG-flow solutions with a UV and IR fixed points. In this case, we find no discrete spectrum and no perturbative instabilities.</description>

      <title>Causality Constraints on Black Hole Thermodynamics in Nonlinear Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study causality constraints on black hole thermodynamics in nonlinear electrodynamics, where the Lagrangian is taken to be an arbitrary function of the electromagnetic field strength tensor. By requiring the absence of superluminal propagation, we show that the mass-to-charge ratio of extremal black holes exhibits a certain monotonicity previously studied in the context of the weak gravity conjecture. Furthermore, under the same condition, we demonstrate that the entropy-to-mass-squared ratio of black holes, which we interpret as an entropy density, decreases monotonically with increasing mass, while keeping the mass-to-charge ratio fixed. This new monotonicity property extends previous studies on the positivity of four-derivative corrections to black hole entropy in the microcanonical ensemble to all orders in nonlinear electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Constraining primordial curvature perturbations with present and future GW detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial scalar curvature perturbations ($\zeta$), typically probed on large cosmological scales via CMB and LSS observations, can be significantly enhanced on smaller scales by various early Universe mechanisms, for instance, non-minimal inflationary models. While decoupled at linear order, scalar and tensor perturbations, i.e., Gravitational Waves (GWs), interact at second order. As a consequence, an enhanced primordial scalar power spectrum $P_\zeta(k)$ can source a sizable stochastic GW background (SGWB). In these proceedings, we briefly review the generation mechanism of such signals, typically referred to as scalar-induced GWs (SIGWs), and discuss the prospects of measuring them with present and future Pulsar Timing Arrays datasets and future GW observatories like the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna LISA.</description>

Abstract: This book is a philosopher's introduction to the idea that our universe is just one of many universes. I present and assess three versions of the idea: one version from philosophy, and two from physics. In short, they are: all the logically possible worlds; all the branches of the quantum state, in an Everettian interpretation of quantum theory; and all the bubbles of inflationary cosmology. For each proposal, I choose one main philosophical question to discuss in depth. They are, respectively: what is a possible world; what is chance; and what is explanation. But before treating these proposals and their associated questions, I set the stage by reviewing physics and philosophy from about 1600 to about 1900; and a final Chapter compares and contrasts the proposals.</description>

Abstract: Bousso and Stanford (BS) argued that the black hole final state proposal leads to acausal effects and ill-defined probabilities for the AMPS experiment. We identify a loophole in their analysis using insights from entanglement wedge reconstruction and replica wormholes. We trace the cause of the BS problems to the misidentification of the physical interior where the second AMPS measurement happens from among the multiple interiors introduced by the first measurement.</description>

Abstract: In this letter, we show that the Semiclassical Einstein's Field Equation can be recovered using the generalized entropy $S_{gen}$. This approach is reminiscent of non-equilibrium thermodynamics. Furthermore, contrary to the entanglement equilibrium approach of deriving the semiclassical Einstein's equation, this approach does not require any such assumptions and still recovers its correct form. Therefore, in a sense, we also show the validity of the semiclassical approximation, a crucial approach for establishing a number of important ideas such as the Hawking effect.</description>

      <title>Analysis of gravitational radiation generated by type D black holes with positive cosmological constant</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The criterion for existence of gravitational radiation at conformal infinity in the presence of a positive cosmological constant is applied to a general family of exact solutions representing generic (pairs of) black holes of algebraic type D. Our analysis shows that only accelerating black holes generate gravitational radiation measurable at infinity. This very satisfactory result confirms the goodness of the criterion. To that end, a new metric form of the family of exact type D black holes is constructed -- including any cosmological constant and a (double-aligned) non-null electromagnetic field -- whose expression is suitable for investigation of the asymptotic structure of this large family of spacetimes. The family depends on seven physical parameters, namely $m$, $a$, $l$, $\alpha$, $e$, $g$, and $\Lambda$ that characterize mass, specific angular momentum parameter, NUT parameter, acceleration, electric and magnetic charges, and the cosmological constant, respectively.</description>

Abstract: In the present article, we have obtained an exact analytical solution of six-dimensional pure Gauss-Bonnet gravity in the presence of both NUT and Maxwell charges. The topology of the horizon is chosen to be the product of two 2-spheres. Upon evaluating the solution, we study the spacetime properties, such as event horizon and singularity, and obtain the ranges of parameter space where the solution is valid. We discuss how the presence of Maxwell charges may impact the solution's asymptotic expansion and what distinctive effects it will bring to the geometry. The thermodynamic properties of the solution are also discussed, emphasizing the interplay between NUT and Maxwell charges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10582v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamical black holes have an apparent horizon as one of their characteristics. The later might be null, time-like, or space-like surfaces that define the evolution of a black hole. Our study examines how an apparent horizon's behavior is influenced by the null energy condition in spherically-symmetric spacetime. If the location of an apparent horizon and the NEC horizon coincide, it is proven to be null surface. The outer apparent horizon may appear time-like despite the growth of the black hole mass, which must be astrophysical important because the shadow of a black hole always decreases. We show that if NEC is satisfied everywhere in spacetime, then the dynamical black hole asymptotically tends to Vaidya black hole. Our research demonstrates that evaporation of a regular black hole consistently results in a horizonless object with a regular center, which opens the possibility of elucidating the information loss paradox.</description>

      <title>Insights into Binary Neutron Star Merger Simulations: A Multi-Code Comparison</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational Wave (GW) signals from Binary Neutron Star (BNS) mergers provide critical insights into the properties of matter under extreme conditions. Due to the scarcity of observational data, Numerical Relativity (NR) simulations are indispensable for exploring these phenomena. However, simulating BNS mergers is a formidable challenge, and ensuring the consistency, reliability or convergence, especially in the post-merger, remains a work in progress. In this paper we assess the performance of current BNS merger simulations by analyzing open-source GW waveforms from five leading NR codes - SACRA, BAM, THC, Whisky amd SpEC. We focus on the accuracy of these simulations and on the effect of the equation of state (EOS) on waveform predictions. We first check if different codes give similar results for similar initial data, then apply two methods to calculate convergence and quantify discretization errors. Lastly, we perform a thorough investigation into the effect of tidal interactions on key frequencies in the GW spectrum. We introduce a novel quasi-universal relation for the transient post-merger time, enhancing our understanding of remnant dynamics in this region. This detailed analysis clarifies agreements and discrepancies between these leading NR codes, and highlights necessary improvements for the advanced accuracy requirements of future GW detectors.</description>

      <title>Primordial Gravitational Waves in Quadratic Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03543v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quadratic gravity is a fourth-order (in derivatives) theory that can serve as an attractive upgrade to the standard description of gravity provided by General Relativity, thanks to its renormalizability and its built-in description of primordial inflation. We bring quadratic gravity into a second-order form by introducing an auxiliary tensor field and we consider the primordial tensor fluctuations (gravitational waves) in the theory around a Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker background. After a canonical quantization of the perturbations, we calculate the tensor power spectrum in quasi de Sitter spacetime. We find that the spectral index $n_t$ and the amplitude $A_t$ of the tensor power spectrum are both suppressed by the factor $(1 + 2{\bf H}^2_*/m_\text{gh}^2)^{-1}$, where ${\bf H}_*$ is the Hubble rate at horizon exit and $m_\text{gh}$ is the mass of the spin-two ghost. This restores the slow-roll consistency condition familiar from single-field inflation models, where the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ is equal to $-8n_t$ in the lowest nontrivial order in the slow-roll approximation. We also discuss the well-known issue of the ghost problem in fourth-order theories and how it pertains to the results at hand.</description>

      <title>Transition from Regular Black Holes to Wormholes in Covariant Effective Quantum Gravity: Scattering, Quasinormal Modes, and Hawking Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Utilizing the Hamiltonian constraints approach, a quantum-corrected solution has been derived \cite{Zhang:2024ney}, which describes either a regular black hole or a traversable wormhole, contingent upon the value of the quantum parameter. In this work, we compute the quasinormal modes associated with axial gravitational and test fields' perturbations of these objects. We see that due to quantum corrections near the event horizon, the first several overtones deviate from their Schwarzschild values at an increasing rate. The transition between the black hole and wormhole states is marked by modifications in the late-time signal. Our findings reveal that the fundamental quasinormal modes of quantum-corrected black holes exhibit only slight deviations from those of the classical Schwarzschild solution. However, at the transition, the spectrum undergoes significant changes, with the wormhole state characterized by exceptionally long-lived quasinormal modes. In addition, we calculate absorption cross-sections of partial waves, grey-body factors and energy emission rates of Hawking radiation.</description>

      <title>More accurate slow-roll approximations for inflation in scalar-tensor theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose new versions of the slow-roll approximation for inflationary models with nonminimally coupled scalar fields. We derive more precise expressions for the standard slow-roll parameters as functions of the scalar field. To verify the accuracy of the proposed approximations, we consider inflationary models with the induced gravity term and the fourth-order monomial potential. For specific values of the model parameters, this model is the well-known Higgs-driven inflationary model. We investigate the inflationary dynamics in the Jordan frame and come to the conclusion that the proposed versions of the slow-roll approximation are not only more accurate at the end of inflation, but also give essentially more precise estimations for the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ and the amplitude of scalar perturbations $A_s$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the polarization properties of gravitational waves within a torsionless spacetime framework, as described by the Palatini formalism. Our analysis uncovers the presence of two novel polarization modes, referred to as shear modes, which extend beyond the traditional set of six modes in a four-dimensional Riemannian spacetime. These shear modes, uniquely driven by vector degrees of freedom associated with non-metricity, are classified as vector modes, and their detection provides a unique opportunity to explore the fundamental structure of spacetime and to test gravity theories. These modes extend the standard gravitational wave polarization paradigm and provide novel observational signatures for gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop an analytic model that extends classical white hole geometry by incorporating both radiative dynamics and electric charge. Starting from a maximal analytic extension of the Schwarzschild white hole via Kruskal Szekeres coordinates, we introduce a time dependent mass function, representative of outgoing null dust to model evaporation. Building on this foundation, the study then integrates the Reissner-Nordstr\"om framework to obtain a dynamic, charged white hole solution in double null coordinates. In the resulting Vaidya Reissner Nordstr\"om metric, both the Bondi mass and the associated charge decrease monotonically with retarded time, capturing the interplay of radiation and electromagnetic effects. Detailed analysis of horizon behavior reveals how mass loss and charge shedding modify the causal structure, ensuring that energy conditions are preserved and cosmic censorship is maintained.</description>

Abstract: The generalized Gullstrand-Painleve geometry is investigated for expanding matter. Compared to other studies, we take into account an anisotropic stress tensor as the source of curvature with an equation of state resembling the MIT bag model form. The spacetime is of de Sitter type for $t&gt;&gt;1/\sqrt{\Lambda}, \Lambda$ being the equivalent cosmological constant. The energy density and pressures of the fluid are only time dependent.

      <title>Test-Field vs Physical Quasi-Normal Modes in Scalar-Tensor Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of the general effort to model black hole dynamics, and in particular their return-to-equilibrium through quasi-normal modes, it is crucial to understand how much test-field perturbations deviate from physical perturbations in modified gravity scenarios. On the one hand, physical perturbations follow the modified Einstein equations of the considered extension of general relativity. The complexity of those equations can quickly escalate with extra fields and non-linear couplings. On the other hand, test-field perturbations, with negligible back-reaction on the space-time geometry, describe the propagation of both matter fields and spin $s=2$ gravitational waves on the black hole geometry. They are not subject to the intricacies of the modified Einstein equations, and only probe the background spacetime metric. If their physics were to not deviate significantly from physical perturbations, they would be especially useful to investigate predictions from quantum gravity scenarios which lack explicit detailed Einstein equations.
  Here we focus on a specific modified gravity solution -- BCL black holes in scalar-tensor theories -- for which physical perturbations and related QNM frequencies have already been studied and computed numerically. We compute the test-field QNM frequencies and compare the two QNM spectra. This provides a concrete example of the significant differences arising between test-fields and physical perturbations, and flags unphysical deviations related to the test-field framework.</description>

      <title>Ultra-low-frequency gravitational waves from individual supermassive black hole binaries as standard sirens</title>

      <description>arXiv:2201.00607v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultra-low-frequency gravitational waves (GWs) generated by individual inspiraling supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) at the centers of galaxies may be detected by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) in the future. These GW signals, which encode absolute cosmic distances, can serve as bright and dark sirens, potentially evolving into a precise cosmological probe. Here, we show that a PTA in the era of the Square Kilometre Array, comprising 100 millisecond pulsars, could potentially detect about 25 bright sirens and 41 dark sirens over a 10-year observation period. The bright sirens, combined with cosmic microwave background data, offer capabilities comparable to current mainstream joint cosmological observations for measuring the equation of state of dark energy. The dark sirens could achieve a measurement precision of the Hubble constant close to that of current distance-ladder observations. Our results suggest that ultra-low-frequency GWs from individual SMBHBs are of great significance in investigating the nature of dark energy and determining the Hubble constant.</description>

      <title>The Asymptotic Structure of Cosmological Integrals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06558v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a general analysis of the asymptotic behaviour of perturbative contributions to observables in arbitrary power-law FRW cosmologies, indistinctly the Bunch-Davies wavefunction and cosmological correlators. We consider a large class of scalar toy models, including conformally-coupled and massless scalars in arbitrary dimensions, that admits a first principle definition in terms of (generalised/weighted) cosmological polytopes. The perturbative contributions to an observable can be expressed as an integral of the canonical function associated to such polytopes and to weighted graphs. We show how the asymptotic behaviour of these integrals is governed by a special class of nestohedra living in the graph-weight space, both at tree and loop level. As the singularities of a cosmological process described by a graph can be associated to its subgraphs, we provide a realisation of the nestohedra as a sequential truncation of a top-dimensional simplex based on the underlying graph. This allows us to determine all the possible directions -- both in the infrared and in the ultraviolet --, where the integral can diverge as well as their divergence degree. Both of them are associated to the facets of the nestohedra, which are identified by overlapping tubings of the graph: the specific tubing determines the divergent directions while the number of overlapping tubings its degree of divergence. This combinatorial formulation makes straightforward the application of sector decomposition for extracting both leading and subleading divergences from the integral, as the sectors in which the integration domain can be tiled are identified by the collection of compatible facets of the nestohedra, with the latter that can be determined via the graph tubings. Finally, the leading divergence can be interpreted as a restriction of the canonical function of the relevant polytope onto a special hyperplane.</description>

      <title>Absence of antisymmetric tensor fields : Clue from Starobinsky model of f(R) gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02771v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the surprising aspects of the present Universe, is the absence of any noticeable observable effects of higher-rank antisymmetric tensor fields in any natural phenomena. Here, we address the possible explanation of the absence of the higher rank antisymmetric tensor fields within the framework of $f(R)$ gravity. We explore the cosmological evolution of the scalar degrees of freedom associated with higher curvature term in a general $f(R)$ gravity model $f (R) = R +\alpha_n R^n$. We show that while different cosmological parameters mimic standard behaviour at different epochs for different forms of higher curvature gravity (i.e. different values of n ), only Starobinsky model (n = 2) gives a natural justification for the invisibility of the signatures of the massless modes of higher rank antisymmetric fields. In contrast, for other models ($n\neq2$), despite their agreement with standard cosmology, the scalar degree of freedom induces an enhancement in the coupling of the antisymmetric fields and thereby contradicts the observation. The result does not change even with the inclusion of the Cosmological Constant. Thus, our result reveals that among different $f(R)$ models, Starobinsky model successfully explains the suppression of the massless modes of higher rank antisymmetric tensor fields leading to their invisibility in the present universe.</description>

      <title>Cosmology with Binary Neutron Stars: Does Mass-Redshift Correlation Matter?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02494v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Next-generation gravitational wave detectors are expected to detect millions of compact binary mergers across cosmological distances. The features of the mass distribution of these mergers, combined with gravitational wave distance measurements, will enable precise cosmological inferences, even without the need for electromagnetic counterparts. However, achieving accurate results requires modeling the mass spectrum, particularly considering possible redshift evolution. Binary neutron star (BNS) mergers are thought to be less influenced by changes in metallicity compared to binary black holes (BBH) or neutron star-black hole (NSBH) mergers. This stability in their mass spectrum over cosmic time reduces the chances of introducing biases in cosmological parameters caused by redshift evolution. In this study, we use the population synthesis code COMPAS to generate astrophysically motivated catalogs of BNS mergers and explore whether assuming a non-evolving BNS mass distribution with redshift could introduce biases in cosmological parameter inference. Our findings show that despite significant variations in the BNS mass distribution across binary physics assumptions and initial conditions in COMPAS, the joint mass-redshift population can be expressed as the product of the mass distribution marginalized over redshift and the redshift distribution marginalized over masses. This enables a 2% unbiased constraint on the Hubble constant-sufficient to address the Hubble tension. Additionally, we show that in the fiducial COMPAS setup, the bias from a non-evolving BNS mass model is less than 0.5% for the Hubble parameter measured at redshift 0.4. These results establish BNS mergers as strong candidates for spectral siren cosmology in the era of next-generation gravitational wave detectors.</description>

Abstract: We consider DHOST inflationary models with a shift symmetry leading to a de Sitter space-time at the background cosmological level. Deviations from scale invariance of the scalar and tensor perturbations follow from the breaking of the shift symmetry by quadratic and quartic operators. These models show a strong violation of the consistency relation of single-field inflationary models with a very flat spectrum of tensor perturbations. This opens up the prospects of future detection of primordial gravitational waves by mHz experiments.</description>

      <title>Searching for Inflationary Physics with the CMB Trispectrum: 1. Primordial Theory &amp; Optimal Estimators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04434v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The primordial four-point function encodes a wealth of information about the inflationary Universe. Despite extensive theoretical work, most models of four-point physics have never been compared to data. In this series, we conduct a detailed analysis of Cosmic Microwave Background temperature and polarization trispectra, searching for a wide variety of phenomena including local effects, self-interactions, curvatons, DBI inflation, gauge fields, solid inflation, scalar field exchange, spinning massive field exchange, chiral physics, point sources, and gravitational lensing. After presenting a suite of separable primordial templates, we derive thirteen quasi-optimal estimators that directly estimate the underlying template amplitudes. These are unbiased, minimum variance, mask-deconvolved, and account for correlations between templates (including with lensing). Each estimator can be efficiently implemented using spherical harmonic transforms, Monte Carlo methods, and optimization techniques, and asymptotes to standard forms in certain limits. In Paper 2, we implement these estimators in public code, and in Paper 3, use them to constrain primordial trispectra with Planck data. This enables a wide variety of tests of inflation, including some of the first direct constraints on cosmological collider physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05258v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To unlock the vast potential of the CMB trispectrum, we require both robust estimators and efficient computational tools. In this work, we introduce the public code PolySpec: a suite of quartic estimators designed to measure the amplitudes of a wide variety of inflationary templates, including local non-Gaussianity, effective field theory models, direction-dependent trispectra, spinning massive particle exchange, and weak gravitational lensing. PolySpec includes a python/cython implementation of each estimator derived in Paper 1 and has been carefully optimized to ensure efficient use of computational resources. We perform a broad range of validation tests, which demonstrate that the estimator is unbiased and minimum-variance, both in Gaussian and non-Gaussian regimes. In addition, we forecast constraints on various types of trispectra; this highlights the utility of CMB polarization and demonstrates that many models of primordial physics are poorly correlated with the simple templates considered in previous studies. This work lays the foundation for the Planck trispectrum analyses performed in Paper 3.</description>

Abstract: Is there new physics hidden in the four-point function of the cosmic microwave background (CMB)? We conduct a detailed analysis of the Planck PR4 temperature and polarization trispectrum for $\ell\in[2,2048]$. Using the theoretical and computational tools developed in Paper 1 and Paper 2, we search for 33 template amplitudes, encoding a variety of effects from inflationary self-interactions to particle exchange. We find no evidence for primordial non-Gaussianity and set stringent constraints on both phenomenological amplitudes and couplings in the inflationary Lagrangian. Due to the use of optimal estimators and polarization data, our constraints are highly competitive. For example, we find $\sigma(g_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc})=4.8\times 10^4$ and $\tau_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc} &lt;1500$ (95\% CL), a factor of two improvement on Effective Field Theory amplitudes, and a $43\sigma$ detection of gravitational lensing. Many templates are analyzed for the first time, such as direction-dependent trispectra and the collapsed limit of the `cosmological collider', across a range of masses and spins. We perform a variety of validation tests; whilst our results are stable, the most relevant systematics are found to be lensing bias, residual foregrounds, and mismatch between simulations and data. The techniques discussed in this series can be extended to future datasets, allowing the primordial Universe to be probed at even higher sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Constraints Preserving Lax-Wendroff Flux Reconstruction for Relativistic Hydrodynamics with General Equations of State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the realm of relativistic astrophysics, the ideal equation of state with a constant adiabatic index provides a poor approximation due to its inconsistency with relativistic kinetic theory. However, it is a common practice to use it for relativistic fluid flow equations due to its simplicity. Here we develop a high-order Lax-Wendroff flux reconstruction method on Cartesian grids for solving special relativistic hydrodynamics equations with several general equations of state available in the literature. We also study the conversion from conservative to primitive variables, which depends on the equation of state in use, and provide an alternative method of conversion when the existing approach does not succeed. For the admissibility of the solution, we blend the high-order method with a low-order method on sub-cells and prove its physical admissible property in the case of all the equations of state used here. Lastly, we validate the scheme by several test cases having strong discontinuities, large Lorentz factor, and low density or pressure in one and two dimensions.</description>

      <title>New cosmological constraints on the evolution of dark matter energy density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09879v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We constrain the evolution of dark matter energy density over time, specifically focusing on deviation from the standard model represented by the equation $\rho_{m}\propto(1+z)^{3-\varepsilon}$, where $\varepsilon$ is a constant parameter. Utilizing a diverse array of observational datasets, including baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) data from the first release of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), distance priors derived from cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations by the Planck satellite, Hubble rate data obtained through the cosmic chronometers (CC) method, type Ia supernova (SNIa) data from the Panthon sample, and the data from the redshift space distortion (RSD) measurements ($f\sigma_8$), we derive stringent constraints on the deviation parameter. We find that for the model under consideration, the deviation parameter is constrained to be $\varepsilon = -0.0073^{+0.0029}_{-0.0033}$, indicating a deviation of approximately $2.4\sigma$ from the scenario where dark matter and vacuum dark energy do not interact. When compared with previous studies and alternative analyses, our findings provide corroborative evidence for an interaction between dark matter and vacuum dark energy, particularly in light of the release of BAO data from DESI.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Complement of a Gravitating Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15886v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Any gravitating region $a$ in any spacetime gives rise to a generalized entanglement wedge, the hologram $e(a)$. Holograms exhibit properties expected of fundamental operator algebras, such as strong subadditivity, nesting, and no-cloning. But the entanglement wedge EW of an AdS boundary region $B$ with commutant $\bar B$ satisfies an additional condition, complementarity: EW$(B)$ is the spacelike complement of EW$(\bar B)$ in the bulk.
  Here we identify an analogue of the boundary commutant $\bar B$ in general spacetimes: given a gravitating region $a$, its \emph{fundamental complement} $\tilde{a}$ is the smallest wedge that contains all infinite world lines contained in the spacelike complement $a'$ of $a$. We refine the definition of $e(a)$ by requiring that it be spacelike to $\tilde a$. We prove that $e(a)$ is the spacelike complement of $e(\tilde a)$ when the latter is computed in $a'$.
  We exhibit many examples of $\tilde{a}$ and of $e(a)$ in de Sitter, flat, and cosmological spacetimes. We find that a Big Bang cosmology (spatially closed or not) is trivially reconstructible: the whole universe is the entanglement wedge of any wedge inside it. But de Sitter space is not trivially reconstructible, despite being closed. We recover the AdS/CFT prescription by proving that EW$(B)=e($causal wedge of $B$).</description>

      <title>LSZ ghostbusters in the quadratic gravity stage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20597v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The present letter considers the quantization method developed in [1]-[9], which postulates that, in several situations, negative norm or ghost states can be avoided in order to give positive probabilities. These authors also postulate a candidate for a path integral for those theories, following pioneer works initiated by Dirac [10]} and Pauli \[11]. However, taking into account the non standard oscillator algebra inherent to this method, It is of interest the derivation of the LSZ rules in this context, since it may not be clear at first sight that has the usual form of the textbooks, due to the non standard oscillator algebra and the redefinitions of the states.This is done here, applied to Stelle gravity [12]-[13]. In addition, an equivalent but simpler way to deal with negative norm states is worked out, in which hermiticity is more explicit. As far as we understand, our conclusions fully agree with the arguments and expectations of those authors.</description>
