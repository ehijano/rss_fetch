      <title>Propulsion Trades for a 2035-2040 Solar Gravitational Lens Mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Solar Gravitational Lens (SGL) enables multipixel imaging and spatially resolved spectroscopy of a nearby terrestrial exoplanet from heliocentric distances $z\simeq 650$-$900$ AU, where solar power is negligible and transportation largely sets time-to-first-science. Reaching 650 AU in 20 yr implies a ballistic lower bound $\bar v_r \simeq 32.5~{\rm AU/yr}\simeq 154$ km/s, motivating propulsion beyond chemical and gravity-assist-only options. We compare close-perihelion solar sailing, fission-powered nuclear electric propulsion (NEP), and Oberth-enabled hybrid injection using simple time-to-distance models that isolate the long outbound leg (i.e., excluding architecture-dependent inner-solar-system injection overhead). For solar sailing, $r_p=0.05$ AU requires $\sigma_{\rm tot}\simeq 4.9~\mathrm{g\,m^{-2}}$ for $v_\infty\simeq 105$ km/s and $\sigma_{\rm tot}\simeq 2.3~\mathrm{g\,m^{-2}}$ for $v_\infty\simeq 155$ km/s, placing sub-20 yr sail-only access in an ultra-low-areal-density, deep-perihelion survivability regime. For NEP, a constant-power stage closure shows that a $m_0=20$ t spacecraft with $m_{\rm pay}=800$ kg and $\eta=0.7$ reaches 650 AU in ~27-33 yr for $\alpha_{\rm tot}=10$-$20~\mathrm{kg\,kW_e^{-1}}$ (typical optima $P_e\simeq 0.18$-$0.30~\mathrm{MW_e}$, thrust of a few newtons). NEP-only sub-20 yr transfers require extremely aggressive assumptions ($\alpha_{\rm tot}\lesssim 3~\mathrm{kg\,kW_e^{-1}}$ and very-high-$I_{\rm sp}$, long-life EP), whereas hybrid architectures become plausible for $\alpha_{\rm tot}\sim 10$-$15~\mathrm{kg\,kW_e^{-1}}$ if an injection stage supplies $v_0\gtrsim 50$-70 km/s prior to NEP cruise. We map these requirements to technology readiness and identify system-level demonstrations needed by the early 2030s for a credible 2035--2040 start.</description>

      <title>A Two-Dimensional Analytic Solution for the Generation of Hyperbolic Trajectories Via A Single Close Encounter with Applications To Interstellar Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of interstellar interlopers such as 1I/`Oumuamua, 2I/Borisov, and 3I/ATLAS have highlighted the necessity of understanding the dynamical pathways that eject small bodies from planetary systems into hyperbolic trajectories. In this paper we examine the orbital elements of particles in the restricted three-body problem prior to and post scattering onto hyperbolic trajectories by massive perturbers. Building on previous work, we calculate closed-form -- but approximate -- analytic criteria that map pre- to post-encounter orbital elements. An application of these equations demonstrates that ejection occurs most efficiently when the orbital eccentricity of the massless test particle exceeds a minimum threshold, $e\gtrsim0.4$. The primary driver of the final eccentricity is the component of the perturber-centric velocity projected along the direction of motion of the perturber. These analytic criteria are then benchmarked and validated against numerical simulations which demonstrate that they provide a reasonably good zeroth-order approximation for ejection behavior. However, system-specific cases will generally require numerical simulations in addition to this analytic construction. The methodology is applied to (i) the solar system and exoplanetary systems (ii) $\beta$ Pictoris and (iii) HR 8799 to evaluate the pre-scattering orbits of ejected particles. This method provides a transparent and computationally efficient tool for identifying orbits within a given system from which interstellar objects are efficiently ejected via a single scattering event from a massive perturber.</description>

      <title>Where Does Tracing of Cosmic Ray in Real Atmosphere Terminate?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In backtracing simulations, which are widely employed to determine cosmic-ray particle trajectories in the geomagnetic field, the atmosphere is typically approximated as an artificial sharp boundary at some low altitude where the traced trajectory terminates. In this paper, we extend beyond this simplified assumption and investigate two realistic physical processes that terminate cosmic-ray particle propagation in the atmosphere: Bethe-Bloch energy loss mechanisms and hard scattering interactions with atmospheric atoms using total cross sections based on the Glauber-Gribov formalism. The former mechanism dominates at low rigidities (for protons below $\sim0.57$~GV), while the latter becomes dominant at higher rigidities. Consequently, we introduce two dimensionless variables up to detailed numerical criteria: the relative rigidity shift due to Bethe-Bloch effects ($\Delta\mathfrak{R}/\mathfrak{R}$), and the expected number of hard scattering events ($\langle N\rangle$). Using the corrected US Standard Atmosphere 1976 model, we demonstrate that the altitude dependence can be factorized as approximately $\exp(-0.14h/\textrm{km})$. Additionally, the effect of the local curvature radius of the trajectory near perigee can be similarly factorized. Our calculations indicate that the simplified sharp-boundary altitude should be at least $50$ km with $\Delta\mathfrak{R}/\mathfrak{R}+\langle N\rangle\lesssim1$ for protons, increasing by more than $15$ km for heavy nuclei such as iron.</description>

      <title>GASV: A New VLBI analysis software for Geodesy and Astrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present GASV, a novel Python-based software package specifically designed for the analysis of Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) data. Developed with ease of installation and user friendliness in mind, GASV supports both pipeline and interactive processing modes. The software processes VLBI baseline delays and rates in standard formats such as HOPS outputs and NGS card files to estimate key geodetic and astrometric parameters, including station coordinates, Earth Orientation Parameters, source coordinates, clock parameters, and atmospheric models. We evaluate the capabilities and performance of GASV, demonstrating that its parameter estimation accuracy for IVS INT, Regular, and CONT sessions is comparable to that achieved by the VLBI analysis centers at BKG and USNO. As a state-of-the-art tool, GASV not only enables high-quality single-session data processing but also but also supports global analyses of long-term SINEX files, generating Celestial Reference Frame and Terrestrial Reference Frame solutions with reliable accuracy.</description>

      <title>Stellar Interpretation of Meteoritic Data and PLotting for Everyone (SIMPLE): Isotope Mixing Lines for Six Sets of Core-Collapse Supernova Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bulk meteorites and their inclusions exhibit, for many chemical elements, isotopic variability produced by nucleosynthetic events in stars and supernovae before the formation of the Sun. While the exact astrophysical origins of these variations are still a matter of debate, their identification provides insights on the environment of the Sun's birth and the formation of the Solar System. Here we present a new Python tool called SIMPLE (Stellar Interpretation of Meteoritic Data and Plotting for Everyone) designed to compare the isotopic composition of the ejecta from core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) with meteoritic data. In the present version, the SIMPLE toolkit includes a dataset of 18 CCSN models, from 6 different published sets, with initial masses of 15, 20, and 25 M$_{\odot}$ and solar metallicity. SIMPLE is designed to easily extract the isotopic abundances predicted by each CCSN model for any elements and post-process them into the format needed to compare to the meteoritic data, therefore, facilitating their interpretation. As an example of how to use SIMPLE, we analyze the composition of the Ni isotopes in the 18 models and confirm that bulk meteorite Ni anomalies are compatible with material from the innermost Si-rich region of CCSN ejecta. Designed as a collaborative platform, SIMPLE is open-source and welcomes community contributions to enhance its development and dissemination for stellar nucleosynthesis and meteoritic studies. Future enhancements include addition of more model predictions and inclusion of mixing between different layers of supernova ejecta.</description>

      <title>Wide binaries without viable bound Newtonian orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Wide binaries offer a unique opportunity to test gravity in the low acceleration regime, where deviations from Newtonian dynamics may appear. Aims. We use high-resolution VLT-ESPRESSO archival spectra to study 26 wide binaries with projected separations larger than 13,000 AU. By combining precise radial velocities with Gaia proper motions and parallaxes, we aim to test whether these systems are consistent with Newtonian gravity in the low acceleration regime. Methods. We use multiple radial velocity measurements and stellar parameters to remove systems affected by unresolved triples, chance alignments, or young systems. For the remaining binaries, we combine radial velocities (corrected for convective shift and gravitational redshift) with Gaia proper motions, parallaxes, and positions to attempt bound Newtonian orbital solutions Results. Fourteen of the 26 initial systems were discarded: 12 due to radial velocity variability indicating unresolved close binaries, one hosting a faint Gaia companion, and one too young. Of the remaining 12, nine can be fitted with bound orbital solution, while three show velocity differences too large to be reconciled with any bound Newtonian orbit. Conclusions. For the three systems that cannot be fitted with a bound orbit, repeated radial velocity observations allow us to confidently exclude, with one possible exception, unresolved triple stellar companions or massive close-in planets as causes. Given their likely large 3-dimensional separations, these binaries may have been dynamically perturbed or disrupted by stellar encounters or Galactic tides, and may no longer be gravitationally bound. This highlights how utmost caution must be applied when studying wide binaries as isolated systems.</description>

      <title>The Frequency of Solar Eclipses for a Given Place: A New Approach to a Classic Question</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a classic 1982 paper in this journal, Jean Meeus used a statistical approach for finding the mean frequency of a total and an annular eclipse of the Sun at a given place on the surface of the Earth. In this current paper we tackle the problem again, taking advantage of the much greater computing power now available. We obtain narrower estimates of once every 373 $\pm$ 7 years for a total eclipse, and once every 226 $\pm$ 4 years for an annular eclipse. In addition, we obtain a result of once every 2.59 $\pm$ 0.02 years for a partial eclipse. We provide further insights into the "latitude effect", showing that solar eclipses occur most frequently around the Arctic and Antarctic Circles. We also show how the gradual shift of aphelion and perihelion with respect to the seasons produces a $\sim$21,000-year cycle in the frequency of eclipses in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.</description>

      <title>The EXoplanet Climate Infrared TElescope (EXCITE): A balloon-borne mission to measure spectroscopic phase curves of transiting hot Jupiters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The EXoplanet Climate Infrared TElescope (EXCITE) is a balloon-borne mission dedicated to measuring spectroscopic phase curves of hot Jupiter-type exoplanets. Phase curve measurements can be used to characterize an exoplanet's longitude-dependent atmospheric composition and energy circulation patterns. EXCITE carries a 0.5 m primary mirror and moderate resolution diffraction-limited spectrograph with spectral coverage from 0.8--3.5 um. EXCITE is designed to fly from a long-duration balloon (LDB). EXCITE will observe through the peak of a target's spectral energy distribution (SED) and through spectral signatures of hydrogen and carbon-containing molecules. In this paper, we present the science goals of EXCITE, detail the as-built instrument, and discuss its performance during a 2024 engineering flight from Fort Sumner, New Mexico.</description>

      <title>NSF-DOE Vera C. Rubin Observatory Observations of Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on the observation and measurement of astrometry, photometry, morphology, and activityof the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, also designated C/2025 N1 (ATLAS) with the NSF-DOE Vera C. Rubin Observatory. Comet 3I/ATLAS, the third known interstellar object, was discovered on UT 2025 July 1. Rubin Observatory had coincidentally collected images of the object's region of the sky during routine commissioning. Facilitated by Rubin's high resolution and large aperture, we successfully recovered object detections from Rubin observations spanning UT 2025 June 21 (10 days before discovery, when 3I/ATLAS was 4.5 au from the Sun) through the date of discovery, and we acquired additional images through UT 2025 July 20 as part of commissioning. We measure on-sky locations of 3I/ATLAS in Rubin ugrizy bands, with a typical precision of about 70 mas, and briefly describe the reason this is coarser than our measured static source astrometric precision of about 3 mas in Rubin images. We measure grizy magnitudes of 3I/ATLAS photometry at about 0.01 mag precision, detecting no short-term photometric variability above 0.01 mag. We derive an estimated near-nucleus dust-to-nucleus scattering cross-section ratio of eta &gt;= 13 on UT 2025 July 2 based on Rubin photometry and an upper limit nucleus size computed from Hubble Space Telescope observations. We find Rubin colors of g - r = (0.657 +/- 0.013) mag, r - i = (0.235 +/- 0.018) mag, i - z = (0.147 +/- 0.042) mag, z - y = (0.047 +/- 0.052) mag. These data represent the earliest observations of this object by a large (&gt;=8-meter class) telescope and illustrate the type of measurements (and discoveries) Rubin's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will begin to provide after it begins in early 2026.</description>

      <title>How Internal Structure Shapes the Metallicity of Giant Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The composition and internal structure of gas giant exoplanets encode key information about their formation and evolution. We investigate how different assumed interior structures affect the inferred bulk metallicity and its correlation with planetary mass. For a sample of 44 giant exoplanets (0.12-5.98 MJ), we computed evolutionary models with CEPAM and retrieved their bulk metallicities under three structural hypotheses: core+envelope (CE), dilute core (DC), and fully mixed (FM). Across all structures, we recover a significant positive correlation between total heavy-element mass (MZ) and planetary mass (M), and a negative correlation between bulk metallicity (Z) and M (also for Z/Zstar vs M). Dilute core structures yield metallicities comparable to CE models, regardless of the assumed extent of the composition gradient. Increasing atmospheric metallicity augments the inferred bulk metallicity, as enhanced opacities slow planetary cooling. Non-adiabatic DC models can further increase the retrieved metallicity by up to 35 percent. We find that the mass-metallicity anti-correlation is primarily driven by low-mass, metal-rich planets (M &lt; 0.2 MJ), and that massive planets (greater than about 1 MJ) can exhibit unexpectedly high metallicities (Z approximately 0.1-0.3). Improved constraints on convective mixing, combined with upcoming accurate measurements of planetary masses, radii, and atmospheric compositions from missions such as PLATO and Ariel, will provide further constraints on interior structure and formation models of gas giant planets.</description>

      <title>First Astrometric Limits on Binary Planets and Exomoons orbiting $\beta$ Pictoris b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The search for exomoons, or moons in other star systems, has attracted significant interest in recent years, driven both by advancements in detection sensitivity and by the expanding population of known exoplanets. The $\beta$ Pictoris system is a particularly favorable target, as its proximity and directly imaged planets allow for precise astrometric monitoring. We present astrometric constraints on the presence of binary planets and exomoons in the $\beta$ Pictoris system using archival observations from the GRAVITY interferometer and SPHERE instruments. We calculate these limits by modeling the motion of the two orbiting planets and introducing an additional perturbation to the model that simulates the astrometric motion caused by an exomoon orbiting the planet $\beta$ Pictoris b. We find that for short orbital periods ($\approx50$ days), a lunar companion is only allowed if its mass remains below $\approx 180~M_{\oplus}$ ($0.6~M_{\text{Jup}}$) at $3\sigma$ confidence. At intermediate periods near 300 days, we exclude moons more massive than $\approx 65~M_{\oplus}$ ($0.2~M_{\text{Jup}}$) at $3\sigma$ confidence. At longer orbital periods, we place the tightest constraints, ruling out any potential exomoon above $\approx 50~M_{\oplus}$ ($0.15~M_{\text{Jup}}$) at $700$ days and $\approx 30~M_{\oplus}$ ($0.1~M_{\text{Jup}}$) at $1,100$ days (both at $3\sigma$ confidence). These results place the first astrometric constraints on moons and binary planets in the $\beta$ Pictoris system and demonstrate the sensitivity of interferometric observations for exomoon studies.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning to Discover a North East Monsoon Index for Rainfall Prediction in Thailand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10181v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurately predicting long-term rainfall is challenging. Global climate indices, such as the El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation, are standard input features for machine learning. However, a significant gap persists regarding local-scale indices capable of improving predictive accuracy in specific regions of Thailand. This paper introduces a novel North East monsoon climate index calculated from sea surface temperature to reflect the climatology of the boreal winter monsoon. To optimise the calculated areas used for this index, a Deep Q-Network reinforcement learning agent explores and selects the most effective rectangles based on their correlation with seasonal rainfall. Rainfall stations were classified into 12 distinct clusters to distinguish rainfall patterns between southern and upper Thailand. Experimental results show that incorporating the optimised index into Long Short-Term Memory models significantly improves long-term monthly rainfall prediction skill in most cluster areas. This approach effectively reduces the Root Mean Square Error for 12-month-ahead forecasts.</description>
