      <title>Noise-adaptive hybrid quantum convolutional neural networks based on depth-stratified feature extraction</title>

Abstract: Hierarchical quantum classifiers, such as quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs), represent recent progress toward designing effective and feasible architectures for quantum classification. However, their performance on near-term quantum hardware remains highly sensitive to noise accumulation across circuit depth, calling for strategies beyond circuit-architecture design alone. We propose a noise-adaptive hybrid QCNN that improves classification under noise by exploiting depth-stratified intermediate measurements. Instead of discarding qubits removed during pooling operations, we measure them and use the resulting outcomes as classical features that are jointly processed by a classical neural network. This hybrid hierarchical design enables noise-adaptive inference by integrating quantum intermediate measurements with classical post-processing. Systematic experiments across multiple circuit sizes and noise settings, including hardware-calibrated noise models derived from IBM Quantum backend data, demonstrate more stable convergence, reduced loss variability, and consistently higher classification accuracy compared with standard QCNNs. Moreover, we observe that this performance advantage significantly amplifies as the circuit size increases, confirming that the hybrid architecture mitigates the scaling limitations of standard architectures. Notably, the multi-basis measurement variant attains performance close to the noiseless limit even under realistic noise. While demonstrated for QCNNs, the proposed depth-stratified feature extraction applies more broadly to hierarchical quantum classifiers that progressively discard qubits.</description>

      <title>CQ-CiM: Hardware-Aware Embedding Shaping for Robust CiM-Based Retrieval</title>

Abstract: Deploying Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) on edge devices is in high demand, but is hindered by the latency of massive data movement and computation on traditional architectures. Compute-in-Memory (CiM) architectures address this bottleneck by performing vector search directly within their crossbar structure. However, CiM's adoption for RAG is limited by a fundamental ``representation gap,'' as high-precision, high-dimension embeddings are incompatible with CiM's low-precision, low-dimension array constraints. This gap is compounded by the diversity of CiM implementations (e.g., SRAM, ReRAM, FeFET), each with unique designs (e.g., 2-bit cells, 512x512 arrays). Consequently, RAG data must be naively reshaped to fit each target implementation. Current data shaping methods handle dimension and precision disjointly, which degrades data fidelity. This not only negates the advantages of CiM for RAG but also confuses hardware designers, making it unclear if a failure is due to the circuit design or the degraded input data. As a result, CiM adoption remains limited. In this paper, we introduce CQ-CiM, a unified, hardware-aware data shaping framework that jointly learns Compression and Quantization to produce CiM-compatible low-bit embeddings for diverse CiM designs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to shape data for comprehensive CiM usage on RAG.</description>

      <title>Fast and low energy approximate full adder based on FELIX logic</title>

Abstract: In the "Big Data" era, a lot of data must be processed and moved between processing and memory units. New technologies and architectures have emerged to improve system performance and overcome the memory bottleneck. The memristor is a technology with both computing and memory capabilities. In-Memory Computing (IMC) can be performed by applying memristors to stateful design methods. The Fast and Energy-Efficient Logic in Memory (FELIX) logic is one of the stateful implementation logics compatible with memristive crossbar arrays. The way computations are performed can be changed to improve performance. Approximate design methods can be applied in error-resilient applications. In error-resilient applications, an acceptable amount of precision is lost while features such as hardware complexity, latency, and energy are improved. In this paper, using these two concepts, an approximate full adder circuit with exact Cout and approximate Sum outputs has been proposed using the FELIX design method for IMC in two different implementation approaches. The applied memristor count in the proposed FELIX-based Approximate Full Adder (FAFA) in the two proposed implementation approaches (FAFA1 and FAFA2) is improved by 14.28% and 28.57%, energy consumption is improved by 73.735% and 81.754%, respectively. The number of computational steps in both approaches is improved by 66.66% compared to the exact FELIX-based full adder. In this paper, two different scenarios are considered for evaluating the FAFA. In the 1st and 2nd scenarios, respectively, for the three and four Most Significant Bits (MSBs), the exact full adder is used, and for the five and four Least Significant Bits (LSBs), the FAFA is used. The results of error analysis and evaluations of the FAFA in three different image processing applications confirmed that FAFA has high accuracy and acceptable performance.</description>

      <title>Toward a Multi-Echelon Cyber Warfare Theory: A Meta-Game-Theoretic Paradigm for Defense and Dominance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08976</link>

Abstract: Cyber warfare has become a central element of modern conflict, especially within multi-domain operations. As both a distinct and critical domain, cyber warfare requires integrating defensive and offensive technologies into coherent strategies. While prior research has emphasized isolated tactics or fragmented technologies, a holistic understanding is essential for effective resource deployment and risk mitigation. Game theory offers a unifying framework for this purpose. It not only models attacker-defender interactions but also provides quantitative tools for equilibrium analysis, risk assessment, and strategic reasoning. Integrated with modern AI techniques, game-theoretic models enable the design and optimization of strategies across multiple levels of cyber warfare, from policy and strategy to operations, tactics, and technical implementations. These models capture the paradoxical logic of conflict, where more resources do not always translate into greater advantage, and where nonlinear dynamics govern outcomes. To illustrate the approach, this chapter examines RedCyber, a synthetic cyber conflict, demonstrating how game-theoretic methods capture the interdependencies of cyber operations. The chapter concludes with directions for future research on resilience, cros-echelon planning, and the evolving role of AI in cyber warfare.</description>

      <title>Stop Saying "AI"</title>

Abstract: Across academia, industry, and government, ``AI'' has become central in research and development, regulatory debates, and promises of ever faster and more capable decision-making and action. In numerous domains, especially safety-critical ones, there are significant concerns over how ``AI'' may affect decision-making, responsibility, or the likelihood of mistakes (to name only a few categories of critique). However, for most critiques, the target is generally ``AI'', a broad term admitting many (types of) systems used for a variety of tasks and each coming with its own set of limitations, challenges, and potential use cases. In this article, we focus on the military domain as a case study and present both a loose enumerative taxonomy of systems captured under the umbrella term ``military AI'', as well as discussion of the challenges of each. In doing so, we highlight that critiques of one (type of) system will not always transfer to other (types of) systems. Building on this, we argue that in order for debates to move forward fruitfully, it is imperative that the discussions be made more precise and that ``AI'' be excised from debates to the extent possible. Researchers, developers, and policy-makers should make clear exactly what systems they have in mind and what possible benefits and risks attend the deployment of those particular systems. While we focus on AI in the military as an exemplar for the overall trends in discussions of ``AI'', the argument's conclusions are broad and have import for discussions of AI across a host of domains.</description>
