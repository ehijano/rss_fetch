      <title>A Bogovski\v{i}-type operator for Corvino-Schoen hyperbolic gluing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a solution operator for the linearized constant scalar curvature equation at hyperbolic space in space dimension larger than or equal to two. The solution operator has good support propagation properties and gains two derivatives relative to standard norms. It can be used for Corvino-Schoen-type hyperbolic gluing, partly extending the recently introduced Mao-Oh-Tao gluing method to the hyperbolic setting.</description>

      <title>A test of the conjectured critical black-hole formation -- null geodesic correspondence: The case of self-gravitating scalar fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has recently been conjectured [A. Ianniccari {\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 133}, 081401 (2024)] that there exists a correspondence between the critical threshold of black-hole formation and the stability properties of null circular geodesics in the curved spacetime of the collapsing matter configuration. In the present compact paper we provide a non-trivial test of this intriguing conjecture. In particular, using analytical techniques we study the physical and mathematical properties of self-gravitating scalar field configurations that possess marginally-stable (degenerate) null circular geodesics. We reveal the interesting fact that the {\it analytically} calculated critical compactness parameter ${\cal C}^{\text{analytical}}\equiv{\text{max}_r}\{m(r)/r\}=6/25$, which signals the appearance of the first (marginally-stable) null circular geodesic in the curved spacetime of the self-gravitating scalar fields, agrees quite well (to within $\sim10\%$) with the exact compactness parameter ${\cal C}^{\text{numerical}}\equiv\text{max}_t\{\text{max}_r\{m(r)/r\}\}\simeq0.265$ which is computed {\it numerically} using fully non-linear numerical simulations of the gravitational collapse of scalar fields at the threshold of black-hole formation [here $m(r)$ is the gravitational mass contained within a sphere of radius $r$].</description>

      <title>Which is which? Identification of the two compact objects in gravitational-wave binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compact objects observed in gravitational-wave astronomy so far always come in pairs and never individually. Identifying the two components of a binary system is a delicate operation that is often taken for granted. The labeling procedure (i.e. which is object "1" and which is object "2") effectively acts as systematics, or equivalently an unspecified prior, in gravitational-wave data inference. The common approach is to label the objects solely by their masses, on a sample-by-sample basis; while intuitive, this leads to degeneracies when binaries have comparable masses. Instead, we argue that object identification should be tackled using the posterior distribution as a whole. We frame the problem in terms of constrained clustering -- a flavor of semi-supervised machine learning -- and find that unfolding the labeling systematics can significantly impact, and arguably improve, our interpretation of the data. In particular, the precision of black-hole spin measurements improves by up to 50%, spurious multimodalities and tails tend to disappear, posteriors become closer to Gaussian distributions, and the identification of the nature of the object (i.e. black hole vs. neutron star) is facilitated. We estimate that about 10% of the LIGO/Virgo posterior samples are affected by this relabeling, i.e. they might have been attributed to the wrong compact object in the observed binaries.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave polarisations in nonminimally coupled gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The properties of metric perturbations are determined in the context of an expanding Universe governed by a modified theory of gravity with a non-minimal coupling between curvature and matter. We analyse the dynamics of the 6 components of a general helicity decomposition of the metric and stress-energy perturbations, consisting of scalar, vector and tensor sectors. The tensor polarisations are shown to still propagate luminally, in agreement with recent data from gravitational interferometry experiments, while their magnitude decays with an additional factor sourced by the nonminimal coupling. We show that the production of these modes is associated with a modified quadrupole formula at leading order. The vector perturbations still exhibit no radiative behaviour, although their temporal evolution is found to be modified, with spatial dependence remaining unaffected. We establish that the scalar perturbations can no longer be treated as identical. We investigate the scalar sector by writing the modified model as an equivalent two-field scalar-tensor theory and find the same scalar degrees of freedom as in previous literature. The different sectors are paired with the corresponding polarisation modes, which can be observationally measured by their effects on the relative motion of test particles, thus providing the possibility of testing the modified theory and constraining its parameters.</description>

      <title>Analytical solutions for Maxwell-scalar system on radially symmetric spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate Maxwell-scalar models on radially symmetric spacetimes in which the gauge and scalar fields are coupled via the electric permittivity. We find the conditions that allow for the presence of minimum energy configurations. In this formalism, the charge density must be written exclusively in terms of the components of the metric tensor and the scalar field is governed by first-order equations. We also find a manner to map the aforementioned equation into the corresponding one associated to kinks in $(1,1)$ spacetime dimensions, so we get analytical solutions for three specific spacetimes. We then calculate the energy density and show that the energy is finite. The stability of the solutions against contractions and dilations, following Derrick's argument, and around small fluctuations in the fields is also investigated. In this direction, we show that the solutions obeying the first-order framework are stable.</description>

      <title>Taub-NUT Black Hole in Higher Derivative Gravity and Its Thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct the first-order perturbative Taub-NUT black hole solutions in Einstein gravity extended with a cubic curvature invariant. The corrected thermodynamic quantities are then obtained by the standard method and the first law and Smarr relation are satisfied. We also study the perturbative correction to thermodynamics using the Reall-Santos (RS) method and verify that the method is still applicable even though the metrics are no longer asymptotic to Minkowski spacetime. We then apply the RS method to obtain the leading correction to the thermodynamics of the complicated Kerr-Taub-NUT black holes.</description>

      <title>Scalar induced gravitational waves in f(R) gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the first and second order cosmological perturbation equations in f(R) modified gravity theory and provide the equation of motion of second order scalar induced gravitational waves. We find that the effects of modified gravity not only change the form of the equation of motion of second order scalar induced gravitational waves but also contribute an additional anisotropic stress tensor, composed of first order scalar perturbations, to the source term of the gravitational waves. We calculate the energy density spectrum of second order scalar induced gravitational waves in the HS model. Utilizing current pulsar timing array observational data, we perform a rigorous Bayesian analysis of the parameter space of the HS model.</description>

      <title>Semi-Classical limit and quantum corrections in noncoincidence power-law $f(Q)$-Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the framework of symmetric teleparallel $f\left( Q\right) $-gravity for a connection defined in the non-coincidence gauge we derive the Wheeler-DeWitt equation of quantum cosmology. Because the gravitational field equation in $f\left( Q\right) $-gravity admits a minisuperspace description the Wheeler-DeWitt equation is a single inhomogeneous partial differential equations. We assume the power-law $f\left( Q\right) =f_{0}Q^{\mu}$ model and with the application of linear quantum observables we calculate the wavefunction of the universe. Finally, we investigate the effects of the quantum correction terms in the semi-classical limit.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Evaporation Process and Tangherlini-Reissner-Nordstr\"om Black Holes Shadow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the black hole evaporation process and shadow property of the Tangherlini-Reissner-Nordstr\"om (TRN) black holes. The TRN black holes are the higher-dimensional extension of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om (RN) black holes and are characterized by their mass $M$, charge $q$, and spacetime dimensions $D$. In higher-dimensional spacetime, the black hole evaporation occurs rapidly, causing the black hole's horizon to shrink. We derive the rate of mass loss for the higher-dimensional charged black hole and investigate the effect of higher-dimensional spacetime on charged black hole shadow. We derive the complete geodesic equations of motion with the effect of spacetime dimensions $D$. We determine impact parameters by maximizing the black hole's effective potential and estimate the critical radius of photon orbits. The photon orbits around the black hole shrink with the effect of the increasing number of spacetime dimensions. To visualize the shadows of the black hole, we derive the celestial coordinates in terms of the black hole parameters. We use the observed results of M87 and Sgr A$^{*}$ black hole from the Event Horizon Telescope and estimate the angular diameter of the charge black hole shadow in the higher-dimensional spacetime. We also estimate the energy emission rate of the black hole. Our finding shows that the angular diameter of the black hole shadow decreases with the increasing number of spacetime dimensions $D$.</description>

      <title>Probing Quantum Gravity Effects with Eccentric Extreme Mass-Ratio Inspirals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the impact of loop quantum gravity (LQG) on extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), and the results indicate that LQG effects cause the orbital decay to occur faster compared to the Schwarzschild case. Furthermore, we use the augmented analytic kludge approach to generate EMRI waveforms and study the LISA's capability to detect the LQG effect with faithfulness. Additionally, employing the Fisher information matrix method for parameter estimation, we estimate that after one year of observation, the uncertainty in $r_0$ reduces to approximately $6.59\times 10^{-4}$ with a signal-to-noise ratio of $49$.</description>

      <title>Black Holes, Complex Curves, and Graph Theory: Revising a Conjecture by Kasner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ratios $\sqrt{8/9}=2\sqrt{2}/3\approx 0.9428$ and $\sqrt{3}/2 \approx 0.866$ appear in various contexts of black hole physics, as values of the charge-to-mass ratio $Q/M$ or the rotation parameter $a/M$ for Reissner-Nordstr\"om and Kerr black holes, respectively. In this work, in the Reissner-Nordstr\"om case, I relate these ratios with the quantization of the horizon area, or equivalently of the entropy. Furthermore, these ratios are related to a century-old work of Kasner, in which he conjectured that certain sequences arising from complex analysis may have a quantum interpretation. These numbers also appear in the case of Kerr black holes, but the explanation is not as straightforward. The Kasner ratio may also be relevant for understanding the random matrix and random graph approaches to black hole physics, such as fast scrambling of quantum information, via a bound related to Ramanujan graph. Intriguingly, some other pure mathematical problems in complex analysis, notably complex interpolation in the unit disk, appear to share some mathematical expressions with the black hole problem and thus also involve the Kasner ratio.</description>

      <title>Generalized Komar charges and Smarr formulas for black holes and boson stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standard Komar charge is a $(d-2)$-form that can be defined in spacetimes admitting a Killing vector and which is closed when the vacuum Einstein equations are satisfied. Its integral at spatial infinity (the Komar integral) gives the conserved charge associated to the Killing vector, and, due to its on-shell closedness, the same value (expressed in terms of other physical variables) is obtained integrating over the event horizon (if any). This equality is the basis of the Smarr formula. This charge can be generalized so that it still is closed on-shell in presence of matter and its integrals give generalizations of the Smarr formula. We show how the Komar charge and other closed $(d-2)$-form charges can be used to prove non-existence theorems for gravitational solitons and boson stars. In particular, we show how one can deal with generalized symmetric fields (invariant under a combination of isometries and other global symmetries) and how the geralized symmetric ansatz permits to evade the non-existence theorems.</description>

      <title>Sagnac effect in a rotating ring with Dirac fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10497v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The observation of the Sagnac effect for massive material particles offers a significant enhancement in sensitivity when compared to optical interferometers with equal area and angular rotation velocity. For this reason, there have been suggestions to employ solid-state interferometers that rely on semiconductors and graphene. We investigate the Sagnac effect in Dirac materials governed by the relativisticlike quasiparticle dispersion law and show that the fringe shift is still determined by the mass of a free electron. This confirms that graphene is indeed a promising material for creating solid-state Sagnac interferometers. Considering monolayer graphene with its linear dispersion law and comparing it with light provides a deeper understanding of the Sagnac effect.</description>

      <title>Identifying sea and valence quarks in a magnetically driven catalysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present work we introduce a holographic prescription to independently describe sea and valence quarks in the context of the gauge/gravity correspondence. We use such prescription to perform an initial calculation that permits us to compare our results with those obtained through lattice techniques when studding magnetic catalysis and its inverse. We find, in agreement with previous studies, that the elaborated behavior of the condensate is mostly attributable to the sea quarks, rather than the valence which show a quite featureless participation.</description>

      <title>Poincare Invariance in Discrete Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A formulation of discrete gravity was recently proposed based on defining a lattice and a shift operator connecting the cells. Spinors on such a space will have rotational SO(d) invariance which is taken as the fundamental symmetry. Inspired by lattice QCD, discrete analogues of curvature and torsion were defined that go smoothly to the corresponding tensors in the continuous limit. In this paper, we show that the absence of diffeomorphism invariance could be replaced by requiring translational invariance in the tangent space by enlarging the tangent space from SO(d) to the inhomogeneous Lorentz group ISO(d) to include translations. We obtain the ISO(d) symmetry by taking instead the Lie group SO(d + 1) and to perform on it Inonu-Wigner contraction. We show that, just as for continuous spaces, the zero torsion constraint converts the translational parameter to a diffeomorphism parameter, thus explaining the effectiveness of this formulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the thermodynamics of Einstein gravity with vanishing cosmological constant subjected to conformal boundary conditions. Our focus is on comparing the series of subextensive terms to predictions from thermal effective field theory, with which we find agreement for the boundary theory on a spatial sphere, hyperbolic space, and flat space. We calculate the leading Wilson coefficients and observe that the first subextensive correction to the free energy is negative. This violates a conjectured bound on this coefficient in quantum field theory, which we interpret as a signal that gravity does not fully decouple in the putative boundary dual.</description>

      <title>Gravastars as Nontopological Solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a coupled system consisting of a complex scalar field, a U(1) gauge field, a complex Higgs scalar field, and Einstein gravity. We present nontopological soliton star solutions in which the interior geometry is described by the de Sitter metric, the exterior by the Schwarzschild metric, and these two regions are attached by a spherical surface layer with a finite thickness. This structure is the same as the so-called gravastars, so we refer to these solutions as \lq solitonic gravastars\rq . We demonstrate that compact solitonic gravastars that possessing photon spheres can appear. Additionally, we study the mass and compactness of solitonic gravastars for various sets of parameters that characterize the system.</description>

      <title>Charting the Nanohertz Gravitational Wave Sky with Pulsar Timing Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the summer of 2023, the pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) announced a compelling evidence for the existence of a nanohertz stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB). Despite this breakthrough, however, several critical questions remain unanswered: What is the source of the signal? How can cosmic variance be accounted for? To what extent can we constrain nanohertz gravity? When will individual supermassive black hole binaries become observable? And how can we achieve a stronger detection? These open questions have spurred significant interests in PTA science, making this an opportune moment to revisit the astronomical and theoretical foundations of the field, as well as the data analysis techniques employed. In this review, we focus on the theoretical aspects of the SGWB as detected by PTAs. We provide a comprehensive derivation of the expected signal and its correlation, presented in a pedagogical manner, while also addressing current constraints. Looking ahead, we explore future milestones in the field, with detailed discussions on emerging theoretical considerations such as cosmic variance, the cumulants of the one- and two-point functions, subluminal gravitational waves, and the anisotropy and polarization of the SGWB.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the Primordial Black Hole Abundance through Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves from Advanced LIGO and Virgo's First Three Observing Runs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a promising dark matter candidate, primordial black holes (PBHs) lighter than $\sim10^{-18}M_{\odot}$ are supposed to have evaporated by today through Hawking radiation. This scenario is challenged by the memory burden effect, which suggests that the evaporation of black holes may slow down significantly after they have emitted about half of their initial mass. We explore the astrophysical implications of the memory burden effect on the PBH abundance by today and the possibility for PBHs lighter than $\sim10^{-18}M_{\odot}$ to persist as dark matter. Our analysis utilizes current LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA data to constrain the primordial power spectrum and infers the PBH abundance. We find a null detection of scalar-induced gravitational waves that accompanied the formation of the PBHs. Then we place an upper limit on the primordial power spectrum and the PBH abundance to be $f_{\mathrm{pbh}}\simeq0.3$ for PBHs with masses $\sim10^{-24}M_{\odot}$. Furthermore, we expect that next-generation gravitational wave detectors, such as the Einstein Telescope and the Cosmic Explorer, will provide even more stringent constraints. Our results indicate that future detectors can reach sensitivities that could rule out PBH as dark matter within $\sim[10^{-29}M_{\odot},10^{-19}M_{\odot}]$ in the null detection of scalar-induced gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>On effective models of regular black holes inspired by higher-derivative and nonlocal gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.12251v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we study static spherically symmetric solutions of effective field equations related to local and nonlocal higher-derivative gravity models, based on their associated effective delta sources. This procedure has been applied to generate modifications of the Schwarzschild geometry in several contexts (e.g., modified gravity, string theory, noncommutative geometry, generalized uncertainty principle scenarios), but a general analysis of the possible equations of state and their influence on the solutions was still lacking. Here, we aim to fill this gap in the literature and investigate whether these metrics might be able to reproduce features of the solutions of higher-derivative gravity models. In particular, we present an equation of state such that the solution matches the Newtonian-limit one in both regimes of large and small $r$. A significant part of the work is dedicated to studying the curvature regularity of the solutions and the comparison with the linearized solutions. Explicit metrics are presented for effective sources originating from local and nonlocal models. The results obtained here might be regarded as possible links between the previous research on linearized higher-derivative gravity and the solutions of the nonlinear complete field equations, which remain unknown at the moment.</description>

      <title>Iterative extraction of overtones from black hole ringdown</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extraction of multiple quasinormal modes from ringdown gravitational waves emitted from a binary black hole coalescence is a touchstone to test whether a remnant black hole is described by the Kerr spacetime in general relativity. However, it is not straightforward to check the consistency between the ringdown signal and the quasinormal mode frequencies predicted by the linear perturbation theory. While the longest-lived mode can be extracted in a stable manner, the higher overtones damp more quickly and hence the fitting of overtones tends to end up with the overfit. To improve the extraction of overtones, we propose an iterative procedure consisting of fitting and subtraction of the longest-lived mode of the ringdown waveform in the time domain. Through the analyses of the mock waveform and numerical relativity waveform, we clarify that the iterative procedure allows us to extract the overtones in a more stable manner.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03607v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Boundary-to-Bound (B2B) correspondence, which connects orbital and radiative observables between bound and unbound orbits, has recently been introduced and demonstrated in the perturbative regime. We produce a large number of numerical relativity simulations of bound and unbound encounters between two nonspinning equal mass black holes in order to test this correspondence in the non-perturbative regime. We focus on testing the radiated energy and angular momentum, as well as orbital parameters such as the period and periastron advance. We find that, across a wide range of eccentricities, the B2B relationships do not hold in the non-perturbative regime, thereby placing a clear limit on the applicability of these relationships. We also approximate the separatrix between bound and unbound relativistic encounters as a function of their initial energies and angular momenta.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmological models can be studied effectively using dynamical systems techniques. Starting from Brown's formulation of the variational principle for relativistic fluids, we introduce new types of couplings involving a perfect fluid, a scalar field, and boundary terms. We describe three different coupling models, one of which turns out to be particularly relevant for cosmology. Its behaviour is similar to that of models in which dark matter decays into dark energy. In particular, for a constant coupling, the model mimics well-known dynamical dark energy models while the non-constant couplings offer a rich dynamical structure, unseen before. We are able to achieve this richness whilst working in a two-dimensional phase space. This is a significant advantage which allows us to provide a clear physical interpretation of the key features and draw analogies with previously studied models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08740v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the dynamical stability of Proca-Higgs stars, in spherical symmetry. These are solutions of the Einstein-Proca-Higgs model, which features a Higgs-like field coupled to a Proca field, both of which minimally coupled to the gravitational field. The corresponding stars can be regarded as Proca stars with self-interactions, while avoiding the hyperbolicity issues of self-interacting Einstein-Proca models. We report that these configurations are stable near the Proca limit in the candidate stable branches, but exhibit instabilities in certain parts of the parameter space, even in the candidate stable branches, regaining their stability for very strong self-interactions. This shows that for these models, unlike various examples of scalar boson stars, self-interactions can deteriorate, rather than improve, the dynamical robustness of bosonic stars.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a new class of two dimensional gravity models using ideas motivated by the Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity. This leads to a rather natural formulation of a theory that has close links with Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity. After introducing the theory and discussing its vacuum solutions, we present the Hamiltonian analysis. This implies the presence of a single dynamical degree of freedom, which is in sharp contrast to General Relativity, where there are no degrees of freedom in two spacetime dimensions. Our approach can be extended to various other lower-dimensional gravity theories and thus could be of wider interest.</description>

      <title>The deceleration parameter in perturbed Bianchi universes with a peculiar-velocity "tilt"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bianchi cosmologies are ``natural'' anisotropic extensions of the Friedmann universes and they have long been used to investigate the cosmological implications of anisotropy. The latter introduces new ingredients to the standard scenarios, although there are physical processes and effects that maintain their basic Friedmann features when extended to Bianchi universes. Here, we assume a perturbed Bianchi model and look into the implications of the observers' peculiar flow for their measurement and their interpretation of the deceleration parameter. Our motivation is twofold. To begin with, relative motions have long been known to deceive the observers by ``contaminating'' the observations, which also still suffer from sample limitations that cloud the statistical significance of the findings. Further motivation comes from claims that observers in bulk flows that expand slightly slower than their surroundings can have the illusion of cosmic acceleration in a universe that is actually decelerating. The claim was originally based on studies of a perturbed tilted Einstein-de Sitter model, but persisted when the background cosmology was replaced by any of the three Friedmann universes. This raised the possibility that the peculiar-motion effect on the deceleration parameter may be generic and largely independent of the host spacetime. Here, we investigate this possibility by extending the earlier studies to perturbed Bianchi models. We find that the Friedmann picture remains unchanged, unless the Bianchi background has unrealistically high anisotropy. The bulk-flow observers can still be misled to the illusion of accelerated expansion by their own peculiar motion.</description>

Abstract: We identify an anisotropic divergence-free conformal Killing tensor $K_{jl}$ for static spherically symmetric spacetimes, and write the conformal Killing gravity equations as Einstein equations augmented by this tensor. The field equations are of second order: this fact allows for analytic solutions and considerably simplifies the derivation of results of previous studies based on the original Harada equations. In particular, we prove the equivalence of the known third order field equations, with the second order ones obtained by us in the conformal Killing parametrization. The structure of the Ricci tensor and of the conformal Killing tensor are compatible with both anisotropic fluid sources and (non)-linear electrodynamics. We reobtain covariantly and in simple steps the general static spherical solutions for vacuum and linear electrodynamics. Moreover we recover the purely magnetic Lagrangian functions that induce metrics of interest for black holes.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Anisotropy and Bianchi Characterization: Killing vector fields and the implied finding of their metric frame</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On the largest scales the universe appears to be almost perfectly homogeneous and isotropic, adhering to the cosmological principle. On smaller scales inhomogeneities and anisotropies become increasingly prominent, reflecting the origin, emergence and formation of structure in the Universe and its cosmological impact. Also, a range of tensions between various cosmological observations may suggest it to be necessary to explore the consequences of such deviations from the ideal uniform universe. In this study, we restrict this to an investigation of anisotropies on the nature of the Universe. This motivates a more thorough understanding of the manifestation of anisotropy in cosmological applications. When letting go of the assumption of isotropy, spacetime metrics become homogeneous and completely anisotropic. As such, the Lie algebras of Killing vector fields will be 3D, and fit into the so-called 9-part Bianchi classification. This work strives to, given a suitable 3D Lie algebra of vector fields $\{\xi_a\}_{a=1,2,3}$ reconstruct the basis for a metric on which this Lie algebra is Killing. Through finding a determining equation for the frame invariant under $\{\xi_a\}$ and using the method of characteristics to solve it, expressions for said invariant frame in terms of the $\{\xi_a\}$ are obtained. This leads to general equations for the invariant frame in terms of the $\{\xi_a\}$, organized by Bianchi class. Some examples demonstrating this method are worked out.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we investigate the quasinormal modes, pseudospectrum and time evolution of a massive vector field around a quantum corrected black hole in de-Sitter spacetime. We start by parameterization and using orthonormal tetrads to get the effective potential. Methodologically we use the hyperboloidal framework together with discretizing the non-selfadjoint operator through Chebyshev-Gauss-Labatto grid to attain the QNMs. We explore the parametric instability of QNMs caused by quantum correction, cosmological constant and Proca mass, and these three factors show very different influences on the QNMs' migration flow. On the other hand, we discuss the instability of QNMs with arbitrary-shape perturbation and the effectiveness of numerical results through pseudospectrum. We use high frequency approximation to attain the expression of the time domain Green function and clarify the origin of two different stages in time evolution. Through numerical methods we confirm that no power-law late time tail is expected, and the possible impact on time evolution caused by quantum correction is discussed.</description>

      <title>Parametrized-Post-Newtonian Test of Black Hole Spacetime for Galactic Center Massive Black Hole Sgr A*: Formulation and $\chi^2$ Fitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11284v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have performed a parametrized post-Newtonian (PPN) test of a black hole spacetime using observational data of the star S0-2/S2 orbiting the massive black hole at our galactic center Sgr A*. After introducing our PPN model of black hole spacetime, we report the result of $\chi^2$ fitting of the PPN model with the observational data. A new finding through our PPN model is a detectability of the gravitational lens effect on the null geodesics connecting S0-2 and observer under the present observational uncertainties, if a PPN parameter is about one order larger than the value for general relativity case. On the other hand, the effect of black hole spin on the S0-2's motion is not detectable. Thus our present PPN test is performed with spherically symmetric vacuum black hole spacetime. The resultant value of the PPN parameter, which corresponds to the minimum $\chi^2$, implies that the gravitational field of Sgr A* is not of Schwarzschild metric or that there exists a sufficient amount of dark matters around Sgr A* to be detected by present telescopes. However, the difference between the minimum $\chi^2$ and the $\chi^2$ of Schwarzschild case is not large enough to ensure a statistical significance of non-Schwarzschild result. A more precise statistical analysis than $\chi^2$ statistics is necessary to extract a statistically significant information of the gravitational field of Sgr A* from present observational data. We will report a result by a Bayesian analysis in next paper.</description>

      <title>Graviscalar quasinormal modes and asymptotic tails of a thick brane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the graviscalar quasinormal modes (QNMs) and their asymptotic tail behavior of a thick brane. Considering the scalar perturbations of the thick brane metric, we obtain the main equations of graviscalar Kaluza-Klein modes. Based on these equations, the frequencies of the graviscalar QNMs of the thick brane are obtained by the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin, asymptotic iteration, and numerical evolution methods. The results show that the scalar fluctuation of the thick brane has a series of discrete QNMs, similar to the tensor perturbation of the brane. These modes appear as decaying massive scalar particles in four-dimensional spacetime. We also studied in detail the late time tails of these QNMs and found that some modes have slowly decaying oscillatory tails that may be new sources of the gravitational wave backgrounds. Obviously, the QNMs contain the information of the brane and are characteristic modes of the thick brane.</description>

      <title>From Einstein to Horndeski: Holographic Transport Coefficients in Modified Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.06550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2006.06550v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the holographic computation of bulk and shear viscosity ratios in strongly coupled thermal plasmas using the AdS/BCFT correspondence within Horndeski gravity. We demonstrate that this framework leads to non-zero viscosity-to-entropy ratios ($\zeta/S$ and $\eta/S$) at low temperatures, indicating a break in conformal symmetry. At high temperatures, these ratios approach zero, recovering the expected conformal behavior of quark-gluon plasma. Our findings provide new insights into the hydrodynamic properties of strongly coupled plasmas and offer a more nuanced understanding of QCD-like theories in holographic models.</description>

      <title>Cosmological constraints on $R^2$-corrected Appleby-Battye model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.06392v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nowadays, efforts are being devoted to the study of alternative cosmological scenarios in which modifications of General Relativity have been proposed to explain the late cosmic acceleration without assuming the existence of dark energy. In this scenario, we investigate the $R^2$-AB model, which consists of an $f(R)$ model with only one extra free parameter, $b$, in addition to the 6 of the flat-$\Lambda$CDM. Regarding this model, it was already shown that a positive value for $b$ is required for the model to be consistent with Solar System tests, moreover, the condition for the existence of a de~Sitter state requires $b \ge 1.6$. To impose observational constraints on the $R^2$-AB model we consider three datasets: 31 $H(z)$ measurements from Cosmic Chronometers (CC), 20 $[{f\sigma}_{8}](z)$ measurements from Redshift-Space Distortion (RSD), and the most recent type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) sample from Pantheon+. Next, we perform two different analyses: we have considered only SNe Ia data and the combined likelihood SNe+CC+RSD. The first one has provided $b=2.28^{+6.52}_{-0.55}$, while the second one $b=2.18^{+5.41}_{-0.55}$. In the first case it was necessary to set the absolute magnitude $M_B = -19.253$ from SH0ES collaboration, while in the second we did a marginalization over the Hubble constant $H_0$ in the normalized growth function. We have also observed that the $H_0-M_B$ degeneracy was broken by adding CC data to the SNe data. Additionally, we perform illustrative analyses that compare this $f(R)$ model with the flat-$\Lambda$CDM model, considering several values of the parameter $b$, for diverse cosmological functions like the Hubble function $H(z)$, the equation of state $w_{\rm eff}(z)$, the parametrized growth rate of cosmic structures $[f\sigma_8](z)$, and $\sigma_8(z)$. We conclude that the model fits well the data, but the parameter $b$ was not unambiguously constrained.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15233v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently we have constructed a completely supersymmetric nonlinear action possessing the properties expected from multiple D0-brane system. Its quantization should result in an interesting supersymmetric field theory in the (super)space with additional matrix coordinates which can provide an important insights in the study of String Theory. As a first stage toward this aim, in this paper we construct the Hamiltonian mechanics and perform covariant quantization of the simplest three dimensional counterpart of the ten dimensional multiple D0-brane model. We obtain a supersymmetric system of equations in super-spacetime enlarged by bosonic and fermionic matrix coordinates which appears as a result of such quantization and discuss some of its properties.</description>

      <title>Phantom matter: a challenging solution to the cosmological tensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18845v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The idea of composite dark energy (DE) is quite natural since on general grounds we expect that the vacuum energy density (associated with the cosmological term $\Lambda$) may appear in combination with other effective forms of DE, denoted X. Here we deal with model $w$XCDM, a simplified version of the old $\Lambda$XCDM model (Grande et al., 2006), and exploit the possibility that X behaves as `phantom matter' (PM), which appears in stringy versions of the running vacuum model (RVM). Unlike phantom DE, the PM fluid satisfies the strong energy condition like usual matter, hence bringing to bear positive pressure at the expense of negative energy. Bubbles of PM may appear in the manner of a transitory `phantom vacuum' tunneled into the late universe before it heads towards a new de Sitter era, thereby offering a crop field for the growing of structures earlier than expected. Using SNIa, cosmic chronometers, transversal BAO (BAO 2D), LSS data and the full CMB likelihood from Planck 2018, we find that the $H_0$ and growth tensions virtually disappear, provided that BAO 2D are the only source of BAO data used in the fit. In contrast, our preliminary analysis using exclusively anisotropic BAO (BAO 3D) indicates that the ability to ease the $H_0$ tension is significantly reduced as compared to the scenario with BAO 2D, despite the fact that the overall fit to the cosmological data is still better than in the $\Lambda$CDM. Finally, our approach with BAO 2D favors quintessence-like behavior of the DE below $z\simeq 1.5$ at $\gtrsim 3\sigma$ CL, which is compatible with the recent DESI measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05617v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We resolve black hole information paradox within semiclassical gravity, in a manner that does not depend on details of unknown quantum gravity. Our crucial insight is that outgoing Hawking particles are physical only far from the black hole horizon, so they are created far from the horizon and entangled with degrees of freedom closer to the horizon. The latter degrees of freedom can be understood as quasi-classical coherent states, implying that Hawking radiation is accompanied with additional radiation similar to classical radiation by which the black hole loses hair during the classical gravitational collapse. The two kinds of radiation are entangled, which resolves black hole information paradox.</description>

      <title>Fingerprints of a Non-Inflationary Universe from Massive Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11016v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct explicit models of classical primordial standard clocks in an alternative to inflation, namely the slowly contracting ekpyrotic scenario. We study the phenomenology of massive spectator fields added to a state-of-the-art ekpyrotic model, with coupling functions that allow for these heavy fields to be classically excited while the background is slowly contracting. We perform numerical computations of the corrections to the scalar primordial power spectrum and compare with analytical estimates. Our full numerical results reveal so-called clock signals, sharp feature signals, as well as signals that link the two together. The models are found to predict oscillatory features that are resolutely different from what is calculated in inflation, and thus, such features represent unique fingerprints of a slowly contracting universe. This confirms the capability of primordial standard clocks to model-independently discriminate among very early universe scenarios.</description>

Abstract: Anti-de Sitter vacuum, which correspond to a negative cosmological constant (CC), is theoretically important and well-motivated. However, whether it exists in reality or not has always been a controversial issue. In this paper, we perform the search for the negative CC using recent Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) baryon acoustic oscillation measurements combined with Planck cosmic microwave background and Pantheon Plus supernova data. Though we did not find the evidence for negative CC, we observed the indication for it, the negative CC is preferred at $&gt;68\%$ significance level, while such a negative CC can make the state equation of evolving dark energy component (coexisting with negative CC) $w\geqslant -1$. Our work highlights the potential of upcoming cosmological surveys to search for the negative CC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07748v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the gravitational dual of a fermionic field theory at finite temperature and charge density in two spatial dimensions, subject to a deformation by a relevant scalar operator. This makes a $(3+1)$-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell system coupled to a free fermion fluid, known as an electron cloud, undergo a holographic renormalization group flow. The inner (Cauchy) horizon is destroyed and the near-singularity metric instead adopts the form of a positive-$p_t$ Kasner cosmology, signaling the collapse of the Einstein-Rosen bridge. Previous studies have suggested that this collapse hinders direct probing of the singularity. Nonetheless, we propose and compute several CFT observables that characterize the interior and near-singularity geometries. These include the thermal $a$-function, which decays with a specific power of $p_t$ as nearly all CFT degrees of freedom are integrated out, and two-point correlators for neutral and charged operators, with the latter directly probing the singularity despite the positive-$p_t$. We also calculate characteristic velocities related to entanglement and complexity growth in the time-evolved thermofield double state, as well as the butterfly effect indicative of operator spreading. Notably, the deformed electron cloud features a Lifshitz IR fixed point and an additional Kasner trans-IR fixed point, absent in neutral RG flows.</description>

      <title>Implications of Fermionic Dark Matter Interactions on Anisotropic Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14020v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The presence of Dark matter (DM) within a neutron star (NS) can substantially influence the macroscopic properties. It is commonly assumed that the pressure inside an NS is isotropic, but in reality, pressure is locally anisotropic. This study explores the properties of anisotropic NS with a subfraction of DM (isotropic) trapped inside. Implementing a two-fluid formalism with three Equations of State (EOS): AP3 (a realistic nucleon-nucleon interaction model), BSk22 (modeling atomic nuclei and neutron-matter), and MPA1 (considering relativistic effects in nuclear interactions). The properties of NS, such as mass ($M$), radius ($R$), and dimensionless tidal deformability ($\Lambda$), for various DM-anisotropic configurations, have been rigorously tested against observational constraints. These constraints include data from the binary NS merger GW170817, NICER x-ray measurements, and pulsar mass-radius observations. We observe that with increasing DM subfraction, higher anisotropies could also satisfy the observational constraints. Furthermore, increasing the coupling ($g$) between DM and its mediator leads to the formation of a core-halo structure, with a DM halo surrounding the baryonic matter (BM). Specifically, for coupling values of $g = 10^{-4}$, $10^{-3.7}$, and $10^{-3.5}$, we observe that the maximum radius ($R_{max}$) decreases with increasing anisotropy, which contrasts with the behavior at $g = 10^{-5}$ and in scenarios with no DM. Our analysis indicates that binary pulsar systems could potentially constrain the extent of admixed anisotropic NS or, more optimistically, provide evidence for the existence of DM-admixed anisotropic NS.</description>

      <title>Kasner eons with matter: holographic excursions to the black hole singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14535v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent work has shown that introducing higher-curvature terms to the Einstein-Hilbert action causes the approach to a space-like singularity to unfold as a sequence of Kasner eons. Each eon is dominated by emergent physics at an energy scale controlled by higher-curvature terms of a given order, transitioning to higher-order eons as the singularity is approached. The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, we demonstrate that the inclusion of matter dramatically modifies the physics of eons compared to the vacuum case. We illustrate this by considering a family of quasi-topological gravities of arbitrary order minimally coupled to a scalar field. Second, we investigate Kasner eons in the interior of black holes with field theory duals and analyze their imprints on holographic observables. We show that the behavior of the thermal $a$-function, two-point functions of heavy operators, and holographic complexity can capture distinct signatures of the eons, making them promising tools for diagnosing stringy effects near black hole singularities.</description>

      <title>Energy-dependent intrinsic time delay of gamma-ray bursts on testing Lorentz invariance violation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14719v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-energy photons of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) might be emitted at different intrinsic times with energy dependence at the source. In this letter, we expand the model from previous works on testing the Lorentz Invariance Violation (LV) with the observed GRB data from the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. We reanalyze the previous data with the full Bayesian parameter estimation method and get consistent results by assuming that the time delays are due to an LV term and a constant intrinsic time delay term. Subsequently, we neglect the LV effect and only consider the intrinsic time delay effect. We assume a common intrinsic time delay term along with a source energy correlated time delay of high-energy photons. We find that the energy-dependent emission times can also explain the observed GRB data of high-energy photon events. Finally, we integrate these two physical mechanisms into a unified model to distinguish and evaluate their respective contributions using the observed GRB data.</description>

      <title>Intrinsically-defined higher-derivative Carrollian scalar field theories without Ostrogradsky instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03648v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the most generic Carrollian higher derivative free scalar field theory intrinsically on a Carrollian manifold. The solutions to these theories are massless free particles propagating with speeds depending on the coupling constants in the Lagrangian, thus, allowing interference solutions which are not allowed on a Lorentzian manifold. This demonstrates that the set of solutions to the Carrollian theories is much larger than that of their Lorentzian counterparts. We also show that Carrollian higher derivative theories are more resistant to Ostrogradsky's instabilities. These instabilities can be resolved by choosing the coupling constants appropriately in the Carrollian Lagrangian, something that was proven to be impossible in Lorentzian theories.</description>

      <title>Microscopic entropy of static black holes in 3d Lovelock gravities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03865v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a microscopic derivation of the semi-classical entropy of static black holes in 3d Lovelock gravities, which are certain 3d Horndeski theories that were recently discovered from higher-dimensional Lovelock gravities via various methods and admit novel black hole solutions analogous to higher-dimensional ones. Assuming the ground state is described by the soliton obtained from the black hole solution by performing a double Wick rotation, we reproduce the semi-classical entropy from Cardy formula without central charges for the asymptotic growth of the number of states. We explain in detail how the mass of the soliton, which is needed in the Cardy formula, can be computed in the mini-superspace formalism.</description>
