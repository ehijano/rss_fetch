      <title>Fabrication-Directed Entanglement for Designing Chiral and Anisotropic Metamaterial Foams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entangled networks are fundamental in various systems, from biological structures to engineered materials. Current techniques for programming entanglement often rely on intricate chemistry or result in statistically homogeneous networks, limiting the ability to create spatially patterned structures with precisely engineered functions. Thus, a key challenge remains in developing approaches to program complex mechanical behaviors, such as anisotropy and chirality, within monolithic entangled structures. This work introduces Fabrication-Directed Entanglement (FDE), a methodology integrating viscous thread printing (VTP) and topology optimization (TO) to program the entanglement of a single homogeneous filament. By spatially adjusting VTP parameters (deposition height, speed), we control local coiling density, creating quasi-two-phase (dense/sparse) regions within a monolithic entangled foam. Topology optimization guides the placement of these regions to achieve target macroscopic mechanical properties. Here we show foam-like mechanical metamaterials with tunable compliance, rigidity, and chirality. Experimental testing and simulation confirm that FDE expands the achievable material property space compared to homogeneous VTP foams, enabling properties like tunable directional stiffness, Poisson's ratios from $\nu\approx0.06~\text{to}~0.56$, and novel significant normal-shear coupling ($\eta_{212}\approx0.72$) from a single base material. This approach offers a viable new pathway for designing complex, functional entangled foam structures with tailored mechanical behaviors.</description>

      <title>Direct integration of atomic precision advanced manufacturing into middle-of-line silicon fabrication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomic precision advanced manufacturing (APAM) dopes silicon with enough carriers to change its electronic structure, and can be used to create novel devices by defining metallic regions whose boundaries have single-atom abruptness. Incompatibility with the thermal and lithography process requirements for gated silicon transistor manufacturing have inhibited exploration of both how APAM can enhance CMOS performance, and how transistor manufacturing steps can accelerate the discovery of new APAM device concepts. In this work, we introduce an APAM process that enables direct integration into the middle of a transistor manufacturing workflow. We show that a process that combines sputtering and annealing with a hardmask preserves a defining characteristic of APAM, a doping density far in excess of the solid solubility limit, while trading another, the atomic precision, for compatibility with manufacturing. The electrical characteristics of a chip combining a transistor with an APAM resistor show the APAM module has only affected the transistor through the addition of a resistance, and not by altering the transistor. This proof-of-concept demonstration also outlines the requirements and limitations of a unified APAM tool which could be introduced into manufacturing environments, greatly expanding access to this technology, and inspiring a new generation of devices with it.</description>

      <title>Magnetic-field dependent VB- spin decoherence in hexagonal boron nitrides: A first-principles study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The negatively charged boron vacancy (VB-) in h-BN operates as an optically addressable spin qubit in two-dimensional materials. To further advance the spin into a versatile qubit platform, it is imperative to understand its spin decoherence precisely, which is currently one of the major limiting factors for the VB- spin. In this study, we employ a first-principles quantum many-body simulation to investigate the decoherence of the VB- spin in dense nuclear spin baths as a function of magnetic field from 100 G to 3 T, revealing several unique phenomena and their origin. We found that decoherence mechanism changes at a specific magnetic field, which we refer to as the transition boundary (TB). Below the TB, the decoherence occurs within submicrosecond and it is primarily governed by independent nuclear spin dynamics. Above the TB, pair-wise flip-flop transitions become the dominant decoherence source, leading to the decoherence time of tens of microseconds. Building upon this understanding, we developed a method to predict the TB depending on the isotopic composition of h-BN, leading to TBs at 5020 G for h-10B14N and 2050 G for h-11B14N, which is in excellent agreement with our numerical results. We show that the larger TB in h-10BN derives from the larger nuclear spin of 10B than that of 11B, giving rise to strong nuclear modulation effects over a wider range of magnetic field in 10BN than in 11BN. We also explain the microscopic origin of several unique features in the decoherence, such as magnetic-field insensitive fast modulation found below the TB. Our results provide essential insight on the role of the 100% dense nuclear spin environment with large nuclear spins in the VB- decoherence, opening a new avenue for advancing the spin qubit in h-BN as robust platform in quantum information science.</description>

      <title>Fabrication-tolerant frequency conversion in thin film lithium niobate waveguide with layer-poled modal phase matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thanks to its high quadratic nonlinear susceptibilty and low propagation losses, thin film lithium niobate (TFLN) on insulator is an ideal platform for laser frequency conversion and generation of quantum states of light. Frequency conversion is usually achieved by quasi-phase matching (QPM) via electric-field poling. However, this scheme shows very high sensitivity to the dimensions of the waveguide, poling period and duty cycle, resulting in a lack of repeatability of the phase matched wavelength and efficiency, which in turn limits the spread of TFLN frequency converters in complex circuits and hinders wafer-scale production. Here we propose a layer-poled modal phase matching (MPM) that is 5 to 10 times more robust towards fabrication uncertainties and theoretically more efficient than conventional QPM. By selectively poling the bottom part of the waveguide all along its length, second harmonic is efficiently generated on a higher order waveguide's mode. We validate this approach by poling TFLN waveguides as a post-process after the fabrication in a foundry process. We perform a tolerance analysis and compare the experimental results with conventional QPM second harmonic generation process on the same waveguides. Then, we show how MPM can be exploited to obtain efficient intraband frequency conversion processes at telecom wavelengths by leveraging simultaneous second harmonic and difference frequency generation in the same waveguide.</description>

Abstract: Recycling textile fibers is critical to reducing the environmental impact of the textile industry. Hyperspectral near-infrared (NIR) imaging combined with advanced deep learning algorithms offers a promising solution for efficient fiber classification and sorting. In this study, we investigate supervised and unsupervised deep learning models and test their generalization capabilities on different textile structures. We show that optimized convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and autoencoder networks achieve robust generalization under varying conditions. These results highlight the potential of hyperspectral imaging and deep learning to advance sustainable textile recycling through accurate and robust classification.</description>

      <title>Design of A Single Antenna With Tunable In-Band RCS Null Through Load Impedance Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17415v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reducing the in-band radar cross section (RCS) of antennas has been a widely concerned problem. However, most of works focus on RCS reduction of antenna arrays, or need to additionally increase the size of a single antenna. Therefore, this work presents a method to control the null of the in-band RCS by changing the load impedance of the antenna without additional aperture. Then, the monostatic and bistatic RCS can be effectively reduced. First, the relationship between the null position and the load impedance is calculated by analyzing the in-band scattering field of the antenna. Second, the performance of RCS null control is verified by the traditional patch antenna, whose operating frequency is designed at 2 GHz. The load impedance of the antenna is controlled by cascading an open circuit stub of different lengths on the feeding line. Simulated results show that the proposed method can tune the null of in-band RCS from 0o to 60o under linear polarized normally incident plane wave. By setting the null reasonably, it can achieve 10 dB reduction for both monostatic and bistatic RCS at the same time. Moreover, the radiation performance of the antenna basically remains unchanged, and the gain is greater than 6.5 dBi. Measured results verify the effectiveness of the design method.</description>

      <title>A 3.584 Tbps coherent receiver chip on InP-LiNbO3 wafer-level integration platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02878</link>

Abstract: The rapid advancement of the thin-film lithium niobate (LiNbO3) platform has established it as a premier choice for high-performance photonics integrated circuits. However, the scalability and cost-efficiency of this platform are hindered by the reliance on chip-level fabrication and integration for passive and active components, necessitating a robust wafer-level LiNbO3 heterogeneous integration platform. Despite its critical role in enabling ultrahigh-speed optical interconnects, as well as optical mmWave/THz sensing and communication, the realization of ultrahigh-speed photodiodes and optical coherent receivers on the LiNbO_3 platform remains an unresolved challenge. This is primarily due to the challenges associated with the large-scale integration of direct-bandgap materials. To address these challenges, we have developed a scalable, high-speed InP-LiNbO3 wafer-level heterogeneous integration platform. This platform facilitates the fabrication of ultrahigh-speed photodiodes with a bandwidth of 140 GHz, capable of receiving high-quality 100-Gbaud pulse amplitude modulation (PAM4) signals. Moreover, we demonstrate a seven-channel, single-polarization I-Q coherent receiver chip with an aggregate receiving capacity of 3.584 Tbit/s. This coherent receiver exhibits a balanced detection bandwidth of 60 GHz and a common mode rejection ratio (CMRR) exceeding 20 dB. It achieves receiving capacities of 600 Gbit/s/\lambda with a 100-Gbaud 64-QAM signal and 512 Gbit/s/\lambda with a 128-Gbaud 16-QAM signal. Furthermore, energy consumption as low as 9.6 fJ/bit and 13.5 fJ/bit is achieved for 200 Gbit/s and 400 Gbit/s capacities, respectively. Our work provides a viable pathway toward enabling Pbps hyperscale data center interconnects, as well as optical mmWave/THz sensing and communication.</description>

      <title>Multifunctional 2d infrared photodetectors enabled by asymmetric singular metasurfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06480v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional materials offering ultrafast photoresponse suffer from low intrinsic absorbance, especially in the mid-infrared wavelength range. Challenges in 2d material doping further complicate the creation of light-sensitive $p-n$ junctions. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a graphene-based infrared detector with simultaneously enhanced absorption and strong structural asymmetry enabling zero-bias photocurrent. A key element for those properties is an asymmetric singular metasurface (ASMS) atop graphene with keen metal wedges providing singular enhancement of local absorbance. The ASMS geometry predefines extra device functionalities. The structures with connected metallic wedges demonstrate polarization ratios up to 200 in a broad range of carrier densities at a wavelength of 8.6 $\mu$m. The structures with isolated wedges display gate-controlled switching between polarization-discerning and polarization-stable photoresponse, a highly desirable yet scarce property for polarized imaging.</description>

      <title>Antiferromagnetic diamond network as an efficient spin filter: Proposition of a spin-specific semi-conducting behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10700v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose, for the first time, that an array of diamond plaquettes, each possessing vanishing net magnetization, can achieve complete spin polarization over a broad bias window. Furthermore, this system can be utilized to realize spin-specific semiconducting behavior. We describe the antiferromagnetic diamond network within a tight-binding framework, where spin-dependent scattering arises due to the interaction between itinerant electrons and local magnetic moments at different lattice sites. The mechanism underlying spin filtration relies on the specific arrangement of magnetic moments within individual plaquettes. We systematically investigate the spin polarization phenomenon under various input conditions, examining its dependence on network size, system temperature, and the magnetic flux threading each plaquette. Due to the network's geometry, we identify a sharply localized, highly degenerate energy level coexisting with conducting states. By tuning physical parameters, a small energy gap can be established between these degenerate localized states and the conducting energy band, enabling spin-specific $p$-type and $n$-type semiconducting behavior. Our findings offer a novel approach for designing future spintronic devices based on similar antiferromagnetic networks.</description>

      <title>Colossal Dielectric Response and Electric Polarization in Lithium Nitrate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19919v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lithium nitrate LiNO$_3$ is identified to possess a dielectric constant $\epsilon$' larger than 6x10$^6$ at 1 kHz in powder samples above the critical temperature $T$$_W$ = 306 K. For single crystalline samples, $\epsilon$' can be sustained to remain above 10$^5$ and the dissipation factor below 10 in the temperature region of 280-340 K after a simple 'activation' process. Moreover, pyroelectric current measurements show LiNO$_3$ to be ferroelectric with an electric polarization of $P$ = 1,200 $\mu$C/cm$^2$. Both $\epsilon$' and $P$ are amongst one of the highest in all known materials. We propose a model suggesting the mechanism underlying the colossal magnitudes of $\epsilon$' and $P$ to stem from a gearing-ungearing process of the planar NO$_3$$^-$ at the macroscopic level. Our results potentially push the boundaries of ceramic capacitors.</description>

      <title>Streaming Self-Corrected Dual-Comb Spectrometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07005v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We radically simplify coherently averaged dual-comb spectroscopy by introducing a real-time self-correction system: a radio frequency system-on-chip computes each incoming dual-comb interferogram's phase, frequency, and arrival time; calculates changes in the combs' carrier-envelope offset frequency and repetition rate difference; and immediately phase-corrects the incoming interferogram data stream. The algorithm supports up to 0.3 GHz interferogram frequency bandwidth and thus combines fast measurement times (corresponding to high detunings) with broadband optical detection. Using this system, we achieve comb-resolved spectroscopy with Fourier-limited linewidth, coherent averaging over arbitrarily long durations, and high signal-to-noise ratios (e.g., up to 2900 for 150 s averaging time). Iodine and acetylene spectroscopy yield excellent agreement with literature over an optical bandwidth of 10 THz in the visible and near-infrared. Common dual-comb spectroscopy self-correction requires a bright and continuous interferogram train. We lift this requirement by introducing cross-channel correction: the algorithm measures phase fluctuations from a reference channel and predicts and corrects their influence on a signal channel. This enables correcting unstable or intermittent signals (typical, e.g., in field measurements), or low-amplitude signals with amplified phase fluctuations (relevant for nonlinearly upconverted combs). The approach makes instantaneous dual-comb spectroscopy available to everyday applications.</description>

Abstract: Scaling of transistors has enabled continuous improvements in logic device performance, especially through materials engineering. However, surpassing horizontal limitations in chip manufacturing requires a vertical, third dimension. Three-dimensional integration of high-performance logic demands solving the challenge of low-temperature (less than 450{\deg}C) synthesis of high-mobility n-type and p-type semiconductor thin films for back-end-of-line (BEOL) compatible transistors. Metal oxides, particularly indium oxides alloyed with gallium and tungsten, are promising n-type channel materials, but suitable p-type materials for BEOL remain scarce. Zinc sulfide (ZnS), a wide band-gap semiconductor, shows room-temperature p-type conductivity when doped with copper and crystallizes below 400{\deg}C. Here, we report growth of crystalline ZnS thin films by pulsed laser deposition on amorphous and polycrystalline surfaces including silicon nitride, thermal silicon dioxide, yttrium oxide, hafnium dioxide, sapphire, platinum, and titanium nitride. X-ray diffraction reveals out-of-plane texturing across all surfaces, while grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering probes in-plane crystalline quality. Surface and interface properties are assessed using X-ray reflectivity and atomic force microscopy. Electrical characterization via J-V measurements (ZnS on Pt) and metal-oxide-semiconductor capacitor (ZnS on silicon dioxide) measurements show low leakage current ($10^{-5} A/cm^2$ at 0.40 MV/cm) and bilayer capacitor behavior, suggesting ZnS is highly intrinsic with minimal electrically active defects. Further work on doping ZnS with copper or other p-type elements is needed to realize ZnS as a dopable wide band-gap semiconductor for BEOL integration. This work demonstrates a novel thin-film growth method for sulfide semiconductors under BEOL-compatible conditions.</description>

      <title>Roughness-Limited Performance in Ultra-Low-Loss Lithium Niobate Cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01913v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Achieving low optical loss is critical for scaling complex photonic systems. Thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) offers strong electro-optic and nonlinear properties in a compact platform, making it ideal for quantum and nonlinear optics. While $Q$ factors above $10^7$ have been achieved, they remain below the intrinsic material limit. We present a systematic study of scattering losses due to roughness in TFLN racetrack cavities, isolating contributions from sidewall and interface roughness. Quality factors up to $27 \times 10^6$ are demonstrated in waveguides with widths of $2.2\lambda$ ($\sim3.5\,\mu$m), where interface roughness dominates, and up to $1.2 \times 10^7$ in narrower waveguides $0.8\lambda$ wide ($\sim1.2\,\mu$m), where sidewall roughness is the primary limitation. Our modeling framework, based on 3D wave simulations informed by AFM-measured roughness, is material-independent and broadly applicable across integrated photonic platforms.</description>

      <title>A Synergistic Framework of Nonlinear Acoustic Computing and Reinforcement Learning for Real-World Human-Robot Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01998v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework integrating nonlinear acoustic computing and reinforcement learning to enhance advanced human-robot interaction under complex noise and reverberation. Leveraging physically informed wave equations (e.g., Westervelt, KZK), the approach captures higher-order phenomena such as harmonic generation and shock formation. By embedding these models in a reinforcement learning-driven control loop, the system adaptively optimizes key parameters (e.g., absorption, beamforming) to mitigate multipath interference and non-stationary noise. Experimental evaluations, covering far-field localization, weak signal detection, and multilingual speech recognition, demonstrate that this hybrid strategy surpasses traditional linear methods and purely data-driven baselines, achieving superior noise suppression, minimal latency, and robust accuracy in demanding real-world scenarios. The proposed system demonstrates broad application prospects in AI hardware, robot, machine audition, artificial audition, and brain-machine interfaces.</description>
