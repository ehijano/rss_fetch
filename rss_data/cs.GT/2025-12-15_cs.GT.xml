      <title>Learning-Augmented Facility Location Mechanisms for the Envy Ratio Objective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The augmentation of algorithms with predictions of the optimal solution, such as from a machine-learning algorithm, has garnered significant attention in recent years, particularly in facility location problems. Moving beyond the traditional focus on utilitarian and egalitarian objectives, we design learning-augmented facility location mechanisms on a line for the envy ratio objective, a fairness metric defined as the maximum ratio between the utilities of any two agents. For the deterministic setting, we propose a mechanism which utilizes predictions to achieve $\alpha$-consistency and $\frac{\alpha}{\alpha - 1}$-robustness for a selected parameter $\alpha \in [1,2]$, and prove its optimality. We also resolve open questions raised by Ding et al. [10], devising a randomized mechanism without predictions to improve upon the best-known approximation ratio from $2$ to $1.8944$. Building upon these advancements, we construct a novel randomized mechanism which incorporates predictions to achieve improved performance guarantees.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the Economic Impact of Decentralization on Users</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We model the ultimate price paid by users of a decentralized ledger as resulting from a two-stage game where Miners (/Proposers/etc.) first purchase blockspace via a Tullock contest, and then price that space to users. When analyzing our distributed ledger model, we find:
  - A characterization of all possible pure equilibria (although pure equilibria are not guaranteed to exist).
  - A natural sufficient condition, implied by Regularity (a la [Mye81]), for existence of a ``market-clearing'' pure equilibrium where Miners choose to sell all space allocated by the Distributed Ledger Protocol, and that this equilibrium is unique.
  - The market share of the largest miner is the relevant ``measure of decentralization'' to determine whether a market-clearing pure equilibrium exists.
  - Block rewards do not impact users' prices at equilibrium, when pure equilibria exist. But, higher block rewards can cause pure equilibria to exist.
  We also discuss aspects of our model and how they relate to blockchains deployed in practice. For example, only ``patient'' users (who are happy for their transactions to enter the blockchain under any miner) would enjoy the conclusions highlighted by our model, whereas ``impatient'' users (who are interested only for their transaction to be included in the very next block) still face monopoly pricing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pseudovariety $\mathbf{DS}$ consists of all finite monoids whose regular $D$-classes form subsemigroups. We exhibit a uniform winning strategy for Synchronizer in the synchronization game on every synchronizing automaton whose transition monoid lies in $\mathbf{DS}$, and we prove that $\mathbf{DS}$ is the largest pseudovariety with this property.</description>

      <title>Attacking and Securing Community Detection: A Game-Theoretic Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been demonstrated that adversarial graphs, i.e., graphs with imperceptible perturbations, can cause deep graph models to fail on classification tasks. In this work, we extend the concept of adversarial graphs to the community detection problem, which is more challenging. We propose novel attack and defense techniques for community detection problem, with the objective of hiding targeted individuals from detection models and enhancing the robustness of community detection models, respectively. These techniques have many applications in real-world scenarios, for example, protecting personal privacy in social networks and understanding camouflage patterns in transaction networks. To simulate interactive attack and defense behaviors, we further propose a game-theoretic framework, called CD-GAME. One player is a graph attacker, while the other player is a Rayleigh Quotient defender. The CD-GAME models the mutual influence and feedback mechanisms between the attacker and the defender, revealing the dynamic evolutionary process of the game. Both players dynamically update their strategies until they reach the Nash equilibrium. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed attack and defense methods, and both outperform existing baselines by a significant margin. Furthermore, CD-GAME provides valuable insights for understanding interactive attack and defense scenarios in community detection problems. We found that in traditional single-step attack or defense, attacker tends to employ strategies that are most effective, but are easily detected and countered by defender. When the interactive game reaches a Nash equilibrium, attacker adopts more imperceptible strategies that can still achieve satisfactory attack effectiveness even after defense.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian of polymatrix zero-sum games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12609v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The understanding of a dynamical system's properties can be significantly advanced by establishing it as a Hamiltonian system and then systematically exploring its inherent symmetries. By formulating agents' strategies and cumulative payoffs as canonically conjugate variables, we identify the Hamiltonian function that generates the dynamics of poly-matrix zero-sum games. We reveal the symmetries of our Hamiltonian and derive the associated conserved quantities, showing how the conservation of probability and the invariance of the Fenchel coupling are intrinsically encoded within the system. Furthermore, we propose the dissipation FTRL (DFTRL) dynamics by introducing a perturbation that dissipates the Fenchel coupling, proving convergence to the Nash equilibrium and linking DFTRL to last-iterate convergent algorithms. Our results highlight the potential of Hamiltonian dynamics in uncovering the structural properties of learning dynamics in games, and pave the way for broader applications of Hamiltonian dynamics in game theory and machine learning.</description>

      <title>Classification in Equilibrium: Structure of Optimal Decision Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper characterizes optimal classification when individuals adjust their behavior in response to the classification rule. We model the interaction between a designer and a population as a Stackelberg game: the designer selects a classification rule anticipating how individuals will comply, cheat, or abstain in order to obtain a favorable classification. Under standard monotone likelihood ratio assumptions, and for a general set of classification objectives, optimal rules belong to a small and interpretable family--single-threshold and two-cut rules--that encompass both conventional and counterintuitive designs. Our results depart sharply from prior findings that optimal classifiers reward higher signals. In equilibrium, global accuracy can be maximized by rewarding those with lower likelihood ratios or by concentrating rewards or penalties in a middle band to improve informational quality. We further characterize classification objectives that rule out socially harmful equilibria that disincentivize compliance for some populations.</description>

      <title>Computing Evolutionarily Stable Strategies in Imperfect-Information Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10279v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an algorithm for computing evolutionarily stable strategies (ESSs) in symmetric perfect-recall extensive-form games of imperfect information. Our main algorithm is for two-player games, and we describe how it can be extended to multiplayer games. The algorithm is sound and computes all ESSs in nondegenerate games and a subset of them in degenerate games which contain an infinite continuum of symmetric Nash equilibria. The algorithm is anytime and can be stopped early to find one or more ESSs. We experiment on an imperfect-information cancer signaling game as well as random games to demonstrate scalability.</description>

      <title>Data as Voters: Core Set Selection Using Approval-Based Multi-Winner Voting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.09995v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to the core set/instance selection problem in machine learning. Our approach is based on recent results on (proportional) representation in approval-based multi-winner elections. In our model, instances play a double role as voters and candidates. The approval set of each instance in the training set (acting as a voter) is defined from the concept of local set, which already exists in the literature. We then select the election winners by using a representative voting rule, and such winners are the data instances kept in the reduced training set. We evaluate our approach in two experiments involving neural network classifiers and classic machine learning classifiers (KNN and SVM). Our experiments show that, in several cases, our approach improves the performance of state-of-the-art methods, and the differences are statistically significant.</description>

      <title>Small-Gain Nash: Certified Contraction to Nash Equilibria in Differentiable Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classical convergence guarantees for gradient-based learning in games require the pseudo-gradient to be (strongly) monotone in Euclidean geometry as shown by rosen(1965), a condition that often fails even in simple games with strong cross-player couplings. We introduce Small-Gain Nash (SGN), a block small-gain condition in a custom block-weighted geometry. SGN converts local curvature and cross-player Lipschitz coupling bounds into a tractable certificate of contraction. It constructs a weighted block metric in which the pseudo-gradient becomes strongly monotone on any region where these bounds hold, even when it is non-monotone in the Euclidean sense. The continuous flow is exponentially contracting in this designed geometry, and projected Euler and RK4 discretizations converge under explicit step-size bounds derived from the SGN margin and a local Lipschitz constant. Our analysis reveals a certified "timescale band", a non-asymptotic, metric-based certificate that plays a TTUR-like role: rather than forcing asymptotic timescale separation via vanishing, unequal step sizes, SGN identifies a finite band of relative metric weights for which a single-step-size dynamics is provably contractive. We validate the framework on quadratic games where Euclidean monotonicity analysis fails to predict convergence, but SGN successfully certifies it, and extend the construction to mirror/Fisher geometries for entropy-regularized policy gradient in Markov games. The result is an offline certification pipeline that estimates curvature, coupling, and Lipschitz parameters on compact regions, optimizes block weights to enlarge the SGN margin, and returns a structural, computable convergence certificate consisting of a metric, contraction rate, and safe step-sizes for non-monotone games.</description>

      <title>Understanding LLM Agent Behaviours via Game Theory: Strategy Recognition, Biases and Multi-Agent Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07462v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly operate as autonomous decision-makers in interactive and multi-agent systems and human societies, understanding their strategic behaviour has profound implications for safety, coordination, and the design of AI-driven social and economic infrastructures. Assessing such behaviour requires methods that capture not only what LLMs output, but the underlying intentions that guide their decisions. In this work, we extend the FAIRGAME framework to systematically evaluate LLM behaviour in repeated social dilemmas through two complementary advances: a payoff-scaled Prisoners Dilemma isolating sensitivity to incentive magnitude, and an integrated multi-agent Public Goods Game with dynamic payoffs and multi-agent histories. These environments reveal consistent behavioural signatures across models and languages, including incentive-sensitive cooperation, cross-linguistic divergence and end-game alignment toward defection. To interpret these patterns, we train traditional supervised classification models on canonical repeated-game strategies and apply them to FAIRGAME trajectories, showing that LLMs exhibit systematic, model- and language-dependent behavioural intentions, with linguistic framing at times exerting effects as strong as architectural differences. Together, these findings provide a unified methodological foundation for auditing LLMs as strategic agents and reveal systematic cooperation biases with direct implications for AI governance, collective decision-making, and the design of safe multi-agent systems.</description>
