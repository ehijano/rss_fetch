      <title>Bias Mitigation for AI-Feedback Loops in Recommender Systems: A Systematic Literature Review and Taxonomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommender systems continually retrain on user reactions to their own predictions, creating AI feedback loops that amplify biases and diminish fairness over time. Despite this well-known risk, most bias mitigation techniques are tested only on static splits, so their long-term fairness across multiple retraining rounds remains unclear. We therefore present a systematic literature review of bias mitigation methods that explicitly consider AI feedback loops and are validated in multi-round simulations or live A/B tests. Screening 347 papers yields 24 primary studies published between 2019-2025. Each study is coded on six dimensions: mitigation technique, biases addressed, dynamic testing set-up, evaluation focus, application domain, and ML task, organising them into a reusable taxonomy. The taxonomy offers industry practitioners a quick checklist for selecting robust methods and gives researchers a clear roadmap to the field's most urgent gaps. Examples include the shortage of shared simulators, varying evaluation metrics, and the fact that most studies report either fairness or performance; only six use both.</description>

      <title>Algorithm Adaptation Bias in Recommendation System Online Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online experiments (A/B tests) are widely regarded as the gold standard for evaluating recommender system variants and guiding launch decisions. However, a variety of biases can distort the results of the experiment and mislead decision-making. An underexplored but critical bias is algorithm adaptation effect. This bias arises from the flywheel dynamics among production models, user data, and training pipelines: new models are evaluated on user data whose distributions are shaped by the incumbent system or tested only in a small treatment group. As a result, the measured effect of a new product change in modeling and user experience in this constrained experimental setting can diverge substantially from its true impact in full deployment. In practice, the experiment results often favor the production variant with large traffic while underestimating the performance of the test variant with small traffic, which leads to missing opportunities to launch a true winning arm or underestimating the impact. This paper aims to raise awareness of algorithm adaptation bias, situate it within the broader landscape of RecSys evaluation biases, and motivate discussion of solutions that span experiment design, measurement, and adjustment. We detail the mechanisms of this bias, present empirical evidence from real-world experiments, and discuss potential methods for a more robust online evaluation.</description>

      <title>Beyond Negative Transfer: Disentangled Preference-Guided Diffusion for Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) leverages user behaviors across domains to enhance recommendation quality. However, naive aggregation of sequential signals can introduce conflicting domain-specific preferences, leading to negative transfer. While Sequential Recommendation (SR) already suffers from noisy behaviors such as misclicks and impulsive actions, CDSR further amplifies this issue due to domain heterogeneity arising from diverse item types and user intents. The core challenge is disentangling three intertwined signals: domain-invariant preferences, domain-specific preferences, and noise. Diffusion Models (DMs) offer a generative denoising framework well-suited for disentangling complex user preferences and enhancing robustness to noise. Their iterative refinement process enables gradual denoising, making them effective at capturing subtle preference signals. However, existing applications in recommendation face notable limitations: sequential DMs often conflate shared and domain-specific preferences, while cross-domain collaborative filtering DMs neglect temporal dynamics, limiting their ability to model evolving user preferences. To bridge these gaps, we propose \textbf{DPG-Diff}, a novel Disentangled Preference-Guided Diffusion Model, the first diffusion-based approach tailored for CDSR, to or best knowledge. DPG-Diff decomposes user preferences into domain-invariant and domain-specific components, which jointly guide the reverse diffusion process. This disentangled guidance enables robust cross-domain knowledge transfer, mitigates negative transfer, and filters sequential noise. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that DPG-Diff consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple metrics.</description>

      <title>ERank: Fusing Supervised Fine-Tuning and Reinforcement Learning for Effective and Efficient Text Reranking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text reranking models are a crucial component in modern systems like Retrieval-Augmented Generation, tasked with selecting the most relevant documents prior to generation. However, current Large Language Models (LLMs) powered rerankers often face a fundamental trade-off. On one hand, Supervised Fine-Tuning based pointwise methods that frame relevance as a binary classification task lack the necessary scoring discrimination, particularly for those built on reasoning LLMs. On the other hand, approaches designed for complex reasoning often employ powerful yet inefficient listwise formulations, rendering them impractical for low latency applications. To resolve this dilemma, we introduce ERank, a highly effective and efficient pointwise reranker built from a reasoning LLM that excels across diverse relevance scenarios. We propose a novel two-stage training pipeline that begins with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). In this stage, we move beyond binary labels and train the model generatively to output fine grained integer scores, which significantly enhances relevance discrimination. The model is then further refined using Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a novel, listwise derived reward. This technique instills global ranking awareness into the efficient pointwise architecture. We evaluate the ERank reranker on the BRIGHT, FollowIR, TREC DL, and BEIR benchmarks, demonstrating superior effectiveness and robustness compared to existing approaches. On the reasoning-intensive BRIGHT benchmark, our ERank-4B achieves an nDCG@10 of 38.7, while a larger 32B variant reaches a state of the art nDCG@10 of 40.2.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Open Dataset Search in the LLM Era: Retrospectives and Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-quality datasets are typically required for accomplishing data-driven tasks, such as training medical diagnosis models, predicting real-time traffic conditions, or conducting experiments to validate research hypotheses. Consequently, open dataset search, which aims to ensure the efficient and accurate fulfillment of users' dataset requirements, has emerged as a critical research challenge and has attracted widespread interest. Recent studies have made notable progress in enhancing the flexibility and intelligence of open dataset search, and large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong potential in addressing long-standing challenges in this area. Therefore, a systematic and comprehensive review of the open dataset search problem is essential, detailing the current state of research and exploring future directions. In this survey, we focus on recent advances in open dataset search beyond traditional approaches that rely on metadata and keywords. From the perspective of dataset modalities, we place particular emphasis on example-based dataset search, advanced similarity measurement techniques based on dataset content, and efficient search acceleration techniques. In addition, we emphasize the mutually beneficial relationship between LLMs and open dataset search. On the one hand, LLMs help address complex challenges in query understanding, semantic modeling, and interactive guidance within open dataset search. In turn, advances in dataset search can support LLMs by enabling more effective integration into retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) frameworks and data selection processes, thereby enhancing downstream task performance. Finally, we summarize open research problems and outline promising directions for future work. This work aims to offer a structured reference for researchers and practitioners in the field of open dataset search.</description>

      <title>HiPS: Hierarchical PDF Segmentation of Textbooks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing demand for effective tools to parse PDF-formatted texts, particularly structured documents such as textbooks, reveals the limitations of current methods developed mainly for research paper segmentation. This work addresses the challenge of hierarchical segmentation in complex structured documents, with a focus on legal textbooks that contain layered knowledge essential for interpreting and applying legal norms. We examine a Table of Contents (TOC)-based technique and approaches that rely on open-source structural parsing tools or Large Language Models (LLMs) operating without explicit TOC input. To enhance parsing accuracy, we incorporate preprocessing strategies such as OCR-based title detection, XML-derived features, and contextual text features. These strategies are evaluated based on their ability to identify section titles, allocate hierarchy levels, and determine section boundaries. Our findings show that combining LLMs with structure-aware preprocessing substantially reduces false positives and improves extraction quality. We also find that when the metadata quality of headings in the PDF is high, TOC-based techniques perform particularly well. All code and data are publicly available to support replication. We conclude with a comparative evaluation of the methods, outlining their respective strengths and limitations.</description>

      <title>Identifying Origins of Place Names via Retrieval Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Who is the "Batman" behind "Batman Street" in Melbourne? Understanding the historical, cultural, and societal narratives behind place names can reveal the rich context that has shaped a community. Although place names serve as essential spatial references in gazetteers, they often lack information about place name origins. Enriching these place names in today's gazetteers is a time-consuming, manual process that requires extensive exploration of a vast archive of documents and text sources. Recent advances in natural language processing and language models (LMs) hold the promise of significant automation of identifying place name origins due to their powerful capability to exploit the semantics of the stored documents. This chapter presents a retrieval augmented generation pipeline designed to search for place name origins over a broad knowledge base, DBpedia. Given a spatial query, our approach first extracts sub-graphs that may contain knowledge relevant to the query; then ranks the extracted sub-graphs to generate the final answer to the query using fine-tuned LM-based models (i.e., ColBERTv2 and Llama2). Our results highlight the key challenges facing automated retrieval of place name origins, especially the tendency of language models to under-use the spatial information contained in texts as a discriminating factor. Our approach also frames the wider implications for geographic information retrieval using retrieval augmented generation.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Surface: A Solution-Aware Retrieval Model for Competition-level Code Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In competitive programming task, problem statements are often embedded within elaborate narrative backgrounds, requiring deep understanding of the underlying solutions to successfully complete the tasks. Current code generation models primarily focus on token-level semantic modeling, highly susceptible to distractions from irrelevant narrative statements. Inspired by RAG, retrieving reference code with similar solutions may help enhance model performance on difficult problems. However, existing retrieval models also emphasize surface-level semantic similarity, neglecting the deeper solution-level logical similarities that are critical in competitive programming. Therefore, designing ranking models capable of accurately identifying and retrieving problems and corresponding codes remains an urgent research problem in competitive code generation. In this paper, we propose SolveRank, a solution-aware ranking model empowered by synthetic data for competitive programming tasks. Specifically, we leverage the DeepSeek-R1 model to generate logically equivalent but differently phrased new problems, verified by GPT-4o for solution consistency. Then, we train SolveRank with these as positive samples and BM25/random-retrieved problems as negatives. During inference, SolveRank retrieves relevant problems and corresponding code from the corpus to assist a downstream code generator. Experiments on the xCodeEval dataset demonstrate that SolveRank outperforms SOTA ranking methods in precision and recall metrics, and boosts code generation performance for difficult problems.</description>

      <title>MARS: Modality-Aligned Retrieval for Sequence Augmented CTR Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Click-through rate (CTR) prediction serves as a cornerstone of recommender systems. Despite the strong performance of current CTR models based on user behavior modeling, they are still severely limited by interaction sparsity, especially in low-active user scenarios. To address this issue, data augmentation of user behavior is a promising research direction. However, existing data augmentation methods heavily rely on collaborative signals while overlooking the rich multimodal features of items, leading to insufficient modeling of low-active users.
  To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel framework \textbf{MARS} (\textbf{M}odality-\textbf{A}ligned \textbf{R}etrieval for \textbf{S}equence Augmented CTR Prediction). MARS utilizes a Stein kernel-based approach to align text and image features into a unified and unbiased semantic space to construct multimodal user embeddings. Subsequently, each low-active user's behavior sequence is augmented by retrieving, filtering, and concentrating the most similar behavior sequence of high-active users via multimodal user embeddings. Validated by extensive offline experiments and online A/B tests, our framework MARS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and achieves substantial growth on core business metrics within Kuaishou~\footnote{https://www.kuaishou.com/}. Consequently, MARS has been successfully deployed, serving the main traffic for hundreds of millions of users. To ensure reproducibility, we provide anonymous access to the implementation code~\footnote{https://github.com/wangshukuan/MARS}.</description>

      <title>Re3: Learning to Balance Relevance &amp; Recency for Temporal Information Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal Information Retrieval (TIR) is a critical yet unresolved task for modern search systems, retrieving documents that not only satisfy a query's information need but also adhere to its temporal constraints. This task is shaped by two challenges: Relevance, ensuring alignment with the query's explicit temporal requirements, and Recency, selecting the freshest document among multiple versions. Existing methods often address the two challenges in isolation, relying on brittle heuristics that fail in scenarios where temporal requirements and staleness resistance are intertwined. To address this gap, we introduce Re2Bench, a benchmark specifically designed to disentangle and evaluate Relevance, Recency, and their hybrid combination. Building on this foundation, we propose Re3, a unified and lightweight framework that dynamically balances semantic and temporal information through a query-aware gating mechanism. On Re2Bench, Re3 achieves state-of-the-art results, leading in R@1 across all three subsets. Ablation studies with backbone sensitivity tests confirm robustness, showing strong generalization across diverse encoders and real-world settings. This work provides both a generalizable solution and a principled evaluation suite, advancing the development of temporally aware retrieval systems. Re3 and Re2Bench are available online: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Re3-0C5A</description>

      <title>AI4DiTraRe: Building the BFO-Compliant Chemotion Knowledge Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chemistry is an example of a discipline where the advancements of technology have led to multi-level and often tangled and tricky processes ongoing in the lab. The repeatedly complex workflows are combined with information from chemical structures, which are essential to understand the scientific process. An important tool for many chemists is Chemotion, which consists of an electronic lab notebook and a repository. This paper introduces a semantic pipeline for constructing the BFO-compliant Chemotion Knowledge Graph, providing an integrated, ontology-driven representation of chemical research data. The Chemotion-KG has been developed to adhere to the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles and to support AI-driven discovery and reasoning in chemistry. Experimental metadata were harvested from the Chemotion API in JSON-LD format, converted into RDF, and subsequently transformed into a Basic Formal Ontology-aligned graph through SPARQL CONSTRUCT queries. The source code and datasets are publicly available via GitHub. The Chemotion Knowledge Graph is hosted by FIZ Karlsruhe Information Service Engineering. Outcomes presented in this work were achieved within the Leibniz Science Campus ``Digital Transformation of Research'' (DiTraRe) and are part of an ongoing interdisciplinary collaboration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a fast and effective Linear approach for updating recommendations in a scalable graph-based recommender system UltraGCN. Solving this task is extremely important to maintain the relevance of the recommendations under the conditions of a large amount of new data and changing user preferences. To address this issue, we adapt the simple yet effective low-rank approximation approach to the graph-based model. Our method delivers instantaneous recommendations that are up to 30 times faster than conventional methods, with gains in recommendation quality, and demonstrates high scalability even on the large catalogue datasets.</description>

      <title>Cloud-Device Collaborative Agents for Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled agent-based recommendation systems with strong semantic understanding and flexible reasoning capabilities. While LLM-based agents deployed in the cloud offer powerful personalization, they often suffer from privacy concerns, limited access to real-time signals, and scalability bottlenecks. Conversely, on-device agents ensure privacy and responsiveness but lack the computational power for global modeling and large-scale retrieval. To bridge these complementary limitations, we propose CDA4Rec, a novel Cloud-Device collaborative framework for sequential Recommendation, powered by dual agents: a cloud-side LLM and a device-side small language model (SLM). CDA4Rec tackles the core challenge of cloud-device coordination by decomposing the recommendation task into modular sub-tasks including semantic modeling, candidate retrieval, structured user modeling, and final ranking, which are allocated to cloud or device based on computational demands and privacy sensitivity. A strategy planning mechanism leverages the cloud agent's reasoning ability to generate personalized execution plans, enabling context-aware task assignment and partial parallel execution across agents. This design ensures real-time responsiveness, improved efficiency, and fine-grained personalization, even under diverse user states and behavioral sparsity. Extensive experiments across multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that CDA4Rec consistently outperforms competitive baselines in both accuracy and efficiency, validating its effectiveness in heterogeneous and resource-constrained environments.</description>

      <title>CSRM-LLM: Embracing Multilingual LLMs for Cold-Start Relevance Matching in Emerging E-commerce Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As global e-commerce platforms continue to expand, companies are entering new markets where they encounter cold-start challenges due to limited human labels and user behaviors. In this paper, we share our experiences in Coupang to provide a competitive cold-start performance of relevance matching for emerging e-commerce markets. Specifically, we present a Cold-Start Relevance Matching (CSRM) framework, utilizing a multilingual Large Language Model (LLM) to address three challenges: (1) activating cross-lingual transfer learning abilities of LLMs through machine translation tasks; (2) enhancing query understanding and incorporating e-commerce knowledge by retrieval-based query augmentation; (3) mitigating the impact of training label errors through a multi-round self-distillation training strategy. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CSRM-LLM and the proposed techniques, resulting in successful real-world deployment and significant online gains, with a 45.8% reduction in defect ratio and a 0.866% uplift in session purchase rate.</description>

      <title>Empowering Large Language Model for Sequential Recommendation via Multimodal Embeddings and Semantic IDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequential recommendation (SR) aims to capture users' dynamic interests and sequential patterns based on their historical interactions. Recently, the powerful capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have driven their adoption in SR. However, we identify two critical challenges in existing LLM-based SR methods: 1) embedding collapse when incorporating pre-trained collaborative embeddings and 2) catastrophic forgetting of quantized embeddings when utilizing semantic IDs. These issues dampen the model scalability and lead to suboptimal recommendation performance. Therefore, based on LLMs like Llama3-8B-instruct, we introduce a novel SR framework named MME-SID, which integrates multimodal embeddings and quantized embeddings to mitigate embedding collapse. Additionally, we propose a Multimodal Residual Quantized Variational Autoencoder (MM-RQ-VAE) with maximum mean discrepancy as the reconstruction loss and contrastive learning for alignment, which effectively preserve intra-modal distance information and capture inter-modal correlations, respectively. To further alleviate catastrophic forgetting, we initialize the model with the trained multimodal code embeddings. Finally, we fine-tune the LLM efficiently using LoRA in a multimodal frequency-aware fusion manner. Extensive experiments on three public datasets validate the superior performance of MME-SID thanks to its capability to mitigate embedding collapse and catastrophic forgetting. The implementation code and datasets are publicly available for reproduction: https://github.com/Applied-Machine-Learning-Lab/MME-SID.</description>

      <title>Towards Multi-Aspect Diversification of News Recommendations Using Neuro-Symbolic AI for Individual and Societal Benefit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: News recommendations are complex, with diversity playing a vital role. So far, existing literature predominantly focuses on specific aspects of news diversity, such as viewpoints. In this paper, we introduce multi-aspect diversification in four distinct recommendation modes and outline the nuanced challenges in diversifying lists, sequences, summaries, and interactions. Our proposed research direction combines symbolic and subsymbolic artificial intelligence, leveraging both knowledge graphs and rule learning. We plan to evaluate our models using user studies to not only capture behavior but also their perceived experience. Our vision to balance news consumption points to other positive effects for users (e.g., increased serendipity) and society (e.g., decreased polarization).</description>

      <title>Application Of Large Language Models For The Extraction Of Information From Particle Accelerator Technical Documentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The large set of technical documentation of legacy accelerator systems, coupled with the retirement of experienced personnel, underscores the urgent need for efficient methods to preserve and transfer specialized knowledge. This paper explores the application of large language models (LLMs), to automate and enhance the extraction of information from particle accelerator technical documents. By exploiting LLMs, we aim to address the challenges of knowledge retention, enabling the retrieval of domain expertise embedded in legacy documentation. We present initial results of adapting LLMs to this specialized domain. Our evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of LLMs in extracting, summarizing, and organizing knowledge, significantly reducing the risk of losing valuable insights as personnel retire. Furthermore, we discuss the limitations of current LLMs, such as interpretability and handling of rare domain-specific terms, and propose strategies for improvement. This work highlights the potential of LLMs to play a pivotal role in preserving institutional knowledge and ensuring continuity in highly specialized fields.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Media Frames to Improve Normative Diversity in News Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Click-based news recommender systems suggest users content that aligns with their existing history, limiting the diversity of articles they encounter. Recent advances in aspect-based diversification -- adding features such as sentiments or news categories (e.g. world, politics) -- have made progress toward diversifying recommendations in terms of perspectives. However, these approaches often overlook the role of news framing, which shapes how stories are told by emphasizing specific angles or interpretations. In this paper, we treat media frames as a controllable aspect within the recommendation pipeline. By selecting articles based on a diversity of frames, our approach emphasizes varied narrative angles and broadens the interpretive space recommended to users. In addition to introducing frame-based diversification method, our work is the first to assess the impact of a news recommender system that integrates frame diversity using normative diversity metrics: representation, calibration, and activation. Our experiments based on media frame diversification show an improvement in exposure to previously unclicked frames up to 50%. This is important because repeated exposure to the same frames can reinforce existing biases or narrow interpretations, whereas introducing novel frames broadens users' understanding of issues and perspectives. The method also enhances diversification across categorical and sentiment levels, thereby demonstrating that framing acts as a strong control lever for enhancing normative diversity.</description>

      <title>Upcycling Candidate Tokens of Large Language Models for Query Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Query Expansion (QE) improves retrieval performance by enriching queries with related terms. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been used for QE, but existing methods face a trade-off: generating diverse terms boosts performance but increases computational cost. To address this challenge, we propose Candidate Token Query Expansion (CTQE), which extracts diverse and relevant terms from a single LLM decoding pass by leveraging unselected candidate tokens. These tokens, though not part of the final output, are conditioned on the full query and capture useful information. By aggregating them, CTQE achieves both relevance and diversity without extra inference, reducing overhead and latency. Experiments show that CTQE delivers strong retrieval performance with significantly lower cost, outperforming or comparable to more expensive methods. Code is available at: https://github.com/bluejeans8/CTQE</description>

      <title>Lighting the Way for BRIGHT: Reproducible Baselines with Anserini, Pyserini, and RankLLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The BRIGHT benchmark is a dataset consisting of reasoning-intensive queries over diverse domains. We explore retrieval results on BRIGHT using a range of retrieval techniques, including sparse, dense, and fusion methods, and establish reproducible baselines. We then apply listwise reranking with large language models (LLMs) to further investigate the impact of reranking on reasoning-intensive queries. These baselines are integrated into popular retrieval and reranking toolkits Anserini, Pyserini, and RankLLM, with two-click reproducibility that makes them easy to build upon and convenient for further development. While attempting to reproduce the results reported in the original BRIGHT paper, we find that the provided BM25 scores differ notably from those that we obtain using Anserini and Pyserini. We discover that this difference is due to BRIGHT's implementation of BM25, which applies BM25 on the query rather than using the standard bag-of-words approach, as in Anserini, to construct query vectors. This difference has become increasingly relevant due to the rise of longer queries, with BRIGHT's lengthy reasoning-intensive queries being a prime example, and further accentuated by the increasing usage of retrieval-augmented generation, where LLM prompts can grow to be much longer than ''traditional'' search engine queries. Our observation signifies that it may be time to reconsider BM25 approaches going forward in order to better accommodate emerging applications. To facilitate this, we integrate query-side BM25 into both Anserini and Pyserini.</description>

      <title>OpinioRAG: Towards Generating User-Centric Opinion Highlights from Large-scale Online Reviews</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of opinion highlights generation from large volumes of user reviews, often exceeding thousands per entity, where existing methods either fail to scale or produce generic, one-size-fits-all summaries that overlook personalized needs. To tackle this, we introduce OpinioRAG, a scalable, training-free framework that combines RAG-based evidence retrieval with LLMs to efficiently produce tailored summaries. Additionally, we propose novel reference-free verification metrics designed for sentiment-rich domains, where accurately capturing opinions and sentiment alignment is essential. These metrics offer a fine-grained, context-sensitive assessment of factual consistency. To facilitate evaluation, we contribute the first large-scale dataset of long-form user reviews, comprising entities with over a thousand reviews each, paired with unbiased expert summaries and manually annotated queries. Through extensive experiments, we identify key challenges, provide actionable insights into improving systems, pave the way for future research, and position OpinioRAG as a robust framework for generating accurate, relevant, and structured summaries at scale.</description>

      <title>Access Paths for Efficient Ordering with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the LLM ORDER BY operator as a logical abstraction and study its physical implementations within a unified evaluation framework. Our experiments show that no single approach is universally optimal, with effectiveness depending on query characteristics and data. We introduce three new designs: an agreement-based batch-size policy, a majority voting mechanism for pairwise sorting, and a two-way external merge sort adapted for LLMs. With extensive experiments, our agreement-based procedure is effective at determining batch size for value-based methods, the majority-voting mechanism consistently strengthens pairwise comparisons on GPT-4o, and external merge sort achieves high accuracy-efficiency trade-offs across datasets and models. We further observe a log-linear scaling between compute cost and ordering quality, offering the first step toward principled cost models for LLM powered data systems.</description>

      <title>GIER: Gap-Driven Self-Refinement for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce GIER (Gap-driven Iterative Enhancement of Responses), a general framework for improving large language model (LLM) outputs through self-reflection and revision based on conceptual quality criteria. Unlike prompting strategies that rely on demonstrations, examples, or chain-of-thought templates, GIER utilizes natural language descriptions of reasoning gaps, and prompts a model to iteratively critique and refine its own outputs to better satisfy these criteria. Across three reasoning-intensive tasks (SciFact, PrivacyQA, and e-SNLI) and four LLMs (GPT-4.1, GPT-4o Mini, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Llama 3.3 70B), GIER improves rationale quality, grounding, and reasoning alignment without degrading task accuracy. Our analysis demonstrates that models can not only interpret abstract conceptual gaps but also translate them into concrete reasoning improvements.</description>

      <title>CRouting: Reducing Expensive Distance Calls in Graph-Based Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) is a crucial problem in information retrieval and AI applications. Recently, there has been a surge of interest in graph-based ANNS algorithms due to their superior efficiency and accuracy. However, the repeated computation of distances in high-dimensional spaces constitutes the primary time cost of graph-based methods. To accelerate the search, we propose a novel routing strategy named CRouting, which bypasses unnecessary distance computations by exploiting the angle distributions of high-dimensional vectors. CRouting is designed as a plugin to optimize existing graph-based search with minimal code modifications. Our experiments show that CRouting reduces the number of distance computations by up to 41.5% and boosts queries per second by up to 1.48$\times$ on two predominant graph indexes, HNSW and NSG. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/ISCS-ZJU/CRouting.</description>

      <title>MedSEBA: Synthesizing Evidence-Based Answers Grounded in Evolving Medical Literature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the digital age, people often turn to the Internet in search of medical advice and recommendations. With the increasing volume of online content, it has become difficult to distinguish reliable sources from misleading information. Similarly, millions of medical studies are published every year, making it challenging for researchers to keep track of the latest scientific findings. These evolving studies can reach differing conclusions, which is not reflected in traditional search tools. To address these challenges, we introduce MedSEBA, an interactive AI-powered system for synthesizing evidence-based answers to medical questions. It utilizes the power of Large Language Models to generate coherent and expressive answers, but grounds them in trustworthy medical studies dynamically retrieved from the research database PubMed. The answers consist of key points and arguments, which can be traced back to respective studies. Notably, the platform also provides an overview of the extent to which the most relevant studies support or refute the given medical claim, and a visualization of how the research consensus evolved through time. Our user study revealed that medical experts and lay users find the system usable and helpful, and the provided answers trustworthy and informative. This makes the system well-suited for both everyday health questions and advanced research insights.</description>

      <title>How to Make Museums More Interactive? Case Study of Artistic Chatbot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conversational agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly utilized in educational settings, in particular in individual closed digital environments, yet their potential adoption in the physical learning environments like cultural heritage sites, museums, and art galleries remains relatively unexplored. In this study, we present Artistic Chatbot, a voice-to-voice RAG-powered chat system to support informal learning and enhance visitor engagement during a live art exhibition celebrating the 15th anniversary of the Faculty of Media Art at the Warsaw Academy of Fine Arts, Poland. The question answering (QA) chatbot responded to free-form spoken questions in Polish using the context retrieved from a curated, domain-specific knowledge base consisting of 226 documents provided by the organizers, including faculty information, art magazines, books, and journals. We describe the key aspects of the system architecture and user interaction design, as well as discuss the practical challenges associated with deploying chatbots at public cultural sites. Our findings, based on interaction analysis, demonstrate that chatbots such as Artistic Chatbot effectively maintain responses grounded in exhibition content (60\% of responses directly relevant), even when faced with unpredictable queries outside the target domain, showing their potential for increasing interactivity in public cultural sites.

      <title>BALM-TSF: Balanced Multimodal Alignment for LLM-Based Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time series forecasting is a long-standing and highly challenging research topic. Recently, driven by the rise of large language models (LLMs), research has increasingly shifted from purely time series methods toward harnessing textual modalities to enhance forecasting performance. However, the vast discrepancy between text and temporal data often leads current multimodal architectures to over-emphasise one modality while neglecting the other, resulting in information loss that harms forecasting performance. To address this modality imbalance, we introduce BALM-TSF (Balanced Multimodal Alignment for LLM-Based Time Series Forecasting), a lightweight time series forecasting framework that maintains balance between the two modalities. Specifically, raw time series are processed by the time series encoder, while descriptive statistics of raw time series are fed to an LLM with learnable prompt, producing compact textual embeddings. To ensure balanced cross-modal context alignment of time series and textual embeddings, a simple yet effective scaling strategy combined with a contrastive objective then maps these textual embeddings into the latent space of the time series embeddings. Finally, the aligned textual semantic embeddings and time series embeddings are together integrated for forecasting. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show that, with minimal trainable parameters, BALM-TSF achieves state-of-the-art performance in both long-term and few-shot forecasting, confirming its ability to harness complementary information from text and time series.

Abstract: We investigate the efficacy of Large Language Models (LLMs) in detecting implicit and explicit hate speech, examining whether models with minimal safety alignment (uncensored) might provide more objective classification capabilities compared to their heavily-aligned (censored) counterparts. While uncensored models theoretically offer a less constrained perspective free from moral guardrails that could bias classification decisions, our results reveal a surprising trade-off: censored models significantly outperform their uncensored counterparts in both accuracy and robustness, achieving 78.7% versus 64.1% strict accuracy. However, this enhanced performance comes with its own limitation -- the safety alignment acts as a strong ideological anchor, making censored models resistant to persona-based influence, while uncensored models prove highly malleable to ideological framing. Furthermore, we identify critical failures across all models in understanding nuanced language such as irony. We also find alarming fairness disparities in performance across different targeted groups and systemic overconfidence that renders self-reported certainty unreliable. These findings challenge the notion of LLMs as objective arbiters and highlight the need for more sophisticated auditing frameworks that account for fairness, calibration, and ideological consistency.</description>

      <title>Do small language models generate realistic variable-quality fake news headlines?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) have the capability for text generation and may potentially be used to generate falsified texts online. This study evaluates 14 SLMs (1.7B-14B parameters) including LLaMA, Gemma, Phi, SmolLM, Mistral, and Granite families in generating perceived low and high quality fake news headlines when explicitly prompted, and whether they appear to be similar to real-world news headlines. Using controlled prompt engineering, 24,000 headlines were generated across low-quality and high-quality deceptive categories. Existing machine learning and deep learning-based news headline quality detectors were then applied against these SLM-generated fake news headlines. SLMs demonstrated high compliance rates with minimal ethical resistance, though there were some occasional exceptions. Headline quality detection using established DistilBERT and bagging classifier models showed that quality misclassification was common, with detection accuracies only ranging from 35.2% to 63.5%. These findings suggest the following: tested SLMs generally are compliant in generating falsified headlines, although there are slight variations in ethical restraints, and the generated headlines did not closely resemble existing primarily human-written content on the web, given the low quality classification accuracy.</description>

      <title>TMT: A Simple Way to Translate Topic Models Using Dictionaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The training of topic models for a multilingual environment is a challenging task, requiring the use of sophisticated algorithms, topic-aligned corpora, and manual evaluation. These difficulties are further exacerbated when the developer lacks knowledge of the target language or is working in an environment with limited data, where only small or unusable multilingual corpora are available.
  Considering these challenges, we introduce Topic Model Translation (TMT), a novel, robust and transparent technique designed to transfer topic models (e.g., Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) based topic models) from one language to another, without the need for metadata, embeddings, or aligned corpora. TMT enables the reuse of topic models across languages, making it especially suitable for scenarios where large corpora in the target language are unavailable or manual translation is infeasible. Furthermore, we evaluate TMT extensively using both quantitative and qualitative methods, demonstrating that it produces semantically coherent and consistent topic translations.</description>

      <title>MatPROV: A Provenance Graph Dataset of Material Synthesis Extracted from Scientific Literature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synthesis procedures play a critical role in materials research, as they directly affect material properties. With data-driven approaches increasingly accelerating materials discovery, there is growing interest in extracting synthesis procedures from scientific literature as structured data. However, existing studies often rely on rigid, domain-specific schemas with predefined fields for structuring synthesis procedures or assume that synthesis procedures are linear sequences of operations, which limits their ability to capture the structural complexity of real-world procedures. To address these limitations, we adopt PROV-DM, an international standard for provenance information, which supports flexible, graph-based modeling of procedures. We present MatPROV, a dataset of PROV-DM-compliant synthesis procedures extracted from scientific literature using large language models. MatPROV captures structural complexities and causal relationships among materials, operations, and conditions through visually intuitive directed graphs. This representation enables machine-interpretable synthesis knowledge, opening opportunities for future research such as automated synthesis planning and optimization.</description>

      <title>Question-to-Knowledge: Multi-Agent Generation of Inspectable Facts for Product Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying whether two product listings refer to the same Stock Keeping Unit (SKU) is a persistent challenge in ecommerce, especially when explicit identifiers are missing and product names vary widely across platforms. Rule based heuristics and keyword similarity often misclassify products by overlooking subtle distinctions in brand, specification, or bundle configuration. To overcome these limitations, we propose Question to Knowledge (Q2K), a multi agent framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for reliable SKU mapping. Q2K integrates: (1) a Reasoning Agent that generates targeted disambiguation questions, (2) a Knowledge Agent that resolves them via focused web searches, and (3) a Deduplication Agent that reuses validated reasoning traces to reduce redundancy and ensure consistency. A human in the loop mechanism further refines uncertain cases. Experiments on real world consumer goods datasets show that Q2K surpasses strong baselines, achieving higher accuracy and robustness in difficult scenarios such as bundle identification and brand origin disambiguation. By reusing retrieved reasoning instead of issuing repeated searches, Q2K balances accuracy with efficiency, offering a scalable and interpretable solution for product integration.</description>

      <title>ABCD-LINK: Annotation Bootstrapping for Cross-Document Fine-Grained Links</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding fine-grained relations between documents is crucial for many application domains. However, the study of automated assistance is limited by the lack of efficient methods to create training and evaluation datasets of cross-document links. To address this, we introduce a new domain-agnostic framework for selecting a best-performing approach and annotating cross-document links in a new domain from scratch. We first generate and validate semi-synthetic datasets of interconnected documents. This data is used to perform automatic evaluation, producing a shortlist of best-performing linking approaches. These approaches are then used in an extensive human evaluation study, yielding performance estimates on natural text pairs. We apply our framework in two distinct domains -- peer review and news -- and show that combining retrieval models with LLMs achieves 78\% link approval from human raters, more than doubling the precision of strong retrievers alone. Our framework enables systematic study of cross-document understanding across application scenarios, and the resulting novel datasets lay foundation for numerous cross-document tasks like media framing and peer review. We make the code, data, and annotation protocols openly available.</description>

      <title>Abex-rat: Synergizing Abstractive Augmentation and Adversarial Training for Classification of Occupational Accident Reports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The automatic classification of occupational accident reports is a critical research area for enhancing workplace safety and enabling large-scale risk analysis. However, the severe class imbalance inherent in these real-world datasets often compromises the performance of analytical models, particularly for rare but severe incident types, hindering the development of reliable automated systems. To address this challenge, we propose ABEX-RAT, a novel and efficient framework that synergizes generative data augmentation with robust adversarial training. Our approach first employs a twostep abstractive-expansive (ABEX) pipeline, which leverages a large language model to distill core incident semantics and then uses a generative model to create diverse, highquality synthetic samples for underrepresented classes. Subsequently, a lightweight classifier is trained on the augmented data using a computationally efficient random adversarial training (RAT) protocol, which stochastically applies perturbations to enhance model generalization and robustness without significant overhead. Experimental results on the public OSHA dataset demonstrate that our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance, reaching a macro-F1 score of 90.32% and significantly outperforming previous SOTA and fine-tuned large model baselines. Our work validates that this synergistic strategy is a highly effective and efficient alternative to brute-force fine-tuning for specialized, imbalanced classification tasks. The code is publicly available at:https://github.com/nxcc-lab/ABEX-RAT.</description>

      <title>Better by Comparison: Retrieval-Augmented Contrastive Reasoning for Automatic Prompt Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic prompt optimization has recently emerged as a strategy for improving the quality of prompts used in Large Language Models (LLMs), with the goal of generating more accurate and useful responses. However, most prior work focuses on direct prompt refinement or model fine-tuning, overlooking the potential of leveraging LLMs' inherent reasoning capability to learn from contrasting examples. In this paper, we present Contrastive Reasoning Prompt Optimization (CRPO), a novel framework that formulates prompt optimization as a retrieval augmented reasoning process. Our approach retrieves top k reference prompts from the HelpSteer2 dataset, an open-source collection annotated for helpfulness, correctness, coherence, complexity, and verbosity, and constructs two complementary optimization paradigms: (1) tiered contrastive reasoning, where the LLM compares high, medium, and low quality prompts to refine its own generation through reflective reasoning, and (2) multi-metric contrastive reasoning, where the LLM analyzes the best prompts along each evaluation dimension and integrates their strengths into an optimized prompt. By explicitly contrasting high and low quality exemplars, CRPO enables the model to deduce why certain prompts succeed while others fail, thereby achieving more robust and interpretable optimization. Experimental results on the HelpSteer2 benchmark demonstrate that CRPO significantly outperforms baselines. Our findings highlight the promise of contrastive, retrieval-augmented reasoning for advancing automatic prompt optimization.</description>

      <title>Detecting LLM-assisted writing in scientific communication: Are we there yet?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16807v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), exemplified by ChatGPT, have significantly reshaped text generation, particularly in the realm of writing assistance. While ethical considerations underscore the importance of transparently acknowledging LLM use, especially in scientific communication, genuine acknowledgment remains infrequent. A potential avenue to encourage accurate acknowledging of LLM-assisted writing involves employing automated detectors. Our evaluation of four cutting-edge LLM-generated text detectors reveals their suboptimal performance compared to a simple ad-hoc detector designed to identify abrupt writing style changes around the time of LLM proliferation. We contend that the development of specialized detectors exclusively dedicated to LLM-assisted writing detection is necessary. Such detectors could play a crucial role in fostering more authentic recognition of LLM involvement in scientific communication, addressing the current challenges in acknowledgment practices.</description>

      <title>Transforming Norm-based To Graph-based Spatial Representation for Spatio-Temporal Epidemiological Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14539v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pandemics, with their profound societal and economic impacts, pose significant threats to global health, mortality rates, economic stability, and political landscapes. In response to these challenges, numerous studies have employed spatio-temporal models to enhance our understanding and management of these complex phenomena. These spatio-temporal models can be roughly divided into two main spatial categories: norm-based and graph-based. Norm-based models are usually more accurate and easier to model but are more computationally intensive and require more data to fit. On the other hand, graph-based models are less accurate and harder to model but are less computationally intensive and require fewer data to fit. As such, ideally, one would like to use a graph-based model while preserving the representation accuracy obtained by the norm-based model. In this study, we explore the ability to transform from norm-based to graph-based spatial representation for these models. We first show no analytical mapping between the two exists, requiring one to use approximation numerical methods instead. We introduce a novel framework for this task together with twelve possible implementations using a wide range of heuristic optimization approaches. Our findings show that by leveraging agent-based simulations and heuristic algorithms for the graph node's location and population's spatial walk dynamics approximation one can use graph-based spatial representation without losing much of the model's accuracy and expressiveness. We investigate our framework for three real-world cases, achieving 94\% accuracy preservation, on average. Moreover, an analysis of synthetic cases shows the proposed framework is relatively robust for changes in both spatial and temporal properties.</description>

      <title>Understanding and Scaling Collaborative Filtering Optimization from the Perspective of Matrix Rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23300v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collaborative Filtering (CF) methods dominate real-world recommender systems given their ability to learn high-quality, sparse ID-embedding tables that effectively capture user preferences. These tables scale linearly with the number of users and items, and are trained to ensure high similarity between embeddings of interacted user-item pairs, while maintaining low similarity for non-interacted pairs. Despite their high performance, encouraging dispersion for non-interacted pairs necessitates expensive regularization (e.g., negative sampling), hurting runtime and scalability. Existing research tends to address these challenges by simplifying the learning process, either by reducing model complexity or sampling data, trading performance for runtime. In this work, we move beyond model-level modifications and study the properties of the embedding tables under different learning strategies. Through theoretical analysis, we find that the singular values of the embedding tables are intrinsically linked to different CF loss functions. These findings are empirically validated on real-world datasets, demonstrating the practical benefits of higher stable rank, a continuous version of matrix rank which encodes the distribution of singular values. Based on these insights, we propose an efficient warm-start strategy that regularizes the stable rank of the user and item embeddings. We show that stable rank regularization during early training phases can promote higher-quality embeddings, resulting in training speed improvements of up to 66%. Additionally, stable rank regularization can act as a proxy for negative sampling, allowing for performance gains of up to 21% over loss functions with small negative sampling ratios. Overall, our analysis unifies current CF methods under a new perspective, their optimization of stable rank, motivating a flexible regularization method.</description>

Abstract: Recent advancements in generative AI have fostered the development of highly adept Large Language Models (LLMs) that integrate diverse data types to empower decision-making. Among these, multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) applications are promising because they combine the strengths of information retrieval and generative models, enhancing their utility across various domains, including clinical use cases. This paper introduces AlzheimerRAG, a Multimodal RAG application for clinical use cases, primarily focusing on Alzheimer's Disease case studies from PubMed articles. This application incorporates cross-modal attention fusion techniques to integrate textual and visual data processing by efficiently indexing and accessing vast amounts of biomedical literature. Our experimental results, compared to benchmarks such as BioASQ and PubMedQA, have yielded improved performance in the retrieval and synthesis of domain-specific information. We also present a case study using our multimodal RAG in various Alzheimer's clinical scenarios. We infer that AlzheimerRAG can generate responses with accuracy non-inferior to humans and with low rates of hallucination.</description>

      <title>Investigating Tax Evasion Emergence Using Dual Large Language Model and Deep Reinforcement Learning Powered Agent-based Simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tax evasion, usually the largest component of an informal economy, is a persistent challenge over history with significant socio-economic implications. Many socio-economic studies investigate its dynamics, including influencing factors, the role and influence of taxation policies, and the prediction of the tax evasion volume over time. These studies assumed such behavior is given, as observed in the real world, neglecting the "big bang" of such activity in a population. To this end, computational economy studies adopted developments in computer simulations, in general, and recent innovations in artificial intelligence (AI), in particular, to simulate and study informal economy appearance in various socio-economic settings. This study presents a novel computational framework to examine the dynamics of tax evasion and the emergence of informal economic activity. Employing an agent-based simulation powered by Large Language Models and Deep Reinforcement Learning, the framework is uniquely designed to allow informal economic behaviors to emerge organically, without presupposing their existence or explicitly signaling agents about the possibility of evasion. This provides a rigorous approach for exploring the socio-economic determinants of compliance behavior. The experimental design, comprising model validation and exploratory phases, demonstrates the framework's robustness in replicating theoretical economic behaviors. Findings indicate that individual personality traits, external narratives, enforcement probabilities, and the perceived efficiency of public goods provision significantly influence both the timing and extent of informal economic activity. The results underscore that efficient public goods provision and robust enforcement mechanisms are complementary; neither alone is sufficient to curtail informal activity effectively.</description>

      <title>MOHPER: Multi-objective Hyperparameter Optimization Framework for E-commerce Retrieval System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05227v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: E-commerce search optimization has evolved to include a wider range of metrics that reflect user engagement and business objectives. Modern search frameworks now incorporate advanced quality features, such as sales counts and document-query relevance, to better align search results with these goals. Traditional methods typically focus on click-through rate (CTR) as a measure of engagement or relevance, but this can miss true purchase intent, creating a gap between user interest and actual conversions. Joint training with the click-through conversion rate (CTCVR) has become essential for understanding buying behavior, although its sparsity poses challenges for reliable optimization. This study presents MOHPER, a Multi-Objective Hyperparameter Optimization framework for E-commerce Retrieval systems. Utilizing Bayesian optimization and sampling, it jointly optimizes both CTR, CTCVR, and relevant objectives, focusing on engagement and conversion of the users. In addition, to improve the selection of the best configuration from multi-objective optimization, we suggest advanced methods for hyperparameter selection, including a meta-configuration voting strategy and a cumulative training approach that leverages prior optimal configurations, to improve speeds of training and efficiency. Currently deployed in a live setting, our proposed framework substantiates its practical efficacy in achieving a balanced optimization that aligns with both user satisfaction and revenue goals.</description>

Abstract: Collaborative filtering (CF) enables large-scale recommendation systems by encoding information from historical user-item interactions into dense ID-embedding tables. However, as embedding tables grow, closed-form solutions become impractical, often necessitating the use of mini-batch gradient descent for training. Despite extensive work on designing loss functions to train CF models, we argue that one core component of these pipelines is heavily overlooked: weight decay. Attaining high-performing models typically requires careful tuning of weight decay, regardless of loss, yet its necessity is not well understood. In this work, we question why weight decay is crucial in CF pipelines and how it impacts training. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we surprisingly uncover that weight decay's primary function is to encode popularity information into the magnitudes of the embedding vectors. Moreover, we find that tuning weight decay acts as a coarse, non-linear knob to influence preference towards popular or unpopular items. Based on these findings, we propose PRISM (Popularity-awaRe Initialization Strategy for embedding Magnitudes), a straightforward yet effective solution to simplify the training of high-performing CF models. PRISM pre-encodes the popularity information typically learned through weight decay, eliminating its necessity. Our experiments show that PRISM improves performance by up to 4.77% and reduces training times by 38.48%, compared to state-of-the-art training strategies. Additionally, we parameterize PRISM to modulate the initialization strength, offering a cost-effective and meaningful strategy to mitigate popularity bias.</description>

      <title>RAGentA: Multi-Agent Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Attributed Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16988v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present RAGentA, a multi-agent retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework for attributed question answering (QA) with large language models (LLMs). With the goal of trustworthy answer generation, RAGentA focuses on optimizing answer correctness, defined by coverage and relevance to the question and faithfulness, which measures the extent to which answers are grounded in retrieved documents. RAGentA uses a multi-agent architecture that iteratively filters retrieved documents, generates attributed answers with in-line citations, and verifies completeness through dynamic refinement. Central to the framework is a hybrid retrieval strategy that combines sparse and dense methods, improving Recall@20 by 12.5% compared to the best single retrieval model, resulting in more correct and well-supported answers. Evaluated on a synthetic QA dataset derived from the FineWeb index, RAGentA outperforms standard RAG baselines, achieving gains of 1.09% in correctness and 10.72% in faithfulness. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our multi-agent RAG architecture and hybrid retrieval strategy in advancing trustworthy QA with LLMs.</description>

      <title>LLM-Enhanced Multimodal Fusion for Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17966v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) predicts user behavior by leveraging historical interactions across multiple domains, focusing on modeling cross-domain preferences and capturing both intra- and inter-sequence item relationships. We propose LLM-Enhanced Multimodal Fusion for Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (LLM-EMF), a novel and advanced approach that enhances textual information with Large Language Models (LLM) knowledge and significantly improves recommendation performance through the fusion of visual and textual data. Using the frozen CLIP model, we generate image and text embeddings, thereby enriching item representations with multimodal data. A multiple attention mechanism jointly learns both single-domain and cross-domain preferences, effectively capturing and understanding complex user interests across diverse domains. Evaluations conducted on four e-commerce datasets demonstrate that LLM-EMF consistently outperforms existing methods in modeling cross-domain user preferences, thereby highlighting the effectiveness of multimodal data integration and its advantages in enhancing sequential recommendation systems. Our source code will be released.</description>

      <title>WebWatcher: Breaking New Frontier of Vision-Language Deep Research Agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05748v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Web agents such as Deep Research have demonstrated superhuman cognitive abilities, capable of solving highly challenging information-seeking problems. However, most research remains primarily text-centric, overlooking visual information in the real world. This makes multimodal Deep Research highly challenging, as such agents require much stronger reasoning abilities in perception, logic, knowledge, and the use of more sophisticated tools compared to text-based agents. To address this limitation, we introduce WebWatcher, a multi-modal Agent for Deep Research equipped with enhanced visual-language reasoning capabilities. It leverages high-quality synthetic multimodal trajectories for efficient cold start training, utilizes various tools for deep reasoning, and further enhances generalization through reinforcement learning. To better evaluate the capabilities of multimodal agents, we propose BrowseComp-VL, a benchmark with BrowseComp-style that requires complex information retrieval involving both visual and textual information. Experimental results show that WebWatcher significantly outperforms proprietary baseline, RAG workflow and open-source agents in four challenging VQA benchmarks, which paves the way for solving complex multimodal information-seeking tasks.</description>

      <title>Youtu-GraphRAG: Vertically Unified Agents for Graph Retrieval-Augmented Complex Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph retrieval-augmented generation (GraphRAG) has effectively enhanced large language models in complex reasoning by organizing fragmented knowledge into explicitly structured graphs. Prior efforts have been made to improve either graph construction or graph retrieval in isolation, yielding suboptimal performance, especially when domain shifts occur. In this paper, we propose a vertically unified agentic paradigm, Youtu-GraphRAG, to jointly connect the entire framework as an intricate integration. Specifically, (i) a seed graph schema is introduced to bound the automatic extraction agent with targeted entity types, relations and attribute types, also continuously expanded for scalability over unseen domains; (ii) To obtain higher-level knowledge upon the schema, we develop novel dually-perceived community detection, fusing structural topology with subgraph semantics for comprehensive knowledge organization. This naturally yields a hierarchical knowledge tree that supports both top-down filtering and bottom-up reasoning with community summaries; (iii) An agentic retriever is designed to interpret the same graph schema to transform complex queries into tractable and parallel sub-queries. It iteratively performs reflection for more advanced reasoning; (iv) To alleviate the knowledge leaking problem in pre-trained LLM, we propose a tailored anonymous dataset and a novel 'Anonymity Reversion' task that deeply measures the real performance of the GraphRAG frameworks. Extensive experiments across six challenging benchmarks demonstrate the robustness of Youtu-GraphRAG, remarkably moving the Pareto frontier with up to 90.71% saving of token costs and 16.62% higher accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines. The results indicate our adaptability, allowing seamless domain transfer with minimal intervention on schema.</description>

      <title>SEAL: Structure and Element Aware Learning to Improve Long Structured Document Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In long structured document retrieval, existing methods typically fine-tune pre-trained language models (PLMs) using contrastive learning on datasets lacking explicit structural information. This practice suffers from two critical issues: 1) current methods fail to leverage structural features and element-level semantics effectively, and 2) the lack of datasets containing structural metadata. To bridge these gaps, we propose \our, a novel contrastive learning framework. It leverages structure-aware learning to preserve semantic hierarchies and masked element alignment for fine-grained semantic discrimination. Furthermore, we release \dataset, a long structured document retrieval dataset with rich structural annotations. Extensive experiments on both released and industrial datasets across various modern PLMs, along with online A/B testing, demonstrate consistent performance improvements, boosting NDCG@10 from 73.96\% to 77.84\% on BGE-M3.

      <title>Authorship conflicts in academia: an international cross-discipline survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.00386v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collaboration among scholars has emerged as a significant characteristic of contemporary science. As a result, the number of authors listed in publications continues to rise steadily. Unfortunately, determining the authors to be included in the byline and their respective order entails multiple difficulties which often lead to conflicts. Despite the large volume of literature about conflicts in academia, it remains unclear how exactly these are distributed over the main socio-demographic properties, as well as the different types of interactions academics experience. To address this gap, we conducted an international and cross-disciplinary survey answered by 752 academics from 41 fields of research and 93 countries that statistically well-represent the overall academic workforce. Our findings are concerning and suggest that conflicts over authorship credit arise very early in one's academic career, even at the level of Master and Ph.D., and become increasingly common over time.</description>

      <title>Into the crossfire: evaluating the use of a language model to crowdsource gun violence reports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12989v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gun violence is a pressing human rights issue that affects nearly every dimension of the social fabric, from healthcare and education to psychology and the economy. Reliable data on firearm events is paramount to developing more effective public policy and emergency responses. However, the lack of comprehensive databases and the risks of in-person surveys prevent human rights organizations from collecting needed data in most countries. Here, we partner with a Brazilian human rights organization to conduct a systematic evaluation of language models to assist with monitoring real-world firearm events from social media data. We propose a fine-tuned BERT-based model trained on Twitter (now X) texts to distinguish gun violence reports from ordinary Portuguese texts. We then incorporate our model into a web application and test it in a live intervention. We study and interview Brazilian analysts who continuously check social media texts to identify new gun violence events. Qualitative assessments show that our solution helped all analysts use their time more efficiently and expanded their search capacities. Quantitative assessments show that the use of our model was associated with analysts having further interactions with online users reporting gun violence. Our findings suggest that human-centered interventions using language models can help support the work of human rights organizations.</description>

      <title>CoRanking: Collaborative Ranking with Small and Large Ranking Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23427v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated superior listwise ranking performance. However, their superior performance often relies on large-scale parameters (\eg, GPT-4) and a repetitive sliding window process, which introduces significant efficiency challenges. In this paper, we propose \textbf{CoRanking}, a novel collaborative ranking framework that combines small and large ranking models for efficient and effective ranking. CoRanking first employs a small-size reranker to pre-rank all the candidate passages, bringing relevant ones to the top part of the list (\eg, top-20). Then, the LLM listwise reranker is applied to only rerank these top-ranked passages instead of the whole list, substantially enhancing overall ranking efficiency. Although more efficient, previous studies have revealed that the LLM listwise reranker have significant positional biases on the order of input passages. Directly feed the top-ranked passages from small reranker may result in the sub-optimal performance of LLM listwise reranker. To alleviate this problem, we introduce a passage order adjuster trained via reinforcement learning, which reorders the top passages from the small reranker to align with the LLM's preferences of passage order. Extensive experiments on three IR benchmarks demonstrate that CoRanking significantly improves efficiency (reducing ranking latency by about 70\%) while achieving even better effectiveness compared to using only the LLM listwise reranker.</description>

      <title>Federated Retrieval-Augmented Generation: A Systematic Mapping Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18906v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Federated RAG) combines Federated Learning (FL), which enables distributed model training without exposing raw data, with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which improves the factual accuracy of language models by grounding outputs in external knowledge. As large language models are increasingly deployed in privacy-sensitive domains such as healthcare, finance, and personalized assistance, Federated RAG offers a promising framework for secure, knowledge-intensive natural language processing (NLP). To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents the first systematic mapping study of Federated RAG, covering literature published between 2020 and 2025. Following Kitchenham's guidelines for evidence-based software engineering, we develop a structured classification of research focuses, contribution types, and application domains. We analyze architectural patterns, temporal trends, and key challenges, including privacy-preserving retrieval, cross-client heterogeneity, and evaluation limitations. Our findings synthesize a rapidly evolving body of research, identify recurring design patterns, and surface open questions, providing a foundation for future work at the intersection of RAG and federated systems.</description>

      <title>TriPSS: A Tri-Modal Keyframe Extraction Framework Using Perceptual, Structural, and Semantic Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05395v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient keyframe extraction is critical for video summarization and retrieval, yet capturing the full semantic and visual richness of video content remains challenging. We introduce TriPSS, a tri-modal framework that integrates perceptual features from the CIELAB color space, structural embeddings from ResNet-50, and semantic context from frame-level captions generated by LLaMA-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct. These modalities are fused using principal component analysis to form compact multi-modal embeddings, enabling adaptive video segmentation via HDBSCAN clustering. A refinement stage incorporating quality assessment and duplicate filtering ensures the final keyframe set is both concise and semantically diverse. Evaluations on the TVSum20 and SumMe benchmarks show that TriPSS achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming both unimodal and prior multimodal approaches. These results highlight TriPSS' ability to capture complementary visual and semantic cues, establishing it as an effective solution for video summarization, retrieval, and large-scale multimedia understanding.</description>

      <title>MetaAgent: Toward Self-Evolving Agent via Tool Meta-Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00271v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose MetaAgent, an agentic paradigm inspired by the principle of learning-by-doing, where expertise is developed through hands-on practice and continual self-improvement. MetaAgent starts with a minimal workflow, equipped only with basic reasoning and adaptive help-seeking abilities. When a knowledge gap is encountered, MetaAgent generates natural language help requests, which are routed to the most suitable external tool by a dedicated tool router. As MetaAgent solves tasks, it continually conducts self-reflection and answer verification, distilling actionable experience into concise texts that are dynamically incorporated into future task contexts. Besides, MetaAgent autonomously builds in-house tools and a persistent knowledge base by organizing its tool-use history, further enhancing its ability to retrieve and integrate relevant information We term this continual, data-driven process as \textit{meta tool learning}, through which MetaAgent incrementally refines its reasoning and tool-use strategies, without changing model parameters or requiring further post-training. Evaluated on challenging knowledge discovery benchmarks, including GAIA, WebWalkerQA, and BrowseCamp, MetaAgent consistently outperforms workflow-based baselines and matches or exceeds end-to-end trained agents, demonstrating the promise of self-evolving agentic systems for robust, general-purpose knowledge discovery. We provide our source codes in https://github.com/qhjqhj00/MetaAgent.</description>

      <title>ST-Raptor: LLM-Powered Semi-Structured Table Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18190v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semi-structured tables, widely used in real-world applications (e.g., financial reports, medical records, transactional orders), often involve flexible and complex layouts (e.g., hierarchical headers and merged cells). These tables generally rely on human analysts to interpret table layouts and answer relevant natural language questions, which is costly and inefficient. To automate the procedure, existing methods face significant challenges. First, methods like NL2SQL require converting semi-structured tables into structured ones, which often causes substantial information loss. Second, methods like NL2Code and multi-modal LLM QA struggle to understand the complex layouts of semi-structured tables and cannot accurately answer corresponding questions. To this end, we propose ST-Raptor, a tree-based framework for semi-structured table question answering using large language models. First, we introduce the Hierarchical Orthogonal Tree (HO-Tree), a structural model that captures complex semi-structured table layouts, along with an effective algorithm for constructing the tree. Second, we define a set of basic tree operations to guide LLMs in executing common QA tasks. Given a user question, ST-Raptor decomposes it into simpler sub-questions, generates corresponding tree operation pipelines, and conducts operation-table alignment for accurate pipeline execution. Third, we incorporate a two-stage verification mechanism: forward validation checks the correctness of execution steps, while backward validation evaluates answer reliability by reconstructing queries from predicted answers. To benchmark the performance, we present SSTQA, a dataset of 764 questions over 102 real-world semi-structured tables. Experiments show that ST-Raptor outperforms nine baselines by up to 20% in answer accuracy. The code is available at https://github.com/weAIDB/ST-Raptor.</description>
