      <title>Stock Movement Prediction with Multimodal Stable Fusion via Gated Cross-Attention Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accurate prediction of stock movements is crucial for investment strategies. Stock prices are subject to the influence of various forms of information, including financial indicators, sentiment analysis, news documents, and relational structures. Predominant analytical approaches, however, tend to address only unimodal or bimodal sources, neglecting the complexity of multimodal data. Further complicating the landscape are the issues of data sparsity and semantic conflicts between these modalities, which are frequently overlooked by current models, leading to unstable performance and limiting practical applicability. To address these shortcomings, this study introduces a novel architecture, named Multimodal Stable Fusion with Gated Cross-Attention (MSGCA), designed to robustly integrate multimodal input for stock movement prediction. The MSGCA framework consists of three integral components: (1) a trimodal encoding module, responsible for processing indicator sequences, dynamic documents, and a relational graph, and standardizing their feature representations; (2) a cross-feature fusion module, where primary and consistent features guide the multimodal fusion of the three modalities via a pair of gated cross-attention networks; and (3) a prediction module, which refines the fused features through temporal and dimensional reduction to execute precise movement forecasting. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the MSGCA framework exceeds current leading methods, achieving performance gains of 8.1%, 6.1%, 21.7% and 31.6% on four multimodal datasets, respectively, attributed to its enhanced multimodal fusion stability.</description>

      <title>Application of Black-Litterman Bayesian in Statistical Arbitrage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: \begin{abstract} In this paper, we integrated the statistical arbitrage strategy, pairs trading, into the Black-Litterman model and constructed efficient mean-variance portfolios. Typically, pairs trading underperforms under volatile or distressed market condition because the selected asset pairs fail to revert to equilibrium within the investment horizon. By enhancing this strategy with the Black-Litterman portfolio optimization, we achieved superior performance compared to the S\&amp;P 500 market index under both normal and extreme market conditions. Furthermore, this research presents an innovative idea of incorporating traditional pairs trading strategies into the portfolio optimization framework in a scalable and systematic manner.</description>
