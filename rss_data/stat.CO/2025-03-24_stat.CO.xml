      <title>Spatial Data Science Languages: commonalities and needs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent workshops brought together several developers, educators and users of software packages extending popular languages for spatial data handling, with a primary focus on R, Python and Julia. Common challenges discussed included handling of spatial or spatio-temporal support, geodetic coordinates, in-memory vector data formats, data cubes, inter-package dependencies, packaging upstream libraries, differences in habits or conventions between the GIS and physical modelling communities, and statistical models. The following set of insights have been formulated: (i) considering software problems across data science language silos helps to understand and standardise analysis approaches, also outside the domain of formal standardisation bodies; (ii) whether attribute variables have block or point support, and whether they are spatially intensive or extensive has consequences for permitted operations, and hence for software implementing those; (iii) handling geometries on the sphere rather than on the flat plane requires modifications to the logic of {\em simple features}, (iv) managing communities and fostering diversity is a necessary, on-going effort, and (v) tools for cross-language development need more attention and support.</description>

      <title>concrete: Targeted Estimation of Survival and Competing Risks in Continuous Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article introduces the R package concrete, which implements a recently developed targeted maximum likelihood estimator (TMLE) for the cause-specific absolute risks of time-to-event outcomes measured in continuous time. Cross-validated Super Learner machine learning ensembles are used to estimate propensity scores and conditional cause-specific hazards, which are then targeted to produce robust and efficient plug-in estimates of the effects of static or dynamic interventions on a binary treatment given at baseline quantified as risk differences or risk ratios. Influence curve-based asymptotic inference is provided for TMLE estimates and simultaneous confidence bands can be computed for target estimands spanning multiple multiple times or events. In this paper we review the one-step continuous-time TMLE methodology as it is situated in an overarching causal inference workflow, describe its implementation, and demonstrate the use of the package on the PBC dataset.</description>

      <title>Using Mathlink Cubes to Introduce Data Wrangling with Examples in R</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07029v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores an innovative approach to teaching data wrangling skills to students through hands-on activities before transitioning to coding. Data wrangling, a critical aspect of data analysis, involves cleaning, transforming, and restructuring data. We introduce the use of a physical tool, mathlink cubes, to facilitate a tangible understanding of data sets. This approach helps students grasp the concepts of data wrangling before implementing them in coding languages such as R. We detail a classroom activity that includes hands-on tasks paralleling common data wrangling processes such as filtering, selecting, and mutating, followed by their coding equivalents using R's `dplyr` package.</description>

      <title>Metaheuristics is All You Need</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05797v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimization plays an important role in tackling public health problems. Animal instincts can be used effectively to solve complex public health management issues by providing optimal or approximately optimal solutions to complicated optimization problems common in public health. BAT algorithm is an exemplary member of a class of nature-inspired metaheuristic optimization algorithms and designed to outperform existing metaheuristic algorithms in terms of efficiency and accuracy. It's inspiration comes from the foraging behavior of group of microbats that use echolocation to find their target in the surrounding environment. In recent years, BAT algorithm has been extensively used by researchers in the area of optimization, and various variants of BAT algorithm have been developed to improve its performance and extend its application to diverse disciplines. This paper first reviews the basic BAT algorithm and its variants, including their applications in various fields. As a specific application, we apply the BAT algorithm to a biostatistical estimation problem and show it has some clear advantages over existing algorithms.</description>

      <title>Bypassing orthogonalization in the quantum DPP sampler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05906v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given an $n\times r$ matrix $X$ of rank $r$, consider the problem of sampling $r$ integers $\mathtt{C}\subset \{1, \dots, n\}$ with probability proportional to the squared determinant of the rows of $X$ indexed by $\mathtt{C}$. The distribution of $\mathtt{C}$ is called a projection determinantal point process (DPP). The vanilla classical algorithm to sample a DPP works in two steps, an orthogonalization in $\mathcal{O}(nr^2)$ and a sampling step of the same cost. The bottleneck of recent quantum approaches to DPP sampling remains that preliminary orthogonalization step. For instance, (Kerenidis and Prakash, 2022) proposed an algorithm with the same $\mathcal{O}(nr^2)$ orthogonalization, followed by a $\mathcal{O}(nr)$ classical step to find the gates in a quantum circuit. The classical $\mathcal{O}(nr^2)$ orthogonalization thus still dominates the cost. Our first contribution is to reduce preprocessing to normalizing the columns of $X$, obtaining $\mathsf{X}$ in $\mathcal{O}(nr)$ classical operations. We show that a simple circuit inspired by the formalism of Kerenidis et al., 2022 samples a DPP of a type we had never encountered in applications, which is different from our target DPP. Plugging this circuit into a rejection sampling routine, we recover our target DPP after an expected $1/\det \mathsf{X}^\top\mathsf{X} = 1/a$ preparations of the quantum circuit. Using amplitude amplification, our second contribution is to boost the acceptance probability from $a$ to $1-a$ at the price of a circuit depth of $\mathcal{O}(r\log n/\sqrt{a})$ and $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ extra qubits. Prepending a fast, sketching-based classical approximation of $a$, we obtain a pipeline to sample a projection DPP on a quantum computer, where the former $\mathcal{O}(nr^2)$ preprocessing bottleneck has been replaced by the $\mathcal{O}(nr)$ cost of normalizing the columns and the cost of our approximation of $a$.</description>
