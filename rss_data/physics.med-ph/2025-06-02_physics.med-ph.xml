      <title>The Use of Alendronate to Enhance Transcranial Transmission of Focused Ultrasound for Successful Ablations in Brain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of alendronate therapy in improving bone density distribution in skull bones and corresponding ultrasound permeability in patients who had previously experienced unsuccessful transcranial MR-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) ablation. The ability of alendronate treatment to modify skull bone characteristics and enhance the success rate of repeat MRgFUS procedures was assessed.
  Methods: Five patients with initially unsuccessful MRgFUS ablations underwent a 6-12 month regimen of alendronate to improve bone density. Repeat MRgFUS procedures were performed, and changes in skull density ratio (SDR) and peak focal temperatures were evaluated statistically using CT and MR imaging. Histograms of skull bone density were introduced and analysed as an additional metric.
  Results: After therapy, SDR increased in four out of five patients (from 0.378$\pm$0.037 to 0.424$\pm$0.045, p&gt;0.05). All repeated procedures were successful. The maximum focal temperature, averaged over sonications, increased from 53.6$\pm$4.0{\deg}C to 55.7$\pm$4.1{\deg}C (p=0.018), while the maximum temperature per patient rose from 57.0$\pm$2.4{\deg}C to 60.2$\pm$1.8{\deg}C (p=0.031). Histograms of CT scans showed a reduction in low-density voxels, indicating trabecular bone densification. 3D CT scan registration revealed local density changes, defect filling, and void reduction.
  Conclusions: Alendronate therapy enhanced skull bone density distribution and thus ultrasound permeability, which has facilitated successful repeat MRgFUS. By visually analysing CT changes, healthcare professionals can better inform their decision-making regarding repeat surgeries. This method broadens the pool of patients with low SDR eligible for MRgFUS treatment and underscores the potential benefits of alendronate in improving treatment outcomes.</description>

      <title>Digital twins enable full-reference quality assessment of photoacoustic image reconstructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantitative comparison of the quality of photoacoustic image reconstruction algorithms remains a major challenge. No-reference image quality measures are often inadequate, but full-reference measures require access to an ideal reference image. While the ground truth is known in simulations, it is unknown in vivo, or in phantom studies, as the reference depends on both the phantom properties and the imaging system. We tackle this problem by using numerical digital twins of tissue-mimicking phantoms and the imaging system to perform a quantitative calibration to reduce the simulation gap. The contributions of this paper are two-fold: First, we use this digital-twin framework to compare multiple state-of-the-art reconstruction algorithms. Second, among these is a Fourier transform-based reconstruction algorithm for circular detection geometries, which we test on experimental data for the first time. Our results demonstrate the usefulness of digital phantom twins by enabling assessment of the accuracy of the numerical forward model and enabling comparison of image reconstruction schemes with full-reference image quality assessment. We show that the Fourier transform-based algorithm yields results comparable to those of iterative time reversal, but at a lower computational cost. All data and code are publicly available on Zenodo: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15388429.</description>

      <title>Motility-dependent selective transport of active matter in trap arrays: Separation methods based on trapping-detrapping and deterministic lateral displacement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Selecting active matter based on its motility represents a challenging task, as it requires different approaches than common separation techniques intended for separation based on, e.g., size, shape, density, and flexibility. This motility-based selection is important for, e.g., selecting biological species, such as bacteria or highly motile sperm cells for medically assisted reproduction. Common separation techniques are not applicable for separating species based on motility as such species can have indistinguishable physical properties, i.e., size, shape, density, and differ only by their ability to execute self-propelled motion as, e.g., motile, and immotile sperm cells. Therefore, selecting active species based on motility requires completely different approaches. Some of these have been developed including sperm cell selection techniques, e.g., swim-up techniques, passive selection methods based on the ability of highly motile sperm cells to swim across streamlines, as well as more sophisticated techniques. Here we theoretically demonstrate via numerical simulations various efficient methods of selection and separation based on the motility of active species using arrays of traps. Two approaches are proposed: one allowed the selective escape of motile species from traps, and the other one relying on a deterministic lateral displacement (DLD)-type method. As a model system, we consider self-propelled Janus particles whose motility can be tuned. The resulted separation methods are applicable for separation of biological motile species, such as bacteria or sperm cells, as well as for Janus micro- and nanoparticles.</description>

      <title>Sparsity-Driven Parallel Imaging Consistency for Improved Self-Supervised MRI Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-driven deep learning (PD-DL) models have proven to be a powerful approach for improved reconstruction of rapid MRI scans. In order to train these models in scenarios where fully-sampled reference data is unavailable, self-supervised learning has gained prominence. However, its application at high acceleration rates frequently introduces artifacts, compromising image fidelity. To mitigate this shortcoming, we propose a novel way to train PD-DL networks via carefully-designed perturbations. In particular, we enhance the k-space masking idea of conventional self-supervised learning with a novel consistency term that assesses the model's ability to accurately predict the added perturbations in a sparse domain, leading to more reliable and artifact-free reconstructions. The results obtained from the fastMRI knee and brain datasets show that the proposed training strategy effectively reduces aliasing artifacts and mitigates noise amplification at high acceleration rates, outperforming state-of-the-art self-supervised methods both visually and quantitatively.</description>

      <title>AFIRE: Accurate and Fast Image Reconstruction Algorithm for Geometric-inconsistency Multispectral CT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For nonlinear multispectral computed tomography (CT), accurate and fast image reconstruction is challenging when the scanning geometries under different X-ray energy spectra are inconsistent or mismatched. Motivated by this, we propose an accurate and fast algorithm named AFIRE to address such problem in the case of mildly full scan. We discover that the derivative operator (gradient) of the involved nonlinear mapping at some special points, for example, at zero, can be represented as a composition (block multiplication) of a diagonal operator (matrix) composed of X-ray transforms (projection matrices) and a very small-scale matrix. Based on the insights, the AFIRE is proposed respectively from the continuous, discrete and actual-use perspectives by leveraging the simplified Newton method. Under proper conditions, we establish the convergence theory of the proposed algorithm. Furthermore, numerical experiments are also carried out to verify that the proposed algorithm can accurately and effectively reconstruct the basis images in completely geometric-inconsistency dual-energy CT with noiseless and noisy projection data. Particularly, the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms some state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Finally, the flexibility and extensibility of the proposed algorithm are also demonstrated.</description>
