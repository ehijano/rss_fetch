      <title>$C^{0}$-inextendibility of FLRW spacetimes within a subclass of axisymmetric spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starting from the proof of the $C^0$-inextendibility of Schwarzschild by Sbierski, the past decade has seen renewed interest in showing low-regularity inextendibility for known spacetime models. Specifically, a lot of attention has been paid to FLRW spacetimes and there is an ever growing array of results in the literature. Apart from hoping to provide a concise summary of the state of the art we present an extension of work by Galloway and Ling on $C^0$-inextendibility of certain FLRW spacetimes within a subclass of spherically symmetric spacetimes, to $C^0$-inextendibility within a subclass of axisymmetric spacetimes. Notably our result works in the case of flat FLRW spacetimes with $a(t)\to 0$ for $t\to 0^+$, a setting where other known $C^0$-inextendibility results for FLRW spacetimes due to Sbierski do not apply.</description>

      <title>Singularity formation in co-dimension one of the dHYM cotangent flow on blow up of $\mathbb{C}\mathbb{P}^{3}$ at a point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence and uniqueness of canonical singular solutions of the J-equation and the deformed Hermitian Yang Mills (dHYM) equation was proved in \cite{DMS24} on compact K\"{a}hler surfaces. In this paper, we study the singularity formation of the dHYM cotangent flow on the one-point blow up of $\mathbb{C}\mathbb{P}^3$ using Calabi ansatz. In particular, we provide an explicit example where the flow develops a singularity along the exceptional divisor. Moreover, the limit satisfies corresponding singular dHYM equation in the sense of \cite{DMS24} and provides some evidence for Conjecture $1.12$ in \cite{DMS24} on this three-dimensional manifold with symmetry.</description>

      <title>Submersion constructions for geometries with parallel skew torsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the absence of a de Rham decomposition theorem for geometries with torsion, we develop and unify ways to view a geometry with parallel skew torsion as the total space of a locally defined, not necessarily unique Riemannian submersion with totally geodesic fibers. We complete and extend the Cleyton-Swann classification of irreducible such geometries and characterize the cases where the stabilizer of the torsion is larger than the holonomy. As a byproduct, we obtain structure results on Gray manifolds, nearly parallel G$_2$-manifolds and Sasaki manifolds with reducible holonomy.</description>

      <title>The sparseness of g-convex functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The g-convexity of functions on manifolds is a generalization of the convexity of functions on Rn. It plays an essential role in both differential geometry and non-convex optimization theory. This paper is concerned with g-convex smooth functions on manifolds. We establish criteria for the existence of a Riemannian metric (or connection) with respect to which a given function is g-convex. Using these criteria, we obtain three sparseness results for g-convex functions: (1) The set of g-convex functions on a compact manifold is nowhere dense in the space of smooth functions. (2) Most polynomials on Rn that is g-convex with respect to some geodesically complete connection has at most one critical point. (3) The density of g-convex univariate (resp. quadratic, monomial, additively separable) polynomials asymptotically decreases to zero</description>

      <title>Scalar-mean rigidity theorem for compact manifolds with boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a scalar-mean rigidity theorem for compact Riemannian manifolds with boundary in dimension less than five by extending Schoen-Yau dimension reduction argument. As a corollary, we prove the sharp spherical radius rigidity theorem and best NNSC fill-in in terms of the mean curvature. Additionally, we prove a (Lipschitz) Listing type scalar-mean comparison rigidity theorem for these dimensions. Our results remove the spin assumption.</description>

      <title>K\"ahler metrics of negative holomorphic (bi)sectional curvature on a compact relative K\"ahler fibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a compact relative K\"ahler fibration over a compact K\"ahler manifold with negative holomorphic sectional curvature, if the relative K\"ahler form on each fiber also exhibits negative holomorphic sectional curvature, we can construct K\"ahler metrics with negative holomorphic sectional curvature on the total space. Additionally, if this form induces a Griffiths negative Hermitian metric on the relative tangent bundle, and the base admits a K\"ahler metric with negative holomorphic bisectional curvature, we can also construct K\"ahler metrics with negative holomorphic bisectional curvature on the total space. As an application, for a non-trivial fibration where both the fibers and base have K\"ahler metrics with negative holomorphic bisectional curvature, and the fibers are one-dimensional, we can explicitly construct K\"ahler metrics of negative holomorphic bisectional curvature on the total space, thus resolving a question posed by To and Yeung for the case where the fibers have dimension one.</description>

      <title>A symmetry condition for genus zero free boundary minimal surfaces attaining the first eigenvalue of one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An embedded free boundary minimal surface in the 3-ball has a Steklov eigenvalue of one due to its coordinate functions. Fraser and Li conjectured that whether one is the first nonzero Steklov eigenvalue. In this paper, we show that if an embedded free boundary minimal surface of genus zero, with $n$ boundary components, in the 3-ball has $n$ distinct reflection planes, then one is the first eigenvalue of the surface.</description>

      <title>Non-convergent sequences of solutions to the massive Vafa-Witten equations with 'interesting' $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ self-dual harmonic 2-form limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper constructs sequences of solutions to the Vafa-Witten equations with non-zero (but small) mass term on the product of a 2-dimensional torus with a Riemann surface of genus greater than 1. These are divergent sequences (modulo principle bundle automorphisms) that converge after renormalization to define an 'interesting' $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ harmonic 2-form data set. This data set consists of a non-empty, codimension 2 submanifold, a real line bundle defined on the complement of that submanifold with no extension across it, and a self-dual, harmonic 2-form with values in that line bundle that does not extend over the submanifold. Even so, the norm of this 2-form does extend as a H\"older continuous function with that submanifold being its zero locus.</description>

      <title>Existence and regularity of min-max anisotropic minimal hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In any closed smooth Riemannian manifold of dimension at least three, we use the min-max construction to find anisotropic minimal hyper-surfaces with respect to elliptic integrands, with a singular set of codimension~$2$ vanishing Hausdorff measure. In particular, in a closed $3$-manifold, we obtain a smooth anisotropic minimal surface.
  The critical step is to obtain a uniform upper bound for density ratios in the anisotropic min-max construction. This confirms a conjecture by Allard [Invent. Math., 1983].</description>

      <title>Kadomtsev-Petviashvili hierarchies with non-formal pseudo-differential operators, non-formal solutions, and a Yang-Mills--like formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We start from the classical Kadomtsev-Petviashvili hierarchy posed on formal pseudo-differential operators, and we produce two hierarchies of non-linear equations posed on non-formal pseudo-differential operators lying in the Kontsevich and Vishik's odd class, one of them with values in formal pseudo-differential operators. We prove that the corresponding Zakharov-Shabat equations hold in this context, and we express one of our hierarchies as the minimization of a class of Yang-Mills action functionals on a space of pseudo-differential connections whose curvature takes values in the Dixmier ideal. We finish by comparing our Kadomtsev-Petviashvili hierarchies in terms of the solutions that they produce to the KP-II equation: existence, uniqueness and formality.</description>

      <title>Fine P\'olya-Szeg\H{o} rearrangement inequalities in metric spaces and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study fine P\'olya-Szeg\H{o} rearrangement inequalities into weighted intervals for Sobolev functions and functions of bounded variation defined on metric measure spaces supporting an isoperimetric inequality. We then specialize this theory to spaces with synthetic Ricci lower bounds in both finite and infinite dimension and characterize equality cases under minimal assumptions.
  As applications of our theory, we show new results around geometric and functional inequalities under Ricci lower bounds answering also questions raised in the literature. Finally, we study further settings and deduce a Faber-Krahn theorem on Euclidean spaces with radial log-convex densities, a boosted P\'olya-Szeg\H{o} inequality with asymmetry reminder on weighted convex cones, the rigidity of Sobolev inequalities on Euclidean spaces outside a convex set and a general lower bound for Neumann eigenvalues on open sets in metric spaces.</description>

      <title>Formation of Trapped Surfaces in Geodesic Foliation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the classical results of the formation of trapped surfaces for the Einstein vacuum equation relying on the geodesic foliation, rather than the double null foliation used in all previous results, starting with the seminal work of Christodoulou \cite{Chr1} and continued in \cite{KRodn}, \cite{An}, \cite{AnLuk}, \cite{KLR}, \cite{An1}. The main advantage of the method is that it only requires information on the incoming curvature along the incoming initial null hypersurface. The result is based on a version of the non-integrable PT frame introduced in \cite{KS:Kerr} and \cite{GKS}, associated to the geodesic foliation.</description>

      <title>Quantitative approximate definable choices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A definable choice is a semialgebraic selection of one point in every fiber of the projection of a semialgebraic set. Definable choices exist by semialgebraic triviality, but their complexity depends exponentially on the number of variables. By allowing the selection to be approximate (in the Hausdorff sense), we quantitatively improve this result. In particular, we construct an approximate selection with degree that is linear in the complexity of the original set, and independent on the number of variables. This work is motivated by infinite-dimensional applications, in particular to the Sard conjecture in sub-Riemannian geometry. To prove these results, we develop a general quantitative theory for Hausdorff approximations in semialgebraic geometry, which has independent interest.</description>

      <title>Generalization of Arnold's $J^+$-invariant for pairs of immersions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.04349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.04349v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces the $J^{2+}$-invariant for oriented pairs of generic immersions. This invariant behaves like Arnold's $J^+$-invariant for generic immersions as it is invariant when going through inverse tangencies and triple points, but changes when traversing direct tangencies. It has several useful properties, for example its independence of the $J^{2+}$-invariants of the single immersions forming the pair. Also it is invariant under simultaneous orientation change. Therefore, one can define two $J^{2+}$-invariants for each pair depending on its orientation, those two invariants are not independent from each other. Furthermore, the invariant is extended to $J^{n+}$ for links of $n$ oriented immersions.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we establish some modified defect relations for the Gauss map $g$ of a complete minimal surface $S\subset\mathbb R^m$ into a $k$-dimension projective subvariety $V\subset\mathbb P^n(\mathbb C)\ (n=m-1)$ with hypersurfaces $Q_1,\ldots,Q_q$ of $\mathbb P^n(\mathbb C)$ in $N$-subgeneral position with respect to $V\ (N\ge k)$. In particular, we give the upper bound for the number $q$ if the image $g(S)$ intersects each hypersurfaces $Q_1,\ldots,Q_q$ a finite number of times and $g$ is nondegenerate over $I_d(V)$, where $d=lcm(\deg Q_1,\ldots,\deg Q_q)$, i.e., the image of $g$ is not contained in any hypersurface $Q$ of degree $d$ with $V\not\subset Q$. Our results extend and generalize the previous results for the case of the Gauss map and hyperplanes in a projective space. The results and the method of this paper have been applied by some authors to study the unicity problem of the Gauss maps sharing families of hypersurfaces.</description>

      <title>The Isometric Immersion of Negatively Curved Surfaces with Finite Total Curvature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.02832v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the smooth isometric immersion of a complete, simply connected surface with a negative Gauss curvature into the three-dimensional Euclidean space. A fundamental and longstanding problem is to find a sufficient condition for a complete negatively curved surface to be isometrically embedded in R^3 [67]. It can be described as an initial and/or boundary value problem for a hyperbolic system of nonlinear partial differential equations derived from the Gauss-Codazzi equations. The mathematical theory associated with this system is largely incomplete. The global smooth isometric immersion has been proven in the literature when the Gauss curvature decays rapidly and monotonically. However, when the Gauss curvature oscillates or decays slowly, the problem becomes much more challenging and little is known. In our paper, we find a sufficient condition, consisting of a finite total Gauss curvature and appropriate oscillations of the Gauss curvature. Under this condition we prove the global existence of a smooth solution to the Gauss-Codazzi system, achieving a global smooth isometric immersion of the surface into R^3. Furthermore, we show that the finite total Gauss curvature is necessary for the existence of a solution in a special case of the Gauss-Codazzi system. New techniques are developed to overcome the difficulties posed by the slow decay and oscillations of the Gauss curvature. By observing that certain combinations of the Riemann invariants decay faster than others, we reformulate the Gauss-Codazzi equations as a symmetric hyperbolic system and uncover a crucial structure of partial dampings. These partial dampings, along with the finite total curvature and appropriate oscillations of the Gauss curvature, enable us to obtain a global smooth solution through delicate analysis, and consequently establish a global smooth isometric immersion of such surfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.01147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $M$ be an open (complete and non-compact) manifold with $\mathrm{Ric}\ge 0$ and escape rate not $1/2$. It is known that under these conditions, the fundamental group $\pi_1(M)$ has a finitely generated torsion-free nilpotent subgroup $\mathcal{N}$ of finite index, as long as $\pi_1(M)$ is an infinite group. We show that the nilpotency step of $\mathcal{N}$ must be reflected in the asymptotic geometry of the universal cover $\widetilde{M}$, in terms of the Hausdorff dimension of an isometric $\mathbb{R}$-orbit: there exist an asymptotic cone $(Y,y)$ of $\widetilde{M}$ and a closed $\mathbb{R}$-subgroup $L$ of the isometry group of $Y$ such that its orbit $Ly$ has Hausdorff dimension at least the nilpotency step of $\mathcal{N}$. This resolves a question raised by Wei and the author.</description>

      <title>Compact Locally Conformally Pseudo-K\"ahler Manifolds with Essential Conformal Transformations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.11184v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A conformal transformation of a semi-Riemannian manifold is essential if there is no conformally equivalent metric for which it is an isometry. For Riemannian manifolds the existence of an essential conformal transformation forces the manifold to be conformally flat. This is false for pseudo-Riemannian manifolds, however compact examples of conformally curved manifolds with essential conformal transformation are scarce. Here we give examples of compact conformal manifolds in signature $(4n+2k,4n+2\ell)$ with essential conformal transformations that are locally conformally pseudo-K\"ahler and not conformally flat, where $n\ge 1$, $k, \ell \ge 0$. The corresponding local pseudo-K\"ahler metrics obtained by a local conformal rescaling are Ricci-flat.</description>

Abstract: In the present paper, we study compact complex manifolds admitting a Hermitian metric which is SKT and CYT and whose Bismut torsion is parallel. We first obtain a characterization of the universal cover of such manifolds as a product of a Kaehler Ricci-flat manifold with a Bismut flat one. Then, using a mapping torus construction, we provide non-Bismut flat examples. The existence of generalized Kaehler structures is also investigated.</description>

Abstract: This paper explores the existence and properties of \emph{basic} eigenvalues and eigenfunctions associated with the Riemannian Laplacian on closed, connected Riemannian manifolds featuring an effective isometric action by a compact Lie group. Our primary focus is on investigating the potential existence of homeomorphic yet not diffeomorphic smooth manifolds that can accommodate invariant metrics sharing common basic spectra. We establish the occurrence of such scenarios for specific homotopy spheres and connected sums. Moreover, the developed theory demonstrates that the ring of invariant admissible scalar curvature functions fails to recover the smooth structure in many examples. We show the existence of homotopy spheres with identical rings of invariant scalar curvature functions, irrespective of the underlying smooth structure.</description>

Abstract: Cosymplectic and normal almost contact structures are analogues of symplectic and complex structures that can be defined on 3-manifolds. Their existence imposes strong topological constraints. Generalized geometry offers a natural common generalization of these two structures: $B_3$-generalized complex structures. We prove that any closed orientable 3-manifold admits such a structure, which can be chosen to be stable, that is, generically cosymplectic up to generalized diffeomorphism.</description>

Abstract: In this note, we prove the existence of one particular class of starshaped compact hypersurfaces, by deriving global curvature estimates for such hypersurfaces; this generalizes the main result in [Hypersurfaces of prescribed mixed Weingarten curvature. J. Geom. Anal. $\textbf{34}$ (2024).] from the Euclidean space to Riemannian warped products. Moreover, we show that interior second order a priori estimates for admissible solutions to the associated fully nonlinear elliptic partial differential equations can be readily established by similar arguments.</description>

      <title>Adjusted Connections I: Differential Cocycles for Principal Groupoid Bundles with Connection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a new perspective on principal bundles with connection as morphisms from the tangent bundle of the underlying manifold to a classifying dg-Lie groupoid. This groupoid can be identified with a lift of the inner homomorphisms groupoid arising in \v{S}evera's differentiation procedure of Lie quasi-groupoids. Our new perspective readily extends to principal groupoid bundles, but requires an adjustment, an additional datum familiar from higher gauge theory. We show that for Lie groupoids, the additional adjustment data amounts to a Cartan connection. The resulting adjusted connections naturally provide a global formulation of the kinematical data of curved Yang-Mills-Higgs theories as described by Kotov-Strobl (arXiv:1510.07654) and Fischer (arXiv:2104.02175).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive some estimates for stable minimal hypersurfaces in $R^{n+1}$. The estimates are related to recent proofs of Bernstein theorems for complete stable minimal hypersurfaces in $R^{n+1}$ for $3\le n\le 5$ by Chodosh-Li, Chodosh-Li-Minter-Stryker and Mazet. In particular, the estimates indicate that the methods in their proofs may not work for $n=6$, which is observed also by Antonelli-Xu and Mazet. The method of derivation in this work might also be applied to other problems.</description>

      <title>Streets-Tian Conjecture on several special types of Hermitian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09425v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Hermitian-symplectic metric is a Hermitian metric whose K\"ahler form is given by the $(1,1)$-part of a closed $2$-form. Streets-Tian Conjecture states that a compact complex manifold admitting a Hermitian-symplectic metric must be K\"ahlerian (i.e., admitting a K\"ahler metric). The conjecture is known to be true in dimension $2$ but is still open in dimensions $3$ or higher. In this article, we confirm the conjecture for some special types of compact Hermitian manifolds, including non-balanced Bismut torsion parallel (BTP) manifolds, and compact quotients of Lie groups whose Lie algebra is either almost abelian or contains a $J$-invariant abelian ideal of a codimension $2$. The non-balanced BTP case contains all Vaisman manifolds as a proper subset. These results extended some of the earlier works on the topic by Fino, Kasuya, Vezzoni, Angella, Otiman, and others. Our approach is elementary in nature, by giving explicit descriptions of Hermitian-symplectic metrics on such spaces as well as the pathways of deforming them into K\"ahler ones, aimed at illustrating the algebraic complexity and subtlety of Streets-Tian Conjecture.</description>

      <title>A Phase Space Approach to the Conformal Construction of Non-Vacuum Initial Data Sets in General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.15027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.15027v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a uniform (and unambiguous) procedure for scaling the matter fields in implementing the conformal method to parameterize and construct solutions of Einstein constraint equations with coupled matter sources. The approach is based on a phase space representation of the space-time matter fields after a careful $n+1$ decomposition into spatial fields $B$ and conjugate momenta $\Pi_B$, which are specified directly and are conformally invariant quantities. We show that if the Einstein-matter field theory is specified by a Lagrangian which is diffeomorphism invariant and involves no dependence on derivatives of the space-time metric in the matter portion of the Lagrangian, then fixing $B$ and $\Pi_B$ results in conformal constraint equations that, for constant-mean curvature initial data, semi-decouple just as they do for the vacuum Einstein conformal constraint equations. We prove this result by establishing a structural property of the Einstein momentum constraint that is independent of the conformal method: For an Einstein-matter field theory which satisfies the conditions just stated, if $B$ and $\Pi_B$ satisfy the matter Euler-Lagrange equations, then (in suitable form) the right-hand side of the momentum constraint on each spatial slice depends only on $B$ and $\Pi_B$ and is independent of the space-time metric. We discuss the details of our construction in the special cases of the following models: Einstein-Maxwell-charged scalar field, Einstein-Proca, Einstein-perfect fluid, and Einstein-Maxwell-charged dust. In these examples we find that our technique gives a theoretical basis for scaling rules, such as those for electromagnetism, that have worked pragmatically in the past, but also generates new equations with advantageous features for perfect fluids that allow direct specification of total rest mass and total charge in any spatial region.</description>

Abstract: We establish an entropy rigidity theorem for Hitchin representations of all geometrically finite Fuchsian groups which generalizes a theorem of Potrie and Sambarino for Hitchin representations of closed surface groups. In the process, we introduce the class of (1,1,2)-hypertransverse groups and show for such a group that the Hausdorff dimension of its conical limit set agrees with its (first) simple root entropy, providing a common generalization of results of Bishop and Jones, for Kleinian groups, and Pozzetti, Sambarino and Wienhard, for Anosov groups. We also introduce the theory of transverse representations of projectively visible groups as a tool for studying discrete subgroups of linear groups which are not necessarily Anosov or relatively Anosov.</description>

      <title>Modified defect relation of Gauss maps on annular ends of minimal surfaces for hypersurfaces of projective varieties in subgeneral position</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.10396v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $A$ be an annular end of a complete minimal surface $S$ in $\mathbb R^m$ and let $V$ be a $k$-dimension projective subvariety of $\mathbb P^n(\mathbb C)\ (n=m-1)$. Let $g$ be the generalized Gauss map of $S$ into $V\subset\mathbb P^n(\mathbb C)$. In this paper, we establish a modified defect relation of $g$ on the annular end $A$ for $q$ hypersurfaces $\{Q_i\}_{i=1}^q$ of $\mathbb P^n(\mathbb C)$ in $N$-subgeneral position with respect to $V$. Our result implies that the image $g(A)$ cannot omit all $q$ hypersurfaces $Q_1,\ldots,Q_q$ if $g$ is nondegenerate over $I_d(V)$ and $q&gt;\frac{(2N-k+1)(M+1)(M+2d)}{2d(k+1)}$, where $M=H_V(d)-1$ and $d$ is the least of common multiple of $\deg Q_1,\ldots,\deg Q_q$. As our best knowledge, it is the first time the value distribution of the Gauss map on an annular end of a minimal surfaces with hypersurface targets is studied, in particular the product into sum inequality for holomorphic curves on Riemann surfaces with hypersurfaces targets is presented. This our result has been used to study the unicity of the gauss maps in the recent work of C. Lu and X. Chen [14].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08041v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent interest in elastic problems in which the target space is non-Euclidean, we study a limit where local rest distances within an elastic body are incompatible, yet close to, distances within the ambient space. Specifically, we obtain, via $\Gamma$-convergence, a limit elastic model for a sequence of elastic bodies $(M,g_\varepsilon)$ in an ambient space $(S,s)$, for Riemannian metrics $g_\varepsilon$ and $s$ such that $g_\varepsilon \to s$. Furthermore, we relate the minimum of the limit problem to a linearized curvature discrepancy between $g_\varepsilon$ and $s$, using recent results of Kupferman and Leder. This relation confirms a linearized version of a long-standing conjecture in elasticity regarding the relation between the elastic energy and the curvature of the underlying space. The main technical challenge, compared to other linearization results in elasticity, is obtaining the correct notion of displacement for manifold-valued configurations, using Sobolev truncations and parallel transport. We show that the associated compactness result is obtained if $(S,s)$ satisfies a quantitative rigidity property, analogous to the Friesecke--James--M\"uller rigidity estimate in Euclidean space, and show that this property holds when $(S,s)$ is a round sphere.</description>

      <title>Linear Singer-Hopf conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12012v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If $X$ is a closed $2n$-dimensional aspherical manifold, i.e., the universal cover of $X$ is contractible, then the Singer-Hopf conjecture predicts that $(-1)^n\chi(X)\geq 0$. We prove this conjecture when $X$ is a complex projective manifold whose fundamental group admits an almost faithful linear representation over any field. In fact, we prove a much stronger statement that if $X$ is a complex projective manifold with large fundamental group and $\pi_1(X)$ admits an almost faithful linear representation, then $\chi(X, {P})\geq 0$ for any perverse sheaf ${P}$ on $X$.
  To prove the main result, we introduce a vanishing cycle functor of multivalued one-forms. Then using techniques from non-abelian Hodge theories in both archimedean and non-archimedean settings, we deduce the desired positivity from the geometry of pure and mixed period maps.</description>

      <title>Complex and Quaternionic Analogues of Busemann's Random Simplex and Intersection Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01057v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend two celebrated inequalities by Busemann -- the random simplex inequality and the intersection inequality -- to both complex and quaternionic vector spaces. Our proof leverages a monotonicity property under symmetrization with respect to complex or quaternionic hyperplanes. Notably, we demonstrate that the standard Steiner symmetrization, contrary to assertions in a paper by Grinberg, does not exhibit this monotonicity property.</description>

      <title>Homotopy G-algebras and moduli space operad</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9409063</link>
      <description>arXiv:hep-th/9409063v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper emphasizes the ubiquitous role of moduli spaces of algebraic curves in associative algebra and algebraic topology. The main results are: (1) the space of an operad with multiplication is a homotopy Gerstenhaber (i.e., homotopy graded Poisson) algebra; (2) the singular cochain complex is naturally an operad; (3) the operad of decorated moduli spaces acts naturally on the de Rham complex $\Omega^\bullet X$ of a K\"{a}hler manifold $X$, thereby yielding the most general type of homotopy G-algebra structure on $\Omega^\bullet X$.</description>
