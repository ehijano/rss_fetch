      <title>Analytical solutions of layered Poiseuille flows in the diffuse interface model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the two-phase macroscopic governing equations in the phase field model, the governing equations and analytical solutions for the steady-state layered Poiseuille flows in the diffuse interface (DI) model are derived and analyzed. Then, based on three dynamic viscosity models commonly used in the literature, the corresponding analytical solutions of the velocity profile are obtained. Under the condition of high dynamic viscosity ratio, the analytical solution of DI model may be significantly different from that of the sharp interface (SI) model, and the degree of deviation depends on the dynamic viscosity model and the interface thickness. Therefore, the numerical simulation of layered Poiseuille flow with DI model should be compared with the analytical solution of DI model with the same dynamic viscosity model. A direct comparison of the numerical solution results with the SI analytical solution could misinterpret the model error with the numerical error. In addition, the direct numerical simulation data and the DI analytical solutions agree well, which validates the theoretical results. Finally, a new set of symmetrical dynamic viscosity models is proposed and recommended for the simulation of two-phase flows in the DI model, which makes both the viscosity profiles and velocity profiles close to the SI model.</description>

      <title>Vortex Formation and Dissipation in Chaotic Flows: A Hypercomplex Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents a comprehensive analysis of the formation and dissipation of vortices within chaotic fluid flows, leveraging the framework of Sobolev and Besov spaces on Riemannian manifolds. Building upon the Navier-Stokes equations, we introduce a hypercomplex bifurcation approach to characterize the regularity and critical thresholds at which vortices emerge and dissipate in chaotic settings. We explore the role of differential geometry and bifurcation theory in vortex dynamics, providing a rigorous mathematical foundation for understanding these phenomena. Our approach addresses spectral decomposition, asymptotic stability, and dissipation thresholds, offering critical insights into the mechanisms of vortex formation and dissipation. Additionally, we introduce two new theorems that further elucidate the role of geometric stability and bifurcations in vortex dynamics. The first theorem demonstrates the geometric stability of vortices on manifolds with positive Ricci curvature, while the second theorem analyzes the bifurcation points that lead to the formation or dissipation of vortex structures. This research contributes to the existing literature by providing a more complete mathematical picture of the underlying mechanisms of vortex dynamics in turbulent fluid flows.</description>

      <title>The diffusive compressible Euler model in moving reference frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue to investigate the diffusive compressible Euler (dcE) model for viscous and heat conducting compressible fluid flow, which has been proposed by M. Sv\"ard as an alternative to the Navier-Stokes-Fourier (NSF) equations. The non-convective contribution to the momentum flux tensor in the dcE model is, with inverted sign, the analog of the viscous stress tensor in the NSF formulation. Unlike the latter quantity, the former tensor is non-symmetric, and here we examine some of the consequences of this property. In particular, we demonstrate that the dcE model's analog viscous stress tensor, and its resulting analog viscous dissipation term, are not objective -- that is to say, these quantities, under general time-dependent Euclidean transformations, feature moving reference frame dependence.</description>

      <title>Physics informed Shadowgraph Density Field Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a novel approach to reconstructing density fields from shadowgraph images using a physics-informed framework. By integrating traditional shadowgraph imaging techniques with physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), we effectively capture refractive index variations within complex flow fields. The proposed method addresses the inherent challenges of shadowgraphy, such as noise and limited spatial resolution, enabling accurate visualization of fluid dynamics. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and robustness of our approach, with significant agreement observed between the reconstructed density fields and experimental measurements. This research contributes to the advancement of non-intrusive diagnostic techniques in fluid mechanics and enhances our understanding of flow structures in various applications.</description>

      <title>On a pipeline pressure drop model for nonideal, compressible, gas mixture flow with application to pipeline flow of natural gas-hydrogen blends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a novel, dimensionless model that results in a dimensionless algebraic equation that can be used to quantify the pressure drop associated with the steady state, isothermal flow through a straight, horizontal pipeline, of a compressible gas mixture whose thermodynamic behavior is described for comparison purposes by ideal gas (IG) and nonideal gas generic cubic (GC) equation of state (EOS) models. A solution strategy, that uses the aforementioned dimensionless algebraic equation, is then presented that quantifies the pipeline pressure drop for hydrogen containing mixtures. Two case studies are presented to illustrate the pressure drop dependence on the hydrogen mole fraction of a binary, methane hydrogen mixture, and a natural gas hydrogen mixture with a real life natural gas composition containing eight species.</description>

      <title>A Navier-Stokes asymptotic preserving Direct Simulation Monte Carlo method for multi-species gas flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new asymptotic-preserving Monte Carlo (APMC) method for simulating multi-species gas flows. This method decomposes the collision operator of the traditional APMC methods into macro and micro collision parts: the macro collision part corresponds to the first-order Chapman-Enskog (CE) expansion, solved with a second-order scheme; In contrast, the micro collision part represents the reminder of high-order nonequilibrium terms, calculated following the traditional APMC methods. As a result, this new APMC method preserves Navier-Stokes asymptotics and second-order accuracy in the fluid limit, while maintaining the advantage of the traditional APMC methods in the kinetic limit. Therefore, it is suitable for multi-species gas flows that span multiple scales due to superior resolution and accuracy in both continuum and rarefied flow regimes. Moreover, directly constructed based on the DSMC collision solver, this new APMC method circumvents the complexities of modeling and computing kinetic models. This feature makes it easily applicable to multi-species gas flows with intricate collision models and more than two species. Finally, a coupling scheme with DSMC has been developed to extend the applicability of this new APMC method to multi-species gas flows with disparate masses.</description>

      <title>Impact of vaporization on drop aerobreakup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aerodynamic breakup of vaporizing drops is commonly seen in many spray applications. While it is well known that vaporization can modulate interfacial instabilities, the impact of vaporization on drop aerobreakup is poorly understood. Detailed interface-resolved simulations were performed to systematically study the effect of vaporization, characterized by the Stefan number, on the drop breakup and acceleration for different Weber numbers and density ratios. It is observed that the resulting asymmetric vaporization rates and strengths of Stefan flow on the windward and leeward sides of the drop hinder bag development and prevent drop breakup. The critical Weber number thus generally increases with the Stefan number. The modulation of the boundary layer also contributes to a significant increase of drag coefficient. Numerical experiments were performed to affirm that the drop volume reduction plays a negligible role and the Stefan flow is the dominant reason for the breakup suppression and drag enhancement observed.</description>

      <title>Effect of gas viscosity on the interfacial instability development in a two-phase mixing layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interfacial instability in a two-phase mixing layers between parallel gas and liquid streams is important to two-phase atomization. Depending on the inflow conditions and fluid properties, interfacial instability can be convective or absolute. The goal of the present study is to investigate the impact of gas viscosity on the interfacial instability. Both interface-resolved simulations and linear stability analysis (LSA) have been conducted. In LSA, the Orr-Sommerfeld equation is solved to analyze the spatio-temporal viscous modes. When the gas viscosity decreases, the Reynold number ($\text{Re}$) increases accordingly. The LSA demonstrates that when $\text{Re}$ is higher than a critical threshold, the instability transitions from the absolute to the convective (A/C) regimes. Such a $\text{Re}$-induced A/C transition is also observed in the numerical simulations, though the critical Re observed in simulations is significantly lower than that predicted by LSA. The LSA results indicate that the temporal growth rate decreases with Re. When the growth rate reaches zero, the A/C transition will occur. The $\text{Re}$-induced A/C transition is observed in both confined and unconfined mixing layers and also in cases with low and high gas-to-liquid density ratios. In the transition from typical absolute and convective regimes, a weak absolute regime is identified in the simulations, for which \tcr{the spectrograms} show both the absolute and convective modes. The dominant frequency in the weak absolute regime can be influenced by the perturbation introduced at the inlet. The simulation results also show that the wave propagation speed can vary in space. In the absolute instability regime, the wave propagation speed agrees well with the absolute mode celerity near the inlet and increases to the Dimotakis speed further downstream.</description>

      <title>Mode sensitivity: Connecting Lagrangian coherent structures with modal analysis for fluid flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the relationship between modal representations obtained from data-driven decomposition methods and Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCSs). Mode sensitivity is used to describe this analysis as an extension of the model sensitivity framework developed by Kasz\'as and Haller (2020). The method, based on the computation of the finite-time-Lyapunov exponent, uses modes from fluid data to compute the amplitude perturbations experienced by fluid particle trajectories along with their sensitivity to initial conditions. Demonstrations of the method are presented with both periodic and turbulent flows, including a kinematic flow model, experimental data from the wake past an oscillating foil, numerical data of the classical cylinder wake flow, and a direct numerical simulation (DNS) of a turbulent channel flow. Mode sensitivity fields reveal both quantitatively and qualitatively how the finite-time Lyapunov exponent fields used to visualize LCSs change due to the influence of modes or external perturbations.</description>

      <title>Transition time of a bouncing drop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contact time of bouncing drops is one of the most essential parameters to quantify the water-repellency of surfaces. Generally, the contact time on superhydrophobic surfaces is known to be Weber number-independent. Here, we probe an additional characteristic time, \emph{transition time} inherent in water drop impacting on superhydrophobic surfaces, marking a switch from a predominantly lateral to an axial motion. Systematic experiments and numerical simulations show that the transition time is also Weber number-independent and accounts for half the contact time. Additionally we identify a Weber-independent partition of volume at the maximum spreading state between the rim and lamella and show that the latter contains 1/4 of the total volume of the drop.</description>

      <title>Intermittency of bubble deformation in turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deformation of finite-sized bubbles in intense turbulence exhibits complex geometries beyond simple spheroids as the bubbles exchange energy with the surrounding eddies across a wide range of scales. This study investigates deformation via the velocity of the most stretched tip of the deformed bubble in 3D, as the tip extension results from the compression of the rest of the interface by surrounding eddies. The results show that the power spectrum based on the tip velocity exhibits a scaling akin to that of the Lagrangian statistics of fluid elements, but decays with a distinct timescale and magnitude modulated by the Weber number based on the bubble size. This indicates that the interfacial energy is primarily siphoned from eddies of similar sizes as the bubble. Moreover, the tip velocity appears much more intermittent than the velocity increment, and its distribution near the extreme tails can be explained by the proposed model that accounts for the fact that small eddies with sufficient energy can contribute to extreme deformation. These findings provide a framework for understanding the energy transfer between deformable objects and multiscale eddies in intense turbulence.</description>

      <title>Super-resolution with dynamics in the loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Super-resolution of turbulence is a term used to describe the prediction of high-resolution snapshots of a flow from coarse-grained observations. This is typically accomplished with a deep neural network and training usually requires a dataset of high-resolution images. An approach is presented here in which robust super resolution can be performed without access to high-resolution reference data, as might be expected in an experiment. The training procedure is similar to data assimilation, wherein the model learns to predict an initial condition that leads to accurate coarse-grained predictions at later times, while only being shown coarse-grained observations. Implementation of the approach requires the use of a fully differentiable flow solver in the training loop to allow for time-marching of predictions. A range of models are trained on data generated from forced, two-dimensional turbulence. The networks have reconstruction errors which are similar to those obtained with `standard' super-resolution approaches using high resolution data. Furthermore, they significantly outperform data-assimilation for state-estimation on individual trajectories, allowing accurate reconstruction on coarser grids than is possible with standard variational approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the results of numerical modeling of laminar flows of a viscous incompressible fluid in a flat diffuser with and without vibration effects. Two methods of flow symmetrization in a flat diffuser are considered: by means of periodic vibration action at the inlet to the diffuser and on its walls. Modeling has shown that it is possible to symmetrize the flow of a viscous liquid in the diffuser by using a weak harmonic vibration action, the speed of which can be less than 0.01% of the speed of the main flow</description>

      <title>Topological vortex identification for Hamiltonian flows in doubly periodic domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The motion of two-dimensional incompressible and viscous fluids in doubly periodic domains is often used as a numerical model to investigate the dynamics and statistical properties of two-dimensional (2d) turbulence. In the study of 2d turbulence, it is important to describe interactions of coherent vortex structures of various sizes in turbulent flows, but identifying such vortex structures accurately from complex flow patterns is not easy. In this paper, we provide a classification theory for the topological structure of particle orbits generated by two-dimensional Hamiltonian flows on a flat torus $\mathbb{T}^2$, which is a mathematical model of 2d incompressible and viscous flows. Based on this theory, we show that the global orbit structure of every Hamiltonian flow is converted into a planar tree, called {\it a partially Cyclically-Ordered rooted Tree (COT)}, and its string expression (COT representation). Applying the conversion algorithm to snapshots of two-dimensional free-decaying turbulence and enstrophy cascade turbulence, we demonstrate that the topological structure of a complex flow pattern can be represented by a simple tree and a sequence of letters by the conversion algorithm, thereby extracting coherent vortex structures successfully from the viewpoint of topology.</description>

      <title>Modifications of SPH towards three-dimensional simulations of an icy moon with internal ocean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are some traces of the existence of internal ocean in some icy moons, such as the vapor plumes of Europa and Enceladus. This implies a region of liquid water beneath the surface ice shell. Since liquid water would be essential for the origin of life, it is important to understand the development of these internal oceans, particularly their temperature distribution and evolution. The balance between tidal heating and radiative cooling is believed to sustain liquid water beneath an icy moon's surface. We aim to simulate the tidal heating of an internal ocean in an icy moon using 3-dimensional numerical fluid calculations with the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method. We incorporated viscosity and thermal conduction terms into the governing equations of SPH. However, we encountered two issues while calculating rigid body rotation using SPH with a viscous term: (1) conventional viscosity formulations generated unphysical forces that hindered rotation, and (2) there was artificial internal energy partitioning within the layered structure, which was due to the standard SPH formulations. To address the first issue, we modified the viscosity formulation.For the second, we adopted Density Independent SPH (DISPH) developed in previous studies to improve behavior at discontinuous surfaces. Additionally, we implemented radiative cooling using an algorithm to define fluid surfaces via the particle method. We also introduced an equation of state accounting for phase transitions. With these modifications, we have refined the SPH method to encompass all necessary physical processes for simulating the evolution of icy moons with internal oceans.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a projection-based reduced order modelling (ROM) framework for unsteady parametrized optimal control problems (OCP$_{(\mu)}$s) arising from cardiovascular (CV) applications. In real-life scenarios, accurately defining outflow boundary conditions in patient-specific models poses significant challenges due to complex vascular morphologies, physiological conditions, and high computational demands. These challenges make it difficult to compute realistic and reliable CV hemodynamics by incorporating clinical data such as 4D magnetic resonance imaging. To address these challenges, we focus on controlling the outflow boundary conditions to optimize CV flow dynamics and minimize the discrepancy between target and computed flow velocity profiles. The fluid flow is governed by unsteady Navier--Stokes equations with physical parametric dependence, i.e. the Reynolds number. Numerical solutions of OCP$_{(\mu)}$s require substantial computational resources, highlighting the need for robust and efficient ROMs to perform real-time and many-query simulations. Here, we aim at investigating the performance of a projection-based reduction technique that relies on the offline-online paradigm, enabling significant computational cost savings. The Galerkin finite element method is used to compute the high-fidelity solutions in the offline phase. We implemented a nested-proper orthogonal decomposition (nested-POD) for fast simulation of OCP$_{(\mu)}$s that encompasses two stages: temporal compression for reducing dimensionality in time, followed by parametric-space compression on the precomputed POD modes. We tested the efficacy of the methodology on vascular models, namely an idealized bifurcation geometry and a patient-specific coronary artery bypass graft, incorporating stress control at the outflow boundary, observing consistent speed-up with respect to high-fidelity strategies.</description>

      <title>Spanwise variations in membrane flutter dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the large-amplitude flutter of rectangular membranes in 3-D inviscid flows. The membranes' deformations vary significantly in both the chordwise and spanwise directions. Many previous studies used 2D flow models and neglected spanwise variations, so here we focus on cases with significant spanwise nonuniformity. We determine when such cases occur and how the dynamics vary over the parameter space of membrane mass and pretension for two sets of boundary conditions and two values of both the Poisson ratio and the membrane aspect ratio. With spanwise symmetric and asymmetric initial perturbations, the motions differ for long times but eventually reach the same steady state in most cases.
  At large times, spanwise symmetric and asymmetric oscillations are seen, with the latter more common. Oscillations are often in the form of "side-to-side" and other standing wave motions along the span, as well as traveling wave motions, particularly with free side-edges. Motions are generally nonperiodic and more spatially complex with a large membrane mass, and sometimes periodic at small-to-moderate membrane mass. A large Poisson ratio gives somewhat smoother spatial and temporal features in the dynamics at a given pretension. Increasing the aspect ratio makes the deflection more uniform along the span. With different chordwise and spanwise pretensions we find motions that are qualitatively similar to cases with isotropic pretensions between the anisotropic values.</description>

      <title>Generalization capabilities and robustness of hybrid machine learning models grounded in flow physics compared to purely deep learning models</title>

Abstract: This study investigates the generalization capabilities and robustness of purely deep learning (DL) models and hybrid models based on physical principles in fluid dynamics applications, specifically focusing on iteratively forecasting the temporal evolution of flow dynamics. Three autoregressive models were compared: a convolutional autoencoder combined with a convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM), a variational autoencoder (VAE) combined with a ConvLSTM and a hybrid model that combines proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) with a LSTM (POD-DL). These models were tested on two high-dimensional, nonlinear datasets representing the velocity field of flow past a circular cylinder in both laminar and turbulent regimes. The study used latent dimension methods, enabling a bijective reduction of high-dimensional dynamics into a lower-order space to facilitate future predictions. While the VAE and ConvLSTM models accurately predicted laminar flow, the hybrid POD-DL model outperformed the others across both laminar and turbulent flow regimes. This success is attributed to the model's ability to incorporate modal decomposition, reducing the dimensionality of the data, by a non-parametric method, and simplifying the forecasting component. By leveraging POD, the model not only gained insight into the underlying physics, improving prediction accuracy with less training data, but also reduce the number of trainable parameters as POD is non-parametric. The findings emphasize the potential of hybrid models, particularly those integrating modal decomposition and deep learning, in predicting complex flow dynamics.</description>

      <title>Variational data assimilation in wall turbulence: From outer observations to wall stress and pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimation of near-wall turbulence in channel flow from outer observations is investigated using adjoint-variational data assimilation. We first consider fully resolved velocity data, starting at a distance from the wall. By enforcing the estimated flow to exactly satisfy the Navier-Stokes equations, we seek a statistically stationary turbulent state that reproduces the instantaneous outer measurements. Such an estimated state provides full access to the unknown near-wall turbulence, including the wall shear stresses and pressure. When the first observation is within fifty viscous units from the wall, the correlation coefficient between the true and estimated state exceeds 95%. As the observations are further separated from the wall, at ninety viscous units, the accuracy of the assimilated wall stresses decreases to 40% at the wall. This trend is nearly independent of the Reynolds number. The Fourier spectrum of the estimation error is qualitatively consistent with the coherence spectrum between the outer and the inner state variables: observed long wavelength structures in the outer flow have deeper coherence into the unobserved near-wall region, and therefore the error is lowest at large scales. Nevertheless, the adjoint-variational approach provides a more rigorous quantification of the capacity to accurately predict the instantaneous near-wall turbulence from outer measurements. Lastly, we demonstrate the robustness of the estimation accuracy using filtered and sub-sampled outer observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09844v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review some recent developments in mathematical aspects of relativistic fluids. The goal is to provide a quick entry point to some research topics of current interest that is accessible to graduate students and researchers from adjacent fields, as well as to researches working on broader aspects of relativistic fluid dynamics interested in its mathematical formalism. Instead of complete proofs, which can be found in the published literature, here we focus on the proofs' main ideas and key concepts. After an introduction to the relativistic Euler equations, we cover the following topics: a new wave-transport formulation of the relativistic Euler equations tailored to applications; the problem of shock formation for relativistic Euler; rough (i.e., low-regularity) solutions to the relativistic Euler equations; the relativistic Euler equations with a physical vacuum boundary; relativistic fluids with viscosity. We finish with a discussion of open problems and future directions of research.</description>

      <title>The quantum vortices dynamics: spatio-temporal scale hierarchy and origin of turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.01085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the evolution and interaction of quantum vortex loops with a small but non-zero radius of core ${\sf a}$. The quantization scheme of the classical vortex system is based on the approach proposed by the author \cite{Tal,Tal_PhRF}.
  We consider small perturbations in the ring-shaped loops, which include both helical-type shape variations and small excitations of the flow in the vortex core. The quantization of the circulation $\Gamma$ is deduced from the first principles of quantum theory. As a result of our approach, the set of quantized circulation values is wider than the standard one. The developed theory introduces a hierarchical spatio-temporal scale in the quantum evolution of vortices. We also explore the applicability of this model for describing the origins of turbulence in quantum fluid flows. To achieve this specific objective, we employ the method of random Hamiltonians to describe the interaction of quantum vortex loops.</description>

      <title>Strongly stable dual-pairing summation by parts finite difference schemes for the vector invariant nonlinear shallow water equations -- I: Numerical scheme and validation on the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12739v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an energy/entropy stable and high order accurate finite difference (FD) method for solving the nonlinear (rotating) shallow water equations (SWEs) in vector invariant form using the newly developed dual-pairing and dispersion-relation preserving summation by parts (SBP) FD operators. We derive new well-posed boundary conditions (BCs) for the SWE in one space dimension, formulated in terms of fluxes and applicable to linear and nonlinear SWEs. For the nonlinear vector invariant SWE in the subcritical regime, where energy is an entropy functional, we find that energy/entropy stability ensures the boundedness of numerical solution but does not guarantee convergence. Adequate amount of numerical dissipation is necessary to control high frequency errors which could negatively impact accuracy in the numerical simulations. Using the dual-pairing SBP framework, we derive high order accurate and nonlinear hyper-viscosity operator which dissipates entropy and enstrophy. The hyper-viscosity operator effectively minimises oscillations from shocks and discontinuities, and eliminates high frequency grid-scale errors. The numerical method is most suitable for the simulations of subcritical flows typically observed in atmospheric and geostrophic flow problems. We prove both nonlinear and local linear stability results, as well as a priori error estimates for the semi-discrete approximations of both linear and nonlinear SWEs. Convergence, accuracy, and well-balanced properties are verified via the method of manufactured solutions and canonical test problems such as the dam break and lake at rest. Numerical simulations in two-dimensions are presented which include the rotating and merging vortex problem and barotropic shear instability, with fully developed turbulence.</description>
