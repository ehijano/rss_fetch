      <title>Scalar, Vector Perturbations and Effective Hawking Radiation of Cylindrical Black Holes in $f(\mathcal{R})$ and Ricci-Inverse Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates scalar perturbations and quasinormal modes (QNMs) associated with cylindrical black holes constructed within the frameworks of $f(\mathcal{R})$-gravity and Ricci-Inverse ($\mathcal{RI}$) gravity. Moreover, we study the modified Hawking radiation in these black hole solutions and analyze the effects of coupling constants. These modified theories, which extend general relativity by introducing higher-order curvature corrections and additional geometric terms, provide a rich platform for exploring deviations from standard gravitational physics. The study begins by revisiting the cylindrical black holes in these modified gravity theories, where the effective cosmological constants respectively, are represented by $\Lambda_m^{f(\mathcal{R})}$ and $\Lambda_m^{\mathcal{RI}}$ related to the coupling constants unique to each framework. Afterwards, the QNMs, intrinsic damped oscillations of the black hole space-time, are analyzed to probe the stability of the system, with the effective potential $V$ revealing the impact of the modified gravity parameters. Additionally, the thermodynamic properties of the black holes are examined through the lens of the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP), which introduces quantum corrections to Hawking radiation. The GUP-modified Hawking temperature and entropy are derived, demonstrating significant deviations from classical results and highlighting the quantum gravitational effects in these modified frameworks. By linking QNMs, thermodynamics, and quantum corrections, this work not only deepens the understanding of modified gravity theories but also offers potential observational pathways to test their validity.</description>

      <title>An oscillating Rastall universe crossing the phantom divide line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A cyclic flat universe with quintom behaviour and future big rip has been presented in the framework of Rastall gravity, which is an extension of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. The Hubble parameter oscillates periodically between positive and negative values from one cycle to the next. Cosmic transit has been simulated through an oscillating time-dependent deceleration parameter, and is expected to occur at approximately $ 8.7~~ \text{Gyr}$. The causality is satisfied all the time except near the initial singularity and the future Big Rip singularity.The apparent horizon, entropy and other thermodynamical quantities associated to the current model have been analyzed. Energy conditions have been investigated.</description>

      <title>Scattering of wave dark matter by supermassive black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent simulations of wave dark matter around black hole binaries revealed the formation of a universal density profile that co-rotates with the binary. We derive this profile from first principles, interpreting it as the steady state of a scattering process. We find that the scattering becomes particularly efficient when the ratio of the binary separation to the dark matter's de Broglie wavelength assumes certain discrete values, which can be interpreted as bound state resonances. After estimating the amount of dark matter that undergoes this type of scattering off supermassive black hole binaries at galactic centers, we demonstrate that the process can induce an observable modification of the slope of the Pulsar Timing Array spectrum. This opens up a new possibility to gain insights on the nature of dark matter from observations of low-frequency gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Timelike boundary and corner terms in the causal set action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The causal set action of dimension $d$ is investigated for causal sets that are Poisson sprinklings into submanifolds of $d$-dimensional Minkowski space. Evidence, both analytic and numerical, is provided for the conjecture that the mean of the causal set action over sprinklings into a manifold with a timelike boundary, diverges like $l^{-1}$ in the continuum limit as the discreteness length $l$ tends to zero. A novel conjecture for the contribution to the causal set action from co-dimension 2 corners, also known as joints, is proposed and justified.</description>

      <title>Generation of quantum entanglement in superposed diamond spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A comprehensive study integrating the microscopic structure of spacetime and the principle of quantum superposition is capable of offering a fundamental bottom-up approach for understanding the quantum aspect of gravity. In this paper, we present a framework for the superposition causal diamond spacetime and analyze the behavior of quantum entanglement influenced by the spacetime superposition from the perspective of relativistic quantum information. For the first time, we combine the concept of spacetime superposition with causal diamonds and derive the analytical expression of the Unruh-diamond vacuum state for Dirac fields in the superposed causal diamond spacetime. Based on this, we analyze both initially correlated and uncorrelated modes in superposed and classical causal diamond spacetimes, and quantify how quantum thermal effects arising from spacetime structure alter entanglement. Our findings reveal that quantum entanglement degrades in classical diamond spacetime, while the superposing structure of spacetime generates additional entanglement resources between modes in superposed diamond spacetimes. From a quantum information perspective, our results suggest that the characteristics of spacetime superposition can serve as valuable resources for performing quantum information processing tasks.</description>

      <title>Strong gravitational lensing effects around rotating regular black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we investigate the strong gravitational lensing effects around two classes of rotating regular black holes, which behave as non-singular Minkowski core at the center. Starting from the null geodesic in the equatorial plane of the regular black holes, we analyze the deflection angle for both prograde photons and retrograde photons, which are found to significantly shift from that for Kerr black hole. Then we suppose the rotating regular black holes as the supermassive M87* and SgrA* black holes, respectively, and evaluate the lensing observables such as the image position, separation, magnification and the time delays between the relativistic images for the black holes. In both cases, the time delay differences between the regular black holes and Kerr black hole seem to be measurable, especially for the M87* black hole, but the deviations of outermost relativistic image and the asymptotic relativistic image for the two rotating regular black holes from those for Kerr black hole are less than 10 $\mu as$. This means that it is difficult to probe the regularity of the black hole via the current observations, but we can expect the next generation Event Horizon Telescope to test more precise properties of strong field regime.</description>

      <title>Algorithms for generating and analyzing black hole images based on the analytical equations of lightlike geodesics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analytical orbit equation of the lightlike geodesics through any fixed spatial point in Schwarzschild spacetime is explicitly presented in terms of the impact parameter, and with the result, the algorithms for generating and analyzing the black hole images under various accretion models are constructed. For the static and infalling spherical shell models of optically thin accretion, the integrated intensity observed by a distant observer is derived based on the backward ray tracing method. By taking the monochromatic emission pattern with a $1/r^{2}$ radial profile as example, the black hole images for the spherical shell with different boundaries are plotted, and then, the geometrical features and luminosity variations of these images are summarized. A notable feature of the black hole images for the infalling spherical shell model is that when the inner boundary of the spherical shell is sufficiently large, the doppler effects can strengthen the luminosity in the small adjacent region outside the shadow. The circular annulus models of optically and geometrically thin accretion are further explored. For a lightlike geodesic, the transfer functions establishing the connection between the emitting and receiving points are first provided in the algebraic manner, and the redshift factors in the static, infalling, and rotating circular annulus models are then deduced. With these results, in the three models, the integrated intensities observed by a distant observer viewing the circular annulus at an inclination angle are derived, and the corresponding black hole images for each emission pattern furnished in Phys. Rev. D \textbf{100} (2019) 024018 are plotted. Finally, the geometrical features and the luminosity variations of these images are also summarized.</description>

      <title>Weak Gravity Limit in Newer General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse linearised field equations around the Minkowski metric with its standard flat parallel transport in models of Newer GR, that is quadratic actions in terms of nonmetricity tensor. We show that half of the freedom in choosing the model parameters is immediately fixed by asking for reasonable properties of tensors and vectors, defined with respect to spatial rotations, and accurately describe the much more complicated sector of scalars. In particular, we show that, from the teleparallel viewpoint, the model of STEGR with addition of a gradient squared of the metric determinant exhibits three halves new dynamical modes, and not just one like it was previously claimed.</description>

      <title>Evolution of interior entropy of a loop quantum-corrected black hole pierced by a cosmic string</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of interior entropy of black hole provides a possible way to deal with information problem. We derive evolution relation between interior entropy and Bekenstein-Hawking entropy for a loop quantum-corrected black hole with large mass pierced by an infinitely straight cosmic string during Hawking radiation. We find that the present cosmic string can influence the evolution relation between these two types of entropy under black hole evaporation and the second law of thermodynamics is satisfied for the total variation of these two types of entropy.</description>

      <title>Vacuum Magnetospheres aroud Kerr Black Holes with a Thin Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a model for stationary and axisymmetric black hole magnetospheres by solving the vacuum Maxwell equations in Kerr backgrounds. The poloidal magnetic field is generated by a toroidal electric current in a thin disk on the equatorial plane with an inner edge, and the poloidal electric field is induced due to the black hole spin. We assume a current distribution whose direction reverses at a radius on the disk. The magnetospheric structure is divided into the inner region and the outer one due to the current reversal. In the inner region, some magnetic field lines connect the black hole and the disk, and others surround the inner edge of the disk. In the outer region, the field lines connect the disk and infinity. We investigate the black hole spin dependence of the magnetospheric structure. In the magnetosphere around the Kerr black hole, the electric fields is generated by the black hole spin. In our model, the charge distribution is induced on the disk and the event horizon. Except near the black hole, the electric field strength is proportional to the black hole spin, while the direction of the electric field remains almost the same regardless of the spin. On the other hand, the electromagnetic field near the event horizon strongly depends on the spin. In the maximally rotating case, the magnetic field lines are expelled from the event horizon and the electric equipotential surface coincides with the horizon.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal Ringing of de Sitter Braneworlds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compared with the Poincar\'e braneworld, the de Sitter (dS) braneworld aligns more closely with the present universe characterized by a small but finite cosmological constant. To explore the quasinormal ringing properties within the dS brane scenario, we investigate the gravitational perturbations in both thin and thick dS brane configurations. Analysis of the perturbation equations reveals that the effective potential along the extra dimension exhibits the shape of P\"oschl-Teller potential, asymptotically approaching a constant value (mass gap) at infinity. And analytical calculations further indicate that the gravitational perturbations, apart from the zero mode, possess a series of discrete, purely imaginary quasinormal modes in the late stages. This result implies that these perturbations decay without oscillation over time. The analytical findings also demonstrate that the brane structure primarily determines the distribution of the quasinormal spectrum while preserving the purely imaginary nature of the quasinormal frequencies. Subsequently, we further simulate the gravitational wave signal by numerically evolving the perturbation equations, which yield late-stage results consistent with the analytical predictions. Interestingly, these quasinormal modes carry information about the cosmological constant on the brane, which provides a potential new pathway for the study of cosmology in the dS brane scenario.</description>

      <title>New Agegraphic Dark Energy Model in Modified Symmetric Teleparallel Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we examine the cosmological significance of the new agegraphic dark energy model by investigating different cosmological parameters such as the equation of state parameter, $\omega_{D}-\omega^{\prime}_{D}$ and the $r-s$ planes in the framework of $f(\mathcal{Q})$ theory. We consider flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe model under interacting conditions between dark energy and dark matter. The equation of state parameter indicates a quintessence-like characteristic of the universe. The stability of the model is analyzed using the squared speed of sound parameter which demonstrates the unstable behavior of the new agegraphic dark energy model throughout the cosmic evolution. The freezing region is represented by the $\omega_{D}-\omega^{\prime}_{D}$ plane, while the Chaplygin gas model corresponds to the $r-s$ plane. It is worthwhile to mention here that the interacting new agegraphic dark energy model addresses the cosmic coincidence problem by allowing the energy density ratio between dark energy and dark matter to evolve slowly over cosmic time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the Misner space, incorporating Kip Thorne's "moving wall" model, and pseudo-Schwarzschild spacetime, exploring their geometric structures, geodesics, and causal properties. We propose that pseudo-Schwarzschild spacetime serves as a non-flat generalization of Misner space. We then introduce the pseudo-Reissner-Nordstr\"om spacetime, a novel chronology-violating model that extends the previous two frameworks and unifies the geodesic structures of all three spacetimes. We suggest that these spacetimes constitute a causality-violating family, interconnected through common fundamental causal features$-$geodesics, Cauchy and chronology horizons, and acausal regions$-$leading a conjecture that they are isocausal.</description>

      <title>Generalized Kerr-Schild spacetimes in arbitrary dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the class of generalized Kerr-Schild (GKS) spacetimes in dimensions $n\geq 3$ and analyze their geometric and algebraic properties in a completely theory-independent setting. First, considering the case of a general null vector $\mathbf{k}$ defined by the GKS metric, we obtain the conditions under which it is geodesic. Assuming $\mathbf{k}$ to be geodesic for the remainder of the paper, we examine the alignment properties of the curvature tensors, namely the Ricci and Weyl tensors. We show that the algebraic types of the curvatures of the full (GKS) geometry are constrained by those of the respective background curvatures, thereby listing all kinematically allowed combinations of the algebraic types for the background and the full geometry. A notable aspect of these results is that, unlike the case of Kerr-Schild (KS) spacetimes, the Weyl types of the GKS spacetimes need not be type $II$ or more special. Then, focusing on the case of an expanding $\mathbf k$, we derive the conditions for it to satisfy the optical constraint, extending the previous results of KS spacetimes. We illustrate the general results using the example of (A)dS-Taub-NUT spacetimes in $n=4$, where we also comment on their KS double copy from a GKS perspective. Finally, as an application of our general results, we obtain the full family of GKS spacetimes with a geodesic, expanding, twistfree, and shearfree $\mathbf k$, satisfying the vacuum Einstein equations, and identify it with a subset of the higher-dimensional vacuum Robinson-Trautman solutions. In passing, we also determine the subcase of these solutions that manifests the KS double copy.</description>

      <title>Astrophysical Black holes: An Explanation for the Galaxy Quenching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose models of Astrophysical Black holes (ABHs) without event horizons (EHs), as a more viable explanation for the long-term quenching phenomenon in galaxies. At the same time, the short-term quenching is explained here in terms of an efficient feedback expected in the models of stellar-mass astrophysical black holes (StMABHs). We have calculated the radiative flux from the disk in a general spherically symmetric metric background and used it to contrast the distinctive features of the BHs and ABHs scenarios. The nature of the feedbacks arising from accretion onto a BH and an ABH in the `quasar' and `radio' modes are compared and some possible observational signatures of the StMABHs are pointed out.</description>

      <title>How does non-metricity affect particle creation and evaporation in bumblebee gravity?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze the impact of non-metricity on particle creation and the evaporation process of black holes within the framework of bumblebee gravity. In general lines, we compare black holes in the metric formalism [1] and the metric-affine approach [2]. Initially, we focus on bosonic particle modes to investigate Hawking radiation. Using the Klein-Gordon equation, we compute the Bogoliubov coefficients and derive the Hawking temperature. Subsequently, we examine Hawking radiation as a tunneling process, resolving divergent integrals through the residue method. The analysis is then extended to fermionic particle modes, also within the tunneling framework. Particle creation densities are calculated for both bosonic and fermionic cases. Additionally, greybody bounds are estimated for bosonic and fermionic particles. Finally, we explore the evaporation process, considering the final state of the black holes. In a general panorama, non-metricity in bumblebee gravity raises particle density for bosons while reducing it for fermions, increases greybody factors (for both bosons and fermions), amplifies the emission rate, and accelerates the evaporation process.</description>

      <title>On optimal LISA orbit design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ESA/NASA joint LISA (laser interferometer space antenna) mission is designed to detect gravitational waves, which relies crucially on maintaining three-spacecraft constellation as close to an equilateral triangle with a designed distance as possible. Efforts have been made to achieve this goal by using various simplified models to make it easy to approximately solve the complex problem. In this paper, the problem is formulated as a nonlinear optimization problem using exact nonlinear Kepler's orbit equations. It is shown that the optimal solution based on the exact nonlinear Kepler's orbit equations gives a better solution than the previously obtained ones.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Waterfall: a unitary phenomenological model for black hole evaporation with Page curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a unitary phenomenological model for black hole evaporation based on the analogy of the laboratory process of spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC) \cite{Alsing:2015,Alsing:2016} when the black hole (pump) is allowed to deplete to zero mass. The model incorporates an additional new feature that allows for the interior Hawking partner-particles (idlers) behind the horizon to further generate new Hawking particle pairs of lower energy, one of which remains behind the horizon, and the other that adds to the externally emitted Hawking radiation (signals) outside the horizon. This model produces a Page curve for the evolution of the reduced density matrices for the evaporating black hole internal degrees of freedom entangled with the generated Hawking radiation pairs entangled across the horizon. The Page curve yields an entropy that rises at early times during the evaporation process as Hawking pairs are generated, reaches a peak midway through the evolution, and then decays to zero upon complete evaporation of the black hole. The entire system remains in a pure state at all times undergoing unitary (squeezed state) evolution, with the initial state of the black hole modeled as a bosonic Fock state of large, but finite number $n_{p0}$ of particles. For the final state of the system, the black hole reaches the vacuum state of zero mass, while the external Hawking radiation carries away the total energy of the initial black hole. Inside the horizon there remains $n_{p0}$ Hawking partner-particles of vanishingly small total energy, reminiscent of the "soft-hair" (zero energy) qubit model of Hotta, Nambu and Yamaguchi \cite{Hotta_Nambu_Yamaguchi:2018}, but now from a Hamiltonian for squeezed state generation perspective. The model presented here can be readily extended to encompass arbitrary initial pure states for the black hole, and in falling matter.</description>

      <title>Topological Insights into Black Hole Thermodynamics: Non-Extensive Entropy in CFT framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, We conducted an in-depth investigation into the thermodynamic topology of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet black holes within the framework of Conformal Field Theory (CFT), considering the implications of non-extensive entropy formulations. Our study reveals that the parameter $\lambda$ (R\'{e}nyi entropy) plays a crucial role in the phase behavior of black holes. Specifically, when $\lambda$ is below the critical value (C), it has a negligible impact on the phase behavior. However, when $\lambda$ exceeds the critical value, it significantly alters the phase transition outcomes. Determining the most physically representative values of $\lambda$ will require experimental validation, but this parameter flexibility allows researchers to better explain black hole phase transitions under varying physical conditions. Furthermore, the parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ affect the phase structure and topological charge for the Sharma-Mittal entropy. Only in the case of $C&gt;C_c$ and in the condition of $\alpha\approx\beta$ will we have a first-order phase transition with topological charge + 1. Additionally, for the loop quantum gravity non-extensive entropy as the parameter $q$ approaches 1, the classification of topological charges changes. We observe configurations with one and three topological charges with respect to critical value $C$, resulting in a total topological charge $W = +1$, and configurations with two topological charges $(\omega = +1, -1)$, leading to a total topological charge $W = 0$. These findings provide new insights into the complex phase behavior and topological characteristics of black holes in the context of CFT and non-extensive entropy formulations.</description>

      <title>Thin Accretion Disk Around Rotating Hairy Black Hole: Radiative Property and Optical Appearance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gravitational decoupling method systematically generates hairy modifications to the solutions in general relativity due to new gravitational sources. In view of the recent advances in astronomical observations, these hairy solutions are expected to be testable in the near-term observations. In this paper, we study the radiative property and optical appearance of the thin accretion disk around the rotating hairy black holes obtained by gravitational decoupling. We numerically compute the radiative flux, temperature, and differential luminosity of the thin accretion disk, and we also show its bolometric image by the ray-tracing method. By comparing with the results for the Kerr metric, we found that the deviations of the observational properties of the thin accretion disk from those of Kerr metric becomes significant in the rapid rotating case, or in the inner region of the disk. These results guide the observational investigations on the rotating hairy black hole.</description>

      <title>Stable long-term evolution in numerical relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the potential occurrence of a numerical instability in the long-time simulation of black holes using the Baumgarte-Shapiro-Shibata-Nakamura formulation of numerical relativity, even in the simple set-up of a Schwarzschild black hole. Through extensive numerical experiments, we identify that this ``late-time instability'' arises from accumulated violations of the momentum constraint. To address this issue, we propose two modified versions of the so-called conformal covariant Z4 scheme, designed to propagate momentum constraint violations without damping. Our results demonstrate that these alternative formulations, which we refer to as CCZ4' and CCZ3, effectively resolve the late-time numerical instability not only in Schwarzschild spacetimes but also in black hole spacetimes with matter fields. Notably, by preventing damping of the momentum constraint violation, the Hamiltonian constraint damping can be significantly increased, which plays a crucial role in stabilizing long-term evolution in our proposed schemes.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Study of Generalized Ghost Dark Energy in $f(\textsl{Q}, \textsl{L}_{m})$ Gravity: New Insights into Cosmic Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the generalized ghost dark energy model in the framework of $f(\textsl{Q}, \textsl{L}_{m})$ gravity, where $\textsl{Q}$ represents the non-metricity scalar and $\textsl{L}_{m}$ denotes the matter-Lagrangian density. We take the homogeneous and isotropic universe with an ideal matter distribution and examine a scenario with interacting dark energy and dark matter. We then reconstruct $f(\textsl{Q}, \textsl{L}_{m})$ model to examine the effects of this extended gravitational framework on the cosmic evolution. The behavior of numerous cosmic parameters are explored corresponding to distinct parametric values. The stability is evaluated by the squared sound speed method. The statefinder $(r,s)$ and standard diagnostic pairs $(\omega_D-\omega'_{D})$ are used to study the various cosmic eras. Our results align with recent observational evidence, indicating that the $f(\textsl{Q}, \textsl{L}_{m})$ model effectively characterizes dark energy and cosmic evolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study derives the mass spectrum and entropy of the Brown--Kucha\v{r} dust in anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime using the fractional Wheeler--DeWitt (WDW) equation. The generalized fractional WDW equation is formulated using a fractional quantization map, demonstrating a correlation between the fractal mass dimension of the Brown--Kucha\v{r} dust and L\'evy's fractional parameter $\alpha$ of the Riesz fractional quantum operator. These findings may provide new insights into the ramifications of the fractal behavior of cosmic structures in quantum cosmology and quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Probing Loop Quantum Gravity via Kerr Black Hole and EHT Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a study on optical properties and shadow of quantum Schwarzschild black hole appeared in [Ye et al., Phys. Lett. B 851, 138566, (2024)] for a fixed Barbero-Immirzi parameter $\gamma$. Following the same approach, we considered its rotating counterpart which is precisely a deformed Kerr metric in Loop Quantum Gravity. The deviation between the quantum-corrected Kerr and Kerr black holes has been investigated by the analysis of horizon structure and null geodesics by assuming a fixed value of $\gamma$. We have proved a theorem dealing with the location of unstable circular null orbits for all metrics of this kind by incorporating the convexity of effective potential of the Kerr black hole. The deviation between the shadows of the quantum-corrected and Kerr black holes has also been studied, and lastly the shadow analysis is incorporated in comparison with the EHT results for M87* and Sgr A* to precisely probe the quantity of deviation due to quantum correction. We have found that the quantum correction significantly reduces the extremal spin value and hence the size of the black hole as compared to Kerr black hole. Moreover, the unstable null orbits for quantum black hole are always smaller than the unstable null orbits for Kerr black hole. Lastly, we found that the quantum correction allows the deformed Kerr black hole to mimic Sgr A* with a higher probability than the Kerr black hole. However, the quantum-corrected Kerr black hole barely mimics M87*.</description>

      <title>Post-adiabatic waveform-generation framework for asymmetric precessing binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent years have seen rapid progress in calculations of gravitational waveforms from asymmetric compact binaries containing spinning secondaries. Here we outline a complete waveform-generation scheme, through first post-adiabatic order (1PA) in gravitational self-force theory, for generic secondary spin and generic (eccentric, precessing) orbital configurations around a generic Kerr primary. We emphasize the utility of a Fermi-Walker frame in parametrizing the secondary spin, and we analyse precession and nutation effects in the spin-orbit dynamics. We also explain convenient gauge choices within the waveform-generation scheme, and the gauge invariance of the resulting waveform. Finally, we highlight that, thanks to recent results due to Grant and Witzany et al., all relevant spin effects at 1PA order can now be computed without evaluating local self-forces or torques.</description>

      <title>Overview of the proof of the exterior stability of the $(1+3)$-Minkowski space-time governed by the Einstein-Yang-Mills system in the Lorenz gauge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Einstein-Yang-Mills system in both the Lorenz and harmonic gauges, where the Yang-Mills fields are valued in any arbitrary Lie algebra $\cal G$, associated to any compact Lie group $G$. This gives a system of hyperbolic partial partial differential that does not satisfy the null condition and that has new complications that are not present for the Einstein vacuum equations nor for the Einstein-Maxwell system. We prove the exterior stability of the Minkowski space-time, $\mathbb{R}^{1+3}$, governed by the fully coupled Einstein-Yang-Mills system in the Lorenz gauge, valued in any arbitrary Lie algebra $\cal G$, without any assumption of spherical symmetry. We start with an arbitrary sufficiently small initial data, defined in a suitable energy norm for the perturbations of the Yang-Mills potential and of the Minkowski space-time, and we show the well-posedness of the Cauchy development in the exterior, and we prove that this leads to solutions converging in the Lorenz gauge and in wave coordinates to the zero Yang-Mills fields and to the Minkowski space-time. This provides a first detailed proof of the exterior stability of Minkowski governed by the fully non-linear Einstein-Yang-Mills equations in the Lorenz gauge, by using a null frame decomposition that was first used by H. Lindblad and I. Rodnianski for the case of the Einstein vacuum equations. We note that in contrast to the much simpler case of the Einstein-Maxwell equations where one can omit the potential, in fact in the non-abelian case of the Einstein-Yang-Mills equations, the question of stability, or non-stability, is a purely gauge dependent statement and the partial differential equations depend on the gauge on the Yang-Mills potential that is needed to write up the equations.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Gravity Compactifications on Negatively Curved Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Constructing the landscape of vacua of higher-dimensional theories of gravity by directly solving the low-energy (semi-)classical equations of motion is notoriously difficult. In this work, we investigate the feasibility of Machine Learning techniques as tools for solving the equations of motion for general warped gravity compactifications. As a proof-of-concept we use Neural Networks to solve the Einstein PDEs on non-trivial three manifolds obtained by filling one or more cusps of hyperbolic manifolds. While in three dimensions an Einstein metric is also locally hyperbolic, the generality and scalability of Machine Learning methods, the availability of explicit families of hyperbolic manifolds in higher dimensions, and the universality of the filling procedure strongly suggest that the methods and code developed in this work can be of broader applicability. Specifically, they can be used to tackle both the geometric problem of numerically constructing novel higher-dimensional negatively curved Einstein metrics, as well as the physical problem of constructing four-dimensional de Sitter compactifications of M-theory on the same manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue there is an interesting triple-scaling limit of quantum gravity, namely when Planck's constant scales to infinity while Newton's constant and the speed of light tend to zero, keeping fixed the gravitational coupling $G_N\,c^{-4}$ and the combination $\hbar\,c$. We refer to this limiting theory as ``tantum gravity'' and describe in this Letter some of its main properties and prospects for physics. Most notably, the laws of black hole thermodynamics survive this limit, which means that puzzles related to black holes and their evaporation could be addressed more easily in tantum gravity than in fully-fledged quantum gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Carroll symmetry arises from Poincar\'e symmetry when the speed of light is sent to zero. In this work, we apply the Lie algebra expansion method to find the Carroll versions of different gravity models in three space-time dimensions. Our starting point is the 2D Euclidean AdS algebra along with its flat version. Novel and already known Carrollian algebras, such as the AdS-Carroll and Carroll-Galilei ones are found, and the Chern--Simons gravity theories based on them are constructed. Remarkably, after the expansion, the vanishing cosmological constant limit applied to the 2D Euclidean AdS algebra converts into a non-relativistic limit in three space-time dimensions. We extend our results to Post-Carroll-Newtonian algebras which can be found by expanding a family of 2D Euclidean algebras.</description>

      <title>Note on the local calculation of decoherence of quantum superpositions in de Sitter spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the decoherence effect of quantum superposition in de Sitter (dS) spacetime due to the presence of the cosmological horizon. Using the algebraic approach of quantum field theory on curved spacetime, we derive the precise expression for the expected number of entangling particles in the scalar field case. This expression establishes the relation between the decoherence and the local two-point correlation function. Specifically, we analyze the quantum superposition Gendankenexperiment performed by a local observer at the center of dS spacetime. We compute the entangling particle numbers in scalar field, electromagnetic field, and gravitational field scenarios. It is demonstrated that the quantum spatial superposition state can be decohered by emitting entangling particles into the cosmological horizon. Our setup is equivalent to an accelerating observer in 5-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. The results for the scalar and electromagnetic cases are consistent with those obtained in Ref.[1], which investigated the decoherence effect from the perspective of an accelerating observer in Minkovski spacetime. However, our result fixes the numerical prefactor of the gravitational decoherence.</description>

      <title>Can tensor-scalar induced GWs dominate PTA observations ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observational constraints on small-scale primordial gravitational waves are considerably weaker than those on large scales. We focus on scenarios with significant primordial gravitational waves and curvature perturbations on small scales, studying the energy density spectrum of the second-order TSIGW. By leveraging current data from CMB, BAO, and PTA, combined with the SNR analysis of LISA, we can investigate how tensor-scalar induced gravitational waves affect observations on various scales, thus constraining the parameter space for primordial gravitational waves and curvature perturbations. The Bayes factor analysis suggests that TSIGW+PGW might be more likely to dominate current PTA observations compared to SMBHB.</description>

      <title>Gravity potential determination based on China Space Station Dual-frequency microwave links frequency transfer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The China Space Station (CSS) is currently in orbit and carries the high-precision optical atomic clock with stability of approximately $2.0 \times 10^{-15} / \sqrt{\tau}$ in its experiment module. We have developed a model to determine the gravity potential (GP) based on the gravity frequency shift equation and have created both one-way and dual-frequency transfer models up to $c^{-4}$. These models consider effects from the troposphere, ionosphere, and solid Earth tides. The proposed model is suitable for measurements at the magnitude of $10^{-19}$. Based on the CSS mission, we conducted the simulation experiments. The results indicate that when processing the simulation frequency signal using the proposed model, we can obtain the GP with the accuracies of $ (1.13\pm0.71)\,\mathrm{m^2/s^2}$, $ (0.09\pm0.89)\,\mathrm{m^2/s^2}$, and $(0.66\pm1.18)\,\mathrm{m^2/s^2}$ for cutoff elevation angles of $5^{\circ}$, $10^{\circ}$ and $15^{\circ}$, respectively. With the high-precision optical atomic clock onboard the CSS, the proposed model enables us to measure the GP differences in the magnitude of centimeter-level accuracy.</description>

      <title>Properties of the wormhole-dominant phase in two-dimensional quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the $N \times N$ Hermitian one-matrix model modified by the double-trace interaction. It is known that the coupling for the double-trace interaction can control the weight for the microscopic wormholes if interpreting the matrix model as the lattice model of random surface; tuning the coupling to its critical value, the effect of wormholes become substantial to change the critical behavior of the pure $2$D quantum gravity, which is characterized by a certain positive value of the string susceptibility.
  In the large-$N$ limit, we calculate the continuum limit of the disk amplitude in which the wormhole effects are important. The resulting continuum disk amplitude is the same as that of the pure $2$D quantum gravity. We also introduce the renormalized coupling for the double-trace interaction, and show that the newly introduced renormalized coupling can alter the renormalized bulk cosmological constant effectively.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Conformal $BMS_3$ Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An enhanced version of the conformal BMS$_{3}$ algebra is presented. It is shown to emerge from the asymptotic structure of an extension of conformal gravity in 3D by Pope and Townsend that consistently accommodates an additional spin-2 field, once it is endowed with a suitable set of boundary conditions. The canonical generators of the asymptotic symmetries then span a precise nonlinear W$_{(2,2,2,2,1,1,1)}$ algebra, whose central extensions and coefficients of the nonlinear terms are completely determined by the central charge of the Virasoro subalgebra. The wedge algebra corresponds to the conformal group in four dimensions $SO(4,2)$ and therefore, enhanced conformal BMS$_{3}$ can also be regarded as an infinite-dimensional nonlinear extension of the AdS$_{5}$ algebra with nontrivial central extensions. It is worth mentioning that our boundary conditions might be considered as a starting point in order to consistently incorporate either a finite or an infinite number of conformal higher spin fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a scalar particle without self-interaction or backreaction from the space-time background, the dynamics are governed by the Klein-Gordon equation. In this work, we write the exact solution of this equation in the background of a chargeless, static black string in terms of the biconfluent Heun function. In this curious system, we are able to explore what happens if we have negative values for the masses. The eigenvalue problem provides complex energy values for the particle, which may indicate the presence of quasinormal modes. We show a simple quantum system that can imitate the particle in the black string background, whose solutions are also applications of the biconfluent Heun function.</description>

      <title>Prospects for measuring neutrino mass with 21-cm forest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Both particle physics experiments and cosmological observations have been used to explore neutrino properties. Cosmological researches of neutrinos often rely on the early-universe cosmic microwave background observations or other late-universe probes, which mostly focus on large-scale structures. We introduce a distinct probe, the 21-cm forest, that differs from other probes in both time and scale. Actually, the 21-cm forest is a unique tool for studying small-scale structures in the early universe. Below the free-streaming scale, massive neutrinos suppress the matter power spectrum, influencing small-scale fluctuations in the distribution of matter. The one-dimensional (1D) power spectrum of the 21-cm forest can track these fluctuations across different scales, similar to the matter power spectrum, providing an effective method to probe neutrino mass. Although heating effects in the early universe can also impact the 1D power spectrum of the 21-cm forest, we assess the potential of the 21-cm forest as a tool for measuring neutrino mass, given that the temperature of the intergalactic medium can be constrained using other methods within a certain range. We also discuss the impact of cosmological parameters on our results. In the ideal scenario, the 21-cm forest observation will have the ability to constrain the total neutrino mass to around 0.1 eV. With the accumulation of observational data and advancements in observational technology, the 21-cm forest holds great promise as an emerging and potent tool for measuring neutrino mass.</description>

      <title>Forecast constraints on the axion-photon coupling from interstellar medium heating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In interstellar media characterized by a nonrelativistic plasma of electrons and heavy ions, we study the effect of axion dark matter coupled to photons on the dynamics of an electric field. In particular, we assume the presence of a background magnetic field aligned in a specific direction. We show that there is an energy transfer from the oscillating axion field to photons and then to the plasma induced by forced resonance. This resonance is most prominent for the axion mass $m_{\phi}$ equivalent to the plasma frequency $\omega_p$. Requiring that the heating rate of the interstellar medium caused by the energy transfer does not exceed the observed astrophysical cooling rate, we place forecast constraints on the axion-photon coupling $g$ for several different amplitudes of the background magnetic field $B_0$. By choosing a typical value $B_0=10^{-5}$ G, we find that, for the resonance mass $m_{\phi}=\omega_p$, the upper limit of $g$ can be stronger than those derived from other measurements in the literature. With increased values of $B_0$, it is possible to put more stringent constraints on $g$ for a wider range of the axion mass away from the resonance point.</description>

      <title>Measuring Gravitational Wave Speed and Lorentz Violation with the First Three Gravitational-Wave Catalogs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13099v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The speed of gravitational waves $v_g$ can be measured with the time delay between gravitational-wave detectors. Our study provides a more precise measurement of $v_g$ using gravitational-wave signals only, compared with previous studies. We select 52 gravitational-wave events that were detected with high confidence by at least two detectors in the first three observing runs (O1, O2, and O3) of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo. We use Markov chain Monte Carlo and nested sampling to estimate the $v_g$ posterior distribution for each of those events. We then combine their posterior distributions to find the 90% credible interval of the combined $v_g$ distribution for which we obtain $0.99^{+0.02}_{-0.02}c$ without the use of more accurate sky localization from the electromagnetic signal associated with GW170817. Restricting attention to the 50 binary black hole events generates the same result, while the use of the electromagnetic sky localization for GW170817 gives a tighter constraint of $0.99^{+0.01}_{-0.02}c$. The abundance of gravitational wave events allows us to apply hierarchical Bayesian inference on the posterior samples to simultaneously constrain all nine coefficients for Lorentz violation in the nondispersive, nonbirefringent limit of the gravitational sector of the Standard-Model Extension test framework. We compare the hierarchical Bayesian inference method with other methods of combining limits on Lorentz violation in the gravity sector that are found in the literature.</description>

      <title>Insights and guidelines on the Cauchy horizon theorems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09225v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently there has been progress to resolve the issue regarding the non-existence of the Cauchy horizon inside the static, charged, and spherically symmetric black holes. However, when we generically extend the black holes' spacetime, they are not just static but can be dynamical, thus the interior of black holes does not remain the same as the static case when we take into account the dynamical evolution of black holes. Hence, the properties of the Cauchy horizon could behave differently in the dynamical case. Then, our aim in this paper is to provide a few constructive insights and guidelines regarding this issue by revisiting a few examples of the gravitational collapse of spherically symmetric charged black holes using the double-null formalism. Our numerical results demonstrate that the inside of the outer horizon is no longer static even in late time, and the inner apparent horizon exists but is not regular. The inner apparent horizon can be distinguished clearly from the Cauchy horizon. The spherical symmetric property of black holes allows the inner horizon to be defined in two directions, i.e., the differentiation of the areal radius vanishes along either the out-going or the in-going null direction. Moreover, the Cauchy horizon can be generated from a singularity. Finally, we show some examples that the ``hair" which is associated with the matter field on the inner horizon is not important to determine the existence of the Cauchy horizon; rather, the hair on the outer horizon might play an important role on the Cauchy horizon. Therefore, the dynamic properties of the interior of charged black holes could shed light for us to understand deeply about the Cauchy horizon for the extensions of no-Cauchy-horizon theorems.</description>

      <title>Test the weak cosmic censorship conjecture via black hole in dark matter halo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04415v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The weak cosmic censorship conjecture states that the black hole singularity is hidden inside the event horizon of the black hole, making it impossible for an external observer to measure. In this study, we investigate the weak cosmic censorship conjecture test of dark matter halo-black hole systems in both the cold dark matter model and ultralight dark matter model scenarios, with the aim of gaining insights into the influence of dark matter particles on the weak cosmic censorship conjecture. By examining the particle incident on an extremely or nearly extremal dark matter - black hole, as well as the scattering of a scalar field by an extreme or near-extreme dark matter - black hole. We find that, for test particles, the weak cosmic censorship conjecture is violated under extreme conditions. Under near-extreme conditions, our calculation results show a second-order small quantity, which indicates that the weak cosmic censorship conjecture may be breached under near-extreme conditions. However, if the self-force effect is taken into consideration, whether the weak cosmic censorship conjecture will be violated still requires further in-depth research. For scalar fields, the weak cosmic censorship conjecture is violated under extreme conditions, while under near-extreme conditions, our results show that the weak cosmic censorship conjecture still holds. This research will contribute to furthering our comprehension of the intricate interplay between dark matter and black holes.</description>

Abstract: We study Hawking radiation and wave scattering of charged scalar fields in a charged $C$-metric black hole background. The conformally invariant wave equation for charged scalar fields can be separated into radial and angular parts, each with five singularities. We first show that the radial and angular equations can be respectively transformed into the general Heun equation, and then we explore exact solutions of the radial Heun equation in terms of the local Heun functions and connection coefficients. Exact behaviors of the asymptotic wave functions are determined without approximations. We further apply the exact results to derive Hawking radiation, quasinormal modes and superradiance.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we examine the gravitational deflection of particles in curved spacetime immersed in perfect fluid in the context of Rastall theory. The integral region is generally infinite; an infinite region approach to Gibbons-Werner is proposed to avoid singularity. In the Rastall theory framework, the black hole solutions in the dust field are studied. Additionally, we check the deflection angle from this spacetime under the influence of plasma. Furthermore, we analytically compute plasma's impact on a black hole shadow using a ray-tracing approach and Hamiltonian equation. Hence, the light ray motion equations are independent of the plasma's velocity. It is assumed that plasma is a dispersive medium, pressure-less and non-magnetized, and the plasma particle density corresponds to particle accumulation. The supermassive black hole's shadow and emitted energy are explored when plasma falls radially from infinity onto the black hole.</description>

Hence, we shall call the solution the Schwarzschild-Levi-Civita black hole. Effectively the solution is a one-parameter non-asymptotically flat black hole that is static, axially symmetric, and singular in its axis of symmetry.</description>

      <title>A misleading naming convention: de Sitter `tachyonic' scalar fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17539v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the concept of de Sitter (dS) 'tachyonic' scalar fields, characterized by discrete negative squared mass values, and assess their physical significance through a rigorous Wigner-inspired group-theoretical analysis. This perspective demonstrates that such fields, often misinterpreted as inherently unstable due to their mass parameter, are best understood within the framework of unitary irreducible representations (UIRs) of the dS group. The discrete mass spectrum arises naturally in this representation framework, offering profound insights into the interplay between dS relativity and quantum field theory. Contrary to their misleading nomenclature, we argue that the 'mass' parameter associated with these fields lacks intrinsic physical relevance, challenging traditional assumptions that link it to physical instability. Instead, any perceived instability originates from mismanagement of the system's inherent gauge invariance rather than the fields themselves. A proper treatment of this gauge symmetry, particularly through the Gupta-Bleuler formalism, restores the expected characteristics of these fields as free quantum entities in a highly symmetric spacetime. This study seeks to dispel misconceptions surrounding dS 'tachyonic' fields, underscoring the importance of precise terminology and robust theoretical tools in addressing their unique properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01834v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the decay of Dirac and massive scalar fields at asymptotically late times in the background of the charged asymptotically de Sitter dilatonic black holes. It is shown that the asymptotic decay is exponential and oscillatory for large and intermediate mass of the field, while for zero and small mass it is pure exponential without oscillations. This reflects the dominance of quasinormal modes of the empty de Sitter spacetime at asymptotically late times. We also show that the earlier WKB calculation of the massive scalar field spectrum does not allow one to find the fundamental mode with reasonable accuracy.</description>

      <title>Emergent Cosmological Expansion in Scalar-Tensor Theories of Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the emergence of large-scale cosmological expansion in scalar-tensor theories of gravity. This is achieved by modelling sub-horizon regions of space-time as weak-field expansions around Minkowski space, and then subsequently joining many such regions together to create a statistically homogeneous and isotropic cosmology. We find that when the scalar field can be treated perturbatively, the cosmological behaviour that emerges is well modelled by the Friedmann solutions of the theory. When non-perturbative screening mechanisms occur this result no longer holds, and in the case of scalar fields subject to the chameleon mechanism we find significant deviations from the expected Friedmann behaviour. In particular, the screened mass no longer contributes to the Klein-Gordon equation, suppressing deviations from general relativistic behaviour.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal ringing of thick braneworlds with a finite extra dimension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the quasinormal modes of the Poincar\'e thick brane with a finite extra dimension. Unlike the case with an infinite extra dimension, the gravitational effective potential exhibits three distinct shapes within different ranges of the parameter $n$ in the warp factor: harmonic oscillator potential, P\"oschl-Teller potential, and volcano-like potential. We then study various types of perturbations in this system. Utilizing a combination of analytical, semi-analytical, and numerical methods, we obtain the quasinormal modes of the perturbed fields. Our findings reveal a set of discrete quasinormal modes for the thick brane, similar to those of black holes. Interestingly, when $n=1$, the quasinormal modes exhibit purely imaginary behavior. This study may provide a new way to detect the existence of extra dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07943v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The supertranslation ambiguity of angular momentum is a long-standing problem in general relativity, which arises the puzzle of the angular momentum loss in the post-Minkowskian (PM) expansion. The angular momentum loss in gravitational scattering is of order $G^2$ in the linear response theory but of order $G^3$ in the amplitudes-based methods. In this paper, we propose a generic prescription to fix the supertranslation ambiguity in the PM expansion which will uniquely determine the angular momentum loss. The proposal is self-contained and involves only the null infinity data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a study of the vacuum transition probabilities taking into account quantum corrections. We first introduce a general method that expands previous works employing the Lorentzian formalism of the Wheeler-De Witt equation by considering higher order terms in the semiclassical expansion. The method presented is applicable in principle to any model in the minisuperspace and up to any desired order in the quantum correction terms. Then, we apply this method to obtain analytical solutions for the probabilities up to second quantum corrections for homogeneous isotropic and anisotropic universes. We use the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker metric with positive and zero curvature for the isotropic case and the Bianchi III and Kantowski-Sachs metrics for the anisotropic case. Interpreting the results as distribution probabilities of creating universes by vacuum decay with a given size, we found that the general behaviour is that considering up to the second quantum correction leads to an avoidance of the initial singularity. However, we show that this result can only be achieved for the isotropic universe. Furthermore, we also study the effect of anisotropy on the transition probabilities.</description>

Abstract: A novel thermodynamic phenomenon has been observed in the quantum Ba\~{n}ados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (qBTZ) black hole, utilizing generalized free energy and Kramer escape rate. This phenomenon also reveals the unique property of the quantum black hole. The stochastic thermal motion of various thermodynamic states within the black hole system induces phase transitions, under the influence of generalized free energy which obtained by extending Maxwell's construction. Through the analysis of Kramer escape rate, it is discovered that the qBTZ black hole thermodynamic system exhibits a bounce effect. It originates from the non-monotonicity of entropy in black hole thermodynamic systems. Furthermore, the overall thermodynamic picture of the qBTZ black hole has been obtained under different quantum backreactions.</description>

Abstract: Using Darmois-Israel-Sen junction conditions, and with help of Visser's cut-and-paste method, we study the dynamics of thin-shell wormholes that are made of two conformally Killing gravity (a.k.a Harada gravity) black holes. We check the energy conditions for different values of the new parameter that Harada introduced, as alternative for dark energy. We examine the radial acceleration to reveal the attractive and repulsive characteristics of the thin-shell wormhole throat. We consider the dynamics and stability of the wormhole around the static solutions of the linearized radial perturbations at the wormhole throat. Finally, we determine the regions of stability by applying the concavity test on the ``speed of sound'' as a function in the throat radius and other spacetime parameters, particularly the new Harada parameter.</description>

      <title>Astrophysical insights into magnetic Penrose process around parameterized Konoplya-Rezzolla-Zhidenko black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19800v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the parameterized Konoplya-Rezzolla-Zhidenko (KRZ) black hole (BH) spacetime in the presence of an external asymptotically uniform magnetic field. We first examine the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) radii for both neutral and charged test particles, demonstrating that the deformation parameters, $\delta_1$ and $\delta_2$, reduce the ISCO values. Subsequently, we assess the energy efficiency of the magnetic Penrose process (MPP) for an axially symmetric parameterized BH, analyzing the effects of the deformation parameters and the magnetic field on the energy extraction process. Our findings indicate that the rotational deformation parameter $\delta_2$ is crucial for the efficiency of energy extraction from the BH. The synergy between the rotational deformation parameter and the magnetic field significantly boosts the energy extraction efficiency, with values exceeding $100\%$. Interestingly, for extremal BHs with negative $\delta_2$ values, the energy efficiency increases, in contrast to Kerr BHs where the MPP effect diminishes. Additionally, we explore the astrophysical implications of the MPP by deriving the maximum energy of a proton escaping from the KRZ parameterized BH due to the beta decay of a free neutron near the horizon. Our results show that negative $\delta_2$ values require stronger magnetic fields to achieve equivalent energy levels for high-energy protons, providing deeper insights into high-energy astrophysical phenomena around the parameterized BH.</description>

      <title>All non-expanding gravitational waves in $D$-dimensional (anti-)de Sitter space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a complete, theory-independent classification of $D$-dimensional Kundt spacetimes of Weyl and traceless-Ricci type N. We show that these geometries consist of three invariantly defined subfamilies, namely (generalized) Kundt, pp- and Siklos waves, for each of which we obtain a convenient canonical form. As a byproduct, this also demonstrates that such metrics coincide with the class of non-expanding (A)dS-Kerr-Schild spacetimes. The role of these spacetimes in Einstein's gravity (including minimally coupled $p$-forms and non-linear electrodynamics) as non-expanding gravitational waves in an (anti)-de Sitter background is discussed. Furthermore, applications to extended theories such as Gauss-Bonnet, Lovelock, quadratic and $f(R)$ gravity are also briefly illustrated, as well as the overlap of the obtained metrics with universal and almost-universal spacetimes. In the appendices we additionally settle the issue of the redundancy of certain field equations for all Kundt spacetimes in a theory-independent way, and present various alternative coordinates for the spacetimes studied in the paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10602v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the equations of motion for relativistic elastic membranes, that is, two-dimensional elastic bodies whose internal energy depends only on their stretching, starting from a variational principle. We show how to obtain conserved quantities for the membrane's motion in the presence of spacetime symmetries, determine the membrane's longitudinal and transverse speeds of sound in isotropic states, and compute the coefficients of linear elasticity with respect to the relaxed configuration. We then use this formalism to discuss two physically interesting systems: a rigidly rotating elastic disk, widely discussed in the context of Ehrenfest's paradox, and a Dyson sphere, that is, a spherical membrane in equilibrium in Schwarzschild's spacetime, with the isotropic tangential pressure balancing the gravitational attraction. Surprisingly, although spherically symmetric perturbations of this system are linearly stable, the axi-symmetric dipolar mode is already unstable. This may be taken as a cautionary tale against misconstruing radial stability as true stability.</description>

      <title>Effective ray equations for vortex light and their application in an optical waveguide</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13243v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Beyond its spin, light can also carry intrinsic orbital angular momentum (IOAM), termed as vortex light. In this study, we derive effective ray equations for vortex light by applying the WKB approximation to the covariant Maxwell equations. According to these equations, the propagation of vortex light can be significantly affected by its IOAM, as suggested by numerous studies. To examine the effects of IOAM, we solve the effective ray equations for vortex light and investigate its ray trajectory within a specific optical waveguide. Our findings indicate that the ray trajectory of vortex light exhibits a divergence perpendicular to the normal propagation plane, akin to the spin Hall effect in light. This divergence, termed as the orbital Hall effect, stems from the IOAM of the light. In this study, the effective ray equations are derived by modeling the interaction between light and media as light's free fall in a curved spacetime. Therefore, observing the orbital Hall effect could not only enhance our understanding of light's spin and IOAM, but also offer novel insights into the coupling between light and gravitational fields.</description>

Abstract: We consider two inhomogeneous cosmological models, namely, the flat McVittie spacetime and a simple specific LTB spacetime. Relative to the world line of a reference comoving observer that remains spatially at rest, we study the local deviations of the world lines of free test particles. These local peculiar motions can be invariantly characterized within the framework of a quasi-inertial Fermi normal coordinate system established along the world line of the reference comoving observer. Tidal dynamics in the McVittie model involves the sum of the curvature due to the inhomogeneity, the curvature due to the background FLRW spacetime and a mixed term, while tidal dynamics in the particular LTB model turns out to be qualitatively the same as in the Einstein-de Sitter universe. Peculiar motions in the two cosmological models are briefly compared and contrasted.</description>

      <title>A way of decoupling the gravitational bulk field equations of regular braneworld black holes to suppress the bulk singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a methodology for decoupling the bulk gravitational field equations of braneworld black holes to suppress the bulk singularities. Thus, we provide a regular braneworld black hole setup. To achieve this, we apply a Minimal Geometric Deformation (MGD) with respect to a coupling constant $ \alpha $ to the $4D$ Minkowski spacetime embedded in an extra dimension. This results in a gravitational decoupling into a system $ \mathcal{A} $ with equations of motion of order $ \alpha^0 $ and a system $ \mathcal{B} $, related to the so-called Quasi-Einstein equations of order $ \alpha $. This methodology allows for the construction of a regular geometry everywhere. We outline the necessary constraints for eliminating singularities and provide a recipe for solving the equations of motion. Both the warp factor, the scalar field, and the potential obtained are smooth and free from Dirac delta singularities. A control parameter is introduced such that, in the limit $ b \to 0 $, the Randall-Sundrum (RS) setup is recovered, resulting in a transition from a thick brane to a thin brane. The asymptotic behavior of the curvature invariant $ \displaystyle \lim_{y \to \pm \infty} R_{5D}(r,y) $ is positive near the de Sitter core (for small $ r $), asymptotically negative for finite $ r &gt; r_* $, and asymptotically flat at the $4D$ boundary as $ r \to \infty $. Although this work aims to suppress bulk singularities, it is expected that our methodology may be useful for future investigations related to the embedding of gravitational objects within other braneworld contexts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16891v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A mechanism is found that explains how matter falling into the future event horizon of a black hole leaves information there, which it sends to the past event horizon, and there it determines how particles are emitted. This way information must be conserved. The mechanism is a calculable gravitational effect. We also show how it is avoided that the "hidden region" of the black hole gets involved, which has been standing out as a problem ever since Hawking found that particles must be emitted. The most striking consequence of our mechanism is that the radiation temperature is not what Hawking calculated, but twice that value. This is a direct consequence of the fact that the hidden region is not there.</description>

Abstract: This study investigates the nonclassical properties of the inflaton field within the framework of semiclassical gravity by analyzing Cosmological Mandels $Q$ parameter for Squeezed Number States (SNS) and Coherent Squeezed Number States (CSNS). Mandels $Q$ parameter serves as a critical tool for identifying nonclassical states by differentiating between sub-Poissonian and super-Poissonian statistics. The values of Cosmological Mandels $Q$ are positive shows the super-Poissonian non-classical nature of inflaton for Squeezed Number States (SNS) and Coherent Squeezed Number States (CSNS). These results provide deeper insights into the statistical properties of quantum states in early-universe cosmology and emphasize the relevance of SNS and CSNS in understanding quantum effects on cosmic inflation and particle production.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we investigate some widely-known holography properties of accelerating and rotating black hole, described by rotating C-metric, especially the case in Nariai limit, which are related to Kerr-CFT correspondence but differs in that the outer horizon will coincide the acceleration horizon and the extremal geometry is described by $dS_{2}$ rather than $AdS_{2}$. In order to achieve this goal we define a regularized Komar mass with physical interpretation of varying the horizon area from massless limit to general case. We also reduce the action to a 2-dimensional JT-type action and discuss some of its properties.</description>

      <title>Solving information loss paradox via Euclidean path integral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.01005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.01005v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The information loss paradox associated with black hole Hawking evaporation is an unresolved problem in modern theoretical physics. In this paper, we revisit the entanglement entropy via the Euclidean path integral (EPI) of the quantum state and allow for the branching of semi-classical histories along the Lorentzian evolution. We posit that there exist at least two histories that contribute to EPI, where one is an information-losing history while the other is information-preserving. At early times, the former dominates EPI, while at late times the latter becomes dominant. By so doing we recover the essence of the Page curve and thus the unitarity, albeit with the turning point, i.e., the Page time, much shifted toward the late time. One implication of this modified Page curve is that the entropy bound may thus be violated. We comment on the similarity and difference between our approach and that of the replica wormholes and the island conjecture.</description>

      <title>Fast Neutrino Flavor Conversions can Help and Hinder Neutrino-Driven Explosions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.11207v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first simulations of core-collapse supernovae in axial symmetry with feedback from fast neutrino flavor conversion (FFC). Our schematic treatment of FFCs assumes instantaneous flavor equilibration under the constraint of lepton-number conservation individually for each flavor. Systematically varying the spatial domain where FFCs are assumed to occur, we find that they facilitate SN explosions in low-mass (9-12 solar masses) progenitors that otherwise explode with longer time delays, whereas FFCs weaken the tendency to explode of higher-mass (around 20 solar masses) progenitors.</description>

      <title>Effect of torsion in long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we investigate the effect of curved spacetime on neutrino oscillation. In a curved spacetime, the effect of curvature on fermionic fields is represented by spin connection. The spin connection consists of a non-universal ``contorsion" part which is expressed in terms of vector and axial current density of fermions. The contraction of contorsion part with the tetrad fields, which connects the internal flat space metric and the spacetime metric, is called torsion. In a scenario where neutrino travels through background of fermionic matter at ordinary densities in a curved spacetime, the Hamiltonian of neutrino oscillation gets modified by the torsional coupling constants $\lambda_{21}^{\prime}$ and $\lambda_{31}^{\prime}$. The aim of this work is to study the effect of $\lambda_{21}^{\prime}$ and $\lambda_{31}^{\prime}$ in DUNE and P2SO. In our study we, (i) discuss the effect of torsional coupling constants on the neutrino oscillation probabilities, (ii) estimate the capability of P2SO and DUNE to put bounds on these parameters and (iii) study how the physics sensitivities get modified in presence of torsion.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative Lightcones from Quantum SO(2,1) Conformal Groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Five new families of noncommutative lightcones in 2+1 dimensions are presented as the quantizations of the inequivalent Poisson homogeneous structures that emerge when the lightcone is constructed as a homogeneous space of the SO(2,1) conformal group. Each of these noncommutative lightcones maintains covariance under the action of the respective quantum deformation of the SO(2,1) conformal group. We discuss the role played by SO(2,1) automorphisms in the classification of inequivalent Poisson homogeneous lightcones, as well as the geometric aspects of this construction. The localization properties of the novel quantum lightcones are analyzed and shown to be deeply connected with the geometric features of the Poisson homogeneous spaces.</description>

      <title>Conformal quantum mechanics of causal diamonds: Time evolution, thermality, and instability via path integral functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An observer with a finite lifetime $\mathcal{T}$ perceives the Minkowski vacuum as a thermal state at temperature $T_D = 2 \hbar/(\pi \mathcal{T})$, as a result of being constrained to a double-coned-shaped region known as a causal diamond. In this paper, we explore the emergence of thermality in causal diamonds due to the role played by the symmetries of conformal quantum mechanics (CQM) as a (0+1)-dimensional conformal field theory, within the de Alfaro-Fubini-Furlan model and generalizations. In this context, the hyperbolic operator $S$ of the SO(2,1) symmetry of CQM: (i) is the generator of the time evolution of a diamond observer; (ii) its dynamical behavior leads to the predicted thermal nature; and (iii) its associated quantum instability has a Lyapunov exponent $\lambda_L = \pi T_D/\hbar$, which is half the upper saturation bound of the information scrambling rate. Our approach is based on a comprehensive framework of path-integral representations of the CQM generators in canonical and microcanonical forms, supplemented by semiclassical arguments. The properties of the operator $S$ are studied with emphasis on an operator duality with the corresponding elliptic operator $R$, using a representation in terms of an effective scale-invariant inverse square potential combined with inverted and ordinary harmonic oscillator potentials.</description>

      <title>Conformal quantum mechanics of causal diamonds: Quantum instability and semiclassical approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Causal diamonds are known to have thermal behavior that can be probed by finite-lifetime observers equipped with energy-scaled detectors. This thermality can be attributed to the time evolution of observers within the causal diamond, governed by one of the conformal quantum mechanics (CQM) symmetry generators: the noncompact hyperbolic operator $S$. In this paper, we show that the unbounded nature of $S$ endows it with a quantum instability, which is a generalization of a similar property exhibited by the inverted harmonic oscillator potential. Our analysis is semiclassical, including a detailed phase-space study of the classical dynamics of $S$ and its dual operator $R$, and a general semiclassical framework yielding basic instability and thermality properties that play a crucial role in the quantum behavior of the theory. For an observer with a finite lifetime $\mathcal{T}$, the detected temperature
  $T_D = 2 \hbar/(\pi \mathcal{T})$ is associated with a Lyapunov exponent $\lambda_L = \pi T_D/\hbar$, which is half the upper saturation bound of the information scrambling rate.</description>

      <title>Simulating the Galactic population of axion clouds around stellar-origin black holes: Gravitational wave signals in the 10-100 kHz band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03714v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultralight scalar fields can experience runaway `superradiant' amplification near spinning black holes, resulting in a macroscopic `axion cloud' which slowly dissipates via continuous monochromatic gravitational waves. For a particular range of boson masses, $\mathcal{O}(10^{-11}$ -- $10^{-10})$ eV, an axion cloud will radiate in the $10$ -- $100$ kHz band of the Levitated Sensor Detector (LSD). Using fiducial models of the mass, spin, and age distributions of stellar-origin black holes, we simulate the present-day Milky Way population of these hypothetical objects. As a first step towards assessing the LSD's sensitivity to the resultant ensemble of GW signals, we compute the corresponding signal-to-noise ratios which build up over a nominal integration time of $10^{7}$ s, assuming the projected sensitivity of the $1$-m LSD prototype currently under construction, as well as for future $10$-m and $100$-m concepts. For a $100$-m cryogenic instrument, hundreds of resolvable signals could be expected if the boson mass $\mu$ is around $3\times10^{-11}$ eV, and this number diminishes with increasing $\mu$ up to $\approx 5.5\times10^{-11}$ eV. The much larger population of unresolved sources will produce a confusion foreground which could be detectable by a $10$-m instrument if $\mu \in (3-4.5)\times10^{-11}$ eV, or by a $100$-m instrument if $\mu \in (3-6)\times10^{-11}$ eV.</description>

      <title>Higher-dimensional Willmore energy as holographic entanglement entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19485v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The vacuum entanglement entropy of a general conformal field theory (CFT) in $d=5$ spacetime dimensions contains a universal term, $F(A)$, which has a complicated and non-local dependence on the geometric details of the region $A$ and the theory. Analogously to the previously known $d=3$ case, we prove that for CFTs in $d=5$ which are holographically dual to Einstein gravity, $F(A)$ is equal to a four-dimensional version of the ``Willmore energy'' associated to a doubled and closed version of the Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) surface of $A$ embedded in $\mathbb{R}^5$. This generalized Willmore energy is shown to arise from a conformal-invariant codimension-two functional obtained by evaluating six-dimensional Conformal Gravity on the conically-singular orbifold of the replica trick. The new functional involves an integral over the doubled RT surface of a linear combination of three quartic terms in extrinsic curvatures and is free from ultraviolet divergences by construction. We verify explicitly the validity of our new formula for various entangling regions and argue that, as opposed to the $d=3$ case, $F(A)$ is not globally minimized by a round ball $A=\mathbb{B}^4$. Rather, $F(A)$ can take arbitrarily positive and negative values as a function of $A$. Hence, we conclude that the round ball is not a global minimizer of $F(A)$ for general five-dimensional CFTs.</description>

      <title>WGC as WCCC protector: The Synergistic Effects of various Parameters in Identifying WGC candidate Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00079v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The integration of non-commutative geometry and Gauss-Bonnet corrections in an action and the study of their black hole responses can provide highly intriguing insights. Our primary motivation for this study is to understand the interplay of these two parameters on the geodesics of spacetime, including photon spheres and time-like orbits. In this study, we found that this integration, in its initial form, can limit the value of the Gauss-Bonnet parameter ($\alpha$), creating a critical threshold beyond which changes in the non-commutative parameter ($\Xi$) become ineffective, and the structure can only manifest as a naked singularity. Furthermore, we found that using a more complex model, which includes additional factors such as a cloud of strings and linear charge, as a sample for studying spacetime geodesics, yield different and varied results. In this scenario, negative $\alpha$ values can also play a role, notably preserving the black hole form even with a super-extremal charge ($q &gt; m$). For $\alpha&gt; 0.1$, the black hole mass parameter becomes significantly influential, with a critical mass below which the impact of other parameter changes is nullified. Interestingly, considering a more massive black hole, this high-mass state also maintains its black hole form within the super-extremal charge range. The existence of these two models led us to our main goal. By examining the temperature for these two cases, we find that both situations are suitable for studying the WGC. Finally, based on the behavior of these two models, we will explain how the WGC acts as a logical solution and a protector for the WCCC.</description>

      <title>DeWitt wave functions for de Sitter JT gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity in two-dimensional de Sitter space is an intriguing model for cosmological "wave functions of the universe". Its minisuperspace version already contains all physical information. The size of compact slices is parametrized by a scale factor $h &gt; 0$. The dilaton $\phi$ is chosen to have positive values, $\phi &gt; 0$, and interpreted as size of an additional compact slice in a higher-dimensional theory. At the boundaries $h=0$, $\phi=0$, where the volume of the universe vanishes, the curvature is generically singular. According to a conjecture by DeWitt, solutions of the Wheeler-DeWitt (WDW) equation should vanish at singular loci. Recently, the behaviour of JT wave functions at large field values $h$, $\phi$ has been obtained by means of a path integral over Schwarzian degrees of freedom of a boundary curve. We systematically analyze solutions of the WDW equation with Schwarzian asymptotic behaviour. We find real analytic solutions that vanish on the entire boundary, in agreement with DeWitt's conjecture. Projection to expanding and contracting branches may lead to singularities, which can however be avoided by an appropriate superposition of solutions. Our analysis also illustrates the limitations of semiclassical wave functions.</description>

      <title>The Fuzzball Paradigm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09495v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe the puzzles that arise in the quantum theory of black holes, and explain how they are resolved in string theory. We review how the Bekenstein entropy is obtained through the count of brane bound states. We describe the fuzzball construction of black hole microstates. These states have no horizon and radiate from their surface like a normal body, so there is no information puzzle. We explain how the semiclassical approximation is violated in gravitational collapse even though curvatures are low at the classical horizon. This violation happens because the collapse leads to a stretching of space that is {\it fast}: light does not have time to travel across the collapsing region to establish the `vecro' correlations needed in the quantum gravitational vacuum. These vecro correlations arise from the existence of virtual fuzzball fluctuations in the gravitational vacuum, and are significant because of the large degeneracy of fuzzball states implied by the Bekenstein entropy. It is plausible that similar effects of fast expansion may be responsible for effects like dark energy and the Early Dark Energy postulated to explain the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Gauge symmetry and partially Lagrangian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19447v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the classical field theory whose equations of motion follow from the least action principle, but the class of admissible trajectories is restricted by differential equations. The key element of the proposed construction is the complete gauge symmetry of these additional equations. The unfree variation of the trajectories reduces to the infinitesimal gauge symmetry transformation of the equations restricting the trajectories. We explicitly derive the equations that follow from the requirement that this gauge variation of the action vanishes. The system of equations for conditional extrema is not Lagrangian as such, but it admits an equivalent Hamiltonian formulation with a non-canonical Poisson bracket. The bracket is degenerate, in general. Alternatively, the equations restricting dynamics could be added to the action with Lagrange multipliers with unrestricted variation of the original variables. In this case, we would arrive at the Lagrangian equations for original variables involving Lagrange multipliers and for Lagrange multipliers themselves. In general, these two methods are not equivalent because the multipliers can bring extra degrees of freedom compared to the case of equations derived by unfree variation of the action. We illustrate the general method with two examples. The first example is the particle in a central field with varying trajectories restricted by the equation of conservation of angular momentum. The phase space gets one more dimension, and there is an extra conserved quantity $K$ which is responsible for the precession of trajectories. $K=0$ corresponds to the trajectories of usual Lagrangian dynamics. The second example is the linearized gravity with Einstein-Hilbert action and the class of varying fields is restricted by linearized Nordstr\"om equation. This conditional extrema problem is shown to lead to the linearized Cotton gravity equations.</description>
