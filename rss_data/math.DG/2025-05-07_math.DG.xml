      <title>Ergodic and Entropic Behavior of the Harmonic Map Heat Flow to the Moduli Space of Flat Tori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the harmonic map heat flow from a compact Riemannian manifold \( M \) into the moduli space \( \mathcal{M}_1 \) of unit-area flat tori, which carries a natural hyperbolic structure as the quotient \( \mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z}) \backslash \mathbb{H} \). We prove that the flow is stable with respect to the energy functional and exhibits ergodic behavior in the sense that the evolving maps asymptotically distribute their image uniformly across the moduli space. As a concrete contribution, we show that the sequence of pushforward measures under the flow converges weak--$^{*}$ to the normalized hyperbolic measure on \( \mathcal{M}_1 \). Moreover, we introduce a relative entropy framework to measure the statistical deviation of the flow from equilibrium and prove that the relative entropy with respect to the hyperbolic measure decays to zero in the long-time limit. This provides a quantitative refinement of the ergodic result and establishes a connection between geometric flows, moduli space dynamics, and information-theoretic convergence.</description>

      <title>Correction to: Curvature growth of some 4-dimensional gradient Ricci soliton singularity models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note corrects an error in the proof of Proposition 13 in arXiv:1903.09181 and simultaneously establishes a more general result. We prove that if $M$ is a compact 4-manifold with boundary $\partial M$ a rational homology 3-sphere, and if an unbounded number of disjoint copies of $M$ embed in a compact 4-manifold $N$, then $H_1(\partial M;\mathbb{Z})$ is a direct double. This partially generalizes a theorem of Hantzsche in the case of rational homology 3-spheres.</description>

      <title>Dolbeault-Morse-Novikov Cohomology on Complex manifolds and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the topological properties of complex manifolds by studying Dolbeault-Morse-Novikov cohomology. By establishing an integral inequality, we obtain two main results: (1) When a closed complex manifold admits a nonzero parallel $(0,1)$-form, the Dolbeault-Morse-Novikov cohomology must be trivial, which implies that the Hirzebruch $\chi_{y}$-genus vanishes. (2) When a closed complex manifold admits a nowhere vanishing $(0,1)$-form, we establish a vanishing theorem for a certain class of twisted Dirac operators, which also forces the Hirzebruch $\chi_{y}$-genus to be zero. In particular, we prove that the Hirzebruch $\chi_{y}$-genus of a closed complex manifold vanishes if and only if the manifold admits a nowhere vanishing real vector field. These results generalize some classical theorems from Riemannian manifolds to the complex setting. As a culminating application, we prove that the Hirzebruch $\chi_{y}$-genus must vanish on closed Gauduchon manifolds admitting positive holomorphic scalar curvature.</description>

      <title>Bertrand framed surfaces in the Euclidean 3-space and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A framed surface is a smooth surface in the Euclidean space with a moving frame. By using the moving frame, we can define Bertrand framed surfaces as the same idea as Bertrand framed curves. Then we find the caustics and involutes as Bertrand framed surfaces. As applications, we can directly define the caustics and involutes of framed surfaces, and give conditions that the caustics and involutes are inverse operations of framed surfaces like as those of Legendre curves. Moreover, a framed surface is one of the Bertrand framed surfaces if and only if another caustic of the involute exists, under conditions. Furthermore, we find a new such operation, the so-called tangential direction framed surfaces.</description>

      <title>Toward Riemannian diffeology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a framework for Riemannian diffeology. To this end, we use the tangent functor in the sense of Blohmann and one of the options of a metric on a diffeological space in the sense of Iglesias-Zemmour. With a technical condition for a definite Riemannian metric, we show that the psudodistance induced by the metric is indeed a distance. As examples of Riemannian diffeological spaces, an adjunction space of manifolds, a space of smooth maps and the mixed one are considered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a complex-projective variety with klt singularities and ample canonical divisor. We prove that $X$ is a quotient of the polydisc by a group acting properly discontinuously and freely in codimension one if and only if $X$ admits a semispecial tensor with reduced hypersurface. This extends a result of Catanese and Di Scala to singular spaces, and answers a question raised by these authors. As a key step in the proof, we establish the Bochner principle for holomorphic tensors on klt spaces in the negative K\"{a}hler--Einstein case.</description>

      <title>De Rham Theory in Derived Differential Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the question: What is the de Rham theory for general differentiable spaces? We identify two potential answers and study them. In the first part, we show that the de Rham cohomology calculated using (the completion of) the exterior algebra of the cotangent complex yields non-trivial local invariants for singular differentiable spaces. In particular, in some cases, it differs from the constant sheaf cohomology, which provides an obstruction for the de Rham comparison map to be an equivalence. Moreover, we provide conditions under which this local invariant trivializes, yielding a de Rham-type isomorphism. In the second part, we show that for a suitably defined de Rham stack, there is always an isomorphism between functions on it and constant sheaf cohomology of the underlying topological space. Consequently, there exists a version of the de Rham theorem for singular differentiable spaces which holds with almost no restrictions. Finally, we sketch a generalization of this result to other theories of smooth functions, such as holomorphic or analytic functions. The last part is thus related to analytic de Rham stacks of Rodriguez Camargo used by Scholze to geometrize the local Langlands correspondence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $(\lambda^+(M),\lambda^-(M))$ denote the pair of measured foliations at the boundary at infinity $\partial_\infty$ of a quasi-Fuchsian manifold $M$. We prove that $(\lambda^+(M),\lambda^-(M))$ is filling if $M$ is close to being Fuchsian. We also show that given any filling pair $(\alpha_1,\alpha_2)$ of measured foliations, and every small enough $t&gt;0$, the pair $(t\alpha_1,t\alpha_2)$ is realised as the pair of measured foliations at infinity of some quasi-Fuchsian manifold $M$. This answers questions of Schlenker near the Fuchsian locus.</description>

Abstract: Halin graphs constitute an interesting class of planar and polyhedral graphs. A generalized Halin graph is obtained by connecting all leaves of a planar embedding of a tree via a cycle. A Halin graph is a generalized Halin graph having no vertex of degree two. We classify all generalized Halin graphs with positive Lin-Lu-Yau curvature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.08338v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that if a compact K\"ahler manifold admits a weighted extremal metric for the action of a torus, so too does its blowup at a relatively stable point that is fixed by both the torus action and the extremal field. This generalises previous results on extremal metrics by Arezzo--Pacard--Singer and Sz\'ekelyhidi to many other canonical metrics, including extremal Sasaki metrics, deformations of K\"ahler--Ricci solitons and $\mu$-cscK metrics. In a sequel to this paper, we use this result to study the weighted K-stability of weighted extremal manifolds.</description>

Abstract: We find the information geometry of tempered stable processes. Beginning with the derivation of $\alpha$-divergence between two tempered stable processes, we obtain the corresponding Fisher information matrices and the $\alpha$-connections on their statistical manifolds. Furthermore, we explore statistical applications of this geometric framework. Various tempered stable processes such as generalized tempered stable processes, classical tempered stable processes, and rapidly-decreasing tempered stable processes are presented as illustrative examples.</description>

      <title>The Geometry of Time in Topological Quantum Gravity of the Ricci Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.06230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.06230v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We continue the study of topological nonrelativistic quantum gravity associated with a family of Ricci flow equations on Riemannian manifolds. This topological gravity is of the cohomological type, and it exhibits an ${\cal N}=2$ extended BRST symmetry. In our previous work, we constructed this theory in a two-step procedure in the appropriate nonrelativistic ${\cal N}=2$ superspace, first presenting a topological theory of the spatial metric $g_{ij}$, and then adding the superspace versions of the lapse and shift variables $n$ and $n^i$ while gauging the symmetries of foliation-preserving spacetime diffeomorphisms. In the relation to Perelman's theory of the Ricci flow, the role of Perelman's dilaton is played by our nonprojectable lapse. Here we demonstrate that this construction is equivalent to a standard one-step BRST gauge-fixing of a theory whose fields are $g_{ij}$, $n^i$ and $n$, and whose gauge symmetries consist of (i) the topological deformations of $g_{ij}$, and (ii) the ultralocal nonrelativistic limit of spacetime diffeomorphisms. The supercharge $Q$ of our superspace construction plays the role of the BRST charge. The spacetime diffeomorphism symmetries appear in an interestingly "shifted" form, which may be of broader interest for nonrelativistic quantum gravity outside of the present topological context. In contrast to the foliation-preserving spacetime diffeomorphisms, the gauge symmetries identified in this paper act nonprojectably on time, making it clear that this theory has no local propagating degrees of freedom. We point out an intriguing dual interpretation of the same theory, as a gauge fixing of a dual copy of ultralocal spacetime diffeomorphisms, with the role of ghosts and antighosts interchanged and the second supercharge $\bar Q$ of the ${\cal N}=2$ superalgebra playing the role of the BRST charge in the dual picture.</description>

Abstract: This is the first of a series of papers on the $L^2$-theory for formally integrable structures. It is devoted to constructing a resolution of the solution sheaf for a class of overdetermined systems introduced by L. H{\"o}rmander. A sufficient condition for global exactness is obtained, which leads to gluing techniques for local solutions formulated as Cousin type problems. In addition, we also prove the local solvability of the Treves complex for formally integrable structures with vanishing Levi forms, including Levi flat structures as special cases. To the best of the authors' knowledge, nothing more than the elliptic case is known about the local $L^2$-solvability of the Treves complex in the Levi flat case.</description>

      <title>On the sharpness of Wasserstein contraction along heat flows, and a rigidity of Euclidean spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02280v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that if a smooth metric measure space with non-negative weighted Ricci curvature admits two distinct points such that the $2$-Wasserstein distance is preserved along the associated heat flows i.e.
  \begin{equation}
  W_2(p_t(x,\cdot),p_t(y,\cdot))=d(x,y)
  \end{equation} for some $x,y$ and $t&gt;0$, then the space splits off a line. In particular, Euclidean spaces are the only spaces where the above sharpness condition holds for all pairs of points.
  Moreover, we show for positive $K$ that, the equality for the analogous $K$-contraction estimate for Wasserstein distances cannot be attained among smooth metric measure spaces with Ricci curvature bounded below by $K$.</description>

      <title>HKKN-stratifications in a non-compact framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03259v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is twofold. First, we study HKKN stratifications, both algebraically and analytically, for a Cartesian product between a vector space and a compact K{\"a}hler manifold. We then use these stratifications to prove convexity properties of the moment map for non-compact analytic subsets invariant under a Borel subgroup.</description>
