      <title>On the Significance of Rare Objects at High Redshift: The Impact of Cosmic Variance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of extremely luminous galaxies at ultra-high redshifts ($z\gtrsim 8$) has posed a challenge for galaxy formation models. Most statistical analyses of this tension to date have not properly accounted for the variance due to field-to-field clustering, which causes the number counts of galaxies to vary from field to field, greatly in excess of Poisson noise. This super-Poissonian variance is often referred to as cosmic variance. Since cosmic variance increases rapidly as a function of mass, redshift, and for small observing areas, the most massive objects in deep \textit{JWST} surveys are severely impacted by cosmic variance. In this paper, we introduce a simple model to predict the distribution of the mass of the most massive galaxy found for different survey designs, which includes cosmic variance. The distributions differ significantly from previous predictions using the Extreme Value Statistics formalism, changing both the position and shape of the distribution of most massive galaxies in a counter-intuitive way. We test our model using the \texttt{UniverseMachine} simulations, where the predicted effects of including cosmic variance are clearly identifiable. Moreover, we find that the highly significant skew in the distributions of galaxy number counts for typical deep \textit{JWST} surveys lead to a high "variance on the variance", which greatly impacts the calculation of the cosmic variance itself. We conclude that it is crucial to accurately account for the impact of cosmic variance in any future analysis of tension between extreme galaxies in the early universe and galaxy formation models.</description>

      <title>The Multi-layer Nature of Molecular Gas toward the Cygnus Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the physical properties and 3D distribution of molecular clouds (MCs) toward the Cygnus region using the MWISP CO survey and Gaia DR3 data. Based on Gaussian decomposition and clustering for $\rm ^{13}CO$ lines, over 70% of the fluxes are recovered. With the identification result of $\rm ^{13}CO$ structures, two models are designed to measure the distances of the molecular gas in velocity crowding regions. The distances of more than 200 large $\rm ^{13}CO$ structures are obtained toward the 150 square degree region. Additionally, tens of the identified MC structures coincide well with masers and/or intense mid-IR emission. We find multiple gas layers toward the region: (1) the extensive gas structures composing the Cygnus Rift from 700 pc to 1 kpc across the whole region; (2) the $\sim$ 1.3 kpc gas layer mainly in the Cygnus X South region; and (3) the 1.5 kpc dense filament at the Cygnus X North region and many cometary clouds shaped by Cygnus OB2. We also note that the spatial distribution of YSO candidates is generally consistent with the molecular gas structures. The total molecular mass of the Cygnus region is estimated to be $\sim 2.7\times10^{6}~M_{\odot}$ assuming an X-factor ratio $X_{\rm CO} = 2 \times 10^{20} \rm cm^{-2} (K\cdot km\cdot s^{-1})^{-1}$. The foreground Cygnus Rift contributes $\sim$25% of the molecular mass in the whole region. Our work presents a new 3D view of the MCs distribution toward the Cygnus X region, as well as the exact molecular gas mass distribution in the foreground Cygnus Rift.</description>

      <title>Imprints of interaction processes in the globular cluster system of NGC 3640</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a wide-field study of the globular cluster systems (GCS) of the elliptical galaxy NGC 3640 and its companion NGC 3641, based on observations from Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph/Gemini. NGC 3640 is a shell galaxy which presents a complex morphology, which previous studies have indicated as the sign of a recent 'dry' merger, although whether its nearest neighbour could have influenced these substructures remains an open question. In this work, we trace the spatial distribution of the globular clusters (GCs) as well as their colour distribution, finding a potential bridge of red GCs that connects NGC 3640 to its less massive companion, and signs that the blue GCs were spatially disturbed by the event that created the shells.</description>

      <title>Tip of the iceberg: overmassive black holes at 4&lt;z&lt;7 found by JWST are not inconsistent with the local $\mathcal{M}_{\rm BH}$-$\mathcal{M}_\star$ relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST is revealing a new remarkable population of high-redshift ($z\gtrsim4$), low-luminosity Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) in deep surveys and detecting the host galaxy stellar light in the most luminous and massive quasars at $z\sim 6$ for the first time. Latest results claim supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in these systems to be significantly more massive than expected from the local BH mass - stellar mass ($\mathcal{M}_{\rm BH} - \mathcal{M}_\star$) relation and that this is not due to sample selection effects. Through detailed statistical modeling, we demonstrate that the coupled effects of selection biases (i.e., finite detection limit and requirements on detecting broad lines) and measurement uncertainties in $\mathcal{M}_{\rm BH}$ and $\mathcal{M}_\star$ can in fact largely account for the reported offset and flattening in the observed $\mathcal{M}_{\rm BH} - \mathcal{M}_\star$ relation toward the upper envelope of the local relation, even for those at $\mathcal{M}_{\rm BH} &lt; 10^8\,M_{\odot}$. We further investigate the possible evolution of the $\mathcal{M}_{\rm BH} - \mathcal{M}_\star$ relation at $z\gtrsim 4$ with careful treatment of observational biases and consideration of the degeneracy between intrinsic evolution and dispersion in this relation. The bias-corrected intrinsic $\mathcal{M}_{\rm BH} - \mathcal{M}_\star$ relation in the low-mass regime suggests that there might be a large population of low-mass BHs (${\rm log}\,\mathcal{M}_{\rm BH} \lesssim 5$), possibly originating from lighter seeds, remaining undetected or unidentified even in the deepest JWST surveys. These results have important consequences for JWST studies of BH seeding and the coevolution between SMBHs and their host galaxies at the earliest cosmic times.</description>

      <title>A far-ultraviolet-driven photoevaporation flow observed in a protoplanetary disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most low-mass stars form in stellar clusters that also contain massive stars, which are sources of far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation. Theoretical models predict that this FUV radiation produces photo-dissociation regions (PDRs) on the surfaces of protoplanetary disks around low-mass stars, impacting planet formation within the disks. We report JWST and Atacama Large Millimetere Array observations of a FUV-irradiated protoplanetary disk in the Orion Nebula. Emission lines are detected from the PDR; modelling their kinematics and excitation allows us to constrain the physical conditions within the gas. We quantify the mass-loss rate induced by the FUV irradiation, finding it is sufficient to remove gas from the disk in less than a million years. This is rapid enough to affect giant planet formation in the disk.</description>

      <title>Gas-dynamical Mass Measurements of the Supermassive Black Holes in the Early-Type Galaxies NGC 4786 and NGC 5193 from ALMA and HST Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present molecular gas-dynamical mass measurements of the central black holes in the giant elliptical galaxies NGC 4786 and NGC 5193, based on CO(2$-$1) observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and Hubble Space Telescope near-infrared imaging. The central region in each galaxy contains a circumnuclear disk that exhibits orderly rotation with projected line-of-sight velocities of ${\sim} 270\, \mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s^{-1}}$. We build gas-dynamical models for the rotating disk in each galaxy and fit them directly to the ALMA data cubes. At $0.31^{\prime \prime}$resolution, the ALMA observations do not fully resolve the black hole sphere of influence (SOI), and neither galaxy exhibits a central rise in rotation speed, indicating that emission from deep within the SOI is not detected. As a result, our models do not tightly constrain the central black hole mass in either galaxy, but they prefer the presence of a central massive object in both galaxies. We measure the black hole mass to be $(M_{\mathrm{BH}}/10^8\, M_{\odot}) = 5.0 \pm 0.2 \,[\mathrm{1\sigma \,statistical}] \,^{+1.4}_{-1.3} \,[\mathrm{systematic}]$ in NGC 4786 and $(M_{\mathrm{BH}}/10^8\, M_{\odot}) = 1.4 \pm 0.03 \, [\mathrm{1\sigma\,statistical}] ^{+1.5}_{-0.1} \,[\mathrm{systematic}]$ in NGC 5193. The largest component of each measurement's error budget is from the systematic uncertainty associated with the extinction correction in the host galaxy models. This underscores the importance of assessing the impact of dust attenuation on the inferred $M_{\mathrm{BH}}$.</description>

      <title>Unveiling two expanding stellar groups formed through violent relaxation in The Lagoon Nebula Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current kinematic state of young stellar clusters can give clues on their actual dynamical state and origin. In this contribution, we use Gaia DR3 data of the Lagoon Nebula Cluster (LNC) to show that the cluster is composed of two expanding groups, likely formed from different molecular cloud clumps. We find no evidence of massive stars having larger velocity dispersion than low-mass stars or being spatially segregated across the LNC, as a whole, or within the Primary group. However, the Secondary group, with 1/5th of the stars, exhibits intriguing features. On the one hand, it shows a bipolar nature, with an aspect ratio of $\sim$3:1. In addition, the massive stars in this group exhibit larger velocity dispersion than the low-mass stars, although they are not concentrated towards the center of the group. This suggests that this group may have undergone dynamical relaxation, first, and some explosive event afterward. However, further observations and numerical work have to be performed to confirm this hypothesis. The results of this work suggest that, although stellar clusters may form by the global and hierarchical collapse of their parent clump, still some dynamical relaxation may take place.</description>

      <title>Cloud properties across spatial scales in simulations of the interstellar medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular clouds (MC) are structures of dense gas in the interstellar medium (ISM), that extend from ten to a few hundred parsecs and form the main gas reservoir available for star formation. Hydrodynamical simulations of varying complexity are a promising way to investigate MC evolution and their properties. However, each simulation typically has a limited range in resolution and different cloud extraction algorithms are used, which complicates the comparison between simulations. In this work, we aim to extract clouds from different simulations covering a wide range of spatial scales. We compare their properties, such as size, shape, mass, internal velocity dispersion and virial state. We apply the Hop cloud detection algorithm on (M)HD numerical simulations of stratified ISM boxes and isolated galactic disk simulations that were produced using Flash Ramses and Arepo We find that the extracted clouds are complex in shape ranging from round objects to complex filamentary networks in all setups. Despite the wide range of scales, resolution, and sub-grid physics, we observe surprisingly robust trends in the investigated metrics. The mass spectrum matches in the overlap between simulations without rescaling and with a high-mass slope of $\mathrm{d} N/\mathrm{d}\ln M\propto-1$ in accordance with theoretical predictions. The internal velocity dispersion scales with the size of the cloud as $\sigma\propto R^{0.75}$ for large clouds ($R\gtrsim3\,\mathrm{pc}$). For small clouds we find larger sigma compared to the power-law scaling, as seen in observations, which is due to supernova-driven turbulence. Almost all clouds are gravitationally unbound with the virial parameter scaling as $\alpha_\mathrm{vir}\propto M^{-0.4}$, which is slightly flatter compared to observed scaling, but in agreement given the large scatter.</description>

      <title>Water vapour masers in long-period variable stars III. Mira variables U Her and RR Aql</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the 'Medicina/Effelsberg H2O maser monitoring program' we observed U Her and RR Aql at 22-GHz for about two decades between 1990 and 2011, with a gap between 1997 and 2000 in the case of RR Aql. In addition, maps were obtained in the period 1990-1992 of U Her with the Very Large Array. We find that the strongest emission in U Her is located in a shell with boundaries 11-25 AU. The gas crossing time is 8.5 years. We derive lifetimes for individual maser clouds of less than 4 years, based on the absence of detectable line-of-sight velocity drifts of the maser emission. The shell is not evenly filled, and its structure is maintained on timescales much longer than those of individual maser clouds.
  Both stars show brightness variability on several timescales. The prevalent variation is periodic, following the optical variability of the stars with a lag of 2-3 months. Superposed are irregular fluctuations, of a few months' duration, of increased or decreased excitation at particular locations, and long-term systematic variations on timescales of a decade or more. The properties of the maser emission are governed by those of the stellar wind while traversing the water maser shell. Inhomogeneities in the wind affecting the excitation conditions and prevalent beaming directions likely cause the variations seen on timescales longer than the stellar pulsation period. We propose the existence of long-living regions in the shells, which maintain favourable excitation conditions on timescales of the wind crossing times through the shells or orbital periods of (sub-)stellar companions.</description>

      <title>The EDIBLES Survey. VIII. Band profile alignment of diffuse interstellar bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: There have been many attempts to identify families of diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs) with perfectly correlating band strengths. Although major efforts have been made to classify broadly based DIB families and important insights have been gained, no family has been identified with sufficient accuracy or statistical significance to prove that a series of selected DIBs originates from the same carrier. This can be attributed in part to the exclusive use of equivalent widths to establish DIB families.
  Aims: In a change of strategy, we search for DIBs that are highly correlated in both band strength and profile shape. This approach increases the chance of correlating DIBs being members of one family and originating from the same carrier molecule. We also search for correlations between DIB profile families and atomic interstellar lines, with the goal of further chemically constraining possible DIB carriers.
  Methods: We adapted the well-known method of time-series alignment to perform a spectral alignment; that is, DIB alignment. In a second step, we analysed the alignment results using a clustering analysis. This method required a statistically significant data set of DIB sight lines. The ESO Diffuse Interstellar Bands Large Exploration Survey (EDIBLES) data were perfectly suited for this application.
  Results: We report eight DIB families with correlating strengths and profiles, as well as four previously unreported DIBs in the visual range, found using DIB alignment. All profile family members show Pearson correlation coefficients in band strength higher than 0.9. In particular, we report the 6614 - 6521 AA DIB pair, in which both DIBs show the same triple-peak substructure and an unprecedented band strength Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.9935. The presented approach opens up new perspectives that can guide the laboratory search for DIB carriers.</description>

      <title>X-Shaped Radio Galaxies: Probing Jet Evolution, Ambient Medium Dynamics, and Their Intricate Interconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This review explores the field of X-shaped radio galaxies (XRGs), a distinctive subset of winged radio sources that are identified by two pairs of jetted lobes which aligned by a significant angle, resulting in an inversion-symmetric structure. These lobes, encompassing active (primary) and passive (secondary) phases, exhibit a diverse range of properties across the multiple frequency bands, posing challenges in discerning their formation mechanism. The proposed mechanisms can broadly be categorized into those related either to a triaxial ambient medium, into which the jet propagates, or to a complex, central AGN mechanism, where the jet is generated. The observed characteristics of XRGs as discovered in the most substantial sample to date, challenge the idea that there is universal process at work that produces the individual sources of XRGs. Instead, the observational and numerical results rather imply the absence of an universal model and infer that distinct mechanisms may be at play for the specific sources. By scrutinizing salient and confounding properties, this review intends to propose the potential direction for future research to constrain and constrict individual models applicable to XRGs.</description>

      <title>MIGHTEE-HI: HI galaxy properties in the large scale structure environment at z~0.37 from a stacking experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first measurement of HI mass of star-forming galaxies in different large scale structure environments from a blind survey at $z\sim 0.37$. In particular, we carry out a spectral line stacking analysis considering $2875$ spectra of colour-selected star-forming galaxies undetected in HI at $0.23 &lt; z &lt; 0.49$ in the COSMOS field, extracted from the MIGHTEE-HI Early Science datacubes, acquired with the MeerKAT radio telescope. We stack galaxies belonging to different subsamples depending on three different definitions of large scale structure environment: local galaxy overdensity, position inside the host dark matter halo (central, satellite, or isolated), and cosmic web type (field, filament, or knot). We first stack the full star-forming galaxy sample and find a robust HI detection yielding an average galaxy HI mass of $M_{\rm HI}=(8.12\pm 0.75)\times 10^9\, {\rm M}_\odot$ at $\sim 11.8\sigma$. Next, we investigate the different subsamples finding a negligible difference in $M_{\rm HI}$ as a function of the galaxy overdensity. We report an HI excess compared to the full sample in satellite galaxies ($M_{\rm HI}=(11.31\pm1.22)\times 10^9$, at $\sim 10.2 \sigma$) and in filaments ($M_{\rm HI}=(11.62\pm 0.90)\times 10^9$. Conversely, we report non-detections for the central and knot galaxies subsamples, which appear to be HI-deficient. We find the same qualitative results also when stacking in units of HI fraction ($f_{\rm HI}$). We conclude that the HI amount in star-forming galaxies at the studied redshifts correlates with the large scale structure environment.</description>

      <title>On the properties and implications of collapse-driven MHD turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the driving of MHD turbulence by gravitational contraction using simulations of an initially spherical, magnetically supercritical cloud core with initially transonic and trans-Alfv\'enic turbulence. We perform a Helmholtz decomposition of the velocity field, and investigate the evolution of its solenoidal and compressible parts, as well as of the velocity component along the gravitational acceleration vector, a proxy for the infall component of the velocity field. We find that: 1) In spite of being supercritical, the core first contracts to a sheet perpendicular to the mean field, and the sheet itself collapses. 2) The solenoidal component of the turbulence remains at roughly its initial level throughout the simulation, while the compressible component increases continuously. This implies that turbulence does {\it not} dissipate towards the center of the core. 3) The distribution of simulation cells in the $B$-$\rho$ plane occupies a wide triangular region at low densities, bounded below by the expected trend for fast MHD waves ($B \propto \rho$, applicable for high local Alfv\'enic Mach number $\Ma$) and above by the trend expected for slow waves ($B \sim$ constant, applicable for low local $\Ma$). At high densities, the distribution follows a single trend $B \propto \rho^{\gamef}$, with $1/2 &lt; \gamef &lt; 2/3$, as expected for gravitational compression. 4) The measured mass-to-magnetic flux ratio $\lambda$ increases with radius $r$, due to the different scalings of the mass and magnetic flux with $r$. At a fixed radius, $\lambda$ increases with time due to the accretion of material along field lines. 5) The solenoidal energy fraction is much smaller than the total turbulent component, indicating that the collapse drives the turbulence mainly compressibly, even in directions orthogonal to that of the collapse.</description>

      <title>Orbital analysis of stars in the nuclear stellar disc of the Milky Way</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While orbital analysis studies were so far mainly focused on the Galactic halo, it is possible now to do these studies in the heavily obscured region close to the Galactic Centre. We aim to do a detailed orbital analysis of stars located in the nuclear stellar disc (NSD) of the Milky Way allowing us to trace the dynamical history of this structure. We integrated orbits of the observed stars in a non-axisymmetric potential. We used a Fourier transform to estimate the orbital frequencies. We compared two orbital classifications, one made by eye and the other with an algorithm, in order to identify the main orbital families. We also compared the Lyapunov and the frequency drift techniques to estimate the chaoticity of the orbits. We identified several orbital families as chaotic, $z$-tube, $x$-tube, banana, fish, saucer, pretzel, 5:4, and 5:6 orbits. As expected for stars located in a NSD, the large majority of orbits are identified as $z$-tubes (or as a sub-family of $z$-tubes). Since the latter are parented by $x_{2}$ orbits, this result supports the contribution of the bar (in which $x_{2}$ orbits are dominant in the inner region) in the formation of the NSD. Moreover, most of the chaotic orbits are found to be contaminants from the bar or bulge which would confirm the predicted contamination from the most recent NSD models. Based on a detailed orbital analysis, we were able to classify orbits into various families, most of which are parented by $x_{2}$-type orbits, which are dominant in the inner part of the bar.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present photometric CCD observations of stars in four stellar trapezia ADS 15184, ADS 4728, ADS 2843, and ADS 16795. This study is performed on images obtained at the Observatorio Astron\'omico Nacional at San Pedro M\'artir (OAN), Baja California, M\'exico. In this work we utilise aperture photometry to measure the $U$, $B$, $V$, $R$ and $I$ magnitudes of some of the stars in these dynamically unstable stellar clusters (trapezia).
  Using the $Q=(U-B)-0.72(B-V)$ parameter we obtained the spectral type of the studied stars as well as their distance to the Sun and their reddening. Slight differences between the $Q$-derived Spectral types and those listed in SIMBAD might be due to a different value, from $0.72$, for the slope of the reddening line on the two-colour diagram.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Models of accretion discs surrounding active galactic nuclei (AGNs) find vast applications in high-energy astrophysics. The broad strategy is to parametrize some of the key disc properties such as gas density and temperature as a function of the radial coordinate from a given set of assumptions on the underlying physics. Two of the most popular approaches in this context were presented by Sirko &amp; Goodman (2003) and Thompson et al. (2005). We present a critical reanalysis of these widely used models, detailing their assumptions and clarifying some steps in their derivation that were previously left unsaid. Our findings are implemented in the pAGN module for the Python programming language, which is the first public implementation of these accretion-disc models. We further apply pAGN to the evolution of stellar-mass black holes embedded in AGN discs, addressing the potential occurrence of migration traps.</description>

      <title>Abundances of Neutron-Capture Elements in 62 Stars in the Globular Cluster Messier 15</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: M15 is a globular cluster with a known spread in neutron-capture elements. This paper presents abundances of neutron-capture elements for 62 stars in M15. Spectra were obtained with the Michigan/Magellan Fiber System (M2FS) spectrograph, covering a wavelength range from ~4430-4630 A. Spectral lines from Fe I, Fe II, Sr I, Zr II, Ba II, La II, Ce II, Nd II, Sm II, Eu II, and Dy II, were measured, enabling classifications and neutron-capture abundance patterns for the stars. Of the 62 targets, 44 are found to be highly Eu-enhanced r-II stars, another 17 are moderately Eu-enhanced r-I stars, and one star is found to have an s-process signature. The neutron-capture patterns indicate that the majority of the stars are consistent with enrichment by the r-process. The 62 target stars are found to show significant star-to-star spreads in Sr, Zr, Ba, La, Ce, Nd, Sm, Eu, and Dy, but no significant spread in Fe. The neutron-capture abundances are further found to have slight correlations with sodium abundances from the literature, unlike what has been previously found; follow-up studies are needed to verify this result. The findings in this paper suggest that the Eu-enhanced stars in M15 were enhanced by the same process, that the nucleosynthetic source of this Eu pollution was the r-process, and that the r-process source occurred as the first generation of cluster stars was forming.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Asymmetric Spike-like Structures of 10 au Disk around the Very Low-luminosity Protostar Embedded in the Taurus Dense Core MC 27/L1521F with ALMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent ALMA observations have revealed an increasing number of compact protostellar disks with radii of less than a few tens of au, and the young Class 0/I objects have an intrinsic size diversity. To deepen our understanding of the origin of such tiny disks, we performed the highest resolution configuration observations with ALMA at a beam size of $\sim$0$''$03 (4 au) on the very low luminosity Class 0 protostar embedded in the Taurus dense core MC 27/L1521F. The 1.3 mm continuum measurement successfully resolved a tiny, faint ($\sim$1 mJy) disk with a major axis length of $\sim$10 au, one of the smallest examples in the ALMA protostellar studies. In addition, we detected spike-like components in the northeastern direction at the disk edge. Gravitational instability or other fragmentation mechanisms cannot explain the structures, given the central stellar mass of $\sim$0.2 $M_{\odot}$ and the disk mass of $\gtrsim$10$^{-4}$ $M_{\odot}$. Instead, we propose that these small spike structures were formed by a recent dynamic magnetic flux transport event due to interchange instability that would be favorable to occur if the parental core has a strong magnetic field. The presence of complex arc-like structures on a larger ($\sim$2000 au) scale in the same direction as the spike structures suggests that the event was not single. Such episodic, dynamical events may play an important role in maintaining the compact nature of the protostellar disk in the complex gas envelope during the main accretion phase.</description>

      <title>Observational Evidence for Hot Wind Impact on pc-scale in Low-luminosity Active Galactic Nucleus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supermassive black holes in galaxies spend majority of their lifetime in the low-luminosity regime, powered by hot accretion flow. Strong winds launched from the hot accretion flow have the potential to play an important role in active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback. Direct observational evidence for these hot winds with temperature around 10 keV, has been obtained through the detection of highly ionized iron emission lines with Doppler shifts in two prototypical low-luminosity AGNs, namely M81* and NGC 7213. In this work, we further identify blueshifted H-like O/Ne emission lines in the soft X-ray spectra of these two sources. These lines are interpreted to be associated with additional outflowing components possessing velocity around several $10^3$ km/s and lower temperature (~0.2-0.4 keV). Blue-shifted velocity and the X-ray intensity of these additional outflowing components are hard to be explained by previously detected hot wind freely propagating to larger radii. Through detailed numerical simulations, we find the newly detected blue-shifted emission lines would come from circumnuclear gas shock-heated by the hot wind instead. Hot wind can provide larger ram pressure force on the clumpy circumnuclear gas than the gravitational force from central black hole, effectively impeding the black hole accretion of gas. Our results provide strong evidences for the energy and momentum feedback by the hot AGN wind.</description>

      <title>Numerical challenges for energy conservation in N-body simulations of collapsing self-interacting dark matter haloes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM) haloes can be subject to gravothermal collapse if DM is not collisionless but has strong self-interactions. When the scattering can efficiently transfer heat from the centre to the outskirts, the central region of the halo collapses and reaches densities much higher than those for collisionless DM. This phenomenon is potentially observable in studies of strong lensing. Current theoretical efforts are motivated by observations of surprisingly dense substructures. A comparison with them requires accurate predictions. One method to obtain such predictions is to use N-body simulations. The collapsed haloes are extreme systems that pose severe challenges to state-of-the-art codes used to model self-interacting dark matter (SIDM). We investigate the root of such problems with a focus on energy non-conservation. We run N-body simulations with and without DM self-interactions of an isolated DM-only halo and change numerical parameters relevant to the accuracy of the simulation. We find that not only the numerical scheme for the DM self-interactions can lead to energy non-conservation but also the modelling of gravitational interaction and the time integration are problematic. The issues we found are: (a) particles changing their time step in a non-time-reversible manner; (b) the asymmetry in the tree-based gravitational force evaluation; (c) SIDM velocity kicks break the symplectic nature and time symmetry. Tuning the parameters of the simulation to achieve a high accuracy allows for conserving energy not only at early stages of the evolution but also at late ones. However, the cost of the simulations becomes prohibitively large. Some problems making the simulations of the gravothermal collapse phase inaccurate, can be overcome by choosing appropriate numerical schemes. However, others remain challenging. Our findings motivate further work on addressing these challenges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Intergalactic Medium (IGM) contains $&gt;$50% of the baryonic mass of the Universe, yet the mechanisms responsible for keeping the IGM ionized has not been fully explained. Hence, we investigate ion abundances from the largest blind QSO absorption catalog for clouds that show C IV, N V, and O VI simultaneously. The wavelength range of present UV spectrographs, however, make it possible to probe C IV and O VI over a small range of redshift ($z \approx 0.12 - 0.15$). As a result, we only have five IGM absorbing clouds, yet these provide a powerful and representative tool to probe the IGM ionization state. We found one cloud to be in collisional ionization equilibrium while three of five showed signs of being produced by non-equilibrium processes, specifically conductive interfaces and turbulent mixing layers. None of the models we explore here were able to reproduce the ionization state of the remaining system. Energetic processes, such as galactic feedback from star formation and AGN winds, would be excellent candidates that can cause such widespread ionization.</description>

Abstract: We utilise theoretical models of Population III stellar+nebular spectra to investigate the prospects of observing and accurately identifying Population III galaxies with JWST using both deep imaging and spectroscopy. We investigate a series of different colour cuts, finding that a combination of NIRCam and MIRI photometry through the F444W-F560W, F560W-F770W colours offers the most robust identifier of potential $z=8$ Pop III candidates. We calculate that NIRCam will have to reach $\sim$28.5-30.0 AB mag depths (1-20 h), and MIRI F560W must reach $\sim$27.5-29.0 AB mag depths (10-100 h) to achieve $5\sigma$ continuum detections of $M_* = 10^6~\mathrm{M}_\odot$ Pop III galaxies at $z=8$. We also discuss the prospects of identifying Pop III candidates through slitless and NIRSpec spectroscopic surveys that target Ly$\alpha$, H$\beta$ and/or He II $\lambda 1640$. We find small differences in the H$\beta$ rest-frame equivalent width (EW) between Pop III and non-Pop III galaxies, rendering this diagnostic likely impractical. Instead, we find that the detection of high EW He II $\lambda 1640$ emission will serve as the definitive Pop III identifier, requiring (ultra-)deep integrations (10-250 h) with NIRSpec/G140M for $M_*=10^6~\mathrm{M}_\odot$ Pop III galaxies at $z=8$. However, MIRI F770W detections of Pop III galaxies will require substantial gravitational lensing ($\mu=10$) and/or fortuitous imaging of exceptionally massive ($M_* = 10^7~\mathrm{M}_\odot$) Pop III galaxies. Thus, NIRCam medium-band imaging surveys that can search for high EW He II $\lambda 1640$ emitters in photometry may perhaps be a viable alternative for finding Pop III candidates.</description>

Abstract: Lyman limit systems (LLSs) are dense hydrogen clouds with high enough HI column densities to absorb Lyman continuum photons emitted from distant quasars. Their high column densities imply an origin in dense environments; however, the statistics and distribution of LLSs at high redshifts still remain uncertain. In this paper, we use self-consistent radiative transfer cosmological simulations from the "Cosmic Reionization On Computers" (CROC) project to study the physical properties of LLSs at the tail end of cosmic reionization at $z\sim6$. We generate 3000 synthetic quasar sightlines to obtain a large number of LLS samples in the simulations. In addition, with the high physical fidelity and resolution of CROC, we are able to quantify the association between these LLS samples and nearby galaxies. Our results show that the fraction LLSs spatially associated with nearby galaxies is increasing with the HI column density. Moreover, we find that LLSs that are not near any galaxy typically reside in filamentary structures connecting neighboring galaxies in the intergalactic medium (IGM). This quantification of the distribution and associations of LLSs to large scale structures informs our understanding of the IGM-galaxy connection during the Epoch of Reionization, and provides a theoretical basis for interpreting future observations.</description>

      <title>Powerful Radio-Loud Quasars are Triggered by Galaxy Mergers in the Cosmic Bright Ages</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.11804v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While supermassive black holes are ubiquitous features of galactic nuclei, only a small minority are observed during episodes of luminous accretion. The physical mechanism(s) driving the onset of fueling and ignition in these active galactic nuclei (AGN) are still largely unknown for many galaxies and AGN-selection criteria. Attention has focused on AGN triggering by means of major galaxy mergers gravitationally funneling gas towards the galactic center, with evidence both for and against this scenario. However, several recent studies have found that radio-loud AGN overwhelmingly reside in ongoing or recent major galaxy mergers. In this study, we test the hypothesis that major galaxy mergers are important triggers for radio-loud AGN activity in powerful quasars during cosmic noon (1 &lt; z &lt; 2). To this end, we compare Hubble Space Telescope WFC3/IR observations of the z &gt; 1 3CR radio-loud broad-lined quasars to three matched radio-quiet quasar control samples. We find strong evidence for major-merger activity in nearly all radio-loud AGN, in contrast to the much lower merger fraction in the radio-quiet AGN. These results suggest major galaxy mergers are key ingredients to launching powerful radio jets. Given many of our radio-loud quasars are blue, our results present a possible challenge to the "blow-out" paradigm of galaxy evolution models in which blue quasars are the quiescent end result following a period of red quasar feedback initiated by a galaxy merger. Finally, we find a tight correlation between black hole mass and host galaxy luminosity for these different high-redshift AGN samples inconsistent with those observed for local elliptical galaxies.</description>

Abstract: Recent observations with the \textit{James Webb} Space Telescope (JWST) have further refined the spectroscopic redshift of GN-z11, one of the most distant galaxies identified with the \textit{Hubble} Space Telescope (HST) at $z=10.603$. The presence of extremely dense gas ($&gt;10^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$), the detection of high-ionisation lines and of CII*1335 emission, as well as the presence of an ionisation cone, indicate that GN-z11 also hosts an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN). Further photometric and spectroscopic follow-up demonstrates that it lies in a large-scale, overdense structure with possible signatures of Population III (PopIII) stars in its halo. Surprisingly, Ly$\alpha$ has also been detected despite the expected largely neutral inter-galactic medium at such a redshift. We exploit recent JWST/NIRSpec IFU observations to demonstrate that the Ly$\alpha$ emission in GN-z11 is part of an extended halo with a minimum size of 0.8--3.2 kpc, depending on the definition used to derive the halo size. The surface brightness of the Ly$\alpha$ halo around GN-z11 appears consistent with Ly$\alpha$ halos observed around $z\sim6$ quasars. At the wavelength of Ly$\alpha$ at $z\sim$10.6, we identify three other emission line candidates within the IFU Field-of-View with no UV rest-frame counterpart visible in deep images from the JWST/NIRCam. If confirmed, this could be the first evidence that the local region of GN-z11 represents a candidate protocluster core, forming just 400 Myr after the Big Bang. We give a first estimate of the dark matter halo mass of this structure ($M_h$=2.96$^{+0.44}_{-0.39} \times$10$^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$), consistent with a Coma-like cluster progenitor.</description>

      <title>GA-NIFS: Early-stage feedback in a heavily obscured AGN at $z=4.76$</title>

Abstract: Dust-obscured galaxies are thought to represent an early evolutionary phase of massive galaxies in which the active galactic nucleus (AGN) is still deeply buried in significant amounts of dusty material and its emission is strongly suppressed. The unprecedented sensitivity of the James Webb Space Telescope enables us for the first time to detect the rest-frame optical emission of heavily obscured AGN and unveil the properties of the hidden accreting super-massive black holes (BHs). In this work, we present the JWST/NIRSpec IFS data of ALESS073.1, a massive, dusty, star-forming galaxy at $z = 4.76$ hosting an AGN at its center. The detection of a very broad $H_\alpha$ emission associated with the Broad Line Region (BLR) confirms the presence of a BH ($\log(M_{BH}/M_\odot)&gt;8.7$) accreting at less than 15\% of its Eddington limit and classifies the target as a Type 1 AGN. The rest-frame optical emission lines also reveal a fast ionized gas outflow marginally resolved in the galaxy center. The high sensitivity of NIRSpec allows us to perform the kinematic analysis of the narrow H$\alpha$ component which indicates that the warm ionized gas velocity field is consistent with disk rotation. We also find that, in the innermost nuclear regions ($&lt; 1.5$ kpc), the intrinsic velocity dispersion of the disk reaches $\sim 150$ km/s, $\sim 2-3$ times higher than the velocity dispersion inferred from the [CII] 158$\mu$m line tracing mostly cold gas. Since, at large radii, the velocity dispersion of the warm and cold gas are comparable, we conclude that the outflows are injecting turbulence in the warm ionized gas in the central region, but they are not sufficiently powerful to disrupt the dense gas and quench star formation. These findings support the scenario that dust-obscured galaxies represent the evolutionary stage preceding the unobscured quasar when all gas and dust are removed from the host.</description>

      <title>Chromatically modelling the parsec scale dusty structure in the centre of NGC1068</title>

Abstract: The Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) has been providing breakthrough images of the dust in the central parsecs of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), a key component of the AGN unification scheme and AGN host galaxy interaction. In single IR bands, the images can have multiple interpretations some of which could challenge the unification scheme. This is the case for the archetypal type 2 AGN of NGC1068. The ambiguity is reduced by multi-band temperature maps which are hindered by uncertainty in intra-band alignment. We create a chromatic model capable of simultaneously explaining the VLTI GRAVITY+MATISSE 2$\mu$m-13$\mu$m observations of the AGN in NGC1068. We use a simple disk and wind geometry populated with spherical black body emitters and dust obscuration to create a versatile multi-wavelength model for IR interferometric data of dusty objects. This simple geometry is capable of reproducing the K-N-band VLTI data, explains the complex single band images, and solves the alignment between bands. We find that the resulting geometry is consistent with previous studies. Compared to molecular gas emission, our model wind position angle (PA) of $22^3_2{\deg}$ is close to the mas scale outflowing CO(6-5) PA of ~33{\deg} seen with the ALMA. The equivalent 90{\deg} offset model disk PA is also consistent with the CO(6-5) disk axis of 112{\deg} as well as the mas scale disk axis from CO(2-1), CO(3-2), and HCO$^+$(4-3) of 115$\pm$5{\deg}. Furthermore, the resulting model visually resembles the equivalent achromatic image reconstructions. We conclude that the IR emitting structure surrounding the AGN can indeed be explained by the clumpy disk+wind iteration of the AGN unification scheme. Within the scheme, we find it is best explained as a type 2 and the obscuring dust chemistry is consistent with a mix of olivine silicates and 16$\pm$1% amorphous carbon.</description>

      <title>The morphological mix of dwarf galaxies in the nearby Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use a complete, unbiased sample of 257 dwarf (10^8 MSun &lt; Mstar &lt; 10^9.5 MSun) galaxies at z &lt; 0.08, in the COSMOS field, to study the morphological mix of the dwarf population in low-density environments. Visual inspection of extremely deep optical images and their unsharp-masked counterparts reveals three principal dwarf morphological classes. 43 and 45 per cent of dwarfs exhibit the traditional `early-type' (elliptical/S0) and `late-type' (spiral) morphologies respectively. However, 10 per cent populate a `featureless' class, that lacks both the central light concentration seen in early-types and any spiral structure - this class is missing in the massive-galaxy regime. 14, 27 and 19 per cent of early-type, late-type and featureless dwarfs respectively show evidence for interactions, which drive around 20 per cent of the overall star formation activity in the dwarf population. Compared to their massive counterparts, dwarf early-types show a much lower incidence of interactions, are significantly less concentrated and share similar rest-frame colours as dwarf late-types. This suggests that the formation histories of dwarf and massive early-types are different, with dwarf early-types being shaped less by interactions and more by secular processes. The lack of large groups or clusters in COSMOS at z &lt; 0.08, and the fact that our dwarf morphological classes show similar local density, suggests that featureless dwarfs in low-density environments are created via internal baryonic feedback, rather than by environmental processes. Finally, while interacting dwarfs can be identified using the asymmetry parameter, it is challenging to cleanly separate early and late-type dwarfs using traditional morphological parameters, such as `CAS', M20 and the Gini coefficient (unlike in the massive-galaxy regime).</description>

      <title>Ejecta, Rings, and Dust in SN 1987A with JWST MIRI/MRS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06692v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supernova (SN) 1987A is the nearest supernova in $\sim$400 years. Using the {\em JWST} MIRI Medium Resolution Spectrograph, we spatially resolved the ejecta, equatorial ring (ER) and outer rings in the mid-infrared 12,927 days after the explosion. The spectra are rich in line and dust continuum emission, both in the ejecta and the ring. Broad emission lines (280-380~km~s$^{-1}$ FWHM) seen from all singly-ionized species originate from the expanding ER, with properties consistent with dense post-shock cooling gas. Narrower emission lines (100-170~km~s$^{-1}$ FWHM) are seen from species originating from a more extended lower-density component whose high ionization may have been produced by shocks progressing through the ER, or by the UV radiation pulse associated with the original supernova event. The asymmetric east-west dust emission in the ER has continued to fade, with constant temperature, signifying a reduction in dust mass. Small grains in the ER are preferentially destroyed, with larger grains from the progenitor surviving the transition from SN into SNR. The ER is fit with a single set of optical constants, eliminating the need for a secondary featureless hot dust component. We find several broad ejecta emission lines from [Ne~{\sc ii}], [Ar~{\sc ii}], [Fe~{\sc ii}], and [Ni~{\sc ii}]. With the exception of [Fe~{\sc ii}]~25.99$\mu$m, these all originate from the ejecta close to the ring and are likely being excited by X-rays from the interaction. The [Fe~{\sc ii}]~5.34$\mu$m to 25.99$\mu$m line ratio indicates a temperature of only a few hundred K in the inner core, consistent with being powered by ${}^{44}$Ti decay.</description>

      <title>Mock Observatory: two thousand lightcone mock catalogues of luminous red galaxies from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Survey for the cosmological large-scale analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.03871v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating a reliable covariance matrix for correlation functions of galaxies is a crucial task to obtain accurate cosmological constraints from galaxy surveys. We generate 2,000 independent lightcone mock luminous red galaxy (LRGs) catalogues at $0.3 \leq z \leq 1.25$, designed to cover CAMIRA LRGs observed by the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Programme (HSC SSP). We first produce full-sky lightcone halo catalogues using a COmoving Lagrangian Acceleration (COLA) technique, and then trim them to match the footprints of the HSC SSP S20A Wide layers. The mock LRGs are subsequently populated onto the trimmed halo catalogues according to the halo occupation distribution model constrained by the observed CAMIRA LRGs. The stellar mass ($M_{\star}$) is assigned to each LRG by the subhalo abundance-matching technique using the observed stellar-mass functions of CAMIRA LRGs. We evaluate photometric redshifts (photo-$z$) of mock LRGs by incorporating the photo-$z$ scatter, which is derived from the observed $M_{\star}$--photo-$z$-scatter relations of the CAMIRA LRGs. We validate the constructed full-sky halo and lightcone LRG mock catalogues by comparing their angular clustering statistics (i.e., power spectra and correlation functions) with those measured from the halo catalogues of full $N$-body simulations and the CAMIRA LRG catalogues from the HSC SSP, respectively. We detect clear signatures of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs) from our mock LRGs, whose angular scales are well consistent with theoretical predictions. These results demonstrate that our mock LRGs can be used to evaluate covariance matrices at large scales and provide predictions for the BAO detectability and cosmological constraints.</description>

      <title>Reconnaissance with JWST of the J-region Asymptotic Giant Branch in Distance Ladder Galaxies: From Irregular Luminosity Functions to Approximation of the Hubble Constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04777v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study stars in the J-regions of the asymptotic giant branch (JAGB) of near-infrared color magnitude diagrams in the maser host NGC 4258 and 4 hosts of 6 Type Ia supernovae (SN Ia): NGC 1448, NGC 1559, NGC 5584, and NGC 5643. These clumps of stars are readily apparent near $1.0&lt;F150W-F277W&lt;1.5$ and $m_{F150W}$=22-25 mag with James Webb Space Telescope NIRCam photometry. Various methods have been proposed to assign an apparent reference magnitude for this recently proposed standard candle, including the mode, median, sigma-clipped mean or a modeled luminosity function parameter. We test the consistency of these by measuring intra-host variations, finding differences of up to $\sim$0.2 mag that significantly exceed statistical uncertainties. Brightness differences appear intrinsic, and are further amplified by the non-uniform shape of the JAGB luminosity function, also apparent in the LMC and SMC. We follow a 'many methods' approach to consistently measure JAGB magnitudes and distances to the SN Ia host sample calibrated by NGC 4258. We find broad agreement with distances measured from Cepheids, tip of the red giant branch (TRGB), and Miras. However, the SN host mean distance estimated via the JAGB method necessary to estimate $H_0$ differs by $\sim$0.19 mag amongst the above definitions, a result of different levels of luminosity function asymmetry. The methods yield a full range of $71-78$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, i.e., a fiducial result of $H_0=74.7\pm2.1$ (stat) $\pm$2.3 (sys) ($\pm$3.1 if combined in quadrature) km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, with systematic errors limited by the differences in methods. Future work may seek to further standardize and refine this promising tool, making it more competitive with established distance indicators.</description>

      <title>The role of carbon in red giant spectro-seismology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13235v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although red clump stars function as reliable standard candles, their surface characteristics (i.e. $T_\text{eff}$, $\log g$, and [Fe/H]) overlap with those of red giant branch stars, which are not standard candles. Recent results have revealed that spectral features containing carbon (e.g. CN molecular bands) carry information correlating with the "gold-standard" asteroseismic classifiers that distinguish red clump from red giant branch stars. However, the underlying astrophysical processes driving the correlation between these spectroscopic and asteroseismic quantities in red giants remain inadequately explored. This study aims to enhance our understanding of this "spectro-seismic" effect, by refining the list of key spectral features predicting red giant evolutionary state. In addition, we conduct further investigation into those key spectral features to probe the astrophysical processes driving this connection. We employ the data-driven The Cannon algorithm to analyse high-resolution ($R\sim80,000$) Veloce Rosso spectra from the Anglo-Australian Telescope for 301 red giant stars (where asteroseismic classifications from the TESS mission are known for 123 of the stars). The results highlight molecular spectroscopic features, particularly those containing carbon (e.g. CN), as the primary indicators of the evolutionary states of red giant stars. Furthermore, by investigating CN isotopic pairs (that is, $^{12}$C$^{14}$N and $^{13}$C$^{14}$N) we find suggestions of statistically significant differences in the reduced equivalent widths of such lines, suggesting that physical processes that change the surface abundances and isotopic ratios in red giant stars, such as deep mixing, are the driving forces of the "spectro-seismic" connection of red giants.</description>

Abstract: The Jiao Tong University Spectroscopic Telescope (JUST) is a 4.4-meter f/6.0 segmentedmirror telescope dedicated to spectroscopic observations. The JUST primary mirror is composed of 18 hexagonal segments, each with a diameter of 1.1 m. JUST provides two Nasmyth platforms for placing science instruments. One Nasmyth focus fits a field of view of 10 arcmin and the other has an extended field of view of 1.2 deg with correction optics. A tertiary mirror is used to switch between the two Nasmyth foci. JUST will be installed at a site at Lenghu in Qinghai Province, China, and will conduct spectroscopic observations with three types of instruments to explore the dark universe, trace the dynamic universe, and search for exoplanets: (1) a multi-fiber (2000 fibers) medium-resolution spectrometer (R=4000-5000) to spectroscopically map galaxies and large-scale structure; (2) an integral field unit (IFU) array of 500 optical fibers and/or a long-slit spectrograph dedicated to fast follow-ups of transient sources for multimessenger astronomy; (3) a high-resolution spectrometer (R~100000) designed to identify Jupiter analogs and Earth-like planets, with the capability to characterize the atmospheres of hot exoplanets.</description>
