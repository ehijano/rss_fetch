      <title>Fermion liquids as quantum Hall liquids in phase space: A unified approach for anomalies and responses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of many strongly correlated metallic phases have inspired novel routes to generalize or go beyond the celebrated Landau Fermi liquid theory. To this end, from universal consideration of symmetries and anomalies, Else, Thorngren and Senthil (ETS) have introduced a class of theories called ersatz Fermi liquids which possess a Fermi surface and satisfy a generalized Luttinger's theorem. In this work, we view all such fermion liquids obeying the Luttinger theorem as incompressible quantum Hall liquids in higher-dimensional phase space and use it as the starting point to derive their effective low-energy field theory. The non-commutativity of phase space motivates us to use Seiberg-Witten map to derive the field theory in an ordinary (commutative) space and naturally leads to terms that correspond to the correct topological Chern-Simons action postulated by ETS in one, two, and three dimensions. Additionally, our approach also reproduces all the non-topological terms that characterize important contributions to the response, including the semiclassical equations of motion. Finally, our derivations of Chern-Simons terms from the Seiberg-Witten map also verify a longstanding conjecture in non-commutative field theory.</description>

      <title>Design and Benchmarks for Emulating Kondo Dynamics on a Quantum Chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent advances in digital quantum simulation and the overall prospective of solving correlated many-electron problems using quantum algorithms, we design a gate-based quantum circuit that emulates the dynamics of the Kondo impurity model. We numerically determine the impurity magnetization, entanglement between impurity and fermionic sites and energy as a function of time (i.e.~circuit depth) for various initial states and find universal long-time dynamics. We complement the numerical simulations for moderate system size with an asymptotically exact analytical solution that is effective in the limit of large system sizes and for starting states corresponding to a filled Fermi sea. This work opens up the perspective of studying the dynamics of electronic quantum many-body states on quantum chips of the NISQ era.</description>

      <title>High-Magnetic Field Phases in U$_{1-x}$Th$_x$Te$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At temperatures much lower than its superconducting critical temperature $T_c$ of 2.1 K, the heavy fermion superconductor UTe$_2$ has a remarkable phase diagram of magnetic field $H$ vs. angles $\phi$ and $\theta$ at which $H$ is tilted away from the $b$-axis toward the $a$- and $c$-axes, respectively, in the orthorhombic unit cell. The phase diagram appears to contain three superconducting phases: (1) a low field superconducting phase SC$_{\mathrm{LF}}$ extending over all values of $\phi$ and $\theta$ with an upper critical field $H_{c2}$ with a maximum value of 15 T at $\phi = \theta = 0^\circ$; (2) a high field superconducting phase SC$_{\mathrm{HF}}$ located in a region between $\phi \approx 7^\circ$ and $\theta \approx 4^\circ$ in fields from $H_{c2\mathrm{LF}}$ of the SC$_{\mathrm{LF}}$ phase and the metamagnetic transition at $H_m$ at $\sim 35$ T marking the onset of the magnetic field polarized FP phase: and (3) a SC$_{\mathrm{FP}}$ superconducting phase that resides entirely within the FP phase in a pocket of superconductivity extending from $\theta \approx 20^\circ$ to $40^\circ$ in fields from $\sim 40$ T to above 60 T. In this work, we studied the $H$ vs $\theta$ phase diagram at a base temperature of $\sim 0.6$ K as a function of Th concentration $x$ in U$_{1-x}$Th$_x$Te$_2$ pseudobinary compounds for $0.5\% \lesssim x \lesssim 4.7\%$. We find that for all values of $x$ within this range, the SC$_{\mathrm{LF}}$ phase is retained with a reduced value of $H_{c2}$ of $\sim 10$ T at $\phi = \theta = 0^\circ$ for $x = 4.7\%$, while the SC$_{\mathrm{HF}}$ phase is suppressed. The SC$_{\mathrm{FP}}$ and FP phases are unaffected to values of $x = 2\%$ but are completely suppressed in the region $x = 2.5$ to $4.7\%$ where the residual resistance ratio RRR has decreased from $\sim 14$ at $x = 1.5\%$ to values of $\sim 3$, indicating a significant increase in disorder.</description>

      <title>The Mottness and the Anderson localization in bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The oxygen content plays a pivotal role in determining the electronic properties of the recently discovered La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ superconductors. In this work, we investigate the impact of oxygen vacancies on the insulating behavior of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ across the doping range $\delta = 0$ to $0.5$. At $\delta = 0.5$, we construct a bilayer Hubbard model to describe the system. Using dynamical mean-field theory, we demonstrate that the model captures the characteristics of a bilayer Mott insulator. To explore the effects of disorder within the range $\delta = 0$ to $0.5$, we treat the system as a mixture of metallic and Mott insulating phases. By analyzing the geometric average of the local density of states, we identify an Anderson localization transition occurring around $\delta \sim 0.2$. These results provide a quantitative explanation of recent experimental observations and highlight the critical influence of oxygen content on the physical properties of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$.</description>

      <title>Amp\`ere phase in frustrated magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a new class of algebraic spin liquids, in which the macroscopically degenerate ground state manifold is not Coulombic, like in spin ices, but Amp\`ere-like. The local constraint characterizing an Amp\`ere phase is not a Gauss law, but rather an Amp\`ere law, i.e., a condition on the curl of the magnetization vector field and not on its divergence. As a consequence, the excitations evolving in such a manifold are not magnetically charged scalar quasiparticles, the so-called magnetic monopoles in Coulomb phases, but instead vectorial magnetic loops (or fictional current lines). We demonstrate analytically that in a macroscopically degenerate manifold inheriting the properties of a cooperative paramagnet and subject to a local curl-free contraint, magnetic correlations decay in space with a power law whose exponent is the space dimension d: the Amp\`ere phase is a d-algebraic spin liquid. Using Monte Carlo simulations with appropriate cluster dynamics, we confirm this physics numerically in two- and three-dimensional examples, and illustrate how the Amp\`ere phase compares to its Coulomb counterpart.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrated X-ray structural analysis of the pressure-induced superconductor, $\beta'$-ET$_2$ICl$_2$ under extremely high-pressure conditions, where ET denotes bis(ethylenedithio)tetrathiafulvalene. This material has been known as the highest transition temperature ($T_c$) superconductor among organic superconductors ($T_c=14.2$ K at $8.2$ GPa). On the basis of the experimental results, ab-initio models were derived using the constrained random phase approximation. We revealed that the Lifshitz transition exists behind the Mott insulator-metal transition and found that the value of the on-site Coulomb interaction was halved to around $10$ GPa compared to that at ambient pressure. This study clarifies the enigmatic origins of high $T_{\rm c}$, and concurrently, provides a new understanding of the impacts of structural alterations in organic materials under high pressure on their electronic properties and the superconductivity process.</description>

      <title>Preformed Cooper Pairs in a Triclinic Iron Pnictide Superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electron pairing along with phase coherence generates superconductivity below the critical temperature ($T_c$). In underdoped high-$T_c$ cuprates, these two quantum phenomena may occur at separate temperatures, which was lately confirmed in the quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) iron chalcogenide superconductors. Here, we report a systematic investigation on the pre-pairing behavior in a triclinic iron pnictide superconductor (Ca$_{0.85}$La$_{0.15}$)$_{10}$(Pt$_3$As$_8$)(Fe$_2$As$_2$)$_5$ with $T_c \approx $ 30 K, where the superconductivity is quasi-2D manifested by the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless behaviors. Inelastic neutron scattering experiments unambiguously reveal a spin resonance peak around $E_R =$ 13 meV in the superconducting state, but its intensity continuously decreases when warming up across $T_c$, accompanied with an anomaly around $T^{*}\approx$ 45 K in spin correlations, and a suppression by an in-plane magnetic field persisting to the same temperature. Below $T^{*}$, a significant Nernst signal and a reduction of density of states at the Fermi level are also observed. These results suggest that the precursor of spin resonance is highly related to the preformed Cooper pairs driven by phase fluctuations, much like the pseudogap case in cuprates.</description>

      <title>Non-adiabatic linear response in open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adiabatic theorem and non-adiabatic corrections have been widely applied in modern quantum technology. Recently, non-adiabatic linear response theory has been developed to probe the many-body correlations in closed systems. In this work, we generalize the non-adiabatic linear response theory to open quantum many-body systems. We find that the linear deviation from steady states is memory-less, similar to the closed system. The linear response of observables while ramping the Hamiltonian is still related to the derivative of the retarded Green's function. However, as one ramps the dissipation, the corresponding coefficient is determined by a new high-order correlation function in the steady state. Our work gives a neat result and generalizes the tool of ramping dynamics to study the many-body correlations in open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>On the cuprates' universal waterfall feature: evidence of a momentum-driven crossover</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14381v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study two related universal anomalies of the spectral function of cuprates, so called waterfall and high-energy kink features, by a combined cellular dynamical mean-field theory and angle-resolved photoemission study for the oxychloride Na$_x$Ca$_{2-x}$CuO$_2$Cl$_2$ (Na-CCOC). Tracing their origin back to an interplay of spin-polaron and local correlation effects both in undoped and hole-doped (Na-)CCOC, we establish them as a universal crossover between regions differing in the momentum dependence of the coupling and not necessarily in the related quasiparticles' energies. The proposed scenario extends to doping levels coinciding with the cuprate's superconducting dome and motivates further investigations of the fate of spin-polarons in the superconducting phase.</description>

      <title>Pseudomode expansion of many-body correlation functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an expansion of a many-body correlation function in a sum of pseudomodes -- exponents with complex frequencies that encompass both decay and oscillations. The pseudomode expansion emerges in the framework of the Heisenberg version of the recursion method. This method essentially solves Heisenberg equations in a Lanczos tridiagonal basis constructed in the Krylov space of a given observable. To obtain pseudomodes, we first add artificial dissipation satisfying the dissipative generalization of the universal operator growth hypothesis, and then take the limit of the vanishing dissipation strength. Fast convergence of the pseudomode expansion is facilitated by the localization in the Krylov space, which is generic in the presence of dissipation and can survive the limit of the vanishing dissipation strength. As an illustration, we present pseudomode expansions of infinite-temperature autocorrelation functions in the quantum Ising and $XX$ spin-$1/2$ models on the square lattice. It turns out that it is enough to take a few first pseudomodes to obtain a good approximation to the correlation function.</description>

      <title>Fluctuating magnetism and Pomeranchuk effect in multilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetism typically arises from the effect of exchange interactions on highly localized fermionic wave functions in f- and d-atomic orbitals. In rhombohedral multilayer graphene (RMG), in contrast, magnetism-manifesting as spontaneous polarization into one or more spin and valley flavors[1-7]-originates from itinerant electrons near a Van Hove singularity. Here, we show experimentally that the electronic entropy in this system shows signatures typically associated with disordered local magnetic moments, unexpected for electrons in a fully itinerant metal. Specifically, we find a contribution $\Delta$ S $\approx$ 1k$_B$/charge carrier that onsets at the Curie temperature and survives over one order of magnitude in temperature. First order phase transitions show an isospin `Pomeranchuk effect' in which the fluctuating moment phase is entropically favored over the nearby symmetric Fermi liquid[8, 9]. Our results imply that despite the itinerant nature of the electron wave functions, the spin- and valley polarization of individual electrons are decoupled, a phenomenon typically associated with localized moments, as happens, for example, in solid 3He[10]. Transport measurements, surprisingly, show a finite temperature resistance minimum within the fluctuating moment regime, which we attribute to the interplay of fluctuating magnetic moments and electron phonon scattering. Our results highlight the universality of soft isospin modes to two-dimensional flat band systems.</description>

      <title>Orbital moir\'e and quadrupolar triple-q physics in a triangular lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10953v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We numerically study orders of planer type $(xy,x^2-y^2)$ quadrupoles on a triangular lattice with nearest-neighbor isotropic $J$ and anisotropic $K$ interactions. This type of quadrupoles possesses unique single-ion anisotropy proportional to a third order of the quadrupole moments. This provides an unconventional mechanism of triple-$q$ orders which does not exist for the degrees of freedom with odd parity under time-reversal operation such as magnetic dipoles. In addition to several single-$q$ orders, we find various orders including incommensurate triple-$q$ quasi-long-range orders with orbital moir\'e and a four-sublattice triple-$q$ partial order. Our Monte-Carlo simulations demonstrate that the phase transition to the latter triple-$q$ state belongs to the universality class of the critical line of the Ashkin-Teller model in two dimensions close to the four-state Potts class. These results indicate a possibility of realizing unique quadrupole textures in simple triangular systems.</description>

      <title>Spectral function of a bipolaron coupled to dispersive optical phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11537v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using an efficient variational exact diagonalization method, we computed the electron removal spectral function within the framework of the Holstein-Hubbard model containing two electrons with opposite spins coupled to dispersive quantum optical phonons. Our primary focus was examining the interplay between phonon dispersion and Coulomb repulsion and their effects on the single-electron removal spectral function, relevant for the analysis of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). Tuning the strengths of the electron-phonon coupling and the Hubbard interaction allows us to examine the evolution of the spectral properties of the system as it crosses over from a bound bipolaron to separate polarons. With increasing Hubbard repulsion, the decrease of the bipolaron binding energy results in the gradual downward shift of the polaron band - a low-frequency feature in the spectral function. Simultaneously, the intensity of the polaron band away from the center of the Brillouin zone diminishes until it remains non-zero only in its center as the bipolaron unbinds into two separate polarons. The spectral function is significantly influenced by phonon dispersion, particularly in systems with strong electron-phonon coupling. The sign of the curvature of the phonon band plays a crucial role in the distribution of spectral weight.</description>

      <title>Planon-modular fracton orders</title>

Abstract: There are now many examples of gapped fracton models, which are defined by the presence of restricted-mobility excitations above the quantum ground state. However, the theory of fracton orders remains in its early stages, and the complex landscape of examples is far from being mapped out. Here we introduce the class of planon-modular (p-modular) fracton orders, a relatively simple yet still rich class of quantum orders that encompasses several well-known examples of type I fracton order. The defining property is that any non-trivial point-like excitation can be detected by braiding with planons. From this definition, we uncover a significant amount of general structure, including the assignment of a natural number (dubbed the weight) to each excitation of a p-modular fracton order. We identify simple new phase invariants, some of which are based on weight, which can easily be used to compare and distinguish different fracton orders. We also study entanglement renormalization group (RG) flows of p-modular fracton orders, establishing a close connection with foliated RG. We illustrate our general results with an analysis of several exactly solvable fracton models that we show to realize p-modular fracton orders, including Z_n versions of the X-cube, anisotropic, checkerboard, 4-planar X-cube and four color cube (FCC) models. We show that each of these models is p-modular and compute its phase invariants. We also show that each example admits a foliated RG at the level of its non-trivial excitations, which is a new result for the 4-planar X-cube and FCC models. We show that the Z_2 FCC model is not a stack of other better-studied models, but predict that the Z_n FCC model with n odd is a stack of 10 4-planar X-cubes, possibly plus decoupled layers of 2d toric code. We also show that the Z_n checkerboard model for n odd is a stack of three anisotropic models.</description>

      <title>Learning by Confusion: The Phase Diagram of the Holstein Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04681v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ the "learning by confusion" technique, an unsupervised machine learning approach for detecting phase transitions, to analyze quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the two-dimensional Holstein model--a fundamental model for electron-phonon interactions on a lattice. Utilizing a convolutional neural network, we conduct a series of binary classification tasks to identify Holstein critical points based on the neural network's learning accuracy. We further evaluate the effectiveness of various training datasets, including snapshots of phonon fields and other measurements resolved in imaginary time, for predicting distinct phase transitions and crossovers. Our results culminate in the construction of the finite-temperature phase diagram of the Holstein model.</description>

      <title>Insulator-Metal Transition and Magnetic Crossover in Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10954v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In-plane magnetic fields offer a relatively unexplored opportunity to alter the band structure of stacks of 2D materials so that they exhibit desired physical properties. Here we show that an in-plane magnetic field combined with a transverse electric field can induce an insulator-metal (IM) transition in bilayer graphene. Our study of the magnetic response reveals that the orbital magnetic susceptibility changes from diamagnetic to paramagnetic around the transition point. We discuss several strategies to observe the IM transition, switch the diamagnetism, and more generally control the band structure of stacked 2D materials at experimentally accessible magnetic fields.</description>
