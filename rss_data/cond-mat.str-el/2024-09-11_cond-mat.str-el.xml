      <title>Theory of Topological Superconductivity and Antiferromagnetic Correlated Insulators in Twisted Bilayer WSe${}_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the very recent discovery of unconventional superconductivity in twisted WSe${}_{2}$ homobilayers at filling $\nu=-1$, considerable interests arise in revealing its mechanism. In this paper, we developed a three-band tight-binding model with non-trivial band topology by direct Wannierization of the low-energy continuum model. Incorporating both onsite Hubbard repulsion and next-nearest-neighbor attraction, we then performed a mean-field analysis of the microscopic model and obtained a phase diagram qualitatively consistent with the experiment results. For zero or weak displacement field, the ground state is a Chern number $C=\pm 2$ topological superconductor in the Altland-Zirnbauer A-class (breaking time-reversal but preserving total $S_z$ symmetry) with inter-valley pairing dominant in $d_{xy}\mp id_{x^2-y^2}$-wave (mixing with a subdominant $p_x\pm i p_y$-wave) component. For a relatively strong displacement field, the ground state is a correlated insulator with $120^\circ$ antiferromagnetic order. Our results provide new insights into the nature of the twisted WSe${}_{2}$ systems and suggest the need for further theoretical and experimental explorations.</description>

      <title>Cascade of strongly correlated quantum states in a partially filled kagome flat band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coulomb interactions among charge carriers that occupy an electronic flat band have a profound impact on the macroscopic properties of materials. At sufficient strength, these interactions can give rise to captivating phenomena such as quantum criticality, Mott-Hubbard states, and unconventional superconductivity. The appearance of these characteristics sensitively depends on the number of electrons occupying the flat band states. In this work, we present experimental evidence obtained from scanning tunneling microscopy measurements for a cascade of strongly correlated states appearing in the partially occupied kagome flat bands of Co$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$Sn whose filling can be controlled by the Fe-doping level $x$. At elevated temperatures ($T\geq16\,K$), we detect a nematic electronic state across a broad doping range $0.05&lt;x&lt;0.25$. The comparison with model calculations reveals that strong Coulomb interactions ($U&gt;100\,$meV) blend the states of two $3d$-orbital derived flat bands and impart a nematic order parameter. This state serves as the parent phase of a strongly correlated phase diagram: At lower temperatures $T&lt;16\,$K, we find spectroscopic evidence for an orbital-selective Mott state enabled by the $3d$-orbital degeneracy of the Co atom. This state can only be detected in samples with ideal Fe doping ($x=0.17$) and descends into pseudogap phases upon electron and hole doping. At $T&lt;8\,$K, the pseudogap phase evolves into another nematic low temperature state. Our observations demonstrate that the electronic ground state of a kagome flat band depends on the complex interplay between strong Coulomb repulsion, $3d$-orbital degeneracy, and flat band filling fraction at different temperatures.</description>

      <title>Low-energy critical behavior in two-dimensional tilted semi-Dirac semimetals driven by fermion-fermion interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Employing the renormalization group approach, we carefully investigate the critical behavior of two-dimensional tilted semi-Dirac semimetals induced by the fermion-fermion interactions in the low-energy regime. After incorporating all one-loop corrections, we derive the coupled RG equations of all related parameters and introduce two distinct strategies, named as Strategy I and Strategy II, to describe different scenarios. A detailed numerical analysis yields several interesting behavior in the low-energy limit. At first, we notice that the fermion-fermion interactions either vanish or diverge in the Strategy I, depending on the initial values of the tilting parameter and the fermionic couplings, whereas these interactions in the Strategy II always diverge at a certain critical energy scale, which is associated with the initial conditions. Next, the microstructural parameter $\alpha$ and the fermion velocity $v_F$ in the Strategy I share the similar behavior with their Strategy II counterparts. It is observed that fermion-fermion interactions lead to an increase in $\alpha$ while driving a decrease in $v_F$. Furthermore, the system can either be attracted by the Gaussian fixed point (GFP) or certain relatively fixed point (RFP) in the Strategy I. However, it always flow towards the RFP in the Strategy II at the lowest-energy limit. These results would provide helpful insights into the studies on observable quantities and phase transitions in the two-dimensional tilted semi-Dirac semimetals and the analogous semimetals.</description>

      <title>Doping Tunable CDW Phase Transition in Bulk 1T-ZrSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tuneable electronic properties in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are essential to further their use in device applications. Here, we present a comprehensive scanning tunnelling microscopy and spectroscopy study of a doping-induced charge density wave (CDW) in semiconducting bulk 1T-ZrSe$_2$. We find that atomic impurities which locally shift the Fermi level ($E_F$) into the conduction band trigger a CDW reconstruction concomitantly to the opening of a gap at $E_F$. Our findings shed new light on earlier photoemission spectroscopy and theoretical studies of bulk 1T-ZrSe$_2$, and provide a local understanding of the electron-doping mediated CDW transition observed in semiconducting TMDs.</description>

      <title>Isometric tensor network optimization for extensive Hamiltonians is free of barren plateaus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.14320v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explain why and numerically confirm that there are no barren plateaus in the energy optimization of isometric tensor network states (TNS) for extensive Hamiltonians with finite-range interactions which are, for example, typical in condensed matter physics. Specifically, we consider matrix product states (MPS) with open boundary conditions, tree tensor network states (TTNS), and the multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA). MERA are isometric by construction and, for the MPS and TTNS, the tensor network gauge freedom allows us to choose all tensors as partial isometries. The variance of the energy gradient, evaluated by taking the Haar average over the TNS tensors, has a leading system-size independent term and decreases according to a power law in the bond dimension. For a hierarchical TNS (TTNS and MERA) with branching ratio $b$, the variance of the gradient with respect to a tensor in layer $\tau$ scales as $(b\eta)^\tau$, where $\eta$ is the second largest eigenvalue of a Haar-average doubled layer-transition channel and decreases algebraically with increasing bond dimension. The absence of barren plateaus substantiates that isometric TNS are a promising route for an efficient quantum-computation-based investigation of strongly-correlated quantum matter. The observed scaling properties of the gradient amplitudes bear implications for efficient TNS initialization procedures.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Mysteries of GdRu$_2$Si$_2$: The Impact of Interlayer Coupling on The Magnetic Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: GdRu$_2$Si$_2$ has recently drawn significant attention as a centrosymmetric magnet capable of hosting a short period skyrmion square lattice (SkL) in the absence of Dzyaloshinskii Moriya interaction (DMI). In this system, Gd atoms are arranged on a square lattice forming 2D layers separated by the Ru-Si network in the out-of-plane direction. In the low T regime, the ground state for zero/smaller external magnetic field ($\vec{B}_\perp$) along the out-of-plane direction is a single helical state, characterized by one modulation vector $\vec{Q}$ along one of the in-plane directions of the square lattice. For some critical range of higher $\vec{B}_\perp$, the helical state transforms into a SkL state that can be viewed as the overlap of two helical states defined with $\vec{Q}$ vectors in two in-plane directions, with the same magnitude of $\vec{Q}$ as for the single helical state. So far in the literature, importance has been given to this in-plane $\vec{Q}$ vector in understanding the magnetic phases of the system, considering the out-of-plane magnetic coupling to be weak, which therefore has been ignored. Our calculation of the Gd-Gd magnetic exchange interactions ($J_{ij}$) however shows the strongest $J_{ij}$ to occur between second neighbour Gd atoms along the [111] body-diagonal direction of the unit cell. This along with the body-centred tetragonal structure of the Gd sublattice points to the presence of a hitherto ignored modulation vector, $\vec{Q}_{[111]}$, along the [111] direction in the helical ground state. Atomistic Spin Dynamics (ASD) simulations show the importance of this interaction. This interlayer modulation vector $\vec{Q}_{[111]}$, along with the intralayer $\vec{Q}_{[100]}$, determines the total magnetic ordering of the system. Our data shows that the magnetic phases in GdRu$_2$Si$_2$ are far more complex than what has been previously discussed.</description>

      <title>Wavefunction approach to the fractional anomalous Hall crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose fractional anomalous Hall crystals (FAHCs) as possible ground states of strongly interacting electrons in parent bands with Berry curvature. FAHCs are exotic states of matter that spontaneously break continuous translation symmetry to form a fractional Chern insulator. We construct a unified family of variational wavefunctions that describe FAHCs and their competing states in the presence of uniform parent Berry curvature. We calculate their variational energy with Coulomb interactions semi-analytically in the thermodynamic limit. Our analysis reveals that FAHCs can be energetically favorable over both Wigner crystals and integer anomalous Hall crystals for sufficiently strong interactions or flat dispersion.</description>

      <title>Experimental Demonstration of Break-Even for the Compact Fermionic Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The utility of solving the Fermi-Hubbard model has been estimated in the billions of dollars. Digital quantum computers can in principle address this task, but have so far been limited to quasi one-dimensional models. This is because of exponential overheads caused by the interplay of noise and the non-locality of the mapping between fermions and qubits. Here, we show experimentally that a recently developed local encoding can overcome this problem. We develop a new compilation scheme, called "corner hopping", that reduces the cost of simulating fermionic hopping by 42% which allows us to conduct the largest digital quantum simulations of a fermionic model to date, using a trapped ion quantum computer to prepare adiabatically the ground state of a 6 x 6 spinless Fermi-Hubbard model encoded in 48 physical qubits. We also develop two new error mitigation schemes for systems with conserved quantities, one based on local postselection and one on extrapolation of local observables. Our results suggest that Fermi-Hubbard models beyond classical simulability can be addressed by digital quantum computers without large increases in gate fidelity.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Embedding for Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel multi-scale embedding scheme that links conventional QM/MM embedding and bootstrap embedding (BE) to allow simulations of large chemical systems on limited quantum devices. We also propose a mixed-basis BE scheme that facilitates BE calculations on extended systems using classical computers with limited memory resources. Benchmark data suggest the combination of these two strategies as a robust path in attaining the correlation energies of large realistic systems, combining the proven accuracy of BE with chemical and biological systems of interest in a lower computational cost method. Due to the flexible tunability of the resource requirements and systematic fragment construction, future developments in the realization of quantum computers naturally offer improved accuracy for multi-scale BE calculations.</description>

      <title>Realization of giant elastocaloric cooling at cryogenic temperatures in TmVO$_4$ via a strain load/unload technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The adiabatic elastocaloric effect relates changes in the strain that a material experiences to resulting changes in its temperature. While elastocaloric materials have been utilized for cooling in room temperature applications, the use of such materials for cryogenic cooling remains relatively unexplored. Here, we use a strain load/unload technique at low temperatures, similar to those employed at room-temperature, to demonstrate a large cooling effect in TmVO$_4$. For strain changes of $1.8 \cdot 10^{-3}$, the inferred cooling reaches approximately 50% of the material's starting temperature at 5 K, justifying the moniker "giant". Beyond establishing the suitability of this class of material for cryogenic elastocaloric cooling, these measurements also provide additional insight to the entropy landscape in the material as a function of strain and temperature, including the behavior proximate to the quadrupolar phase transition.</description>

      <title>Theoretical study on the crystal structure of a bilayer nickel-oxychloride Sr$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Cl$_2$ and analysis on the occurrence of possible unconventional superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity under high pressure with $T_c$ exceeding 80 K in a bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has led to a strong desire to realize similar high $T_c$ phenomena at ambient pressure. As one possible path toward realizing superconductivity at ambient pressure, we here propose to consider Sr$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Cl$_2$ as a possible candidate. In this study, we theoretically investigate the electronic structure of Sr$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Cl$_2$ and its structural stability. Our phonon calculation shows that this compound with the $I4/mmm$ tetragonal structure is dynamically stable even at ambient pressure. The characteristic crystal field in this compound lowers the Ni-$d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbital energy, by which the Ni-$d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbital becomes rather closer to the half-filling in Sr$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Cl$_2$ than La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. As a result, we find that superconductivity is enhanced even though a relatively strong orbital hybridization between the $t_{2g}$ and $e_g$ orbitals is somewhat detrimental for superconductivity. We also check the formation enthalpy, which shows that the high-pressure synthesis can be a good way to actually produce Sr$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Cl$_2$. We find that Sr$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Cl$_2$ is a promising new candidate of bilayer-nickelate superconductors, which can possess even higher $T_c$ than pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, at ambient pressure.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous symmetry breaking in a $SO(3)$ non-Abelian lattice gauge theory in $2+1$D with quantum algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The simulation of various properties of quantum field theories is rapidly becoming a testing ground for demonstrating the prowess of quantum algorithms. Some examples include the preparation of ground states, as well as the investigation of various simple wave packets relevant for scattering phenomena. In this work, we study the ability of quantum algorithms to prepare ground states in a matter-free non-Abelian $SO(3)$ lattice gauge theory in $2+1$D in a phase where the global charge conjugation symmetry is spontaneously broken. This is challenging for two reasons: the necessity of dealing with a large Hilbert space for gauge theories compared to that of quantum spin models, and the closing of the gap between the two ground states which becomes exponentially small as a function of the volume. To deal with the large Hilbert space of gauge fields, we demonstrate how the exact imposition of the non-Abelian Gauss Law in the rishon representation of the quantum link operator significantly reduces the degrees of freedom. Further, to resolve the gap, we introduce symmetry-guided ans\"{a}tze in the Gauss-Law-resolved basis for trial states as the starting point for the quantum algorithms to prepare the two lowest energy states. In addition to simulation results for a range of two-dimensional system sizes, we also provide experimental results from the trapped-ion-based quantum hardware, IonQ, when working on systems with four quantum links. The experimental/simulation results derived from our theoretical developments indicate the role of metrics--such as the energy and the infidelity--to assess the obtained results.</description>

      <title>Nernst Plateau in the Quantum Limit of Topological Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nernst effect, a transverse electric current induced by a temperature gradient, is a promising tool for revealing emergent phases of condensed matter. We find a Nernst coefficient plateau in low carrier density topological insulators, as a signature of 1D Weyl points in the quantum limit of the weak topological insulator. The plateau height is inversely proportional to the impurity density, suggesting a way to engineer infinitely large Nernst effects. The Nernst plateau also exists in strong topological insulators, at the bottom of the lowest Landau band. We show that these plateaus have been overlooked in the previous experiments and we highlight the experimental conditions to observe them. Our results may inspire more investigations of employing anomalous Nernst effect to identify emergent phases of condensed matter.</description>

      <title>Uncovering Quantum Many-body Scars with Quantum Machine Learning</title>

Abstract: Quantum many-body scars are rare eigenstates hidden within the chaotic spectra of many-body systems, representing a weak violation of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH). Identifying these scars, as well as other non-thermal states in complex quantum systems, remains a significant challenge. Besides exact scar states, the nature of other non-thermal states lacking simple analytical characterization remains an open question. In this study, we employ tools from quantum machine learning -- specifically, quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs), to explore hidden non-thermal states in chaotic many-body systems. Our simulations demonstrate that QCNNs achieve over 99% single-shot measurement accuracy in identifying all known scars. Furthermore, we successfully identify new non-thermal states in models such as the xorX model, the PXP model, and the far-coupling Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. In the xorX model, some of these non-thermal states can be approximately described as spin-wave modes of specific quasiparticles. We further develop effective tight-binding Hamiltonians within the quasiparticle subspace to capture key features of these many-body eigenstates. Finally, we validate the performance of QCNNs on IBM quantum devices, achieving single-shot measurement accuracy exceeding 63% under real-world noise and errors, with the aid of error mitigation techniques. Our results underscore the potential of QCNNs to uncover hidden non-thermal states in quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Ab initio Green's functions approach for homogeneous nuclear matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Homogeneous nuclear matter is investigated using the \textit{ab initio} Self-consistent Green's function (SCGF) approach with nuclear interactions based on chiral effective field theory. The employed method, which combines the state-of-the-art algebraic diagrammatic construction approximation at third order with Gorkov correlations, is capable of computing both the equation of state (EOS) and single-particle properties of nuclear matter. The EOS calculated with our approach and coupled-cluster theory are shown to agree very well. The one-nucleon spectral functions and the momentum distributions are discussed to gain insights into the dynamics of the interacting nuclear matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.02501v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Twisted homobilayer transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) offers a versatile platform for exploring band topology, interaction-driven phases, and magnetic orders. We study the interaction-driven phases in twisted TMD homobilayers and their low-energy collective excitations, focusing on the effect of band topology on magnetism and its thermal stability. From Hartree-Fock theory of the continuum model, we identify several magnetic and topological phases. By tuning the displacement field, we find two phase transitions involving a change in topology and magnetism respectively. We analyze the magnon spectrum, revealing the crucial role of band topology in stabilizing 2D ferromagnetism by amplifying easy-axis magnetic anisotropy, resulting in a large magnon gap of up to 7meV. As the magnon gap is directly tied to the stability of the magnetic phase to thermal fluctuations, our findings have several important experimental implications.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial summation of Feynman diagrams: Equation of state of the 2D SU(N) Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13774v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Feynman's diagrammatic series is a common language for a formally exact theoretical description of systems of infinitely-many interacting quantum particles, as well as a foundation for precision computational techniques. Here we introduce a universal framework for efficient summation of connected or skeleton Feynman diagrams for generic quantum many-body systems. It is based on an explicit combinatorial construction of the sum of the integrands by dynamic programming, at a computational cost that can be made only exponential in the diagram order on a classical computer and potentially polynomial on a quantum computer. We illustrate the technique by an unbiased diagrammatic Monte Carlo calculation of the equation of state of the $2D$ $SU(N)$ Hubbard model in an experimentally relevant regime, which has remained challenging for state-of-the-art numerical methods.</description>

Abstract: Determining the optical and electronic properties of strongly anisotropic materials with symmetries below orthorhombic remains challenging; generalized ellipsometry is a powerful technique in this regard. Here, we employ Mueller matrix spectroscopic and temperature-dependent ellipsometry to determine the frequency dependence of six components of the dielectric-function tensor of the two-dimensional charge-transfer salt $\alpha$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$I$_3$ across its metal-insulator transition. Our results offer valuable insights into temperature-dependent changes of the components of the spectroscopic dielectric-function tensor across the metal-insulator transition. This advanced method allows extension to other electronic transitions.</description>

      <title>Helical Luttinger liquid on a space-time lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10828v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Luttinger model is a paradigm for the breakdown due to interactions of the Fermi liquid description of one-dimensional massless Dirac fermions. Attempts to discretize the model on a one-dimensional lattice have failed to reproduce the established bosonization results, because of the fermion-doubling obstruction: A local and symmetry-preserving discretization of the Hamiltonian introduces a spurious second species of low-energy excitations, while a nonlocal discretization opens a single-particle gap at the Dirac point. Here we show how to work around this obstruction, by discretizing both space and time to obtain a \textit{local} Lagrangian for a helical Luttinger liquid with Hubbard interaction. The approach enables quantum Monte Carlo simulations that preserve the topological protection of an unpaired Dirac cone.</description>

      <title>Two-step growth of high-quality single crystals of the Kitaev magnet $\alpha$-RuCl$_{3}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The layered honeycomb magnet $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ is the most promising candidate for a Kitaev quantum spin liquid (KQSL) that can host charge-neutral Majorana fermions. Recent studies have shown significant sample dependence of thermal transport properties, which are a key probe of Majorana quasiparticles in the KQSL state, highlighting the importance of preparing high-quality single crystals of $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. Here, we present a relatively simple and reliable method to grow high-quality single crystals of $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. We use a two-step crystal growth method consisting of a purification process by chemical vapor transport (CVT) and a main crystal growth process by sublimation. The obtained crystals exhibit a distinct first-order structural phase transition from the monoclinic ($C2/m$) to the rhombohedral ($R\bar{3}$) structure at $\sim150$ K, which is confirmed by the nuclear quadrupole resonance spectra with much sharper widths than previously reported. The Raman spectra show the absence of defect-induced modes, supporting the good crystallinity of our samples. The jumps in the thermal expansion coefficient and specific heat at the antiferromagnetic (AFM) transition at 7.6-7.7 K are larger and sharper than those of previous samples grown by the CVT and Bridgman methods and do not show any additional AFM transitions at 10-14 K due to stacking faults. The longitudinal thermal conductivity in the AFM phase is significantly larger than previously reported, indicating a very long mean free path of heat carriers. All the results indicate that our single crystals are of superior quality with good crystallinity and few stacking faults, which provides a suitable platform for studying the Kitaev physics.</description>

      <title>Six magnetization plateau phases in a spin-1/2 distorted kagome antiferromagnet: application to $\rm{Y}_3\rm{Cu}_9(\rm{OH})_{19}\rm{Cl}_8$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17207v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recently discovered kagome antiferromagnet $\rm{Y}_3\rm{Cu}_9(\rm{OH})_{19}\rm{Cl}_8$ has attracted significant interest due to its unique kagome lattice structure and magnetic properties. The kagome lattice has three types of exchange interactions: one hexagonal coupling and two different triangular couplings. Previous studies have shown that its ground state is significantly different from that predicted for the undistorted kagome lattice, forming a coplanar spin state with a commensurate magnetic wave vector ${\mathbf Q}=(1/3,1/3)$.
  Two separate studies have proposed distinct sets of exchange interaction parameters for this compound.
  In this study, we investigate the ground state of the spin-1/2 Heisenberg kagome model with three types of nearest-neighbor exchange interactions under a magnetic field by exact diagonalization using the Lanczos method. We reveal that clear magnetization plateaus at $M/M_{\rm sat}$=1/3, 5/9, and 7/9 are present under both parameter sets, which are identified as magnon crystal states based on their spin structures.
  Our findings suggest that these plateaus could potentially be experimentally confirmed with magnetization measurements on $\rm{Y}_3\rm{Cu}_9(\rm{OH})_{19}\rm{Cl}_8$ under a magnetic field of approximately 300 T, achievable with state-of-the-art magnetic field generators. In order to get a deeper understanding of magnetism of $\rm{Y}_3\rm{Cu}_9(\rm{OH})_{19}\rm{Cl}_8$, we perform additional calculations by varying these interactions. Consequently, we discover additional plateau phases at $M/M_{\rm sat}$=1/3, 5/9, and 7/9, each distinctly different from the magnon crystal states.</description>

      <title>Topological pairing of composite fermions via criticality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09050v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) at the filling factor with an even denominator, 5/2, occurs despite the expectation, due to the electron statistics, that the denominator must be an odd number. It is believed that the Cooper pairing of underlying quasiparticles, composite fermions (CFs), leads to the explanation of this effect. Such a state should have a Pfaffian form of the BCS wave function (due to the absence of spin) and non-Abelian statistics of possible vortex-like excitations (due to the $p$-wave nature of the pairing). Here we expose the origin of pairing by using the effective dipole representation of the problem and show that pairing is encoded in a Hamiltonian that describes the interaction of the charge density with dipoles i.e. the current of CFs. The necessary condition for the paired state to exist is the effective dipole physics at the Fermi level as a consequence of the non-trivial topology of the ideal band in which electrons live - a Landau level (LL); the paired state is a resolution of the unstable, critical behaviour characterized by the distancing of correlation hole with respect to electron (and thus dipole) at the Fermi level due to the topology. We describe analytically this deconfined critical point, at which deconfinement of Majorana neutral fermions takes place. In the presence of large, short-range repulsive interaction inside a LL, the critical behavior may be stabilized into a regularized Fermi-liquid-like (FLL) state, like the one that characterizes the physics in the lowest LL (LLL), but in general, for an interaction with slowly decaying pseudopotentials, the system is prone to pairing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum magnetic materials can provide explicit realizations of paradigm models in quantum many-body physics. In this context, SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$ is a faithful realization of the Shastry-Sutherland model (SSM) for ideally frustrated spin dimers, even displaying several of its quantum magnetic phases as a function of pressure. We perform inelastic neutron scattering (INS) measurements on SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$ at 5.5 GPa and 4.5 K, observing spin waves that characterize the high-pressure antiferromagnetic phase. The experimental spectra are well described by linear spin-wave calculations on a SSM with an inter-layer interaction, which is determined accurately as $J_c = 0.053(3)$ meV. The presence of $J_c$ indicates the need to account for the three-dimensional nature of SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$ in theoretical models, also at lower pressures. We find that the ratio between in-plane interactions, $J'/J = 1.8(2)$, undergoes a dramatic change compared to lower pressures that we deduce is driven by a sharp drop in the dimer coupling, $J$. Our results underline the wide horizons opened by high-pressure INS experiments on quantum magnetic materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14822v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the effect of acoustic phonons on the photocurrent and the spectral characteristics of a simplified photovoltaic setup made of Mott insulating layers between two metallic leads among which a bias voltage is applied. We include acoustic phonons via the Migdal approximation and we use real-space Floquet dynamical mean-field theory to address the nonequilibrium Floquet steady-state. The so-called auxiliary master equation approach is employed as impurity solver. We find that impact ionization is only weakly affected by dissipation by acoustic phonons at low bias voltages. For higher biases instead, the Hartree shift considerably alters the on-site energies of the Hubbard bands and suppresses the photocurrent for intermediate electron-phonon coupling strengths. Impact ionization processes play a fundamental role in enhancing the electrical output power, which decreases when electron-phonon interaction is considered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03048v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum one-dimensional systems in their ordered phase admit kinks as elementary excitations above their symmetry-broken vacua. While the scattering properties of the kinks resemble those of quasiparticles, they have distinct locality features that are manifest in their entanglement content. In this work, we study the entanglement entropy of kink excitations. We first present detailed calculations for specific states of a spin-1/2 chain to highlight the salient features of these excitations. Second, we provide a field-theoretic framework based on the algebraic relations between the twist fields and the semilocal fields associated with the excitations, and we compute the R\'enyi entropies in this framework. We obtain universal predictions for the entropy difference between the excited states with a finite number of kinks and the symmetry-broken ground states, which do not depend on the microscopic details of the model in the limit of large regions. Finally, we discuss some consequences of the Kramers-Wannier duality, which relates the ordered and disordered phases of the Ising model, and we explain why, counterintuitively, no explicit relations between those phases are found at the level of entanglement.</description>

Abstract: We develop a comprehensive framework for realizing anyon condensation of topological orders within the string-net model by constructing a Hamiltonian that bridges the parent string-net model before and the child string-net model after anyon condensation. Our approach classifies all possible types of bosonic anyon condensation in any parent string-net model and identifies the basic degrees of freedom in the corresponding child models. Compared with the traditional UMTC perspective of topological orders, our method offers a finer categorical description of anyon condensation at the microscopic level. We also explicitly represent relevant UMTC categorical entities characterizing anyon condensation through our model-based physical quantities, providing practical algorithms for calculating these categorical data.</description>

      <title>Quantum phases of hardcore bosons with repulsive dipolar density-density interactions on two-dimensional lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10632v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyse the ground-state quantum phase diagram of hardcore Bosons interacting with repulsive dipolar potentials. The bosons dynamics is described by the extended-Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian on a two-dimensional lattice. The ground state results from the interplay between the lattice geometry and the long-range interactions, which we account for by means of a classical spin mean-field approach limited by the size of the considered unit cells. This extended classical spin mean-field theory accounts for the long-range density-density interaction without truncation. We consider three different lattice geometries: square, honeycomb, and triangular. In the limit of zero hopping the ground state is always a devil's staircase of solid (gapped) phases. Such crystalline phases with broken translational symmetry are robust with respect to finite hopping amplitudes. At intermediate hopping amplitudes, these gapped phases melt, giving rise to various lattice supersolid phases, which can have exotic features with multiple sublattice densities. At sufficiently large hoppings the ground state is a superfluid. The stability of phases predicted by our approach is gauged by comparison to the known quantum phase diagrams of the Bose-Hubbard model with nearest-neighbour interactions as well as quantum Monte Carlo simulations for the dipolar case on the square and triangular lattice. Our results are of immediate relevance for experimental realisations of self-organised crystalline ordering patterns in analogue quantum simulators, e.g., with ultracold dipolar atoms in an optical lattice.</description>

      <title>Replica symmetry breaking in spin glasses in the replica-free Keldysh formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05842v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the algebra of Parisi ultrametric matrices is recovered by the real-time, replica-free, Dyson-Keldysh equations of infinite-range quantum spin glasses in the late time glassy limit. This connects to earlier results on classical and quantum systems showing how ultrametricity emerges from the persistent slow aging dynamics of the glass phase. The stationary spin glass state thereby spontaneously breaks thermal symmetry, or the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger relation of a state in global thermal equilibrium. We describe the Keldysh path integral of the infinite-range Ising model in transverse and longitudinal fields, and in the context of the Landau expansion of the action functional, show how the long-time limit connects to the full replica symmetry breaking obtained in the equilibrium formalism. We also illustrate our formalism by applying it to the spherical quantum $p$-spin model, which only exhibits one-step replica symmetry breaking</description>

      <title>Decomposition of multilayer superconductivity with interlayer pairing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that multilayer superconductivity with interlayer pairing may naturally decompose into a series of weakly-coupled bilayer and trilayer superconducting blocks in order to minimize its total free energy. Our work is motivated by the recent proposal of interlayer pairing induced by the interlayer superexchange interaction of nearly half-filled $d_{z^2}$ orbitals in the bilayer and trilayer nickelate superconductors. We explore general properties of interlayer pairing superconductivity and perform systematic Ginzburg-Landau analyses of an effective multilayer model. For real materials, our results imply strong superconducting order parameter modulation and short coherence length along the $z$-axis (perpendicular to the layers). This reveals a unique feature of multilayer superconductivity with interlayer pairing and provides a basic framework for future experimental and theoretical investigations.</description>

      <title>Localized RG flows on composite defects and $\mathcal{C}$-theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a composite defect system where a lower-dimensional defect (sub-defect) is embedded to a higher-dimensional one, and examine renormalization group (RG) flows localized on the defect. A composite defect is constructed in the $(3-\epsilon)$-dimensional free $\text{O}(N)$ vector model with line and surface interactions by triggering localized RG flows to non-trivial IR fixed points. Focusing on the case where the symmetry group $\text{O}(N)$ is broken to a subgroup $\text{O}(m)\times\text{O}(N-m)$ on the line defect, there is an $\text{O}(N)$ symmetric fixed point for all $N$, while two additional $\text{O}(N)$ symmetry breaking ones appear for $N\ge 23$. We also examine a $\mathcal{C}$-theorem for localized RG flows along the sub-defect and show that the $\mathcal{C}$-theorem holds in our model by perturbative calculations.</description>
