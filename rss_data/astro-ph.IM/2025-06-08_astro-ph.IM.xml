      <title>Exoplaneteers Keep Overestimating Sigma Significances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astronomers, and in particular exoplaneteers, have a curious habit of expressing Bayes factors as frequentist sigma values. This is of course completely unnecessary and arguably rather ill-advised. Regardless, the practice is common - especially in the detection claims of chemical species within exoplanet atmospheres. The current canonical conversion strategy stems from a statistics paper from Sellke et al. (2001), who derived an upper bound on the Bayes factor between the test and null hypotheses, as a function of the $p$-value (or number of sigmas, $n_{\sigma}$). A common practice within the exoplanet atmosphere community is to numerically invert this formula, going from a Bayes factor to $n_\sigma$. This goes back to Benneke &amp; Seager (2013) -- a highly cited paper that introduced Bayesian model comparison as a means of inferring the presence of specific chemical species -- in an attempt to calibrate the Bayes factors from their technique for a community that in 2013 was more familiar with frequentist sigma significances. However, as originally noted by Sellke et al. (2001), the conversion only provides an upper limit on $n_\sigma$, with the true value generally being lower. This can result in inflations of claimed detection significances, and this note strongly urges the community to stop converting to $n_\sigma$ at all and simply stick with Bayes factors.</description>

      <title>The Online Data Filter for the KM3NeT Neutrino Telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The KM3NeT research infrastructure comprises two neutrino telescopes located in the deep waters of the Mediterranean Sea, namely ORCA and ARCA. KM3NeT/ORCA is designed for the measurement of neutrino properties and KM3NeT/ARCA for the detection of high\nobreakdashes-energy neutrinos from the cosmos. Neutrinos are indirectly detected using three\nobreakdashes-dimensional arrays of photo\nobreakdashes-sensors which detect the Cherenkov light that is produced when relativistic charged particles emerge from a neutrino interaction. The analogue pulses from the photo\nobreakdashes-sensors are digitised offshore and all digital data are sent to a station on shore where they are processed in real time using a farm of commodity servers and custom software. In this paper, the design and performance of the software that is used to filter the data are presented. The performance of the data filter is evaluated in terms of its purity, capacity and efficiency. The purity is measured by a comparison of the event rate caused by muons produced by cosmic ray interactions in the Earth's atmosphere with the event rate caused by the background from decays of radioactive elements in the sea water and bioluminescence. The capacity is measured by the minimal number of servers that is needed to sustain the rate of incoming data. The efficiency is measured by the effective volumes of the sensor arrays.</description>

      <title>Simulation-based inference with neural posterior estimation applied to X-ray spectral fitting II -- High-resolution spectroscopy with the X-ray Integral Field Unit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray spectral fitting in high-energy astrophysics can be reliably accelerated using Machine Learning. In particular, Simulation-based Inference (SBI) produces accurate posterior distributions in the Gaussian and Poisson regime for low-resolution spectra, much faster than other exact approaches such as Monte Carlo Markov Chains or Nested Sampling. We now aim to highlight the capabilities of SBI for high-resolution spectra, as what will be provided by the newAthena X-ray Integral Field Unit (X-IFU). The large number of channels encourages us to use compressed representations of the spectra, taking advantage of the likelihood-free inference aspect of SBI. Two compression schemes are explored, using either simple summary statistics, such as the counts in arbitrary bins or ratios between these bins. We benchmark the efficiency of these approaches using simulated X-IFU spectra with various spectral models, including smooth comptonised spectra, relativistic reflexion models and plasma emission models. We find that using simple and meaningful summary statistics is much more efficient than working directly with the full spectrum, and can derive posterior distributions comparable to those from exact computation using nested sampling. Multi-round inference converges quickly to the good solution. Amortized single round inference requires more simulations, hence longer training time, but can be used to infer model parameters from many observations afterwards. Information from the emission lines must be accounted for using dedicated summary statistics. SBI for X-ray spectral fitting is a robust technique that delivers well calibrated posteriors. This approach shows great promises for high-resolution spectra, offering its potential for the scientific exploitation of the X-IFU. We now plan to apply it to the current era of high-resolution telescopes, and further challenge this approach with real data.</description>

      <title>DART-Vetter: A Deep LeARning Tool for automatic triage of exoplanet candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the identification of new planetary candidates in transit surveys, the employment of Deep Learning models proved to be essential to efficiently analyse a continuously growing volume of photometric observations. To further improve the robustness of these models, it is necessary to exploit the complementarity of data collected from different transit surveys such as NASA's Kepler, Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), and, in the near future, the ESA PLAnetary Transits and Oscillation of stars (PLATO) mission. In this work, we present a Deep Learning model, named DART-Vetter, able to distinguish planetary candidates (PC) from false positives signals (NPC) detected by any potential transiting survey. DART-Vetter is a Convolutional Neural Network that processes only the light curves folded on the period of the relative signal, featuring a simpler and more compact architecture with respect to other triaging and/or vetting models available in the literature. We trained and tested DART-Vetter on several dataset of publicly available and homogeneously labelled TESS and Kepler light curves in order to prove the effectiveness of our model. Despite its simplicity, DART-Vetter achieves highly competitive triaging performance, with a recall rate of 91% on an ensemble of TESS and Kepler data, when compared to Exominer and Astronet-Triage. Its compact, open source and easy to replicate architecture makes DART-Vetter a particularly useful tool for automatizing triaging procedures or assisting human vetters, showing a discrete generalization on TCEs with Multiple Event Statistic (MES) &gt; 20 and orbital period &lt; 50 days.</description>

      <title>The TESS Ten Thousand Catalog: 10,001 uniformly-vetted and -validated Eclipsing Binary Stars detected in Full-Frame Image data by machine learning and analyzed by citizen scientists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has surveyed nearly the entire sky in Full-Frame Image mode with a time resolution of 200 seconds to 30 minutes and a temporal baseline of at least 27 days. In addition to the primary goal of discovering new exoplanets, TESS is exceptionally capable at detecting variable stars, and in particular short-period eclipsing binaries which are relatively common, making up a few percent of all stars, and represent powerful astrophysical laboratories for deep investigations of stellar formation and evolution. We combed Sectors 1-82 of TESS Full-Frame Image data searching for eclipsing binary stars using a neural network that identified ~1.2 million stars with eclipse-like features. Of these, we have performed an in-depth analysis on ~60,000 targets using automated methods and manual inspection by citizen scientists. Here we present a catalog of 10001 uniformly-vetted and -validated eclipsing binary stars that passed all our ephemeris and photocenter tests, as well as complementary visual inspection. Of these, 7936 are new eclipsing binaries while the remaining 2065 are known systems for which we update the published ephemerides. We outline the detection and analysis of the targets, discuss the properties of the sample, and highlight potentially interesting systems. Finally, we also provide a list of ~900,000 unvetted and unvalidated targets for which the neural network found eclipse-like features with a score higher than 0.9, and for which there are no known eclipsing binaries within a sky-projected separation of a TESS pixel (~21 arcsec).</description>

      <title>Search for Lorentz Invariance Violation with spectral lags of GRB 190114C using profile likelihood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We search for Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) using the spectral lag data for GRB 190114C using frequentist analysis, where we deal with the astrophysical nuisance parameters using profile likelihood. For this use case, we find a global minima for the $\chi^2$ as a function of energy scale of LIV ($E_{QG}$), well below the Planck scale. The best-fit $2\sigma$ central intervals for $E_{QG}$ are given by $2.81^{+0.96}_{-0.72}\times 10^{14}$ GeV and $9.10^{+2.59}_{-0.64}\times 10^{5}$ for linear and quadratic LIV, respectively and agree with the Bayesian estimates hitherto obtained in a previous work. Therefore, the results from frequentist analysis GRB 190114C agrees with Bayesian analysis and presents yet another proof of principles applications of profile likelihood in the search for LIV.</description>

      <title>Mapping correlations and coherence: adjacency-based approach to data visualization and regularity discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of science has been transforming man's view towards nature for centuries. Observing structures and patterns in an effective approach to discover regularities from data is a key step toward theory-building. With increasingly complex data being obtained, revealing regularities systematically has become a challenge. Correlation is a most commonly-used and effective approach to describe regularities in data, yet for complex patterns, spatial inhomogeneity and complexity can often undermine the correlations. We present an algorithm to derive maps representing the type and degree of correlations, by taking the two-fold symmetry of the correlation vector into full account using the Stokes parameter. The method allows for a spatially resolved view of the nature and strength of correlations between physical quantities. In the correlation view, a region can often be separated into different subregions with different types of correlations. Subregions correspond to physical regimes for physical systems, or climate zones for climate maps. The simplicity of the method makes it widely applicable to a variety of data, where the correlation-based approach makes the map particularly useful in revealing regularities in physical systems and alike. As a new and efficient approach to represent data, the method should facilitate the development of new computational approaches to regularity discovery.</description>

Abstract: Physics has been transforming our view of nature for centuries. While combining physical knowledge with computational approaches has enabled detailed modeling of physical systems' evolution, understanding the emergence of patterns and structures remains limited. Correlations between quantities are the most reliable approach to describe relationships between different variables. However, for complex patterns, directly searching for correlations is often impractical, as complexity and spatial inhomogeneity can obscure correlations. We discovered that the key is to search for correlations in local regions and developed a new method, adjacent correlation analysis, to extract such correlations and represent them in phase space. When multiple observations are available, a useful way to study a system is to analyze distributions in phase space using the Probability Density Function (PDF). Adjacent correlation analysis evaluates vectors representing local correlations, which can be overlaid on the PDF plot to form the adjacent correlation plot. These correlation vectors often exhibit remarkably regular patterns and may lead to the discovery of new laws. The vectors we derive are equivalent to the vector field in dynamical systems on the attracting manifold. By efficiently representing spatial patterns as correlation vectors in phase space, our approach opens avenues for classification, prediction, parameter fitting, and forecasting.</description>

      <title>MatBYIB: A Matlab-based code for Bayesian inference of extreme mass-ratio inspiral binary with arbitrary eccentricity</title>

Abstract: Accurate parameter estimation(PE) of gravitational waves(GW) is essential for GW data analysis. In extreme mass-ratio inspiral binary(EMRI) systems, orbital eccentricity is a critical parameter for PE. However, current software for for PE of GW often neglects the direct estimation of orbital eccentricity. To fill this gap, we have developed the MatBYIB, a MATLAB-based software package for PE of GW with arbitrary eccentricity. The MatBYIB employs the Analytical Kludge (AK) waveform as a computationally efficient signal generator and computes parameter uncertainties via the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) and the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). For Bayesian inference, we implement the Metropolis-Hastings (M-H) algorithm to derive posterior distributions. To guarantee convergence, the Gelman-Rubin convergence criterion (the Potential Scale Reduction Factor R) is used to determine sampling adequacy, with MatBYIB dynamically increasing the sample size until R &lt; 1.05 for all parameters. Our results demonstrate strong agreement between FIM- based predictions and full MCMC sampling. This program is user-friendly and allows for estimation of gravitational wave parameters with arbitrary eccentricity on standard personal computers.</description>

      <title>Multilevel neural simulation-based inference</title>

Abstract: Neural simulation-based inference (SBI) is a popular set of methods for Bayesian inference when models are only available in the form of a simulator. These methods are widely used in the sciences and engineering, where writing down a likelihood can be significantly more challenging than constructing a simulator. However, the performance of neural SBI can suffer when simulators are computationally expensive, thereby limiting the number of simulations that can be performed. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to neural SBI which leverages multilevel Monte Carlo techniques for settings where several simulators of varying cost and fidelity are available. We demonstrate through both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments that our method can significantly enhance the accuracy of SBI methods given a fixed computational budget.</description>

      <title>Metasurface-Enabled Astronomical Polarimetry</title>

Abstract: In the last decade or so, metasurface optical components have received considerable scientific and industrial interest for a variety of applications. The miniaturization afforded by metasurfaces could benefit astronomy in particular (which is an often-cited potential application area for metasurfaces). However, few developed examples in which metasurface components offer a unique benefit to astronomical instrumentation - substantiated by the production of scientific data - have been shown. Here, we present the Solar Imaging Metasurface Polarimeter (SIMPol), a first-of-its-kind telescope for snapshot imaging polarimetry of the sun around a Sr I line at 460.7 nm enabled by a metasurface polarization-analyzing grating. This high-performance grating exhibits an overall efficiency of nearly 70% and high polarization contrast (diattenuation) across its four observation channels. We demonstrate SIMPol's integration into a major observatory telescope facility with two different imaging modes. In both cases, Zeeman polarization signatures were clearly observed in two adjacent spectral lines of Fe I and Sr I around 460.7 nm. This work demonstrates an early success of metasurface polarization optics in a real application in astronomical instrumentation (here, polarimetric observations of the solar atmosphere), and heralds the application of metasurfaces and emergent nanophotonic technologies in astronomy more broadly.</description>
