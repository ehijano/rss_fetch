      <title>The Atomic Beam Probe Synthetic Diagnostic and its Application in Fusion Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Atomic Beam Probe was installed on the COMPASS tokamak in Prague as an extension of the Beam Emission Spectroscopy. The construction and installation of the diagnostic were preceded by conceptional design and measurements with a test detector. This development work was supported by a trajectory solver, written as a sequential code, called ABPIons, whose shortcomings were discovered early on. For further modeling, orders of magnitude larger numerical performance were required. Therefore, the trajectory calculator has been redesigned and implemented as a GPGPU (general-purpose computing on graphics processing units) code in CUDA C language, which resulted in a performance improvement of three orders of magnitude. The new solver, the Trajectory simulator of ABP Ions with GPU Acceleration (TAIGA), was used to establish the final diagnostics. To aid the improvement of the diagnostics and to design further measurement scenarios, we improved the code and developed a complete synthetic diagnostic. The trajectory solver is an essential tool for designing the ABP. However, a more sophisticated tool was required to consider all essential physical parameters in the simulation. Therefore, we developed the TAIGA-SD synthetic diagnostic, which is the subject of the recent paper.
  In this article, we introduce the concept of the Atomic Beam Probe synthetic diagnostics. We then show the initial input conditions, followed by the trajectory simulator, the mathematical and physical models we used, and the synthetic signal processing. Finally, we present how synthetic diagnostics supported the measurements and what the relation is between the synthetic and the measurement data.</description>

      <title>Magnetic stagnation of two counterstreaming plasma jets induced by intense laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experiments with interacting high-velocity flows of laser plasma can help answer the fundamental questions in plasma physics and improve the understanding of the mechanisms behind astrophysical phenomena, such as formation of collisionless shock waves, deceleration of accretion flows, and evolution of solar (stellar) flares. This work presents the first direct experimental observations of stagnation and redirection of counterstreaming flows (jets) of laser plasma induced by ultra-intense laser pulses with intensity $I \sim$ 2 $\times$ $10^{18}$ $W/cm^2$. Hybrid (PIC - fluid) modeling, which takes into account the kinetic effects of ion motion and the evolution of the pressure tensor for electrons, demonstrates the compression of counterdirected toroidal self-generated magnetic fields embedded in the counterstreaming plasma flows. The enhancement of the toroidal magnetic field in the interaction region results in plasma flow stagnation and redirection of the jets across the line of their initial propagation.</description>

      <title>Electrical charge decay on dielectric surface in nitrogen/C4F7N mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The decay of electrical charge on a dielectric surface in nitrogen-C4F7N (Novec4710, C4) mixtures is investigated using measurement of electric field via in-situ electric field-induced second harmonic (EFISH) technique. The charge is deposited on the surface of the alumina by generating a barrier discharge in the gap, and the amount of charge is determined from electrical current measurements and numerical modeling. For different admixtures (0, 10, and 50 percent) of C4F7N in nitrogen, the presence of surface charge is detected even 60 hours after charge deposition. It is found that C4F7N admixture lead to a significantly longer-lasting surface charge, indicating a slower charge decay. Using an isothermal charge decay model, charge traps are identified for pure nitrogen charge deposition, which are in agreement with results found in the literature. Charge deposition in C4F7N admixtures leads to modification or creation of new traps with higher trap energies. The EFISH measurements are used to determine the C4F7N nonlinear hyperpolarizability tensor component. Direct comparison of the experimental results from two developed methods (EFISH and electrical measurements) and the numerical model gives a closer insight into the surface charge spread over the dielectrics, resulting in surface charge density estimation.</description>

      <title>Characterization of discharge capillaries via benchmarked hydrodynamic plasma simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasma accelerators utilize strong electric fields in plasma waves to accelerate charged particles, making them a compact alternative to radiofrequency technologies. Discharge capillaries are plasma sources used in plasma accelerator research to provide acceleration targets, or as plasma lenses to capture or focus accelerated beams. They have applications for beam-driven and laser-driven plasma accelerators and can sustain high repetition rates for extended periods of time. Despite these advantages, high-fidelity simulations of discharge capillaries remain challenging due to the range of mechanisms involved and the difficulty to diagnose them in experiments. In this work, we utilize hydrodynamic plasma simulations to examine the discharge process of a plasma cell and discuss implications for future accelerator systems. The simulation model is validated with experimental measurements in a 50-mm-long, 1-mm-wide plasma capillary operating a 12-27 kV discharge at 2-12mbar hydrogen pressure. For 20 kV at 8.7mbar the discharge is shown to deposit 178mJ of energy in the plasma. Potential difficulties with the common density measurement method using H{\alpha} emission spectroscopy are discussed. This simulation model enables investigations of repeatability, heat flow management and fine tailoring of the plasma profile with discharges.</description>

      <title>Energy conversion and scaling analysis of relativistic magnetic reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relativistic magnetic reconnection is a key process for accelerating charged particles and producing high-energy radiation. We study this process using relativistic resistive magnetohydrodynamics simulations. Starting with Harris sheet configuration, we study time evolution of reconnection rate and the Alfven four Mach number for outflow. These measurements validate the Sweet-Parker scaling, consistent with previous studies. To study energy conversion processes, we calculate Ohmic dissipation, crucial for understanding how energy is converted between plasma and electromagnetic fields. Decomposing electric field components relative to velocity field, we find that energy conversion is initially dominated by the resistive electric field, but convective electric fields take over as reconnection progresses. Plasma primarily gains energy within the current sheet and near the separatrix. We perform a scan of magnetization for mildly relativistic plasma to examine scaling laws previously derived for non-relativistic inflow. We find the inflow is slower than predicted, due to conversion of magnetic energy mostly into thermal energy, causing strong compressibility. We calculate and verify the scaling of the compressibility factor, providing a more accurate representation of inflow dynamics. We analyze the impact of a guide field on reconnection and energy partition, finding that a stronger guide field reduces the reconnection rate but has minimal effect on the relative distribution of kinetic, magnetic, and thermal energy. Addition of rotating guide field and variations in initial pressure and density have little effect on the energy composition of the outflow, with thermal energy consistently dominating at nearly 90%.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalues and Eigenfunctions of Landau Damping Oscillations in Very Weakly Collisional Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Landau-damped oscillations in collisionless plasmas, described by van Kampen and Case, are quasi-modes, representing a continuous superposition of singular eigenfunctions, not true eigenmodes. Recent work by Ng et al. shows that even rare collisions replace these singular modes with discrete regular modes having complex eigenvalues for the phase velocity (or frequency), approaching Landau eigenvalues in the collisionless limit. We analytically derive approximate expressions for the eigenvalue correction due to rare collisions and for the shape of the eigenfunction describing DF perturbations in velocity space, demonstrating its increasing oscillations in the resonance region as the collision frequency tends to zero. We also obtain approximate expressions for the resonance region's width and peak value, and the oscillation period within it. We validate these analytical results with high-precision numerical calculations using a standard linear matrix eigenvalue problem approach.</description>

      <title>The Dielectric Response of Plasmas with Arbitrary Gyrotropic Velocity Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hot and tenuous plasmas are frequently far from local thermodynamic equilibrium, necessitating sophisticated methods for determining the associated plasma dielectric tensor and normal mode response. The Arbitrary Linear Plasma Solver (\texttt{alps}) is a numerical tool for calculating such responses of plasmas with arbitrary gyrotropic background velocity distribution functions (VDFs). In order to model weakly and moderately damped plasma waves accurately, we have updated to the code to use an improved analytic continuation enabled by a polynomial basis representation. We demonstrate the continuity of solutions to the linear Vlasov--Maxwell dispersion relation between bi-Maxwellian and arbitrary VDF representations and evaluate the influence of VDF structure on mode polarization and wave power emission and absorption.</description>

      <title>Snowplow Model Predictions for Plasma Temperature in Z pinch Discharges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the general framework of the snowplow model, we introduce the equations for computing plasma temperature in Z pinch discharges. We also present expressions to quantify energy transfers in Z pinch discharges. We then apply this methodology to estimate the temperature and energy transfers of a real prototypical experiment and analyze how the plasma temperature behaves under various modifications of the parameters of the prototypical experiment. Among our discoveries we highlight that the temperature of the plasma in the discharges grows linearly with the initial voltage at the capacitor bank. We summarize this and other findings through a single, fairly compact formula.</description>

      <title>Learning Heat Transport Kernels Using a Nonlocal Heat Transport Theory-Informed Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a data-driven framework for the modeling of nonlocal heat transport in plasmas using a nonlocal theory informed neural network trained on kinetic Particle-in-Cell simulations that span both local and nonlocal regimes. The model learns spatiotemporal heat flux kernels directly from simulation data, capturing dynamic transport behaviors beyond the reach of classical formulations. Unlike time-independent kernel models such as Luciani Mora Virmont and Schurtz Nicola\"i Busquet models, our approach yields physically grounded, time-evolving kernels that adapt to varying plasma conditions. The resulting predictions show strong agreement with kinetic benchmarks across regimes. This offers a promising direction for data-driven modeling of nonlocal heat transport and contributes to a deeper understanding of plasma dynamics.</description>

      <title>Fast solvers for Tokamak fluid models with PETSC -- Part I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This report develops the first step in adding multigrid solvers to scientific and engineering-relevant magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) models of Tokamaks. These models are characterized by a distinguished direction in the toroidal coordinate that is partially aligned with the magnetic guide field, which dominates the plasma dynamics. All Tokamak models exploit this structure, for example, NIMROD (https://nimrodteam.org/) uses $2D$, unstructured, high-order finite elements in the poloidal plane with Fourier modes in the toroidal coordinate, and the $3D$, extended MHD code M3D-C1 (https://w3.pppl.gov/~nferraro/m3dc1.html) uses $2D$, unstructured $C^1$ elements in the poloidal plane with cubic Hermite functions in the toroidal direction. This structure suggests adding toroidal semi-coarsening multigrid to the existing solver and thereby reducing reliance on direct solvers, which do not scale optimally and are not well suited to modern hardware that demands extreme levels of parallelism. This report focuses on the velocity solve in M3D-C1, using the PETSC -- the Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation -- numerical library (https://petsc.org), and shows that with little new application code, one-dimensional multigrid is about $5x$ faster than the existing one-level method on an MHD disruption, with runaway electrons, test problem.</description>

      <title>A low-cost plasma source aimed for medical applications using Ar as the working gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Because of the advances in equipment and several studies on medical applications of atmospheric pressure plasmas over the last few years, plasma sources are now being produced for clinical use. It has been demonstrated that plasma sources can be constructed in such a way that their operation and application are safe, and that they present relevant clinical results. However, the manufacturing and operating costs of plasma sources can be decisive for their adoption in medical procedures. In this work, a simple modification of a plasma source that has a low production cost was investigated in order to evaluate the viability of its use for medical applications using argon as the working gas. Without this modification, the plasma source produces high levels of electrical current, which makes it unfeasible for use in medical applications. With the proposed modification, the treatment is no longer carried out using the plasma jet directly, but rather with the post-discharge effluent enriched with reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. As a result, the electrical current reaching the target remains below the safety threshold established for plasma applications in humans. Application tests on water activation indicate that both operating conditions can yield comparable outcomes.</description>

      <title>A general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics extension to mesh-less schemes in the code GIZMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The profound comprehension of the evolution and phenomenology of an Active Galactic Nucleus requires an accurate exploration of the dynamics of the magnetized gaseous disk surrounding the massive black hole in the centre. Many numerical simulations have studied this environment using elaborate grid-based codes, but in recent years, new mesh-less schemes have exhibited excellent conservation properties and good accuracy at a more moderate computational cost. Still, none implement general relativistic magnetic fields, a fundamental ingredient to model an accretion disk around a massive black hole. We present here a general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) scheme working within the mesh-less framework of the code \texttt{GIZMO}. We implement the hyperbolic divergence cleaning procedure, consistently extended to general relativistic effects, to keep the magnetic field divergence under safe levels. We benchmark the scheme against various relativistic magnetohydrodynamics stress tests, considering different dimensionalities and both a Minkowski or a Schwarzchild/Kerr background. To date, this is the first GRMHD scheme working in a mesh-free environment.</description>

      <title>Theory of wakefield in a transversely inhomogeneous plasma waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Theoretical studies have been made into the relativistic drive bunch generation of a wakefield in a cylindrical waveguide filled with a transversely inhomogeneous plasma. According to the model used, the transversely inhomogeneous plasma is considered as a combination of tubular plasma and the plasma background of different density. Analytical expressions have been derived for the excited radial and axial electric field components, and for the azimuthal magnetic field component. The dispersion of the plasma waveguide under study, as well as the topography of the electromagnetic field components of the TM-eigenwaves, resonant with the bunch, have been investigated. Longitudinal and transverse amplitude distribution structures of the axial and radial wakefields have been determined. Spectrum analysis of the longitudinal and transverse wakefields has been performed with the result that their frequency content has been determined.</description>

      <title>Endoreversible Stirling cycles: plasma engines at maximal power</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Endoreversible engine cycles are a cornerstone of finite-time thermodynamics. We show that endoreversible Stirling engines operating with a one-component plasma as working medium run at maximal power output with the Curzon-Ahlborn efficiency. As a main result, we elucidate that this is actually a consequence of the fact that the caloric equation of state depends only linearly on temperature and only additively on volume. In particular, neither the exact form of the mechanical equation of state, nor the full fundamental relation are required. Thus, our findings immediately generalize to a larger class of working plasmas, far beyond simple ideal gases. In addition, we show that for plasmas described by the photonic equation of state the efficiency is significantly lower. This is in stark contrast to endoreversible Otto cycles, for which photonic engines have an efficiency larger than the Curzon-Ahlborn efficiency.</description>

Abstract: Gaia has revealed a variety of substructures in the phase space of stars in the Solar neighborhood, including the vertical `Snail' in $(z,v_z)$ space. Such substructures are often interpreted as the incompletely phase-mixed response of the disc stars to a single perturbation, such as an impulsive encounter with a satellite galaxy. In this paper we consider the possibility that such structures contain manifestations of phase space echoes. First established in plasma physics in the 1960s, echoes arise when a collisionless system is perturbed twice: the macroscopic responses to both perturbations mix to small scales in phase space, whereupon they couple nonlinearly, producing a third macroscopic `echo' response without the need for a third perturbation. We derive the galactic analogue of the plasma echo theory using angle-action variables and apply it to a one-dimensional model of vertical motion in the Milky Way. We verify the predicted echo behavior using idealized test particle simulations, both with and without the inclusion of diffusion through orbital scattering off molecular clouds. While we conclude that the Gaia Snail itself is unlikely a (pure) echo effect, the basic physics we uncover is sufficiently generic that we expect phase-space echoes to be common in disc galaxies.</description>

      <title>Catastrophic Formation of Macro-Scale Flow and Magnetic Fields in the Relativistic Gas of Binary Systems</title>

Abstract: It is shown that a simple quasi-equilibrium analysis of a multi-component plasma can be harnessed to explain catastrophic energy transformations in astrophysical objects. We limit ourselves to the particular class of binary systems for which the typical plasma consists of one classical ion component, and two relativistic electron components - the bulk degenerate electron gas with a small contamination of hot electrons. We derive, analytically, the conditions conducive to such a catastrophic change. The pathway to such sudden changes is created by the slow changes in the initial parameters so that the governing equilibrium state can no longer be sustained and the system must find a new equilibrium that could have vastly different energy mix - of thermal, flow-kinetic and magnetic energies. In one such scenario, macro-scale flow kinetic, and magnetic energies abound in the final state. For the given multi-component plasma, we show that the flow (strongly Super-Alfv\'enic) kinetic energy is mostly carried by the small hot electron component. Under specific conditions, it is possible to generate strong macro-scale magnetic (velocity) field when all of the flow (magnetic) field energy is converted to the magnetic (velocity) field energy at the catastrophe. The analysis is applied to explain various observed characteristics of white dwarf (WD) systems, in particular, of the magnetic and dense/degenerate type.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic radiation by turbulent, magnetized and randomly inhomogeneous solar radio sources generated by electron beams</title>

Abstract: During Type III solar radio bursts, electromagnetic waves are radiated at plasma frequency $\omega_p$ and its harmonics by electrostatic wave turbulence generated by electron beams ejected by Sun in randomly inhomogeneous solar wind and coronal plasmas. These emissions, detected since decades by spacecraft and radiotelescopes, are split by the plasma magnetic field into three modes $\mathcal{X}$, $\mathcal{O}$ and $\mathcal{Z}$ of different dispersion, polarization and radiation properties. This work demonstrates, using three independent and converging approaches, that only a small fraction of electromagnetic energy radiated at $\omega_p$ ($\lesssim10\%$) is escaping from beam-generated radio sources, mainly as $\mathcal{O}$-mode waves and, depending on plasma conditions, as $\mathcal{X}$-mode waves. Most energy is radiated in $\mathcal{Z}$-mode and can therefore be only observed close to sources. Results have major implications for solar radio emission and provide strong support for interpretation of observations performed up to close distances to Sun by Parker Solar Probe and Solar Orbiter spacecraft.</description>

      <title>Frequently Used References For Atomic Data In X-ray Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17106</link>

Abstract: Accurate atomic physics reference data are a crucial requirement for analysis and interpretation of observed spectra, even more so for observations with high spectral resolution. This document provides a curated list of atomic physics references frequently used for plasma diagnostics in X-ray spectroscopy, outside of comprehensive plasma models that typically come with their own underlying atomic databases. The list includes references to physical constants, laboratory benchmarks, transition energies, position and line shapes of neutral fluorescence lines, radiative branching ratios, and commonly used notation for prominent transitions. Quick-look tables for transition energies in H-, He-, and Li-like ions and line positions and shapes for fluorescence lines in neutrals. The main focus is on K-shell transitions. For the H- and He-like tables, we cite state-of-the art calculations that we consider currently the best available reference energies, which are considered high accuracy and thus typically used for energy scale calibration in laboratory measurements. Omissions in these tables are due to the lack of availability in the chosen references, and are not a statement about the relevance of these lines. Due to their complex and highly source-dependent line shape, the atomic data for neutrals is of lower accuracy than that for the highly charged ions, and the best reference data for these line shapes typically consist of empirical models derived from very high-resolution laboratory measurements. The table for neutrals provided here is consistent with the reference used for the energy gain scale calibration of XRISM/Resolve. This document is meant to serve as a resource to help find relevant references and conveniently formatted overview tables. When making use of the information found in these papers, credit should be given to their original authors by citing the appropriate references.</description>

      <title>Data-driven reduced modeling of streamer discharges in air</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06093v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a computational framework for simulating filamentary electric discharges, in which channels are represented as conducting cylindrical segments. The framework requires a model that predicts the position, radius, and line conductivity of channels at a next time step. Using this information, the electric conductivity on a numerical mesh is updated, and the new electric potential is computed by solving a variable-coefficient Poisson equation. A parallel field solver with support for adaptive mesh refinement is used, and the framework provides a Python interface for easy experimentation. We demonstrate how the framework can be used to simulate positive streamer discharges in air. First, a dataset of 1000 axisymmetric positive streamer simulations is generated, in which the applied voltage and the electrode geometry are varied. Fit expressions for the streamer radius, velocity, and line conductivity are derived from this dataset, taking as input the size of the high-field region ahead of the streamers. We then construct a reduced model for positive streamers in air, which includes a stochastic branching model. The reduced model compares well with the axisymmetric simulations from the dataset, while allowing spatial and temporal step sizes that are several orders of magnitude larger. 3D simulations with the reduced model resemble experimentally observed discharge morphologies. The model runs efficiently, with 3D simulations with 20+ streamers taking 4-8 minutes on a desktop computer.</description>

      <title>A comparison of low-n Mercier unstable Wendelstein stellarators and quasi-interchange modes in tokamaks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03987v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mercier's criterion is typically enforced as a hard operational limit in stellarator design. At the same time, past experimental and numerical studies have shown that this limit may often be surpassed, though the exact mechanism behind this nonlinear stability is not well understood. This work aims to contribute to our current understanding by comparing the nonlinear evolution of Mercier unstable Wendelstein stellarators to that of nonlinearly stable quasi-interchange modes in tokamaks. A high mirror, very low $\iota$, W7-X-like configuration is first simulated. A second case is then considered using experimental reconstructions of intermediate $\beta$ W7-AS discharges, where saturated low-n modes were observed experimentally, with sustained MHD signatures over tens of milliseconds. The possible reasons for the discrepancies between experiment and simulation, and the observation of partial reconnection in contrast to flux pumping are discussed, in view of reproducing and designing for operation of stellarators beyond the Mercier stability limit.</description>

      <title>A review of low-rank methods for time-dependent kinetic simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time-dependent kinetic models are ubiquitous in computational science and engineering. The underlying integro-differential equations in these models are high-dimensional, comprised of a six--dimensional phase space, making simulations of such phenomena extremely expensive. In this article we demonstrate that in many situations, the solution to kinetics problems lives on a low dimensional manifold that can be described by a low-rank matrix or tensor approximation. We then review the recent development of so-called low-rank methods that evolve the solution on this manifold. The two classes of methods we review are the dynamical low-rank (DLR) method, which derives differential equations for the low-rank factors, and a Step-and-Truncate (SAT) approach, which projects the solution onto the low-rank representation after each time step. Thorough discussions of time integrators, tensor decompositions, and method properties such as structure preservation and computational efficiency are included. We further show examples of low-rank methods as applied to particle transport and plasma dynamics.</description>
