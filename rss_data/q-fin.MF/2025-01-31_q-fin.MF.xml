      <title>On stochastic control problems with higher-order moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13521v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on a class of time-inconsistent stochastic control problems, where the objective function includes the mean and several higher-order central moments of the terminal value of state. To tackle the time-inconsistency, we seek both the closed-loop and the open-loop Nash equilibrium controls as time-consistent solutions. We establish a partial differential equation (PDE) system for deriving a closed-loop Nash equilibrium control, which does not include the equilibrium value function and is different from the extended Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations as in Bj\"ork et al. (Finance Stoch. 21: 331-360, 2017). We show that our PDE system is equivalent to the extended HJB equations that seems difficult to be solved for our higher-order moment problems. In deriving an open-loop Nash equilibrium control, due to the non-separable higher-order moments in the objective function, we make some moment estimates in addition to the standard perturbation argument for developing a maximum principle. Then, the problem is reduced to solving a flow of forward-backward stochastic differential equations. In particular, we investigate linear controlled dynamics and some objective functions affine in the mean. The closed-loop and the open-loop Nash equilibrium controls are identical, which are independent of the state value, random path and the preference on the odd-order central moments. By sending the highest order of central moments to infinity, we obtain the time-consistent solutions to some control problems whose objective functions include some penalty functions for deviation.</description>

      <title>Risk measures on incomplete markets: a new non-solid paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study risk measures $\varphi:E\longrightarrow\mathbb{R}\cup\{\infty\}$, where $E$ is a vector space of random variables which a priori has no lattice structure$\unicode{x2014}$a blind spot of the existing risk measures literature. In particular, we address when $\varphi$ admits a tractable dual representation (one which does not contain non-$\sigma$-additive signed measures), and whether one can extend $\varphi$ to a solid superspace of $E$. The existence of a tractable dual representation is shown to be equivalent, modulo certain technicalities, to a Fatou-like property, while extension theorems are established under the existence of a sufficiently regular lift, a potentially non-linear mechanism of assigning random variable extensions to certain linear functionals on $E$. Our motivation is broadening the theory of risk measures to spaces without a lattice structure, which are ubiquitous in financial economics, especially when markets are incomplete.</description>
