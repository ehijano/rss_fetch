      <title>Gravitational Waves from the Big Bang</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For millennia, humanity has relied exclusively on light$\unicode{x2014}$initially visible light and, later, broader and broader portions of the electromagnetic spectrum$\unicode{x2014}$to observe the universe. In the past decade, a remarkable chapter in extending astronomy beyond electromagnetic antennas has been concretized: the dawn of gravitational-wave astronomy has opened a new observational window into the cosmos. Among the many new astronomical sources we may now look for and study through their gravitational-wave signals, the Big Bang is surely among the most fascinating. Gravitational waves give us concrete hope of directly observing the primordial universe, whose light, emitted more than 13.7 billion years ago, is blocked from reaching our telescopes. This dissertation is aimed at the study of gravitational waves from cosmic inflation, the main scientific paradigm for the very early universe. Therefore, the text is divided into chapters on gravitational waves, inflationary cosmology, and inflationary gravitational waves. More specifically, our discussion will be steered by the endeavor to explain how the gravitational-wave signal sought by the NANOGrav observatory could have originated in the primordial universe.</description>

      <title>Krylov Complexity in Canonical Quantum Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore Krylov complexity for two exactly solvable models, one in the Wheeler-DeWitt (WDW) quantum cosmology and another in loop quantum cosmology (LQC), for a spatially flat, homogeneous, and isotropic universe sourced with a massless scalar field, which serves the role of clock. While the WDW quantization of this model cannot avoid the big bang/big crunch singularity, it is replaced by a big bounce in LQC. We construct the Krylov basis analytically by applying the Lanczos algorithm and evaluate both the Krylov state and operator complexity. In regimes where the wave function of the universe is sharply peaked, our results indicate that the Krylov complexity grows quadratically with the scalar field clock for the state and operator complexities in both the WDW quantum cosmology and LQC. We further show that operator complexity is exactly twice the state complexity in these regimes. We discuss the interpretation of the global behavior of these systems by calculating the Krylov entropy for both quantum cosmological frameworks. We observe that in LQC, the Krylov complexity and entropy remain finite at the bounce, whereas in the WDW quantum cosmology, they diverge at the big bang/crunch singularity. Our work paves the way for computing Krylov complexity in more intricate quantum cosmological models, including those exhibiting phenomena such as quantum chaos.</description>

      <title>Efficient Search for Detection Candidates Using a Peak Finder Strategy for All-Sky-All-Frequency Gravitational Wave Radiometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first all-sky-all-frequency (ASAF) radiometer search was conducted using data from the first three observing runs of the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors. The significance of this search lies in its fast and unmodeled approach, leveraging a cross-correlation technique to identify common signals across the detector network. As a result, this method serves as an excellent alternative to search for unknown or poorly modeled continuous wave sources and narrowband components of the gravitational wave (GW) background. For continuous wave sources whose waveform can be modeled, this method can serve as the first stage of a hierarchical scheme by identifying sub-threshold candidates to be followed up with more optimal but computationally expensive searches. The ASAF search, however, presently suffers from beam smearing, where multiple candidates may arise due to the same noise fluctuations, detector artifact, or a GW source. This can reduce the detection probability in follow-up analyzes, especially with limited computing resources. To mitigate this issue and reduce the number of correlated and unnecessary candidates, we introduce a novel Peak Finder algorithm. This algorithm helps identifying the most representative candidates while preserving detection sensitivity, thereby allowing follow up of a much larger number of independent candidates. The reduction in correlated samples leads to a significant reduction in False Dismissal Rate (FDR) using the Peak Finder method compared to the Full-sky method. For instance, following up 2 Peak Finder candidates at 30 Hz reduces FDR by a factor of 3.</description>

      <title>The $\mu$-deformed Einstein field equations with $\mu$-dependent effective cosmological constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive the $\mu$-deformed Einstein field equations from the generalized thermodynamic functions of the $\mu$-deformed analog of Bose gas model, applying the (adapted) Verlinde's approach. The basic role of deformation parameter is shown: it provides the possibility to vary the value of the cosmological constant. Due to this, we suggest an interesting treatment of the cosmological constant (CC) problem within the framework of $\mu$-deformation. Namely, viewing the derived $\mu$-deformed CC as an effective one and varying the parameter $\mu$ appropriately, we gain the possibility to drastically reduce the CC, so as to get for it the realistic value. Also, the relation with dark matter is discussed.</description>

      <title>Wave Front Sensing demodulated at the difference frequency between two phase-modulation sidebands in a compound interferometer configuration for a gravitational-wave detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise alignment sensing and control are essential for maintaining the stability of laser interferometric gravitational-wave detectors. Conventional Wave Front Sensing technique (WFS), which relies on the beat between the carrier and phase-modulated (PM) sidebands, is dominated by arm-axis signals when the carrier resonates in the full interferometer. This dominance limits the detection of other optical axes, such as the Power Recycling Cavity (PRC) and incident beam axes. To address this problem, we propose a novel sensing technique, "Phase-Modulated-sideband $\times$ Phase-Modulated-sideband Wave Front Sensing" (PMPMWFS), which demodulates the beat signal at the difference frequency between two anti-resonant PM sidebands. We derived the theoretical response of PMPMWFS and experimentally demonstrated it using the Power-Recycled X-arm (PRXARM) configuration of KAGRA. The results show that PMPMWFS effectively decouples angular fluctuation signals of the PRC and incident beam from those of the arm cavity and provides orthogonal signal components for the end mirror of the arm cavity. Furthermore, feedback control using PMPMWFS achieved stable interferometer locking for over one hour. These results demonstrate that PMPMWFS offers an effective sensing method for decoupling multiple alignment degrees of freedom in future gravitational-wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Quintessence Star Solutions with Conformal Symmetry in a Durgapal Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accelerated expansion of the Universe can be suitably attributed to the existence of the dark energy (DE). On the backdrop of this concept, this paper introduces a novel, anisotropic compact star model whose stability and structure are governed by the presence of quintessence field, defined by the parameter $ w_{Q} (-1&lt;w_{Q}&lt;-\frac{1}{3}) $ and which admits conformal symmetry. The construction of the model relied on the Durgapal-Fuloria (DP) metric formulation. The model successfully meets all the necessary physical constraints viz., TOV equation, energy conditions, compactness factor, surface redshift and casuality condition. The results are analyzed through analytical methods as well as through the graphical visualization for the various physical attributes.</description>

      <title>Late-time cosmic dynamics in $f(R,L_{m})$ gravity with recent observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the late-time cosmic dynamics in the framework of non-linear $f(R, L_m)$ gravity, adopting the functional form $f(R,L_m)=\frac{R}{2}+L_m^2$. To explore the dark energy behavior, we assume an oscillatory parametric equation of state, $\omega(z) = \omega_0 + b \sin[\log(1+z)]$, which allows smooth deviations from the cosmological constant. Using a joint MCMC analysis with the latest Hubble 31 chronometer data, DESI DR2 BAO measurements, and Type Ia supernova samples (Pantheon+, DES-SN5Y and Union 3), we obtain well-constrained parameters around $H_0 \simeq 67.2~\text{km s}^{-1}\text{Mpc}^{-1}$ and $\omega_0\approx-0.5$, consistent with Planck 2018 and other current observations. The model exhibits a clear transition from deceleration to acceleration with $z_{\rm tr} \sim 0.7$--$0.8$, satisfies the NEC and DEC while violating the SEC and yields present EoS values close to $-1$, reproducing $\Lambda$CDM behavior at late times. The derived Universe ages ($t_0 \approx 13.3~\text{Gyr}$) agree well with CMB and stellar constraints, confirming that the proposed oscillatory $f(R, L_m)$ model provides an observationally consistent and dynamically viable alternative to $\Lambda$CDM cosmology.</description>

      <title>Probing Loop Quantum Gravity black holes through gravitational lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate strong gravitational lensing by a charged loop quantum gravity (LQG) black hole obtained through the polymerisation scheme of Borges \textit{et al.} \cite{Borges:2023fog}. These effective geometries replace the Reissner--Nordstr\"om singularity with a symmetric transition surface and admit an extremal, cold remnant determined by the minimal area gap in LQG. In turn, we derive the null geodesic equations, investigate the photon effective potential, and obtain expressions for the photon-sphere radius and critical impact parameter. We compute the weak-field deflection angle and Einstein ring size, highlighting the deviations induced by the polymerisation parameter and the Barbero--Immirzi parameter. In the strong-field regime, we compute the strong deflection coefficients $(\bar{a},\bar{b})$ and evaluate the lensing observables $\theta_\infty$, $s$, and $r_{\rm mag}$. Unlike the Reissner--Nordstr\"om case, the LQG corrections enhance the deflection angle and increase the angular separation of relativistic images, with deviations growing as the geometry approaches the LQG remnant limit. We further compute the corresponding observables for Sgr~A* and M87*, finding that the quantum-gravity modifications lie within the potential sensitivity of next-generation VLBI facilities. For M87*, the angular separation $s\in(0.05712,0.19123)\,\mu\text{as}$, while it is $s\in(0.07595,0.25426)\,\mu\text{as}$ for Sgr A*. The relative flux ratio is found to lie in the range, $r_{\rm mag}\in(4.49272,5.96397)$. Our analysis demonstrates that LQG-induced corrections leave characteristic strong and weak-lensing imprints, offering a promising observational pathway to probe quantum gravity using near-future high-resolution observations.</description>

      <title>Constraining linear form of $f(\mathcal{R,G,T})$ gravity from astrophysical observations of the Pulsar U1724</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we examine the internal structure of compact stars within an extended gravitational framework described by the function $f(\mathcal{R},\mathcal{G},\mathcal{T})$. Throughout this work, the quantity $\mathcal{R}$ refers to the curvature scalar formed from the Ricci tensor. The term $\mathcal{G}$ denotes the Gauss--Bonnet curvature invariant, while $\mathcal{T}$ corresponds to the trace obtained by contracting the matter energy-momentum tensor. Our analysis is directed toward massive radio pulsars with masses above $1.8\,M_{\odot}$, which provide an exceptional testing ground for gravity under conditions inaccessible to laboratory experiments. Adopting the linear form $f(\mathcal{R},\mathcal{G},\mathcal{T})=\mathcal{R}+\alpha\,\mathcal{G}+\beta\,\mathcal{T}$ where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are parameters of suitable dimensionality,\footnote{$\alpha$ has dimensions of $[L^{2}]$ and $\beta$ carries units of $[N^{-1}]$.} we obtain an exact analytic solution for static anisotropic stellar matter in hydrostatic equilibrium. This solution allows all physical quantities to be expressed in terms of the dimensionless parameters $ \alpha_{1}=\alpha/R^{2},\qquad \beta_{1}=\beta/\kappa^{2}$ together with the compactness $C=2GM/(Rc^{2})$. We constraint the two parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ by matching the model with the mass and radius of pulsar \textit{U1724} requires restricting these parameters to $\alpha_{1}=\pm0.023$ and $\beta_{1}=\pm0.001$, where $\kappa^{2}=8\pi G/c^{4}$ is the standard Einstein coupling. The resulting stellar configuration satisfies the causal bound on the radial sound speed, $c_{s}^{2}&lt;c^{2}/3$, distinguishing it from the corresponding behaviour in general relativity.</description>

      <title>Universal scalarization in topological AdS black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the universal behavior of black hole scalarization induced by a charged scalar field in the extended phase space of the asymptotic AdS spacetime with three distinct horizon topologies. The results indicate that in all the three cases, the charged black hole spacetime undergoes scalarization at low temperatures. Notably, the spherical topology is unique in that its domain of scalarization theoretically extends to much higher temperatures under low pressure in the extended phase space. Moreover, the scalarization process in the spherical case exhibits complex phase transition behaviors without additional non-linear terms, which are similar to those in the planar and hyperbolic topologies with the assistance of non-linear terms. With increasing pressure in the extended phase space, the condensate of the scalarization in all three cases undergoes a transition from the first-order style to a cave-of-wind style. This study provides deeper insight into the zeroth-order phase transition during black hole scalarization and reveals the complete phase structure of black holes in the extended phase space.</description>

      <title>Primordial black hole driven cosmic acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a natural mechanism for cosmic acceleration driven by primordial black holes (PBHs) with repulsive behavior, within a ''Swiss Cheese'' cosmological framework. Considering regular black hole spacetimes such as Hayward, Bardeen, and Dymnikova-as well as the singular Schwarzschild-de Sitter case-we consistently find a robust PBH-driven cosmic acceleration phase. This phase ends either at an energy scale set by the PBH parameters or through black hole evaporation. Notably, one finds that ultra-light PBHs with $m &lt; 5 \times 10^8 \, {\rm g}$ can trigger exponential inflation with graceful exit and reheating. Additionally, PBHs with $m \sim 10^{12} \, {\rm g}$ and abundances $0.107 &lt; \Omega_{\rm PBH}^{\rm eq} &lt; 0.5$ near matter-radiation equality can act as an early dark energy component, offering a potential resolution to the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Hawking-radiation-ignited autocatalytic formation of primordial black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and analyze an autocatalytic mechanism in which bursts of Hawking radiation from evaporating micro-primordial black holes (PBHs) trigger the collapse of near-critical plasma overdensities. In a primordial plasma seeded with such patches, this feedback self organizes into a traveling ignition front that successively forms new PBHs and then self-quenches as the Universe expands. A minimal reaction-diffusion model yields conservative criteria for ignition and freeze-out and predicts a stochastic gravitational-wave background with a sharp causal low-frequency edge set by the freeze-out correlation length and largely insensitive to Planck-scale PBH endpoint microphysics. The resulting sub-Hz-to-audio band and amplitudes satisfy cosmological energy-injection bounds, providing a clean, testable target for forthcoming gravitational-wave observatories.</description>

      <title>Violations of the Weak Energy Condition for Lentz Warp Drives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Warp drive spacetimes capable of superluminal transportation, were first introduced in 1994 by Miguel Alcubierre and then generalized by others. These spacetimes violated the Weak Energy Condition (WEC). Lentz proposed a new type of warp drive in 2020. It was claimed that this warp spacetime has non-negative energy density and can therefore be sourced by a classical plasma. We demonstrate that Lentz's claim is incorrect. We begin with a direct calculation of the energy-momentum tensor of Lentz's warp drive in a Eulerian reference frame, and show that there are spacetime regions where the energy density is negative. We then examine the theoretical basis of Lentz's investigation and identify several derivation errors. The derivation errors can be somewhat ameliorated with a modified version of Lentz's geometry, which more closely respects the equalities and inequalities discussed by Lentz. Even so, we show that the modified geometry still violates the WEC even in the Eulerian reference frame. We conclude with a brief discussion of no-go theorems and their relationship to geometries of the kind proposed by Lentz.</description>

      <title>Constraint on massive vector field with extreme-mass-ratio inspirals around a slowly rotating black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the influence of a massive vector (Proca) field on the energy fluxes from extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) around a slowly rotating Kerr black hole. The secondary compact object, carrying a Proca hair, emits additional dipolar radiation that alters total energy flux relative to general relativity (GR). These modifications induce a secular drift in the orbital evolution of circular geodesic orbits, leading to measurable dephasing in the resulting EMRIs waveforms. By evaluating waveform mismatches between the Einstein-Proca framework and its GR counterpart, we show that the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) can distinguish the signatures of a light Proca field when black hole rotation is included. Furthermore, using a Fisher information matrix analysis, we forecast LISA's capability to place stringent constraints on the Proca mass with EMRIs signal from slowly rotating Kerr black holes. For representative EMRIs configurations, we find that LISA can detect or constrain Proca masses down to $\mu_v\sim 10^{-20}$eV, with typical fractional uncertainties at the level of tens percent, depending on the black-hole spin.</description>

      <title>Looking through the Kerr disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study null geodesics that connect the two asymptotically flat regions of the maximally extended Kerr spacetime. These vortical geodesics traverse both horizons and pass through the ring singularity, linking the positive-$r$ exterior to the negative-$r$ asymptotic side. Using impact parameters, we identify a closed subset of parameter space, the inner throat, where the radial potential has no real roots, and photons exhibit no radial turning points. In this region, at most two constant-latitude geodesics exist, one of which is aligned with the principal null direction. We also identify the forbidden polar-angle band that limits the range of geodesics reaching an asymptotic observer. We solve the geodesic equations analytically and numerically in Eddington-Finkelstein-like coordinates, obtaining mutually consistent results that correct and extend previously available formulae. The resulting trajectories are used to construct simulated views for an observer in the negative-$r$ domain, revealing strong image distortion and inversion, with possible implications for analogous white-hole configurations.</description>

      <title>Non-Singular Bouncing Cosmology from Hyperbolic Field Space Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a two-field cosmological model in a closed ($k=+1$) universe where the field space is endowed with a hyperbolic geometry. We demonstrate that the curvature of the field space introduces a kinetic coupling that exponentially suppresses the scalar field kinetic energy as the fields explore certain regions, allowing the spatial curvature to dominate and trigger a non-singular bounce. Crucially, the model satisfies the Null Energy Condition (NEC) throughout, with the bounce driven entirely by the positive spatial curvature -- not by exotic physics. We derive analytic solutions for the bounce, verify them numerically, and compute observable predictions. The model predicts a tensor-to-scalar ratio $r \approx 0.003$--$0.005$ and local non-Gaussianity $f_{\rm NL} \sim \mathcal{O}(1)$, placing it within reach of next-generation CMB experiments such as LiteBIRD and CMB-S4. The model is ghost-free by construction.</description>

      <title>Dynamical interplay between coupled scalar dark sectors and gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a novel cosmological model based on coupled fields in the framework of scalar tensor theories, considering the specific interplay between gravity and scalar fields. The model further extends a recent axion-dilaton system by introducing viable couplings with the space--time geometry encoded into the scalar curvature. After briefly introducing the action and the corresponding field equations, we employ linear stability theory to investigate the physical properties. The analysis showed the compatibility of the current theoretical model with the recent history of the Universe, obtaining viable constraints for the model's parameters in some specific cases. In the present setup, the axion--dilaton system is non--minimally coupled with gravity in an independent manner, leading to distinct physical features in the phase-space structure, possible alleviating the cosmic coincidence problem.</description>

      <title>Off-Equatorial Orbits around Magnetically Charged Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a complete characterization of stable, off-equatorial circular orbits around magnetically charged black holes (MBHs). For a static, spherically symmetric MBH, we derive an exact analytic expression for the orbital latitude theta as a function of radius r. We establish a direct connection between these orbits and the spacetime fundamental structure, and demonstrate their stability against synchrotron radiation. We show that charged particles such as electrons and protons can exhibit O(1) latitude deviations at the ISCO radius and remain stable under synchrotron emission even for extremely small values of the black hole magnetic charge. We then extend the analysis to rotating MBHs, numerically computing the prograde and retrograde orbital branches and demonstrating how frame-dragging modifies their structure and stability regions. We show that these off-equatorial orbits are a unique feature of the magnetic charge, being forbidden in the analogous electrically charged Kerr-Newman spacetime. Our results suggest that environments surrounding magnetically charged black holes can exhibit distinctive phenomenological signatures, with potential implications for black hole imaging and polarimetric observations.</description>

      <title>Schr\"{o}dinger-type $f(Q,T)$ gravity-nonmetricity driven cosmological evolution from inflation to the late Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an $f(Q, T)$ gravity theory with a Schr\"{o}dinger type vectorial non-metricity. In the presence of such a non-metricity, the length of vectors is preserved under autoparallel transport. We obtain the field equations assuming a vanishing total scalar curvature, implemented by a Lagrange multiplier, and investigate their cosmological implications. To do this, we derive the generalized Friedmann equations which now have terms involving the non-metricity and the Lagrange multiplier. Then, we consider two distinct cosmological applications of the model. First of all, by adopting distinct forms of these two basic variables and investigate the possibility of the existence of warm inflationary scenarios within the framework of these models. In particular, we consider the case that the non-metricity is described by a constant vector, and we show that with this assumption we recover standard general relativity. The scenario in which the Lagrange multiplier is a constant is also investigated, and we show that radiation can be created during the very early phases of expansion. The amount of radiation peaks at a certain time after which, there is a transition from an accelerating inflationary phase to a decelerating one. Moreover, we perform a detailed comparison of the predictions of the considered Schr\"{o}dinger type cosmology with a set of observational data for the Hubble function, including Cosmic Chronometers, Type Ia Supernovae, and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis, by adopting a simple linear form for the Lagrange density. The model predictions are also compared with the results of the $\Lambda$CDM standard paradigm. Our results indicate that the Schr\"{o}dinger $f(Q,T)$ type theory can give a good description of the observational data for both the very early and the late Universe.</description>

      <title>Black hole binaries in shift-symmetric Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity experience a slower merger phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In shift-symmetric Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, stationary black holes have a non-vanishing scalar charge. During the inspiral, the phase evolution is modified by several effects, primarily an additional scalar dipole radiation, which enters at -1PN order. This effect accelerates the inspiral when compared to general relativity, when including corrections up to 2PN. Using fully non-linear numerical simulations of quasi-circular, comparable mass binaries, we find that in the late stages the orbital dynamics are altered so that the overall effect is instead a decelerated merger phase for the modified gravity case. We attribute this to a change in the conservative dynamics, and show that at the late inspiral stage more energy must be emitted in scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity to induce a given change in frequency. In longer signals, this should lead to a distinctive switch between a faster and slower frequency evolution relative to general relativity as the binary approaches merger. This work suggests we should revisit existing constraints on the theory that are obtained assuming PN approximations apply up to merger, or based on order by order approximations that neglect backreaction effects on the metric, and shows the importance of including non-linear effects that modify the gravitational sector in the strong field regime.</description>

      <title>Ghost instabilities and strong coupling in quadratic non-metricity theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the framework of Newer General Relativity, defined by all independent quadratic invariants of the non-metricity tensor, including the unique quadratic parity-violating term. We analyze linear perturbations around a flat FLRW background and find that the theory generically exhibits ghost instabilities, except for the special case of Symmetric Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity (STEGR) supplemented by the parity-violating operator. Using both the Dirac-Bergmann procedure and the Cartan-Kuranishi algorithm, we show that this remaining case propagates eight degrees of freedom at the fully non-linear level. This result implies that the parity-violating extension of STEGR is strongly coupled around FLRW and therefore lies beyond the regime of validity of standard linear perturbation theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We express the vacuum Einstein constraints in terms of differential forms - the forms include one-forms constituting an orthonormal coframe of the spatial metric. We show that if the metric is real-analytic, then the constraints can be always expressed locally as a system of first order PDE's - this system is obtained by a special choice of the coframe, which reduces to zero all second order terms in the scalar constraint.</description>

      <title>Dynamical system analysis of the cosmological phases in Palatini $k$-essence gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate a generalized $k$-essence model in the presence of a Palatini $f(\mathcal{R})$ gravitational sector. In the corresponding biscalar-tensor theory, we discuss the distinguished dynamical properties of the two scalar fields, elucidating how the Palatini scalaron can be still algebraically solved in terms of matter, the $k$-essence field and its kinetic term. We derive the conditions ensuring the absence of Ostrogradsky modes and the well-posedness of the initial data problem, also providing an intriguing analogy with a specific class of DHOST theories. Then, we investigate the cosmology of a flat Friedmann-Lema\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker spacetime according a dynamical system approach, with the aim of determining the set of fixed points in the phase space, representing specific periods of the Universe evolution and characterized by different effective barotropic index $w_{\text{eff}}$. The analysis reveals the presence of a range of possible configurations, with the existence of (quasi) de-Sitter epochs connected by heteroclinic orbits, scaling solutions and quintessence phases.</description>

      <title>Spherical Einstein-Friedberg-Lee-Sirlin boson stars: Self-interacting solutions and their astrophysical appearance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate boson stars within the framework of the self-interacting Einstein-Friedberg-Lee-Sirlin (E-FLS) model, constituted by a complex scalar field with a quartic self-interaction and a real scalar field. Our analysis explores the family of static solutions across a broad range of parameters, including the self-interaction of the complex scalar field. We obtain that positive self-interaction terms increase the maximum mass and compactness of E-FLS stars, allowing them to reach masses comparable to the Chandrasekhar limit without the need of ultralight bosonic masses. Moreover, in the limit where the real scalar field becomes massless, the solutions present larger effective radii and allow a broader range of stable solutions. Astrophysical images, generated via backward ray-tracing, show that these compact, self-interacting E-FLS stars produce strong gravitational lensing, yielding shadows that could visually mimic black holes, thus providing potential observational signatures detectable in ongoing electromagnetic surveys.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the impact of breaking diffeomorphism invariance in the inflaton sector. In particular, we consider inflaton models which are invariant under the subgroup of transverse diffeomorphisms and address the possibility of implementing a slow-roll phase. We obtain the corresponding expressions for relevant quantities such as the slow-roll parameters and the number of $e$-folds, and derive the primordial power-spectrum of curvature perturbations. The scalar spectral index features modifications which are confronted with CMB data from Planck and ACT. We study in detail the quadratic potential model, combining asymptotic and numerical analysis. We show that the post-inflationary behavior can be drastically different from the diffeomorphism-invariant case, exhibiting novel dynamical regimes.</description>

      <title>CLAWDIA: A dictionary learning framework for gravitational-wave data analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep-learning methods are becoming increasingly important in gravitational-wave data analysis, yet their performance often relies on large training datasets and models whose internal representations are difficult to interpret. Sparse dictionary learning (SDL) offers a complementary approach: it performs well in scarce-data regimes and yields physically interpretable representations of gravitational-wave morphology. Here we present CLAWDIA (Comprehensive Library for the Analysis of Waves via Dictionary-based Algorithms), an open-source Python framework that integrates SDL-based denoising and classification under realistic detector noise. We systematise previously isolated SDL workflows into a unified, modular environment with a consistent, user-friendly interface. The current release provides several time-domain denoising strategies based on LASSO-regularised sparse coding and a classifier based on Low-Rank Shared Dictionary Learning. A companion toolbox, GWADAMA, supports dataset construction and realistic conditioning of real and simulated interferometer data. We demonstrate CLAWDIA's performance by denoising the signal from binary neutron star event GW170817 and by classifying families of instrumental glitches from LIGO's third observing run, highlighting robustness at low signal-to-noise ratios. CLAWDIA is intended as a community-driven, interoperable library extensible to additional tasks, including detection and parameter estimation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I will discuss how the concept of basho, introduced by Nishida Kitaro nearly a century ago, can give an interesting insight to understand the concept of a point in modern quantum gravity. A quantum spacetime, necessary for the quantization of gravity, requires a whole rethinking of geometry, starting from the primitive concepts, like that of a point. I argue that the local vision of what becomes of classical points in quantum gravity, and in particular in noncommutative geometry, shows several similarities with Nishida's basho.</description>

      <title>Search for high-frequency gravitational waves via re-analysis of cavity axion data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monochromatic high-frequency gravitational waves (HFGW) provide a distinctive probe of new physics scenarios, most notably axion clouds around rotating black holes formed via superradiance. We reanalyzed data from the CAPP-12T MC (multi-cell) axion haloscope experiment [Phys. Rev. Lett. 133,051802 (2024)]. The study covers a continuous $2\,$MHz frequency span centered at $5.311\,$GHz. No rescan candidates were found, and we set 90% confidence-level exclusion limits on the gravitational-wave strain, reaching $h_0 \approx 3.9 \times 10^{-21}$ in the most sensitive regions of the sky. Interpreted in the context of black-hole superradiance from axion clouds, the results exclude black holes with mass $M_{\mathrm{BH}} \simeq 1.22 \times 10^{-6}\,M_\odot$ within distances of $O(10^{-2})\,$AU from Earth, under benchmark assumptions. This work demonstrates the potential of electromagnetic resonant cavities as novel detectors of monochromatic HFGW and motivates future searches for both long-lived and transient signals.</description>

      <title>General relativistic Lagrangian continuum theories -- Part II: electromagnetic fluids and solids with junction conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a covariant variational framework for relativistic electromagnetic continua (fluids and solid) based on Hamilton's principle formulated directly in the material description. The approach extends the geometric theory of relativistic continua introduced in Part I to include polarization, magnetization, and general elastic-electromagnetic coupling through a unified energy functional. By exploiting spacetime and material covariance, the framework yields the corresponding spacetime and convective variational principles, together with transparent expressions for the stress-energy-momentum tensor and the covariant Euler-type balance equations governing nonlinear electromagnetic continua. Coupling to general relativity is naturally incorporated, and when the action is augmented with Gibbons-Hawking-York boundary terms, the gravitational and electromagnetic junction conditions follow directly from the variational formulation. The results provide a coherent foundation for modeling nonlinear electromagnetic continua in relativistic regimes, with relevance to astrophysical systems where relativistic continuum dynamics and electromagnetic fields are known to be strongly coupled, such as neutron-star crusts, magnetar flares, relativistic jets, and accretion disks. We also offer systematic connections with several formulations appearing in the existing literature.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Spin Estimation with Time-variable Image of M87 During the Flaring State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By investigating the time-variable 230 GHz images using ray-tracing general relativistic radiative transfer calculation, we propose a novel method for estimating the spin parameter of the supermassive black hole at the M87 center by utilizing the sudden and short-term increase in emissivity in the innermost region of the accretion disk. It is found that the flux of the photon ring increases simultaneously as the flux of the direct ring, which brightens first, decreases, and then gradually diminishes, when the increase in emissivity persists for $15 t_{\rm g}$ with $t_{\rm g}$ being the light crossing time of the gravitational radius. The direct ring is formed by photons emitted from the vicinity of the innermost region of the disk and traveling directly to the observer without orbiting around the black hole, while the photon ring is formed by photons passing near the spherical photon orbit. The time-averaged width of the dark region between the direct ring and the photon ring (dark crescent) becomes thinner when the spin parameter is higher and the increase in the emissivity of the accretion disk is greater. The time variation of two rings also causes the intensity-weighted center to oscillate both in the direction of the black hole's angular momentum vector projected onto the screen ($Y$-direction) and in the perpendicular direction ($X$-direction). The amplitude of oscillatory time variation in the $X$-direction becomes large when the spin parameter is higher, and that in the $Y$-direction becomes large when the increase in the emissivity of the disk is large. The spin parameter can be estimated by combining the time-averaged dark crescent width and the ratio of the amplitudes in the $X$- and $Y$-directions. This method is applicable when the duration of the increase in emissivity of the accretion disk ranges at least from approximately 10-20 $t_{\rm g}$.</description>

      <title>From LIGO to Fiber- Compact Sagnac Interferometer for Gravitational-Wave Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave detection has transformed astrophysics, granting us direct access to black hole mergers, neutron star collisions, and the cataclysms of stellar death. Yet the great observatories of today, LIGO, Virgo, KAGRA, and the planned Einstein Telescope, rest on Michelson interferometers that, despite their triumphs, confront fundamental barriers of scale, cost, and environmental vulnerability. We envision a new path, a Sagnac-based fiber interferometer that leverages reciprocity and inherent robustness. Its meter-scale, modular design compact enough to fit within a small facility, offers dramatic gains in scalability and affordability over kilometer scale Michelson systems. Tunable to frequency bands where conventional detectors lose sensitivity, it opens the door to compact, versatile, and accessible GW observatories, empowering universities and research centers worldwide. Linked together in a global network, such facilities could transcend mere detection, they could localize cosmic sources and reconstruct them into images, much as black holes were first directly revealed, ushering in a new era of gravitational-wave astronomy and multi-messenger discovery.</description>

      <title>New Near Extremal Black Holes and Love Symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rotating and charged black holes are known to exhibit remarkable properties close to extremality, including emergent hidden symmetries and holographic duality to 2D theories. In this note, we introduce a new class of near-extremal black holes living in $(2,2)$ signature, strongly resembling the Lorentzian ones but with an exact integrable structure $SL(2,\mathbb{R})\times SL(2,\mathbb{R})$. The exterior of the black hole is a self-dual solution with a photon ring. It develops an infinite near-horizon throat described by the Eguchi-Hanson instanton. An exact version of the so-called Love symmetry controls perturbations on the throat. Furthermore, the normalizable spectrum of this black hole provides quasinormal modes in Lorentzian signature.</description>

      <title>How Complex is Dark Energy? A Bayesian Analysis of CPL Extensions with Recent DESI BAO Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nature of dark energy is one of the big puzzling issues in cosmology. While $\Lambda$CDM provides a good fit to the observational data, evolving dark energy scenarios, such as the CPL parametrization, offer a compelling alternative. In this paper, we present a Bayesian model comparison of various dark energy parametrizations using a joint analysis of Cosmic Microwave Background data, DESI Baryon Acoustic Oscillation measurements, and the PantheonPlus (or Union3) Supernovae type Ia sample. We find that while the $\Lambda$CDM model is initially favored over a constant $w$CDM model, the CPL parametrization is significantly preferred over $w$CDM, reinforcing recent evidence for an evolving dark energy component, consistent with DESI collaboration findings. Crucially, when testing higher-order CPL extensions, the so-called CPL$^+$ and CPL$^{++}$, our Bayesian analysis shows that the observational data do not favor these more complex scenarios compared to the standard CPL. This result indicates that adding excessive complexity to the CPL form is unwarranted by current observations. Interestingly, similar to the CPL parametrization, alternative two-parameter forms, specifically $w_{de}(a) = w_0 + w_b(1-a)^2$ and $w_{de}(a) = w_0 + w_c(1-a)^3$, yield a better fit to observational data than the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Our results challenge the necessity for overly complex CPL extensions and confirm that well-chosen two-parameter $w_0w_a$ parametrizations effectively capture DE evolution with current cosmological data, supporting the recent signals for dynamical dark energy by DESI collaboration.</description>

      <title>Tracing the Trace Anomaly of Dense Matter inside Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The trace anomaly $\Delta$ is an important quantity that measures the broken conformal symmetry in neutron star matter. In this work, we present quasi-universal relations that connect the stellar profile of $\Delta$ to the compactness, moment of inertia, and tidal deformability of neutron stars. We apply the quasi-universal relations to determine the trace anomaly profiles for PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0740+6620 based on their mass-radius measurements. We also analyze PSR J0737-3039A according to its moment of inertia inferred from Bayesian modeling of nuclear equation of state. A recent multimessenger constraint on the tidal deformability is also studied, resulting in an estimate value of the trace anomaly $\Delta_c = 0.1770^{+0.0365}_{-0.0432}$ at the center of a $1.4M_\odot$ canonical neutron star. It is expected that more precise observations from both electromagnetic and gravitational-wave channels in the future will provide tighter constraints on the behavior of $\Delta$ inside neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Separating the Inseparable: Constraining Arbitrary Primordial Bispectra with Cosmic Microwave Background Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To efficiently probe primordial non-Gaussianity using Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data, we require theoretical predictions that are factorizable, \textit{i.e.}\ those whose kinematic dependence can be separated. This property does not hold for many models, hindering their application to data. In this work, we introduce a general framework for constructing separable approximations to primordial bispectra, enabling direct CMB constraints on arbitrary models including those computed using numerical tools. In contrast to other approaches such as modal decompositions, we learn the basis functions directly from the data, allowing high-fidelity representations with just a handful of terms. This is practically implemented using machine-learning techniques, utilizing neural network basis functions and a loss function designed to mimic the CMB cosine similarity. We validate our pipeline using a variety of input bispectra, demonstrating that the approximations are $&gt;99.5\%$ correlated with the truth with just three terms. By incorporating the neural basis into the \textsc{PolySpec} code, we derive KSW-type CMB estimators, which reproduce local- and equilateral-type non-Gaussianity to within $0.1\sigma$. As a proof-of-concept, we constrain two inflationary bispectra from the `cosmological collider' scenario; these feature an additional strongly-mixed particle sector and cannot be computed analytically. By combining the numerical predictions from \textsc{CosmoFlow} with our factorizable approach (with just three terms), we place novel constraints on the collider models using \textit{Planck} PR4 data, finding no detection of non-Gaussianity. Our method facilitates detailed studies of the inflationary paradigm, connecting modern theoretical tools with high-resolution observational data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the quantum aspects of the conformal gravity in four dimensions, specifically addressing a known discrepancy in beta functions between general quadratic curvature theories and conformal gravity, which corresponds to two scalar degrees of freedom. We demonstrate that this mismatch is resolved by carefully introducing gauge-fixing and ghost terms via the BRST symmetry, which effectively adds the two scalar modes. Drawing lessons from two-dimensional quantum gravity and Liouville theory, we proceed to integrate the four-dimensional trace anomaly to derive a consistent Liouville action, which is given by a free-field action for the conformal mode with a consistent conformal anomaly. Finally we give the condition that the BRST transformation is anomaly free.</description>

      <title>SL(2N,C) Hyperunification: Dynamical Tetrads, Induced Gravity, and Composite Families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a four-dimensional hyperunified gauge framework in which local Lorentz symmetry and internal gauge interactions are embedded into a special noncompact $\mathrm{SL}(2N,\mathbb{C})$ group acting on spinors. The accompanying tetrads are promoted to dynamical fields whose contracted invertibility condition is interpreted as a nonlinear sigma-model type length constraint. This triggers tetrad condensation and spontaneously breaks $\mathrm{SL}(2N, \mathbb{C})\to \mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})\times\mathrm{SU}(N)$, lifting all noncompact directions. A special ghost-free curvature-squared Lagrangian provides a consistent quadratic sector, while an Einstein--Cartan linear curvature term is shown to arise radiatively from fermion loops. Below the breaking scale only the neutral tetrad (graviton) and $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ vector fields remain massless, whereas axial-vector and tensor fields of the entire gauge multiplet acquire heavy masses. Applying the same $\mathrm{SL}(2N,\mathbb{C})$ symmetry to underlying preons in fundamental spin-$\tfrac12$ representations, rather than directly to quarks and leptons, together with the anomaly matching for the preon chiral symmetry, singles out $N=8$. The chain $\mathrm{SL}(16,\mathbb{C})\to \mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})\times\mathrm{SU}(8)$ then naturally yields three composite quark--lepton families, while filtering out extraneous heavy states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Once again, dispute has arisen over the interpretation of proposed quantum information theory experiments to probe the quantum nature of gravity by testing for gravitationally induced entanglement (GIE) between two spatially separated massive particles ([1] vs. [11,12]; further contributions in [7,9]). The confusion appears to reside in interpreting applications of a Hamiltonian formalism. But classical gravity cannot mediate entanglement on independent grounds. A Newton-Cartan analysis shows that if gravity is classical, a mediator, and entanglement is observed as an outcome of performing a GIE experiment, something other than gravity must have supplied the (virtual) force needed during the experiment to produce the effect.</description>

      <title>Neural surrogates for designing gravitational wave detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics simulators are essential in science and engineering, enabling the analysis, control, and design of complex systems. In experimental sciences, they are increasingly used to automate experimental design, often via combinatorial search and optimization. However, as the setups grow more complex, the computational cost of traditional, CPU-based simulators becomes a major limitation. Here, we show how neural surrogate models can significantly reduce reliance on such slow simulators while preserving accuracy. Taking the design of interferometric gravitational wave detectors as a representative example, we train a neural network to surrogate the gravitational wave physics simulator Finesse, which was developed by the LIGO community. Despite that small changes in physical parameters can change the output by orders of magnitudes, the model rapidly predicts the quality and feasibility of candidate designs, allowing an efficient exploration of large design spaces. Our algorithm loops between training the surrogate, inverse designing new experiments, and verifying their properties with the slow simulator for further training. Assisted by auto-differentiation and GPU parallelism, our method proposes high-quality experiments much faster than direct optimization. Solutions that our algorithm finds within hours outperform designs that take five days for the optimizer to reach. Though shown in the context of gravitational wave detectors, our framework is broadly applicable to other domains where simulator bottlenecks hinder optimization and discovery.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive bosonic fields can trigger superradiant instabilities in rotating astrophysical black holes leading to gaps in their mass-spin distribution. For spin-2 fields, the instability timescale is orders of magnitude shorter than for any other superradiant mode, thereby yielding much stronger constraints. We consider a tower of ultra-light spin-2 fields arising from a warped compactification of a single extra dimension and translate superradiant constraints on their masses into constraints on the warping. As a concrete scenario we consider the 2-brane Randall-Sundrum model and find constraints on the size of the extra dimension and the curvature of $AdS_5$. We discuss the implications of these bounds for strongly warped throats and D-brane uplifts commonly used in attempts to realise metastable de Sitter vacua in string theory.</description>

      <title>Guesswork in the gap: the impact of uncertainty in the compact binary population on source classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nature of the compact objects within the supposed "lower mass gap" remains uncertain. Observations of GW190814 and GW230529 highlight the challenges gravitational waves face in distinguishing neutron stars from black holes. Interpreting these systems is especially difficult because classifications depend simultaneously on measurement noise, compact binary population models, and equation of state (EOS) constraints on the maximum neutron star mass. We analyze 66 confident events from GWTC-3 to quantify how the probability of a component being a neutron star, P(NS), varies across the population. The effects are substantial, the dominant drivers of classification are the pairing preferences of neutron stars with other compact objects, and the neutron star spin distributions. The data reveals that P(NS) varies between 1% - 67% for GW230529's primary and between 51% - 100% for GW190425's primary. By contrast, P(NS) for GW190814's secondary varies by &lt;10%, demonstrating robustness from its high signal-to-noise ratio and small mass ratio. Analysis using EOS information tends to affect P(NS) through the inferred maximum neutron star mass rather than the maximum spin. As it stands, P(NS) remains sensitive to numerous population parameters, limiting its reliability and potentially leading to ambiguous classifications of future GW events.</description>

      <title>Hybrid compact stars with finite strange quark mass and dark energy: implications for astrophysical observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19029v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, a detailed investigation of compact stars composed of deconfined quark matter with finite strange quark mass ($m_s \neq 0$) admixed with dark energy is presented. The quark sector is modeled using the MIT bag model equation of state, while the dark energy component obeys a linear equation of state, $p^{de} = \omega \rho^{de}$ with $\omega$ in the range $-1\leq\omega\leq-frac{1}{3}$. The stellar configuration is explored within the Finch-Skea ansatz for the $g_{rr}$ metric potential. A coupling between quark matter and dark energy is introduced through $\rho^{de} =\beta \rho^Q$, where $\beta$ represents the dark energy coupling parameter. Causality restricts $\beta$ within $0&lt;\beta&lt;-\frac{1}{3\omega}$. The structural features of such compact stars are analysed by varying $\beta$ in this range. Solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations yields a maximum mass of $2.012~M_{\odot}$ with a radius of about 11 km. For a fixed $\omega$, both mass and radius decrease as $\beta$ increases. The model satisfies causality, energy and stability conditions, ensuring physical acceptability. Finally, the framework is applied to estimate radii of compact star candidates identified as strange quark stars with dark energy, showing good agreement with observational data.</description>

      <title>Accounting for the Known Unknowns: A Parametric Framework to Incorporate Systematic Waveform Errors in Gravitational-Wave Parameter Estimation</title>

Abstract: The PE for GW merger events relies on a waveform model calibrated using numerical simulations. Within the Bayesian framework, this waveform model represents the GW signal produced during the merger and is crucial for estimating the likelihood function. However, these waveform models may possess systematic errors that can differ across the parameter space. Addressing these errors in the current data analysis pipeline is an active area of research. We introduce parametrizations for the uncertainties in the amplitude and phase of the reference waveform model. When the error budget in the amplitude and phase of the waveform model, as a function of frequency, is known, it can be used as a prior distribution in the Bayesian framework. We also show that conservative priors can be used to quantify uncertainties in waveform modeling without any knowledge of waveform uncertainty error budgets. Through zero-noise injections and PE recoveries, we demonstrate that even 1%-2% of errors in relative phase to the actual waveform model, for a GW150914-like signal and advanced LIGO detector sensitivity, can introduce biases in the recovered parameters. These biases can be corrected when we account for waveform uncertainties within the PE framework. By analyzing a series of simulated signals from mergers with precessing orbits and recovering them using a non-spinning waveform model, we demonstrate that we can reduce the ratio of systematic errors to statistical errors. This approach allows us to address scenarios where specific physical effects are missing in waveform modeling. The code that implements our parametrization for performing PE is available as a Python package "pycbc_wferrors_plugin", compatible with the PyCBC open source GW analysis library.</description>

      <title>Relativistic stars in $f(Q)$-gravity: Exact analytic solution for the power-law case $f(Q) = Q + b \: Q^\nu$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14302v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate static spherically symmetric spacetimes within the framework of symmetric teleparallel $f(Q)$ gravity in order to describe relativistic stars. We adopt a specific ansatz for the background geometry corresponding to a singularity-free space-time. We obtain an expression for the connection, which allows the derivation of solutions for any $f(Q)$ theory in this context. Our approach aims to address a recurring error appearing in the literature, where even when a connection compatible with spherical symmetry is adopted, the field equation for the connection is systematically omitted and not checked if it is satisfied. For the stellar configuration, we concentrate on the power-law model $f(Q)=Q+\alpha Q_{0}\left( \frac{Q}{Q_{0}}\right) ^{\nu }$. The de Sitter-Schwarzschild geometry naturally emerges as an attractor beyond a certain radius, we thus utilize it as the external solution beyond the boundary of the star. We perform a detailed investigation of the physical characteristics of the interior solution, explicitly determining the mass function, analyzing the resulting gravitational fluid properties and deriving the angular and radial speed of sound.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the modelling of black hole ringdown beyond General Relativity (GR), emphasizing the limitations of approaches that rely solely on shifted quasinormal mode (QNM) frequencies. Starting from modified Teukolsky equations in such scenarios, we classify the distinct types of deviations that can arise -- those shifting QNM frequencies, and those introducing additional frequencies associated with extra fields. We then construct the most general ansatz for metric perturbations in this context and discuss its implications for QNM modelling and theory-agnostic tests of GR using gravitational wave data.</description>

      <title>Can Gravitational Wave Data Shed Light on Dark Matter Particles ?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04905v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) data from observed binary black hole coalescences (BBHC) have been demonstrated in recent analyses to validate the Hawking Area Theorem (HAT) for black hole horizons. The result of such analyses is imposed here as a criterion of {\it absolute} consistency on the logarithmic (in horizon area) corrections to the Bekenstein-Hawking Area Formula (BHAF) for the black hole entropy, when these corrections are computed both from non-perturbative quantum fluctuations of spacetime in matter-free quantum general relativity, as well as arising due to perturbative quantum matter field fluctuations around a stationary classical black hole background spacetime. This criterion of absolute consistency is seen to be obeyed provided certain restrictions ensue on the spin-parity and number of species of the spectrum of quantum matter fluctuations. Such constraints appear to restrict the Beyond-Standard-Model (BSM) part of the matter fluctuation spectrum. Some species of the constrained, yet-unobserved BSM particle spectrum are currently under active consideration in particle cosmology as candidates for dark matter.</description>

      <title>Relativistic excitation of compact stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23176v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the excitation of a compact star under the influence of external gravitational driving in the relativistic regime. Using a model setup in which a wave with constant frequency is injected from past null infinity and scattered by the star to future null infinity, we show that the scattering coefficient encodes rich information of the star. For example, the analytical structure of the scattering coefficient implies that the decay rate of a mode generally plays the role of ``star excitation factor'', similar to the ``black hole excitation factor'' previously defined for describing black hole mode excitations. With this star excitation factor we derive the transient mode excitation as a binary system crosses a generic mode resonance of a companion star during the inspiral stage. This application is useful because previous description of resonant mode excitation of stars still relies on the mode and driving force decomposition based on the Newtonian formalism. In addition, we show that the scattering phase is intimately related to the total energy of spacetime and matter under the driving of a steady input wave from infinity. We also derive the relevant tidal energy of a star under steady driving and compare that with the dynamic tide formula. We estimate that the difference may lead to $\mathcal{O}(0.5)$ radian phase modulation in the late stage of the binary neutron star inspiral waveform.</description>

      <title>Ring formation from black hole superradiance through repeated particle production on bound orbits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03490v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultralight bosonic fields around a rotating black hole can extract energy and angular momentum through the superradiant instability and form a dense cloud. We investigate the scenario involving two scalar fields, $\phi$ and $\chi$, with a coupling term $\frac{1}{2}\lambda\phi\chi^2$, which is motivated by the multiple-axion framework. The ultralight scalar $\phi$ forms a cloud that efficiently produces $\chi$ particles nonperturbatively via parametric resonance, with a large mass hierarchy, $\mu_\chi \gg \mu_\phi$. Rather than escaping the system as investigated by previous studies, these $\chi$ particles remain bound, orbiting the black hole. Moreover, the particle production occurs primarily at the peak of the cloud's profile, allowing $\chi$ particles in quasicircular orbits to pass repeatedly through resonant regions, leading to cumulative amplification. This selective process naturally forms a dense ring of $\chi$ particles, with a mass ratio to the cloud fixed by $(\mu_\phi/\mu_\chi)^2$. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism for generating bound-state particles via parametric resonance, which also impacts the evolution of the cloud. This process can be probed through its imprint on binary dynamics and its gravitational-wave signatures.</description>

      <title>Limiting geometry and spectral instability in Schwarzschild--de Sitter spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05370v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the quasinormal mode (QNM) problem in Schwarzschild--de Sitter spacetimes providing a unified infrastructure tailored for studying limiting configurations. Geometrically, we employ the hyperboloidal framework to explicitly implement Geroch's rigorous limiting procedures for families of spacetimes. This enables a controlled transition between Schwarzschild, de Sitter, and Nariai geometries. Numerically, we introduce the analytical mesh refinement technique into quasinormal mode calculations, successfully recovering -- within the appropriate limiting scenarios -- both known families of quasinormal modes: complex light ring modes and purely imaginary de Sitter modes. We interpret these results in terms of spectral instability, where the notions of stable and unstable modes depends on the specific spacetime limit under consideration. In the Schwarzschild limit, de Sitter modes appear as a destabilizing effect on the continuous branch cut at $\omega = 0$. Conversely, the branch cut can be understood as emerging from an infinite accumulation of discrete modes at $\omega = 0$ in the transitional regime. We propose a heuristic measure of QNM density to characterize this accumulation and highlight the need for a more rigorous study of potential branch cut instabilities -- especially relevant in the context of late-time gravitational wave signals. The proposed infrastructure provides a general and extensible framework for investigations in more complex spacetimes, such as Reissner--Nordstr\"om--de Sitter or Kerr--Newman--de Sitter.</description>

      <title>New models of nonsingular black hole dark matter from limiting curvature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18322v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider phenomenological models for nonsingular black holes that satisfy the limiting curvature condition (i.e., that have curvatures that are always sub-Planckian in size) while having a more general dependence on the black hole mass than the most studied examples. These models allow black holes to exist while having regulators that are larger than the horizon scale; it has been shown previously that this can lead to observable consequences in an astrophysical setting, for allowed choices for the regulator scale. Noting that substantial horizon-scale modifications of the metric will affect black hole thermodynamics and Hawking radiation, we study these metrics in the context of primordial black hole dark matter. Considering examples with de\,Sitter and Minkowski cores, respectively, we study the effect of the regulator in these metrics on the allowed black hole mass ranges (or ``bands"), the black hole temperature, specific heat and lifetime, and the bounds on the primordial black hole fraction of the total dark matter density from the observed extragalactic gamma ray background.</description>

Abstract: Landau's criterion for superfluidity is a special case of a broader principle: A moving fluid cannot be stopped by frictional forces if its state of motion is a local minimum of the grand potential. We employ this general thermodynamic criterion to derive a set of inequalities that any superfluid mixture (with an arbitrary number of order parameters) must satisfy for a certain state of motion to be long-lived and unimpeded by friction. These macroscopic constraints complement Landau's original criterion, in that they hold at all temperatures, and remain valid even for gapless superfluids. Unfortunately, they are only necessary conditions for the existence of a frictionless hydrodynamic motion, since they presuppose the validity of a fluid description. However, they do provide sufficient conditions for stability against stochastic hydrodynamic fluctuations. We first formulate our analysis within the framework of General Relativity, and then we take the Newtonian limit.</description>

      <title>Dynamic shadow of a black hole with a self-interacting massive complex scalar hair</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20569v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamic shadows of a black hole with a self-interacting massive complex scalar hair. The complex scalar field \psi evolves with time t, and its magnitude on the apparent horizon |\psi_{h}| starts from zero, undergoes a sharp rise followed by rapid oscillations, and eventually converges to a constant value. The variation in the photon sphere radius r_{ps} is similar to that of the magnitude |\psi_{h}|. Owing to the emergence of the complex scalar hair \psi, the apparent horizon radius r_{h} starts increasing sharply and then smoothly approaches a stable value eventually. The shadow radius R_{sh} of the black hole with an accretion disk increases with time t_{o} at the observer's position. In the absence of an accretion disk, the shadow radius R_{sh} is larger and also increases as t_{o} increases. Furthermore, we slice the dynamical spacetime into spacelike hypersurfaces for all time points t. For the case with an accretion disk, the variation in R_{sh} is similar to that in the apparent horizon r_{h}, because the inner edge of the accretion disk extends to the apparent horizon. In the absence of an accretion disk, the variation in R_{sh} is similar to that in the photon sphere radius r_{ps}, because the black hole shadow boundary is determined by the photon sphere. As the variation in r_{ps} is induced by \psi, it can be stated that the variation in the size of the shadow is similarly caused by the change in \psi. Regardless of the presence or absence of the accretion disk, the emergence of the complex scalar hair \psi causes the radius R_{sh} of the shadow to start changing. Moreover, we investigate the time delay \Delta t of lights propagating from light sources to the observer. These findings not only enrich the theoretical models of dynamic black hole shadows but also provide a foundation for testing black hole spacetime dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Is gravity quantum mechanical? If so, we argue that nonlinear effects in black hole ringdowns - notably second harmonic generation - generates gravitational waves in non-classical states. While quantum features of these states such as sub-Poissonian statistics or entanglement could in principle be measured at interferometric detectors, the tiny coupling of gravity to matter makes this extremely challenging. Drawing on ideas from quantum optics, we instead propose that the nonlinearities in ringdowns could be used as strongly coupled detectors of quantum gravitational radiation, potentially offering a new route to probing the quantum nature of gravity.</description>

      <title>Bouncing Cosmologies in modified gravity with space time torsion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the possibility of realizing a non-singular bounce in the early universe within the framework of modified gravity with spacetime torsion. In Einstein Cartan theory, torsion is embedded in the spacetime by adding an antisymmetric part in affine connection . We consider generalized version of the framework as $f(\bar{R})$, $\bar{R}$ being the scalar of the modified curvature tensor. $f(\bar{R})$ gravity is recast in Einstein frame as non-minimally coupled scalar tensor theory where the scalar field gets coupled with a rank 2 antisymmetric torsion field through derivative couplings. We investigate whether the introduction of three additional torsion-dependent terms in Einstein frame help to realize a bounce. We first explore this cosmological system in the background of a homogeneous and isotropic FRW spacetime but inclusion of the torsion terms are insufficient to produce a bounce in this symmetric setting. Motivated by this limitation, we relax the symmetry and generalize the background to include inhomogeneity and anisotropy. In this setup, the dynamics is modified in such a way that a bouncing solution is possible without invoking phantom fields or energy condition violations. We have found the exact solutions of all the fields and reconstructed the modified gravity form. We have addressed the behaviour of the fields under perturbation and investigated the stability of the solutions. Constraints on the model parameters have also been derived based on cosmological observations.</description>

      <title>Can you fall into a McVittie black hole? Will you survive?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Yes and maybe. In contrast to the fluid particles of this perfect fluid spacetime which follow non-geodesic world-lines and escape to infinity, we prove that freely-falling test particles of McVittie spacetime can reach the black hole horizon in finite proper time. We review the relevant evidence and argue that the fate of an extended test body is less clear. More precisely: we consider expanding McVittie spacetimes with a non-negative cosmological constant. In each member of this class, we identify a region of the spacetime such that an observer following an initially-ingoing timelike geodesic crosses the black hole horizon of the spacetime in a finite amount of proper time. The curvature behaves in interesting ways along these geodesics. In the case of a positive cosmological constant, curvature scalars (of zero, first and second order in derivatives), Jacobi fields and parallel propagated (p.p.) frame components of the curvature remain finite along timelike geodesics running into the black hole horizon. For a vanishing cosmological constant, scalar curvature terms of zero and first order as well as Jacobi fields remain finite in this limit. However, scalar curvature terms of second order diverge, and we show that there are p.p.\ frame components of the curvature tensor that also diverge in this limit. We argue that this casts a doubt as to whether or not an extended test body can survive crossing the black hole horizon in this case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19822v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a novel gravitational configuration formed by a massless real phantom field and an axion scalar field, minimally coupled to gravity. This system describes an Ellis-type wormhole situated at the center of an axion star. By normalizing the mass of the axion field to unity, the physical properties of the model are determined by three independent parameters: the potential's decay constant, the frequency of the axion field, and the wormhole's throat parameter. We assess the traversability of this wormhole by examining the curvature scalars and energy conditions of the static solution. Our analysis of the wormhole's embedding diagrams indicates that, although the wormhole typically exhibits a single-throat geometry, a double-throat configuration featuring an equatorial plane may arise under specific conditions. Finally, an analysis of the null-geodesics reveals the existence of at least one unstable light ring at the wormhole throat.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we discuss the conditions that allow the establishment of an equivalence between $f(R,T)=R+\lambda h(T)$ gravity models and General Relativity (GR) coupled to a modified matter sector. We do so by considering a $D$-dimensional spacetime and the matter sector to be described by nonlinear electrodynamics and/or a scalar field. We find that, for this particular family of models, the action and field equations can indeed be written in terms of a modified matter source within GR. However, when several matter sources are combined, this interpretation is no longer possible if $h(T)$ is a nonlinear function, due to the emergence of crossed terms that mix together the scalar and vector sectors.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Heisenberg-type lower bounds on spacelike hypersurfaces in general relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01628v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive intrinsic Heisenberg-type lower bounds for the canonical momentum uncertainty of scalar quantum states that are strictly localized in geodesic balls $B_{\Sigma}(p,r)$, serving as the position uncertainty, on spacelike hypersurfaces $(\Sigma,h)$ of arbitrary Lorentzian spacetimes. The estimate depends only on the induced Riemannian geometry of the slice; it is independent of the lapse, shift, and extrinsic curvature, and controls the canonical momentum variance/uncertainty $\sigma_p$ by the first Dirichlet eigenvalue of the Laplace-Beltrami operator (Theorem). On weakly mean-convex balls we obtain the universal product inequality $\sigma_p r \ge \hbar/2$. Under the same assumption, a vector-field Barta-type argument improves this universal floor to the scale-invariant bound $\sigma_p r \ge \pi\hbar/2$, which provides a universal, foliation-independent floor. Any further sharpening of the constant requires eigenvalue-comparison results or other curvature-sensitive methods.</description>

      <title>Oscillatons in Scalar-Field Dark Matter from a Full Fourier Expansion of an Exponential Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02878v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real, time-dependent scalar fields can form oscillating, self-gravitating configurations-oscillatonsthat are viable candidates for scalar-field dark matter (SFDM). We revisit oscillatons with an exponential self-interaction and develop a full Fourier (Jacobi{Anger) treatment that resums the time dependence of both the metric and the potential, thereby unifying quadratic, quartic, and higher-order interactions within a single framework. After fixing the small-amplitude normalization V0 = m2 {\Phi}=({\lambda}2k0), we derive a closed, dimensionless boundary-value problem for the radial profiles and solve it numerically via Bessel-series truncation with controlled convergence. We compute time-resolved and time-averaged observables energy density, radial energy flux, radial/tangential pressures, and total mass and map their dependence on the coupling {\lambda} and central amplitude. The geometry exhibits only even harmonics of the fundamental frequency, while composite observables inherit a DC part plus even harmonics; the radial flux oscillates predominantly at 2!. Apparent negative instantaneous pressures arise from coherent oscillations and are assessed consistently through classical energy-condition diagnostics (WEC/NEC/SEC). Our formulation provides a reproducible and extensible baseline for stability analyses and observational constraints on SFDM oscillatons</description>

      <title>Equivalence of scalar-tensor theories and scale-dependent gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04467v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel equivalence between scale-dependent gravity and scalar-tensor theories that have only a single scalar field with a canonical kinetic term in the Einstein frame and a conformal coupling to the metric tensor. In particular, we show that the set of well-behaved scale-dependent gravity theories can be fully embedded into scalar-tensor theories in a unique way. Conversely, there are multiple ways to write a scalar-tensor theory as a scale-dependent theory. This equivalence is established both on the level of the actions and on the level of field equations. We find that, in the context of this equivalence, the scale-setting relation $k(x)$ is naturally promoted to a dynamical field, which is made manifest by including a corresponding kinetic term in the scale-dependent action. In addition, we demonstrate that the new equivalence fits well into the framework of existing equivalences involving the aforementioned theories and $f(R)$-gravity. Finally, we apply the equivalence relations to explicit examples from both scale-dependent gravity and scalar-tensor theories.</description>

      <title>Regularized Black Hole Solution from a New String Cloud Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11419v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a new family of regular black hole solutions supported by the novel Letelier-Alencar string cloud and regularized through a rational Dagum-type distribution. The regulator smooths the matter profile and ensures finite curvature invariants, yielding a geometry that interpolates between a string-cloud exterior and an anti--de Sitter core. We analyze the energy conditions, identifying where the null, weak, dominant and strong conditions hold or fail across the core and exterior. The parameter space for horizon formation is mapped and the thermodynamic propertie -- mass, Hawking temperature, entropy and heat capacity -- are derived; notably, the entropy depends only on the regularization scale while the string parameter modifies temperature and heat capacity. Employing R\'enyi non-extensive entropy and the topological thermodynamics approach, we show the non-extensive deformation stabilizes the system and removes the standard phase transition. Finally, we compute the shadow radius and derive constraints compatible with current Event Horizon Telescope bounds for Sgr~A* and M87*.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recent article, the author of Ref. [EPJC 85 (2025) 1256] constructed an exact solution describing a static, spherically symmetric black hole embedded in a Dehnen-($\alpha, \beta, \gamma$) type dark matter halo with the parameter choice $\alpha=1,\,\beta=4,\,\gamma=1/2$. The author first derived the density profile, which was subsequently integrated to obtain the mass profile, and this mass profile was then employed in constructing the exact metric solution. In this comment, we demonstrate that both the density profile and the mass profile obtained in Ref. [EPJC 85 (2025) 1256] contain fundamental mathematical errors that invalidate the subsequent analysis.</description>

Abstract: We uncover a new gravitational-wave production mechanism in cosmological, first-order, thermal phase transitions. These are usually assumed to proceed via the nucleation of bubbles of the stable phase inside the metastable phase. However, if the nucleation rate is sufficiently suppressed, then the Universe may supercool all the way down the metastable branch and enter the spinodal region. In this case the transition proceeds via the exponential growth of unstable modes and the subsequent formation, merging and relaxation of phase domains. We use holography to follow the real-time evolution of this process in a strongly coupled, four-dimensional gauge theory. The resulting gravitational wave spectrum differs qualitatively from that in transitions mediated by bubble nucleation. We discuss the possibility that the spinodal dynamics may be preceded by a period of thermal inflation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02409v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For most of cosmic history, the evolution of our Universe has been governed by the physics of a 'dark sector', consisting of dark matter and dark energy, whose properties are only understood in a schematic way. The influence of these constituents is mediated exclusively by the force of gravity, meaning that insight into their nature must be gleaned from gravitational phenomena. The advent of gravitational-wave astronomy has revolutionised the field of black hole astrophysics, and opens a new window of discovery for cosmological sources. Relevant examples include topological defects, such as domain walls or cosmic strings, which are remnants of a phase transition. Here we present the first simulations of cosmic structure formation in which the dynamics of the dark sector introduces domain walls as a source of stochastic gravitational waves in the late Universe. We study in detail how the spectrum of gravitational waves is affected by the properties of the model, and extrapolate the results to scales relevant to the recent evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave background. Our relativistic implementation of the field dynamics paves the way for optimal use of the next generation of gravitational experiments to unravel the dark sector.</description>

      <title>Residual neural networks to classify the high frequency emission in core-collapse supernova gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00422v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new methodology to explore the morphology of the High Frequency Feature (HFF), i.e., the dominant, rising-frequency GW emission from a proto-neutron star in core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe). We used a residual neural network (ResNet50) to perform multi-class classification of image samples constructed from time-frequency Morlet wavelet scalograms. We defined a three-class problem by categorizing the HFF slope as Steep, Moderate, or Low, according to physically informed ranges. The ResNet50 model was optimized with phenomenological waveforms injected into real noise from the LIGO-Virgo O3b observing run and then tested with numerically simulated CCSN waveforms embedded in the same real noise. At galactic distances of 1 kpc and 5 kpc with H1 and L1 data and 1 kpc with V1 data, we obtained highly accurate results (test accuracies from 0.8933 to 0.9867), which show the feasibility of our methodology. For further distances, we observed declines in test accuracy until 0.8000 with H1 and L1 data at 10 kpc and until 0.5933 with V1 data at 10 kpc, which we attribute to limitations in the input datasets. Our methodology is sufficiently general to enable early-stage characterization of the HFF in real interferometric data.</description>

      <title>Feynman Diagrams for Matter Wave Interferometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11446v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new theoretical framework based on Feynman diagrams to compute phase shifts in matter wave interferometry. The method allows for analytic computation of higher order quantum corrections, beyond the traditional semi-classical approximation. These additional terms depend on the finite size of the initial matter wavefunction and/or have higher order dependence on $\hbar$. We apply the method to compute the response of matter wave interferometers to power law potentials and potentials with an arbitrary spatial dependence. The analytic expressions are validated by comparing to numerical simulations, and estimates are provided for the scale of the quantum corrections to the phase shift response to the gravitational field of the earth, anharmonic trapping potentials, and gravitational fields from local proof masses. We find that for certain experimentally feasible parameters, these corrections are large enough to be measured, and could lead to systematic errors if not accounted for. We anticipate these corrections will be especially important for trapped matter wave interferometers and for free-space matter wave interferometers in the presence of proof masses. These interferometers are becoming increasingly sensitive tools for mobile inertial sensing, gravity surveying, tests of gravity and its interplay with quantum mechanics, and searches for dark energy.</description>

      <title>Higher-Derivative Corrections via the Double Copy Procedure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05628v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in the off-shell formulation of the Double Copy (DC) procedure have revealed a profound connection between gauge theories and T-duality invariant frameworks. The main example is Double Field Theory (DFT), emerging as the the off-shell DC of Yang-Mills theory up to cubic order in perturbations. Extending this procedure to a higher-derivative gauge theory gives rise to a Higher-Derivative Double Theory (HDDT), which incorporates Weyl gravity along with $b$-field and dilaton contributions, all in a T-duality invariant manner. In this work, we show that the quadratic contributions of HDDT are directly related (up to field redefinitions) to DFT+, a T-duality invariant model associated with the bosonic string that incorporates first-order $\alpha'$ corrections upon parameterization. Our results expand the potential applications of the off-shell DC program towards constructing perturbative $\alpha'$-corrected Lagrangians, while also opening up possibilities for reversing the map by considering the single and zeroth copies.</description>

Abstract: The stochastic gravitational-wave background originating from cosmic sources contains vital information about the early universe. In this work, we comprehensively study the cross-correlations between the energy-density anisotropies in scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) and the temperature anisotropies and polarization in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). In our analysis of the angular power spectra for these cross-correlations, we consider all contributions of the local-type primordial non-Gaussianity $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$ and $g_{\mathrm{NL}}$ that can lead to large anisotropies. We show that the angular power spectra are highly sensitive to primordial non-Gaussianity. Furthermore, we project the sensitivity of future gravitational-wave detectors to detect such signals and, consequently, measure the primordial non-Gaussianity.</description>

      <title>Constraining Axion Dark Matter with Galactic-Centre Resonant Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08709v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the influence of fuzzy-dark-matter cores on the orbits of stars at the Galactic centre. This dark matter candidate condenses into dense, solitonic cores, and, if a super-massive black hole is present at the centre of such a core, its central part forms a `gravitational atom'. Here, we calculate the atom's contribution to the gravitational potential felt by a Galactic-centre star, for a general state of the atom. We study the angular-momentum dynamics this potential induces, and show that it is similar to vector resonant relaxation. Its influence is found to be potentially sufficiently strong that such a dynamical component should be accounted for in Galactic-centre modelling. For the Milky Way, the atom is expected to have some spherical asymmetry, and we use this to derive a stability condition for the disc of young, massive stars at the Galactic centre - if the atom's mass is too large, then the disc would be destroyed. Thus, the existence of this disc constrains the mass of the particles comprising the solitonic core. We study an example model of the core, where all of the rotation of the core's inner region is assumed to come from an $l=1$ state, and its amplitude is determined by the halo's spin parameter; such a core is found to be in tension with the stability of the clockwise stellar disc for $4.2\times 10^{-20}\,\textrm{eV} \leq m_a \leq 5.4\times 10^{-20}\,\textrm{eV}$ at $2\sigma$. Other core models would vary the constrained values of $m_a$ somewhat. These constraints will tighten significantly with future, improved data.</description>

Abstract: Type Ia supernovae (SNe\,Ia) serve as crucial cosmological distance indicators because of their empirical consistency in peak luminosity and characteristic light curve decline rates. These properties facilitate them to be standardized candles for the determination of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) within late-time universe cosmology. Nevertheless, a statistically significant difference persists between $H_0$ values derived from early and late-time measurements, a phenomenon known as the Hubble tension. Furthermore, recent observations have identified a subset of over-luminous SNe\,Ia, characterized by peak luminosities exceeding the nominal range and faster decline rates. These discoveries raise questions regarding the reliability of SNe\,Ia as standard candles for measuring cosmological distances. In this article, we present the Bayesian analysis of 15 over-luminous SNe\,Ia and show that they yield a lower $H_0$ estimate due to the increase in their absolute magnitude. This investigation potentially represents a step toward addressing the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the lepton asymmetry from DESI DR2 BAO data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09624v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is important to explore the potential existence of lepton asymmetry in the neutrino sector. Conducting a joint analysis of DESI DR2 BAO data and \emph{Planck} 2018 CMB data, we obtain the upper limits on the neutrino degeneracy parameter, i.e., $\xi&lt;0.56$ for the normal mass hierarchy while $\xi&lt;0.62$ for the inverted mass hierarchy, at 95\% confidence level. Considering the influence of the dynamical dark energy, we find that these upper limits remain to be robust. This work may provide helpful implications for model buildings of the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe.</description>

      <title>Hints for a Geon from Causal Dynamic Triangulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11047v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The existence of geons, physical states of self-bound gravitons, has long been proposed. In the context of four-dimensional causal dynamical triangulation simulations we investigate this possibility by measuring curvature-curvature correlators of different gravitational operators. We find a behavior consistent with a massive state, independent of the operators considered, over a certain distance window. While at most a hint, this is tantalizing due to its possible implications for dark matter or (primordial) black holes. We also find indications that the phase of rapid expansion of the obtained de Sitter universe impacts the mass, and relates to quantum fluctuations of space-time.</description>

      <title>A theoretical prediction for the dipole in nearby distances using cosmography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01095v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmography is a widely applied method to infer kinematics of the Universe at small cosmological scales while remaining agnostic about the theory of gravity at play. Usually cosmologists invoke the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric in cosmographic analyses, however generalised approaches allow for analyses outside of any assumed geometrical model. These methods have great promise to be able to model-independently map the cosmic neighborhood where the Universe has not yet converged to isotropy. In this regime, anisotropies can bias parameter inferences if they are not accounted for, and thus must be included for precision cosmology analyses, even when the principle aim is to infer the background cosmology. In this paper, we develop a method to predict the dipole in luminosity distances that arises due to nearby inhomogeneities. This is the leading-order correction to the standard isotropic distance-redshift law. Within a very broad class of general-relativistic universe models, we provide an interpretation of the dipole in terms of the gradients in expansion rate and density which is free from any underlying background cosmology. We use numerical relativity simulations, with improved initial data methods, alongside fully relativistic ray tracing to test the power of our prediction. We find our prediction accurately captures the dipole signature in our simulations to within ~10% for redshifts $z\lesssim 0.07$ in reasonably smooth simulations. In the presence of more non-linear density fields, we find this reduces to $z\lesssim 0.02$. This represents up to an order of magnitude improvement with respect to what is achieved by naive, local cosmography-based predictions. Our paper thus addresses important issues regarding convergence properties of anisotropic cosmographic series expansions that would otherwise limit their applicability to very narrow redshift ranges.</description>

      <title>Character of the highest weight module of BMS algebra realized on codimensional-two boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10137v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the highest weight representation (HWR) of the three and four-dimensional Bondi-Metzner-Sachs (BMS) algebra realized on the codimension-two boundary of asymptotic flat spacetime (AFS). In such a realization, the action of supertranslation shifts the conformal weight of the highest-weight states. As a result, there is no extra quantum number relating to the supertranslation. We construct the highest-weight BMS modules and compute their characters. We show that the BMS$_3$ highest-weight vacuum character with special value of central charges coincides with the 1-loop partition function of three-dimensional asymptotic flat gravity, up to an overall phase factor ``$i$''. We expect the vacuum character of BMS$_4$ may shed light on the flat holography in four dimensions.</description>

      <title>Testing signatures of phantom crossing through full-shape galaxy clustering analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13989v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent observations of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey, when combined with measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and Type Ia supernovae (SNIa), provide compelling evidence for a phantom crossing at late times, along with statistically significant deviations from the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. In this work, we investigate the role of redshift-space galaxy clustering data by employing the pre-reconstruction full-shape (FS) galaxy power spectrum from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) data release 12 (DR12) sample. This dataset is analyzed in combination with BAO measurements from DESI data release 2 (DR2) and various SNIa samples. Our analysis demonstrates that the joint combination of these datasets can yield deviations from $\Lambda$CDM at a significance level of up to $\sim 5\sigma$, suggesting strong indications that the dark energy equation of state parameter $w(z)$ may have crossed the phantom divide ($w = -1$) in the redshift range $z \sim 0.4$-$0.5$. The precise location and strength of this crossing depend on the adopted theoretical parameterizations. Importantly, our results reveal that this trend persists even in the absence of CMB data, underscoring the robustness of the FS power spectrum as a powerful and independent probe for testing dark energy models and for distinguishing between competing cosmological scenarios.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Inference of Gravity through Realistic 3D Modeling of Wide Binary Orbits: General Algorithm and a Pilot Study with HARPS Radial Velocities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11996v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When 3D relative displacement $\mathbf{r}$ and velocity $\mathbf{v}$ between the pair in a gravitationally-bound system are precisely measured, the six measured quantities at one phase can allow elliptical orbit solutions at a given gravitational parameter $G$. Due to degeneracies between orbital-geometric parameters and $G$, individual Bayesian inferences and their statistical consolidation are needed to infer $G$ as recently suggested by a Bayesian 3D modeling algorithm. Here I present a fully general Bayesian algorithm suitable for wide binaries with two (almost) exact sky-projected relative positions (as in the Gaia data release 3) and the other four sufficiently precise quantities. Wide binaries meeting the requirements of the general algorithm to allow for its full potential are rare at present, largely because the measurement uncertainty of the line-of-sight (radial) separation is usually larger than the true separation. As a pilot study, the algorithm is applied to 32 Gaia binaries for which precise HARPS radial velocities are available. The value of $\Gamma \equiv \log_{10}\sqrt{G/G_{\rm N}}$ (where $G_{\rm N}$ is Newton's constant) is $-0.002_{-0.018}^{+0.012}$ supporting Newton for a combination of 24 binaries with Newtonian acceleration $g_{\rm N}&gt;10^{-9}$m s$^{-2}$, while it is $\Gamma=0.134_{-0.036}^{+0.056}$ (thermal prior on eccentricity) or $0.115_{-0.028}^{+0.048}$ (flat prior) for 8 binaries with $g_{\rm N}&lt;10^{-9}$m s$^{-2}$. The $&gt;3.7\sigma$ discrepancy with Newton is significantly contributed by one system whose relative 3D velocity between the pair exceeds the Newtonian escape velocity. This system is not likely to be a chance association but may be consistent with modified gravity. The pilot study demonstrates the potential of the algorithm in measuring gravity at low acceleration with future samples of wide binaries.</description>

      <title>Machine learning classification of black holes in the mass--spin diagram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14316v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the mass--spin diagram for classifying black holes and studying their formation pathways providing an analogue to the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. This allows for black hole evolutionary tracks as a function of redshift, combining formation, accretion, and merger histories for the variety of black hole populations. A realistic black hole continuum constructed from initial mass and spin functions and approximate redshift evolution reveals possible black hole main sequences, such as sustained coherent accretion through cosmic time or hierarchical merger trees. In the stellar-mass regime, we use a binary population synthesis software to compare three spin prescriptions for tidal evolution of Wolf-Rayet progenitors, showing how the mass--spin diagram exposes interesting modeling differences. We then classify black hole populations by applying supervised and unsupervised machine learning clustering methods to mass--spin datasets. While bare unsupervised clustering can nearly recover canonical population boundaries (stellar-mass, intermediate-mass, and supermassive), a more sophisticated approach utilizing deep learning via variational autoencoders for latent space representation learning aids in clustering of realistic datasets with subclasses that highly overlap in mass--spin space. We find that a supervised random forest can accurately recover the correct clusters from the learned latent space representation depending on the complexity of the underlying dataset, semi-supervised methods show potential for further development, and the performance of unsupervised classifiers is a great challenge. Our findings motivate future machine learning applications and demonstrate that the mass--spin diagram can be used to connect gravitational-wave and electromagnetic observations with theoretical models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11919v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work considers how exponential corrections to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula affect the thermodynamic behavior of the FLRW cosmological model. These corrections drastically change the form of the Friedman field equations inducing non-trivial phase transition behavior. For negative values of the trace parameter $\alpha$, the system presents first-order phase transitions above the critical temperature, and for positive $\alpha$, the system undergoes a reentrant phase transition. As these corrections are presumably relevant at the early Universe stage, to corroborate the presence of some potential vestige of this contribution in the current era, a study has been carried out comparing observational data and current values of the Hubble parameter.</description>

      <title>New formalism for perturbations of massive gravity theories around arbitrary background spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15055v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a new technique for studying the perturbations of dRGT-type massive gravity theories around arbitrary background spacetimes. Built initially from the vielbein formulation of the theory, but switching back to the metric formulation afterwards, our approach bypasses many of the complications that arise in previous metric formulation approaches to linearising massive gravity around generic backgrounds, naturally elucidates the ghost-free structure of the interactions, and readily generalises to higher orders in perturbation theory, as well as to multiple interacting metric tensor fields. To demonstrate the power of our technique, we apply our formalism to a number of commonly occurring example backgrounds - proportional, cosmological, and black hole - recovering and extending many known results from the literature at linear order. Lastly, we provide, for the first time, the cubic order multi-gravity potential around a generic background spacetime.</description>

      <title>Nearly Monochromatic Primordial Black Holes as total Dark Matter from Bubble Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19233v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a two-field model where the inflaton $\chi$ is non-minimally coupled to the instanton $\phi$. By choosing an appropriate coupling function, we realize the scenario where the difference of the values of potential between false vacuum (FV) and true vacuum (TV) is maximized during inflation. Most of the bubbles are created at this time. After inflation ends, the potential value of FV drops below that of TV so that these bubbles collapse to form primordial black holes (PBHs). By tuning the parameters of our model, we analyze the Coleman-de Luccia (CDL) and Hawking-Moss (HM) process, finding that the corresponding mass function of PBHs is sharply peaked, implying that we can realize either PBHs as cold dark matter, sub-solar PBHs, or supermassive PBHs in this scenario without enhancement of primordial curvature perturbations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26764v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this letter we show that the one-loop QCD $\beta$-function can be obtained from an index theorem on twistor space. This is achieved by recalling that the $\theta$-angle of self-dual gauge theory flows according the one-loop $\beta$-function. Rewriting self-dual gauge theory as a holomorphic theory on twistor space this flow can be computed as the anomaly to scale invariance. The one-loop Weyl anomaly coefficient $a-c$ can be recovered similarly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12886v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the problem of bulk metric reconstruction in holography by leveraging the inverse scattering framework applied to boundary two-point correlation functions. We generalize our previous work of scalar field and show that reconstruction can be achieved using a single operator rather than a pair. We also apply this method into reconstruction of static homogeneous anisotropic black holes and the reconstruction using correlation function of gauge field. In addition, we analyze the method's robustness under measurement noise and propose filtering strategies to improve reconstruction accuracy. This work advances data-driven bulk reconstruction by providing a concrete, experimentally viable pathway to recover spacetime geometry from field-theoretic observables.</description>

      <title>Entanglement first law for timelike entanglement entropy and linearized Einstein's equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17098v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the entanglement first law of conformal field theory (CFT) to timelike subregions. Focusing on intervals along the time direction of the boundary CFT, we show that the associated timelike entanglement entropy obeys a first-law-like relation, with an effective entanglement temperature inversely proportional to the temporal size of the interval. By implementing a double Wick rotation, we obtain the exact modular Hamiltonian for a suitable hyperbolic subsystem and use it to formulate the timelike entanglement first law precisely. Our central result is a detailed proof that, in asymptotically Anti-de Sitter spacetime, this timelike entanglement first law is equivalent to linearized Einstein's equations in the bulk: the first law follows from the linearized equations and, conversely, implies them. Our result further reveal the dynamical connections between entanglement and gravity.</description>
