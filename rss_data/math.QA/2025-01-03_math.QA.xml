      <title>Group Invariant Quantum Latin Squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantum Latin square is an $n \times n$ array of unit vectors where each row and column forms an orthonormal basis of a fixed complex vector space. We introduce the notion of $(G,G')$-invariant quantum Latin squares for finite groups $G$ and $G'$. These are quantum Latin squares with rows and columns indexed by $G$ and $G'$ respectively such that the inner product of the $a,b$-entry with the $c,d$-entry depends only on $a^{-1}c \in G$ and $b^{-1}d \in G'$. This definition is motivated by the notion of group invariant bijective correlations introduced in [Roberson \&amp; Schmidt (2020)], and every group invariant quantum Latin square produces a group invariant bijective correlation, though the converse does not hold. In this work we investigate these group invariant quantum Latin squares and their corresponding correlations. Our main result is that, up to applying a global isometry to every vector in a $(G,G')$-invariant quantum Latin square, there is a natural bijection between these objects and trace and conjugate transpose preserving isomorphisms between the group algebras of $G$ and $G'$. This in particular proves that a $(G,G')$-invariant quantum Latin square exists if and only if the multisets of degrees of irreducible representations are equal for $G$ and $G'$. Another motivation for this line of work is that whenever Cayley graphs for groups $G$ and $G'$ are quantum isomorphic, then there is a $(G,G')$-invariant quantum correlation witnessing this, and thus it suffices to consider such correlations when searching for quantum isomorphic Cayley graphs. Given a group invariant quantum correlation, we show how to construct all pairs of graphs for which it gives a quantum isomorphism.</description>

      <title>New Weighted Spectral Geometric Mean and Quantum Divergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new class of weighted spectral geometric means has recently been introduced. In this paper, we present its inequalities in terms of the L\"{o}wner order, operator norm, and trace. Moreover, we establish a log-majorization relationship between the new spectral geometric mean, and the R\'{e}nyi relative operator entropy. We also give the quantum divergence of the quantity, given by the difference of trace values between the arithmetic mean and new spectral geometric mean. Finally, we study the barycenter that minimizes the weighted sum of quantum divergences for given variables.</description>

      <title>In Search of a Hidden Curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three enumeration problems are discussed in these lectures. One is a detailed account on simple Hurwitz numbers, explaining how the problem was solved by discovering a key curve. This key ignites the generating functions of Hurwitz numbers and drives them into polynomials. The unexpected polynomiality then brings us simple proofs of the Witten-Kontsevich theorem and the $\lambda_g$-theorem of Faber-Pandharipande. An analogous problem associated with Catalan numbers is also presented, which has a simpler feature in terms of analysis. The third enumeration problem is a quest of identifying a hidden curve behind the Ap\'ery sequence, which remains to be discovered.
  It is examined how a counting problem leads to a \emph{spectral curve} through a differential equation, of Picard-Fuchs type but can be nonlinear. The counting problem is a geometric question associated with the \emph{genus $0$, one marked point} case. Going from the $(0,1)$-case to arbitrary $(g,n)$-case is explained as a process of \emph{quantization} of the spectral curve.
  This perspective of quantization is discussed in a geometric setting, when the differential equations have holomorphic coefficients, in terms of Higgs bundles, opers, and Gaiotto's conformal limit construction. In this context, however, there are no counting problems behind the scene.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize the Hernandez-Jimbo category O of representations of Borel subalgebras of quantum affine groups to the case of quantum loop algebras for arbitrary Kac-Moody g (as well as related algebras, such as quantum toroidal gl_1). Moreover, we give explicit shuffle algebra descriptions of simple modules in category O, which provide tools for the computation of q-characters that are new even in finite types.</description>

      <title>The distinguished invertible object as ribbon dualizing object in the Drinfeld center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.07910v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the Drinfeld center $Z(\mathcal{C})$ of a pivotal finite tensor category $\mathcal{C}$ comes with the structure of a ribbon Grothendieck-Verdier category in the sense of Boyarchenko-Drinfeld. Phrased operadically, this makes $Z(\mathcal{C})$ into a cyclic algebra over the framed $E_2$-operad. The underlying object of the dualizing object is the distinguished invertible object of $\mathcal{C}$ appearing in the well-known Radford isomorphism of Etingof-Nikshych-Ostrik. Up to equivalence, this is the unique ribbon Grothendieck-Verdier structure on $Z(\mathcal{C})$ extending the canonical balanced braided structure that $Z(\mathcal{C})$ already comes equipped with. The duality functor of this ribbon Grothendieck-Verdier structure coincides with the rigid duality if and only if $\mathcal{C}$ is spherical in the sense of Douglas-Schommer-Pries-Snyder. The main topological consequence of our algebraic result is that $Z(\mathcal{C})$ gives rise to an ansular functor, in fact even a modular functor regardless of whether $\mathcal{C}$ is spherical or not. In order to prove the aforementioned uniqueness statement for the ribbon Grothendieck-Verdier structure, we derive a seven-term exact sequence characterizing the space of ribbon Grothendieck-Verdier structures on a balanced braided category. This sequence features the Picard group of the balanced version of the M\"uger center of the balanced braided category.</description>

      <title>A lower bound for the genus of a knot using the Links-Gould invariant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15617v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Links-Gould invariant of links $LG^{2,1}$ is a two-variable generalization of the Alexander-Conway polynomial. Using representation theory of $U_{q}\mathfrak{gl}(2 \vert 1)$, we prove that the degree of the Links-Gould polynomial provides a lower bound on the Seifert genus of any knot, therefore improving the bound known as the Seifert inequality in the case of the Alexander invariant. One practical consequence of this new genus bound is a straightforward proof of the fact that the Kinoshita-Terasaka and Conway knots have genus greater or equal to 2.</description>

      <title>Symplectic Differential Reduction Algebras and Generalized Weyl Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15968v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a map $\Xi\colon U(\mathfrak{g})\rightarrow A$ of associative algebras, with $U(\mathfrak{g})$ the universal enveloping algebra of a (complex) finite-dimensional reductive Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$, the restriction functor from $A$-modules to $U(\mathfrak{g})$-modules is intimately tied to the representation theory of an $A$-subquotient known as the reduction algebra with respect to $(A,\mathfrak{g},\Xi)$. Herlemont and Ogievetsky described differential reduction algebras for the general linear Lie algebra $\mathfrak{gl}(n)$ as algebras of deformed differential operators. Their map $\Xi$ is a realization of $\mathfrak{gl}(n)$ in the $N$-fold tensor product of the $n$-th Weyl algebra tensored with $U(\mathfrak{gl}(n))$. In this paper, we further the study of differential reduction algebras by finding a presentation in the case when $\mathfrak{g}$ is the symplectic Lie algebra of rank two and $\Xi$ is a canonical realization of $\mathfrak{g}$ inside the second Weyl algebra tensor the universal enveloping algebra of $\mathfrak{g}$, suitably localized. Furthermore, we prove that this differential reduction algebra is a generalized Weyl algebra (GWA), in the sense of Bavula, of a new type we term skew-affine. It is believed that symplectic differential reduction algebras are all skew-affine GWAs; then their irreducible weight modules could be obtained from standard GWA techniques.</description>
