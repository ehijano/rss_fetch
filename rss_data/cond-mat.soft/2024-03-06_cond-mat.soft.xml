      <title>Percolation of nonequilibrium assemblies of colloidal particles in active chiral liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing interest in the non-equilibrium assembly of colloidal particles in active liquids is driven by the motivation to create novel structures endowed with tunable properties unattainable within the confines of equilibrium systems. Here, we present an experimental investigation of the structural features of colloidal assemblies in active liquids of chiral E. coli. The colloidal particles form dynamic clusters due to the effective interaction mediated by active media. The activity and chirality of the swimmers strongly influence the dynamics and local ordering of colloidal particles, resulting in clusters with persistent rotation, whose structure differs significantly from those in equilibrium systems with attractive interactions, such as colloid-polymer mixtures. The colloid-bacteria mixture displays several hallmark features of a percolation transition at a critical density, where the clusters span the system size. However, a closer examination of the critical exponents associated with cluster size distribution, average cluster size, and correlation length in the vicinity of the critical density suggest strong deviations from the prediction of the standard continuum percolation model. Therefore, our experiments reveal a richer phase behavior of colloidal assemblies in active liquids.</description>

      <title>Absorbing-state transitions in particulate systems under spatially varying driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the absorbing state transition in particulate systems under spatially inhomogeneous driving using a modified random organization model. For smoothly varying driving the steady state results map onto the homogeneous absorbing state phase diagram, with the position of the boundary between absorbing and diffusive states being insensitive to the driving wavelength. Here the phenomenology is well-described by a one-dimensional continuum model that we pose. For discontinuously varying driving the position of the absorbing phase boundary and the exponent characterising the fraction of active particles are altered relative to the homogeneous case.</description>

      <title>On the onset of slip at adhesive elastic interfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition from static to dynamic friction when an elastic body is slid over another is now known to result from the motion of interface rupture fronts. These fronts may be either crack-like or pulse-like, with the latter involving reattachment in the wake of the front. How and why these fronts occur remains a subject of active theoretical and experimental investigation, given its wide ranging implications for a range of problems in tribology. In this work, we investigate this question using an elastic lattice-network representation; bulk and interface bonds are simulated to deform and, in the latter case, break and reform dynamically in response to an applied remote displacement. We find that, contrary to the oft-cited rigid body scenario with Coulomb-type friction laws, the type of rupture front observed depends intimately on the location of the applied boundary condition. Depending on whether the sliding solid is pulled, pushed or sheared -- all equivalent applications in the rigid case -- distinct interface rupture modes can occur. We quantify these rupture modes, evaluate the interface stresses that lead to their formation, and and study their subsequent propagation dynamics. A strong analogy between the sliding friction problem and mode II fracture emerges from our results, with attendant wave speeds ranging from slow to Rayleigh. We discuss how these fronts mediate interface motion and implications for the general transition mechanism from static to dynamic friction.</description>

      <title>Structural origin of relaxation in dense colloidal suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amorphous solids relax via slow molecular rearrangement induced by thermal fluctuations or applied stress. Although microscopic structural signatures predicting these structural relaxations have long been sought, a physically motivated structural measure relevant to diverse systems remains elusive. Here, we introduce a structural order parameter derived from the mean-field caging potential experienced by the particles due to their neighbors, which reliably predicts the occurrence of structural relaxations. The parameter, derived from density functional theory, is a measure of susceptibility to particle rearrangements that can effectively identify weak or defect-like regions in disordered systems. Using experiments on dense colloidal suspensions, we demonstrate a causal relationship between this order parameter and the structural relaxations of the amorphous solid. In quiescent suspensions, increasing the density leads to stronger correlations between the structure and dynamics. Under applied shear, the mean structural order parameter increases with increasing strain, signaling shear-induced softening, which is accompanied by the proliferation of plastic events. In both cases, the order parameter reliably identifies weak regions where the plastic rearrangements due to thermal fluctuation or applied shear preferentially occur. Our study paves the way to a structural understanding of the relaxation of a wide range of amorphous solids, from suspensions to metallic glasses.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of magnetic self-propelled particles in a harmonic trap</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial active particles, exemplified by Hexbugs (HB), serve as valuable tools for investigating the intricate dynamics of active matter systems. Leveraging their stochastic motion, Hexbugs provides an excellent experimental model. In this study, we utilize Hexbugs equipped with disk-like armor and embedded magnetic dipoles, transforming them into Magnetic Self-Propelled Particles (MSPP). We explore the emergence of collective and stationary states numerically and experimentally by confining these MSPPs within a parabolic domain acting as a harmonic potential. Our findings unveil a diverse range of metastable configurations intricately linked to the complex dynamics inherent in the system. We discern that particle number, activity, and the balance between magnetic and harmonic potential strengths predominantly influence the metastability of these structures. By employing these parameters as control factors, we compare and contrast the behavior of MSPPs with disk-like magnetic Active Brownian Particles (ABPs) in the overdamped limit of vanishing inertia. Our numerical predictions reproduce most of the experimental observations, highlighting the crucial role of magnetic dipole interactions in developing novel configurations for active particles within parabolic domains. These configurations include chains, clusters, and vortex formations characterized by a specific pattern in the particle spatial distribution. Notably, we observe that the influence of inertia is not fundamental in generating metastable configurations in these confined systems. Instead, the particle's shape, activity, and orientation are dominant factors. This comparative analysis provides insights into the distinctive features and dynamics of MSPP within confined environments, shedding light on the role of short-range polar interactions.</description>

      <title>Periodic Cylindrical Bilayers Self-Assembled from Diblock Polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amphiphilic polymers in aqueous solutions can self-assemble to form bilayer membranes, and their elastic properties can be captured by the well-known Helfrich model involving several elastic constants. In this paper, we employ the self-consistent field model to simulate sinusoidal bilayers self-assembled from diblock copolymers where a proper constraint term is introduced to stabilize periodic bilayers with prescribed amplitudes. Then, we devise several methods to extract the shape of these bilayers and examine the accuracy of the free energy predicted by the Helfrich model. Numerical results show that when the bilayer curvature is small, the Helfrich model predicts the excess free energy more accurately. However, when the curvature is large, the accuracy heavily depends on the method used to determine the shape of the bilayer. In addition, the dependence of free energy on interaction strength, constraint amplitude, and constraint period are systematically studied. Moreover, we obtain certain periodic cylindrical bilayers that are equilibrium states of the self-consistent field model, which agree with the theoretical predictions made by the shape equations.</description>

      <title>Numerical studies of triangulated vesicles with anisotropic membrane inclusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we implement the deviatoric curvature model to examine dynamically triangulated surfaces with anisotropic membrane inclusions. The Monte-Carlo numerical scheme is devised to not only minimize the total bending energy of the membrane but also the in-plane nematic order of the inclusions by considering the mismatch between the curvature of the membrane and the intrinsic curvature of the inclusion. Neighboring inclusions can either attract with nearest-neighbor interaction or with a nematic interaction derived from liquid crystal theory. Orientational order determines whether vesicles fully covered with inclusions result in bulbs connected by necks or long tubes. Remarkably, when inclusions on vesicles with no vacancies interact non-nematically, a spontaneous local order can lead to a bulb transition which may have implications in cell or organelle division. Furthermore we find that average nematic order is inversely proportional to the number of thin necks formed in the vesicles. Our method shows good convergence and is suitable for further upgrades, for example to vesicles constrained by volume.</description>

      <title>Mesoscale simulations of diffusion and sedimentation in shape-anisotropic nanoparticle suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the long-time self-diffusion coefficient and sedimentation coefficient for suspensions of nanoparticles with anisotropic shapes (octahedra, cubes, tetrahedra, and spherocylinders) as a function of nanoparticle concentration using mesoscale simulations. We use a discrete particle model for the nanoparticles, and we account for solvent-mediated hydrodynamic interactions between nanoparticles using the multiparticle collision dynamics method. Our simulations are compared to theoretical predictions and experimental data from existing literature, demonstrating good agreement in the majority of cases. Further, we find that the self-diffusion coefficient of the regular polyhedral shapes can be estimated from that of a sphere whose diameter is average of their inscribed and circumscribed sphere diameters.</description>

      <title>Topological balance of cell distributions in plane monolayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most of normal proliferative epithelia of plants and metazoans are topologically invariant and characterized by similar cell distributions according to the number of cell neighbors (DCNs). Here we study peculiarities of these distributions and explain why the DCN obtained from the location of intercellular boundaries and that based on the Voronoi tessellation with nodes located on cell nuclei may differ from each other. As we demonstrate, special microdomains where four or more intercellular boundaries converge are topologically charged. Using this fact, we deduce a new equation describing the topological balance of the DCNs. The developed theory is applied for a series of microphotographs of non-tumoral epithelial cells of the human cervix (HCerEpiC) to improve the image processing near the edges of microphotographs and reveal the topological invariance of the examined monolayers. Special contact microdomains may be present in epithelia of various natures, however, considering the well-known vertex model of epithelium, we show that such contacts are absent in the usual solid-like state of the model and appear only in the liquid-like cancer state. Also, we discuss a possible biological role of special contacts in context of proliferative epithelium dynamics and tissue morphogenesis.</description>

      <title>Shear-enhanced Liquid Crystal Spinning of Conjugated Polymer Fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conjugated polymer fibers can be used to manufacture various soft fibrous optoelectronic devices, significantly advancing wearable devices and smart textiles. Recently, conjugated polymer-based fibrous electronic devices have been widely used in energy conversion, electrochemical sensing, and human-machine interaction. However, the insufficient mechanical properties of conjugated polymer fibers, the difficulty in solution processing semiconductors with rigid main chains, and the challenges in large-scale continuous production have limited their further development in the wearable field. We regulated the pi - pi stacking interactions in conjugated polymer molecules below their critical liquid crystal concentration by applying fluid shear stress. We implemented secondary orientation, leading to the continuous fabrication of anisotropic semiconductor fibers. This strategy enables conjugated polymers with rigid backbones to synergistically enhance the mechanical and semiconductor properties of fibers through liquid crystal spinning. Furthermore, conjugated polymer fibers, exhibiting excellent electrochemical performance and high mechanical strength (600 MPa) that essentially meet the requirements for industrialized preparation, maintain stability under extreme temperatures, radiation, and chemical reagents. Lastly, we have demonstrated logic circuits using semiconductor fiber organic electrochemical transistors, showcasing its application potential in the field of wearable fabric-style logic processing. These findings confirm the importance of the liquid crystalline state and solution control in optimizing the performance of conjugated polymer fibers, thus paving the way for developing a new generation of soft fiber semiconductor devices.</description>

      <title>Stretch-independent magnetization in incompressible magnetorheological elastomers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we perform a critical examination of the phenomenon where the magnetization is stretch-independent in incompressible hard-magnetic magnetorheological elastomers (h-MREs), as observed in several recent experimental and numerical investigations. We demonstrate that the fully dissipative model proposed by Mukherjee et al. (2021) may be reduced, under physically consistent assumptions, to that of Yan et al. (2023), but not that of Zhao et al. (2019). In cases where the h-MRE solid undergoes non-negligible stretching, the model of Zhao et al. (2019) provides predictions that are in disagreement with experimental observations, given that, by construction, that model produces a magnetization response that is not stretch-independent. By contrast, the other two models are able to describe this important feature present in h-MREs, as well as in incompressible magnetically soft s-MRES. Note that in cases where stretching is negligible, such as for inextensible slender structures under bending deformation, the Zhao et al. (2019) model provides accurate predictions despite its underlying assumptions. Additionally, our analysis reveals two key points about the magnetization vector in the context of the more general, fully dissipative model. First, the magnetization can be related to an internal variable in that theory. However, it cannot be formally used as an internal variable except in the special case of an ideal magnet, and, as such, it is subject to constitutive assumptions. Furthermore, we clarify that the magnetization vector alone is insufficient to describe entirely the magnetic response of an MRE solid; instead, the introduction of one of the original Maxwell fields is always necessary for a complete representation.</description>

      <title>Effect of particle stiffness and surface properties on the nonlinear viscoelasticity of dense microgel suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particle surface chemistry and internal softness are two fundamental parameters in governing the mechanical properties of dense colloidal suspensions, dictating structure and flow, therefore of interest from materials fabrication to processing. Here, we modulate softness by tuning the crosslinker content of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) microgels, and we adjust their surface properties by co-polymerization with polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains, controlling adhesion, friction and fuzziness. We investigate the distinct effects of these parameters on the entire mechanical response from restructuring to complete fluidization of jammed samples at varying packing fractions under large-amplitude oscillatory shear experiments, and we complement rheological data with colloidal-probe atomic force microscopy to unravel variations in the particles' surface properties. We find that surface properties play a fundamental role at smaller packings; decreasing adhesion and friction at contact causes the samples to yield and fluidify in a lower deformation range. Instead, increasing softness or fuzziness has a similar effect at ultra-high densities, making suspensions able to better adapt to the applied shear and reach complete fluidization over a larger deformation range. These findings shed new light on the single-particle parameters governing the mechanical response of dense suspensions subjected to deformation, offering synthetic approaches to design materials with tailored mechanical properties.</description>

      <title>Statistical modeling of equilibrium phase transition in confined fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phase transition of confined fluids in mesoporous materials deviates from that of bulk fluids due to the former's interactions with the surrounding heterogeneous structure. For example, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) create a strong heterogeneous field, so adsorbed fluids in MOFs have atypical phase characteristics such as capillary condensation and higher-order phase transitions. These characteristics are modeled by decoupling the host-guest and guest-guest interactions as a many-body problem in the presence of an external nonuniform field. To solve the three-dimensional Ising model, we use mean-field theory to approximate the guest-guest interactions and Mayer's (f)-functions to describe the host-guest interactions in a unit cell. Later, using Hill's theory of nanothermodynamics, we define differential and integral thermodynamic functions to describe confined fluids. These integral properties are then used to understand the phase transition in confined fluids. The investigation reveals a distinct behavior where fluids confined in larger pores undergo a discontinuous (first-order) phase transition, whereas those confined in smaller pores undergo a continuous (higher-order) phase transition. Furthermore, the results indicate that the free-energy barrier for phase transitions is lower in confined fluids than in bulk fluids, which helps explain the lower condensation pressure relative to the bulk saturation pressure. Finally, the integral thermodynamic functions are succinctly presented in the form of a phase diagram, marking an initial step toward a more practical approach for understanding the phase behavior of confined fluids.</description>

      <title>Phase Behavior and Dynamics of Active Brownian Particles in an Alignment Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-propelled particles that are subject to noise are a well-established generic model system for active matter. A homogeneous alignment field can be used to orient the direction of the self-propulsion velocity and to model systems like phoretic Janus particles with a magnetic dipole moment or magnetotactic bacteria in an external magnetic field. Computer simulations are used to predict the phase behavior and dynamics of self-propelled Brownian particles in a homogeneous alignment field in two dimensions. Phase boundaries of the gas-liquid coexistence region are calculated for various P\'eclet numbers, particle densities, and alignment field strengths. Critical points and exponents are calculated and, in agreement with previous simulations, do not seem to belong to the universality class of the 2D Ising model. Finally, the dynamics of spinodal decomposition for quenching the system from the one-phase to the two-phase coexistence region by increasing P\'eclet number is characterized. Our results may help to identify parameters for optimal transport of active matter in complex environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motility coupled to responsive behavior is essential for many microorganisms to seek and establish appropriate habitats. One of the simplest possible responses, reversing the direction of motion, is believed to enable filamentous cyanobacteria to form stable aggregates or accumulate in suitable light conditions. Here, we demonstrate that filamentous morphology in combination with responding to light gradients by reversals has consequences far beyond simple accumulation: Entangled aggregates form at the boundaries of illuminated regions, harnessing the boundary to establish local order. We explore how the light pattern, in particular its boundary curvature, impacts aggregation. A minimal mechanistic model of active flexible filaments resembles the experimental findings, thereby revealing the emergent and generic character of these structures. This phenomenon may enable elongated microorganisms to generate adaptive colony architectures in limited habitats, or guide the assembly of biomimetic fibrous materials.</description>

Abstract: Following a previous work evidencing that short poly-propylene glycol (PPG) chains incorporated to crude SBR-silica nanocomposites act as filler-network softeners without changing their structure, we propose in the present letter to examine more operative cross-linked materials. We first evidence that the adsorption of PPG onto silica deactivates progressively the particle's catalytic effect on vulcanization, without perturbing however the cross-link density distribution that we investigate through multiple-quantum NMR. In addition, electron microscopy confirms that silica structure is conserved after vulcanization and that it does not depend on the PPG content either. Composites containing various amount of PPG can thus be seen as structurally identical, both from a matrix and filler point of view - which is confirmed by small and medium amplitude oscillation shear rheology showing strikingly identical viscoelastic properties. PPG signature only appears above 100% in tensile deformation where it is seen to soften dramatically the filler network. Our discovery makes it consequently possible to decorrelate the mechanical behavior of reinforced rubbers under normal conditions of use and urgent needs of energy dissipation.</description>

Abstract: Self-propelled micron-size particles suspended in a fluid, like bacteria or synthetic microswimmers, are strongly non-equilibrium systems where particle motility breaks the microscopic detailed balance, often resulting in large-scale collective motion. Previous theoretical work has identified long-range hydrodynamic interactions as the main driver of collective motion in unbounded dilute suspension of rear-actuated ("pusher") microswimmers. In contrast, most experimental studies of collective motion in microswimmer suspensions have been carried out in quasi-2-dimensional geometries such as in thin films or near solid or fluid interfaces, where both the swimmers' motion and their long-range flow fields become altered due to the proximity of a boundary. Here, we study numerically a minimal model of microswimmers in such a restricted geometry, where the particles move in the midplane between two no-slip walls. For pushers, we demonstrate collective motion with only short-ranged order, in contrast with the long-ranged flows observed in unbounded systems. For front-actuated ("puller") microswimmers, we discover a long-wavelength density instability resulting in the formation of dense microswimmer clusters. Both types of collective motion are fundamentally different from their previously studied counterparts in unbounded domains. Our results illustrate that hydrodynamic screening due to the presence of a wall is subdominant in determining the collective state of the suspension, which is instead dictated by the geometrical restriction of the swimmers' motion.</description>

      <title>Configurational and Vibrational Entropy in Hydrogen-bonded Fluids</title>

Abstract: The thermodynamics of liquids and supercritical fluids is notorious for eluding a general theory, as can be done for crystalline solids on the basis of phonons and crystal symmetry. The extension of solid state notions such as configurational entropy and phonons to the liquid state remains an intriguing but challenging topic. This is particularly true for liquids like water whose many structural anomalies give it unique properties. Here, for simple fluids, we specify the thermodynamics across the liquid, supercritical, and gaseous states using the spectrum of propagating phonons, thereby determining the non-ideal entropy of the fluid using a single parameter arising from this phonon spectrum. This identifies a marked distinction between these "simple" fluids, and hydrogen bonded fluids whose non-ideal entropy cannot be determined by the phonon spectrum alone. We relate this phonon theory of thermodynamics to the previously observed excess entropy scaling in liquids and how the phonon spectrum creates corresponding states across the fluid phase diagram. These results provide important theoretical understanding to supercritical fluid, whose properties are still poorly understood despite widespread deployment in environmental and energy applications.</description>

      <title>Design principles for fast and efficient self-assembly processes</title>

Abstract: Self-assembly is a fundamental concept in biology and of significant interest to nanotechnology. Significant progress has been made in characterizing and controlling the properties of the resulting structures, both experimentally and theoretically. However, much less is known about kinetic constraints and determinants of dynamical properties like time efficiency, although these constraints can become severe limiting factors of self-assembly processes. Here we investigate how the time efficiency and other dynamical properties of reversible self-assembly depend on the morphology (shape) of the building blocks for systems in which the binding energy between the constituents is large. As paradigmatic examples, we stochastically simulate the self-assembly of constituents with triangular, square, and hexagonal morphology into two-dimensional structures of a specified size. We find that the constituents' morphology critically determines the assembly time and how it scales with the size of the target structure. Our analysis reveals three key structural parameters defined by the morphology: The nucleation size and attachment order, which describe the effective order of the chemical reactions by which clusters nucleate and grow, respectively, and the growth exponent, which determines how the growth rate of an emerging structure scales with its size. Using this characterization, we formulate an effective theory of the self-assembly kinetics, which we show exhibits an inherent scale invariance. This allows us to identify general scaling laws that describe the minimal assembly time as a function of the size of the target structure. We show how these insights on the kinetics of self-assembly processes can be used to design assembly schemes that could significantly increase the time efficiency and robustness of artificial self-assembly processes.</description>

Abstract: Polymer electrolytes (PEs) are promising candidates for use in next-generation high-voltage batteries, as they possess advantageous elastic and electrochemical properties. However, PEs still suffer from low ionic conductivity and need to be operated at higher temperatures. Furthermore, the wide variety of different types of PEs and the complexity of the internal interactions constitute challenging tasks for progressing towards a systematic understanding of PEs. Here, we present a continuum transport theory which enables a straight-forward and thermodynamically consistent method to couple different aspects of PEs relevant for battery performance. Our approach combines mechanics and electrochemistry in non-equilibrium thermodynamics, and is based on modeling the free energy, which comprises all relevant bulk properties. In our model, the dynamics of the polymer-based electrolyte are formulated relative to the highly elastic structure of the polymer. For validation, we discuss a benchmark polymer electrolyte. Based on our theoretical description, we perform numerical simulations and compare the results with data from the literature. In addition, we apply our theoretical framework to a novel type of single-ion conducting PE and derive a detailed understanding of the internal dynamics.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of rigid fibers interacting with triangular obstacles in microchannel flows</title>

Abstract: Fiber suspensions flowing in structured media are encountered in many biological and industrial systems. Interactions between fibers and the transporting flow as well as fiber contact with obstacles can lead to complex dynamics. In this work, we combine microfluidic experiments and numerical simulations to study the interactions of a rigid fiber with an individual equilateral triangular pillar in a microfluidic channel. Four dominant fiber dynamics are identified: transport above or below the obstacle, pole vaulting and trapping, in excellent agreement between experiments and modeling. The dynamics are classified as a function of the length, angle and lateral position of the fibers at the channel entry. We show that the orientation and lateral position close to the obstacle are responsible for the fiber dynamics and we link those to the initial conditions of the fibers at the channel entrance. Direct contact between the fibers and the pillar is required to obtain strong modification of the fiber trajectories, which is associated to irreversible dynamics. Longer fibers are found to be more laterally shifted by the pillar than shorter fibers that rather tend to remain on their initial streamline. Our findings could in the future be used to design and optimize microfluidic sorting devices to sort rigid fibers by length.</description>

      <title>Viscous rebound of a quasi-2D cylinder on a solid wall</title>

Abstract: The purpose of the present study is to extend the simple concept of apparent coefficient of restitution, widely approached in the literature for the case of a single-contact-point between a sphere and a wall, to the case of bouncing whose complexity is increased due to the shape of the contacting object.
  Experiments are carried out with a finite-length cylinder, freely falling in a liquid at rest. Complex 3D motions of the cylinder with respect to the wall occur during bouncing, including multi-contact-points between the cylinder and the bottom as well as cavitation.
  We investigate numerical modelling of an idealized situation (2D infinite cylinder falling parallel to the wall) with 2D simulations where the fluid equations of motion were coupled to the particle equation of motion through an Immersed Boundary Method. The particle equation of motion is coupled to an elastic force to model bouncing, requiring a parameterization of the cut-off length (interpreted as a roughness) and the contact time (associated with the contact elasticity) used here to capture the experimental observations. The simulations confirmed that i) the departure of the coefficient of restitution from 0 is strictly dependent on the apparent roughness and ii) the coefficient of restitution depends on the contact time.
  Finally, we model the coefficient of restitution as the product of two contributions to the mechanical loss of energy: the collision-to-terminal velocity ratio ($V_c/V_t$) of the approach-phase and the rebound-to-collision velocity ratio ($-V_r/V_c$) of the contact-phase. This leads to a reasonably good prediction of the coefficient of restitution in the intermediate regime in $St$. This suggests the relevance of lumping the complex details of physical phenomena involved during contact into a simple concept based on the contact apparent roughness and elasticity.</description>
