      <title>RDF Surfaces: Enabling Classical Negation on the Semantic Web</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a fundamental technology in the Semantic Web, enabling the representation and interchange of structured data. However, RDF lacks the capability to express negated statements in a generic way. As a result, exchanging negative information on a Web scale is thus far restricted to specific cases and predefined statements. The ability to negate (virtually) any RDF statement allows for a comprehensive way to refute, deny or otherwise invalidate claims on a Web scale. Via an intermediate step of a diagrammatic approach to logical expressions called Peirce graphs, we introduce RDF Surfaces, an extension of RDF that incorporates the concept of classic negation, known from first-order logic. Overall, RDF Surfaces provides an abstract, visual approach to negation within the Semantic Web, offering a more general and widely applicable approach than previous attempts at incorporating negation. Aside from a (traditional) programmatic syntax, RDF Surfaces can also be represented visually by means of diagrams inspired by Peirce graphs. We demonstrate negation via RDF Surfaces and how to reason upon it in illustrative use cases drawn from the domains of academic publishing and eHealth. We hope this vision paper attracts new implementers and opens the discussion to its formal specification.</description>

      <title>Formally Certified Approximate Model Counting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Approximate model counting is the task of approximating the number of solutions to an input Boolean formula. The state-of-the-art approximate model counter for formulas in conjunctive normal form (CNF), ApproxMC, provides a scalable means of obtaining model counts with probably approximately correct (PAC)-style guarantees. Nevertheless, the validity of ApproxMC's approximation relies on a careful theoretical analysis of its randomized algorithm and the correctness of its highly optimized implementation, especially the latter's stateful interactions with an incremental CNF satisfiability solver capable of natively handling parity (XOR) constraints.
  We present the first certification framework for approximate model counting with formally verified guarantees on the quality of its output approximation. Our approach combines: (i) a static, once-off, formal proof of the algorithm's PAC guarantee in the Isabelle/HOL proof assistant; and (ii) dynamic, per-run, verification of ApproxMC's calls to an external CNF-XOR solver using proof certificates. We detail our general approach to establish a rigorous connection between these two parts of the verification, including our blueprint for turning the formalized, randomized algorithm into a verified proof checker, and our design of proof certificates for both ApproxMC and its internal CNF-XOR solving steps. Experimentally, we show that certificate generation adds little overhead to an approximate counter implementation, and that our certificate checker is able to fully certify $84.7\%$ of instances with generated certificates when given the same time and memory limits as the counter.</description>

      <title>Learning Temporal Logic Predicates from Data with Statistical Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Temporal logic rules are often used in control and robotics to provide structured, human-interpretable descriptions of high-dimensional trajectory data. These rules have numerous applications including safety validation using formal methods, constraining motion planning among autonomous agents, and classifying data. However, existing methods for learning temporal logic predicates from data provide no assurances about the correctness of the resulting predicate. We present a novel method to learn temporal logic predicates from data with finite-sample correctness guarantees. Our approach leverages expression optimization and conformal prediction to learn predicates that correctly describe future trajectories under mild assumptions with a user-defined confidence level. We provide experimental results showing the performance of our approach on a simulated trajectory dataset and perform ablation studies to understand how each component of our algorithm contributes to its performance.</description>

      <title>A Coalgebraic Semantics for Intuitionistic Modal Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a new coalgebraic semantics for intuitionistic modal logic with $\Box$. In particular, we provide a colagebraic representation of intuitionistic descriptive modal frames and of intuitonistic modal Kripke frames based on image-finite posets. This gives a solution to a problem in the area of coalgebaic logic for these classes of frames, raised explicitly by Litak (2014) and de Groot and Pattinson (2020). Our key technical tool is a recent generalization of a construction by Ghilardi, in the form of a right adjoint to the inclusion of the category of Esakia spaces in the category of Priestley spaces. As an application of these results, we study bisimulations of intuitionistic modal frames, describe dual spaces of free modal Heyting algebras, and provide a path towards a theory of coalgebraic intuitionistic logics.</description>

      <title>Order-theoretic models for decision-making: Learning, optimization, complexity and computation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of intelligent systems explains behaviour in terms of economic rationality. This results in an optimization principle involving a function or utility, which states that the system will evolve until the configuration of maximum utility is achieved. Recently, this theory has incorporated constraints, i.e., the optimum is achieved when the utility is maximized while respecting some information-processing constraints. This is reminiscent of thermodynamic systems. As such, the study of intelligent systems has benefited from the tools of thermodynamics. The first aim of this thesis is to clarify the applicability of these results in the study of intelligent systems.
  We can think of the local transition steps in thermodynamic or intelligent systems as being driven by uncertainty. In fact, the transitions in both systems can be described in terms of majorization. Hence, real-valued uncertainty measures like Shannon entropy are simply a proxy for their more involved behaviour. More in general, real-valued functions are fundamental to study optimization and complexity in the order-theoretic approach to several topics, including economics, thermodynamics, and quantum mechanics. The second aim of this thesis is to improve on this classification.
  The basic similarity between thermodynamic and intelligent systems is based on an uncertainty notion expressed by a preorder. We can also think of the transitions in the steps of a computational process as a decision-making procedure. In fact, by adding some requirements on the considered order structures, we can build an abstract model of uncertainty reduction that allows to incorporate computability, that is, to distinguish the objects that can be constructed by following a finite set of instructions from those that cannot. The third aim of this thesis is to clarify the requirements on the order structure that allow such a framework.</description>

      <title>Ajtai's theorem for $T^2_2(R)$ and pebble games with backtracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a pebble game extended by backtracking options for one of the two players (called Prover) and reduce the provability of the pigeonhole principle for a generic predicate $R$ in the bounded arithmetic $T^2_2(R)$ to the existence of a particular kind of winning strategy (called oblivious) for Prover in the game. While the unprovability of the said principle in $T^2_2(R)$ is an immediate consequence of a celebrated theorem of Ajtai (which deals with a stronger theory $T_2(R)$), up-to-date no methods working for $T^2_2(R)$ directly (in particular without switching lemma) are known. Although the full analysis of the introduced pebble game is left open, as a first step towards resolving it, we restrict ourselves to a simplified version of the game. In this case, Prover can use only two pebbles and move in an extremely oblivious way. Besides, a series of backtracks can be made only once during a play. Under these assumptions, we show that no strategy of Prover can be winning.</description>

      <title>A Subclass of Mu-Calculus with the Freeze Quantifier Equivalent to Buchi Register Automata</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Register automaton (RA) is an extension of finite automaton for dealing with data values in an infinite domain. In the previous work, we proposed disjunctive mu$^\downarrow$-calculus, which is a subclass of modal mu-calculus with the freeze quantifier, and showed that it has the same expressive power as RA. However, disjunctive mu$^\downarrow$-calculus is defined as a logic on finite words, whereas temporal specifications in model checking are usually given in terms of infinite words. In this paper, we re-define the syntax and semantics of disjunctive mu$^\downarrow$-calculus to be suitable for infinite words and prove that the obtained temporal logic has the same expressive power as Buchi RA.</description>

      <title>Provable Guarantees for Model Performance via Mechanistic Interpretability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose using mechanistic interpretability -- techniques for reverse engineering model weights into human-interpretable algorithms -- to derive and compactly prove formal guarantees on model performance. We prototype this approach by formally lower bounding the accuracy of 151 small transformers trained on a Max-of-$k$ task. We create 102 different computer-assisted proof strategies and assess their length and tightness of bound on each of our models. Using quantitative metrics, we show that shorter proofs seem to require and provide more mechanistic understanding, and that more faithful mechanistic understanding leads to tighter performance bounds. We confirm these connections by qualitatively examining a subset of our proofs. Finally, we identify compounding structureless noise as a key challenge for using mechanistic interpretability to generate compact proofs on model performance.</description>

Abstract: To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP).
  Dynamic systems play a central role in fields such as planning, verification, and databases. Fragmented throughout these fields, we find a multitude of languages to formally specify dynamic systems and a multitude of systems to reason on such specifications. Often, such systems are bound to one specific language and one specific inference task. It is troublesome that performing several inference tasks on the same knowledge requires translations of your specification to other languages. In this paper we study whether it is possible to perform a broad set of well-studied inference tasks on one specification. More concretely, we extend IDP3 with several inferences from fields concerned with dynamic specifications.</description>

      <title>Succinctness of Cosafety Fragments of LTL via Combinatorial Proof Systems (extended version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09860v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper focuses on succinctness results for fragments of Linear Temporal Logic with Past (LTL) devoid of binary temporal operators like until, and provides methods to establish them. We prove that there is a family of cosafety languages (Ln)_{n&gt;=1} such that Ln can be expressed with a pure future formula of size O(n), but it requires formulae of size 2^{\Omega}(n) to be captured with past formulae. As a by-product, such a succinctness result shows the optimality of the pastification algorithm proposed in [Artale et al., KR, 2023]. We show that, in the considered case, succinctness cannot be proven by relying on the classical automata-based method introduced in [Markey, Bull. EATCS, 2003]. In place of this method, we devise and apply a combinatorial proof system whose deduction trees represent LTL formulae. The system can be seen as a proof-centric (one-player) view on the games used by Adler and Immerman to study the succinctness of CTL.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As well known, weak K4 and the difference logic DL do not enjoy the Craig interpolation property. Our concern here is the problem of deciding whether any given implication does have an interpolant in these logics. We show that the nonexistence of an interpolant can always be witnessed by a pair of bisimilar models of polynomial size for DL and of triple-exponential size for weak K4, and so the interpolant existence problems for these logics are decidable in coNP and coN3ExpTime, respectively. We also establish coNExpTime-hardness of this problem for weak K4, which is higher than the PSpace-completeness of its decision problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03985v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a characterization of first-order string-to-string transduction via $\lambda$-terms typed in non-commutative affine logic that compute with Church encoding, extending the analogous known characterization of star-free languages. We show that every first-order transduction can be computed by a $\lambda$-term using a known Krohn-Rhodes-style decomposition lemma. The converse direction is given by compiling $\lambda$-terms into two-way reversible planar transducers. The soundness of this translation involves showing that the transition functions of those transducers live in a monoidal closed category of diagrams in which we can interpret purely affine $\lambda$-terms. One challenge is that the unit of the tensor of the category in question is not a terminal object. As a result, our interpretation does not identify $\beta$-equivalent terms, but it does turn $\beta$-reductions into inequalities in a poset-enrichment of the category of diagrams.</description>

Abstract: We present the first automated verification technique for confidence-based 2-safety properties, such as global robustness and global fairness, in deep neural networks (DNNs). Our approach combines self-composition to leverage existing reachability analysis techniques and a novel abstraction of the softmax function, which is amenable to automated verification. We characterize and prove the soundness of our static analysis technique. Furthermore, we implement it on top of Marabou, a safety analysis tool for neural networks, conducting a performance evaluation on several publicly available benchmarks for DNN verification.</description>

      <title>Linear equations with monomial constraints and decision problems in abelian-by-cyclic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08480v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that it is undecidable whether a system of linear equations over the Laurent polynomial ring $\mathbb{Z}[X^{\pm}]$ admit solutions where a specified subset of variables take value in the set of monomials $\{X^z \mid z \in \mathbb{Z}\}$. In particular, we construct a finitely presented $\mathbb{Z}[X^{\pm}]$-module, where it is undecidable whether a linear equation $X^{z_1} \boldsymbol{f}_1 + \cdots + X^{z_n} \boldsymbol{f}_n = \boldsymbol{f}_0$ has solutions $z_1, \ldots, z_n \in \mathbb{Z}$. This contrasts the decidability of the case $n = 1$, which can be deduced from Noskov's Lemma.
  We apply this result to settle a number of problems in computational group theory. We show that it is undecidable whether a system of equations has solutions in the wreath product $\mathbb{Z} \wr \mathbb{Z}$, providing a negative answer to an open problem of Kharlampovich, L\'{o}pez and Miasnikov (2020). We show that there exists a finitely generated abelian-by-cyclic group in which the problem of solving a single quadratic equation is undecidable. We also construct a finitely generated abelian-by-cyclic group, different to that of Mishchenko and Treier (2017), in which the Knapsack Problem is undecidable. In contrast, we show that the problem of Coset Intersection is decidable in all finitely generated abelian-by-cyclic groups.</description>
