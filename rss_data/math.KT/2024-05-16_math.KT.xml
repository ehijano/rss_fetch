      <title>Partial bases and homological stability of $\operatorname{GL}_{n}(R)$ revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a unital ring satisfying the invariant basis number property, that every stably free $R$-module is free, and that the complex of partial bases of every finite rank free module is Cohen--Macaulay. This class of rings includes every ring of stable rank $1$ (e.g. any local, semi-local or Artinian ring), every Euclidean domain, and every Dedekind domain $\mathcal{O}_S$ of arithmetic type where $|S| &gt; 1$ and $S$ contains at least one non-complex place. Extending recent work of Galatius--Kupers--Randal-Williams and Kupers--Miller--Patzt, we prove that the sequence of general linear groups $\operatorname{GL}_n(R)$ satisfies slope-$1$ homological stability with $\mathbb{Z}[1/2]$-coefficients.</description>

      <title>The eta invariant on two-step nilmanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1210.8070</link>
      <description>arXiv:1210.8070v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The eta invariant appears regularly in index theorems but is known to be directly computable from the spectrum only in certain examples of locally symmetric spaces of compact type. In this work, we derive some general formulas useful for calculating the eta invariant on closed manifolds. Specifically, we study the eta invariant on nilmanifolds by decomposing the spin Dirac operator using Kirillov theory. In particular, for general Heisenberg three-manifolds, the spectrum of the Dirac operator and the eta invariant are computed in terms of the metric, lattice, and spin structure data. There are continuous families of geometrically, spectrally different Heisenberg three-manifolds whose Dirac operators have constant eta invariant. In the appendix, some needed results of L. Richardson and C. C. Moore are extended from spaces of functions to spaces of spinors.</description>

      <title>Cartan calculi on the free loop spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.05941v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A typical example of a Cartan calculus consists of the Lie derivative and the contraction with vector fields of a manifold on the derivation ring of the de Rham complex. In this manuscript, a second stage of the Cartan calculus is investigated. In a general setting, the stage is formulated with operators obtained by the Andr\'e-Quillen cohomology of a commutative differential graded algebra $A$ on the Hochschild homology of $A$ in terms of the homotopy Cartan calculus in the sense of Fiorenza and Kowalzig. Moreover, the Cartan calculus is interpreted geometrically with maps from the rational homotopy group of the monoid of self-homotopy equivalences on a space $M$ to the derivation ring on the loop cohomology of $M$. We also give a geometric description to Sullivan's isomorphism, which relates the geometric Cartan calculus to the algebraic one, via the $\Gamma_1$ map due to F\'elix and Thomas.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a conceptual explanation for the somewhat mysterious origin of Suslin matrices. This enables us to generalize the construction of Suslin matrices and to give more conceptual proofs of some well-known results.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Algebraic K-Theory and Derived completions II: the case of Equivariant Homotopy K-Theory and Equivariant K-Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the mid 1980s, while working on establishing completion theorems for equivariant Algebraic K-Theory similar to the well-known completion theorems for equivariant topological K-theory, the late Robert Thomason found the strong finiteness conditions that are required in such theorems to be too restrictive. Then he made a conjecture on the existence of a completion theorem for equivariant Algebraic G-theory, for actions of linear algebraic groups on schemes that holds without any of the strong finiteness conditions that are required in such theorems proven by him. In an earlier work by the first two authors, we solved this conjecture by providing a derived completion theorem for equivariant G-theory. In the present paper, we provide a similar derived completion theorem for the homotopy Algebraic K-theory of equivariant perfect complexes, on schemes that need not be regular.
  Our solution is broad enough to allow actions by all linear algebraic groups, irrespective of whether they are connected or not, and acting on any normal quasi-projective scheme of finite type over a field, irrespective of whether they are regular or projective. This allows us therefore to consider the Equivariant Homotopy Algebraic K-Theory of large classes of varieties like all toric varieties (for the action of a torus) and all spherical varieties (for the action of a reductive group). With finite coefficients invertible in the base fields, we are also able to obtain such derived completion theorems for equivariant algebraic K-theory but with respect to actions of diagonalizable group schemes. These enable us to obtain a wide range of applications, several of which are also explored.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Algebraic K-Theory and Derived completions III: Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13199v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the present paper, we discuss applications of the derived completion theorems proven in our previous two papers. One of the main applications is to Riemann-Roch problems for forms of higher equivariant K-theory, which we are able to establish in great generality both for equivariant G-theory and equivariant homotopy K-theory with respect to actions of linear algebraic groups on normal quasi-projective schemes over a given field. We show such Riemann-Roch theorems apply to all toric and spherical varieties.
  We also obtain Lefschetz-Riemann-Roch theorems involving the fixed point schemes with respect to actions of diagonalizable group schemes. We also show the existence of certain spectral sequences that compute the homotopy groups of the derived completions of equivariant G-theory starting with equivariant Borel-Moore motivic cohomology.</description>
