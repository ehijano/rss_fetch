      <title>Harish-Chandra D-modules for bi-Whittaker reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $D(G)$ be the algebra of algebraic differential operators on a complex reductive group $G$. Denote by $\mathbb{W}$ the bi-Whittaker quantum Hamiltonian reduction of $D(G)$, also known as the quantum Toda lattice. In this article we define the admissible $\mathbb{W}$-modules and the special case of Harish-Chandra modules, the latter being bi-Whittaker variants of the invariant holonomic systems of Hotta-Kashiwara. We then study their torsion properties up to completion relative to the Kazhdan filtration, which in general is unbounded in both directions, through the geometry of universal centralizer. In the case of regular infinitesimal characters, the corresponding $D(G)$-module is shown to be the minimal extension of an irregular connection on the open Bruhat cell. Certain ring-theoretic properties of the completion of $\mathbb{W}$ are also obtained.</description>

      <title>Strata of Weyl groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Weyl group W is a union of strata (certain subsets which are unions of conjugacy classes) which are the nonempty fibres of a map from W to the set of irreducible representations of W. We give an explicit description of strata in terms of a certain modified centralizer group. We also define superstrata of a connected reductive group and state a conjecture about them.</description>

      <title>Hyperfocal subalgebras of hyperfocal abelian Frobenius blocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a class of blocks which is called hyperfocal abelian Frobenius blocks.This class of blocks is an analogous version of the block with abelian defect group and Frobenius inertial quotient at hyperfocal level and includes the blocks with Klein four hyperfocal subgroups and cyclic hyperfocal subgroups. We show that there is a stable equivalence of Morita type between the hyperfocal subalgebras of the hyperfocal abelian Frobenius blocks and a group algebra of a Frobenius group associated with the hyperfocal subgroup of the block. As applications, we can partially describe some structures of the blocks with Klein four hyperfocal subgroups and cyclic hyperfocal subgroups,such as the structures of their hyperfocal subalgebras in terms of derived categories and the structures of their characters. As a consequence, we show that Broue's abelian defect group conjecture holds for blocks with Klein four hyperfocal subgroups.</description>

      <title>Equivariant log concavity and the $\operatorname{FI^\sharp}$-module structure on $H^i(\operatorname{Conf}(n,\mathbb{R}^d))$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Previous work has conjectured that the graded $\mathfrak{S}_n$-representations $H^\bullet(\operatorname{Conf}(n,\mathbb{R}^d);\mathbb{Q})$ are strongly equivariantly log concave, and has proven this conjecture in low degrees. By leveraging the theory of representation stability, we are able instead prove a stronger statement about the $\operatorname{FI^\sharp}$-module structure on $H^i(\operatorname{Conf}(n,\mathbb{R}^d);\mathbb{Q})$ which implies the original conjecture up to degree 19. We conjecture that this equivariant log concavity-like property holds in all degrees for the $\operatorname{FI^\sharp}$-modules $H^i(\operatorname{Conf}(n,\mathbb{R}^d);\mathbb{Q})$.</description>

      <title>On the expansion formulas of cluster varieties from surfaces and their combinatorial properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the cluster algebra structure of the moduli space $\mathscr{A}_{\mathrm{SL}_{n+1},\mathbb{S}}$ of twisted $\mathrm{SL}_{n+1}$-local systems on a surface. We derive general recurrence relations for cluster variables arising from flips of a triangulation, corresponding to specific sequences of mutations. Our approach is grounded in a detailed combinatorial analysis over the standard $n$-triangulated $m$-gon (with explicit calculations for $n=1,2$). As a generalization, the non-simply-laced $G_2$ type is also considered. We prove the "well-triangulated" property for cluster mutations under flips, which provides a combinatorial framework for understanding the stability and transformation rules of these cluster algebra structures, and compute the monomial counts for the cluster expansion formula.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.22189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate $p$-adic automorphic forms on unitary groups through the geometry of infinite-level unitary Shimura varieties and the Hodge-Tate period map. We first develop a perfectoid construction of overconvergent automorphic forms. Building on this, we establish a canonical overconvergent Eichler-Shimura map linking overconvergent cohomology to these $p$-adic automorphic forms. This map induces a comparison between the corresponding coherent sheaves on the eigenvariety, with applications to the study of its geometry and to $p$-adic $L$-functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:0707.3799v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explain (following V. Drinfeld) how the equivariant derived category of the affine Grassmannian can be described in terms of coherent sheaves on the Langlands dual Lie algebra equivariant with respect to the adjoint action, due to some old results of V. Ginzburg. The global cohomology functor corresponds under this identification to restricti on to the Kostant slice. We extend this description to loop rotation equivariant derived category, linking it to Harish-Chandra bimodules for the Langlands dual Lie algebra, so that the global cohomology functor corresponds to the quantum Kostant-Whittaker reduction of a Harish-Chandra bimodule. We derive a conjecture from math.AG/0306413 which identifies the loop-rotation equivariant homology of the affine Grassmannian with quantized completed Toda lattice.</description>

      <title>$2$-representation infinite algebras from non-abelian subgroups of $\operatorname{SL}_3$. Part I: Extensions of abelian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10683v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G \leq \operatorname{SL}_3(\mathbb{C})$ be a non-trivial finite group, acting on $R = \mathbb{C}[x_1, x_2, x_3]$. The resulting skew-group algebra $R \ast G$ is $3$-Calabi-Yau, and can sometimes be endowed with the structure of a $3$-preprojective algebra. However, not every such $R \ast G$ admits such a structure. The finite subgroups of $\operatorname{SL}_3(\mathbb{C})$ are classified into types (A) to (L). We consider the groups $G$ of types (C) and (D) and determine for each such group whether the algebra $R \ast G$ admits a $3$-preprojective cut, that is a $3$-preprojective structure arising from a grading of the McKay quiver of $G$. We show that the algebra $R \ast G$ admits a $3$-preprojective cut if and only if $9 \mid |G|$. Our proof is constructive and yields a description of the involved $2$-representation infinite algebras. This is based on the semi-direct decomposition $G \simeq N \rtimes K$ for an abelian group $N$, and we show that the existence of a $3$-preprojective structure on $R \ast G$ is essentially determined by the existence of one on $R \ast N$. This provides new classes of $2$-representation infinite algebras, and we discuss some $2$-Auslander-Platzeck-Reiten tilts. Along the way, we give a detailed description of the involved groups and their McKay quivers by iteratively applying skew-group constructions.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we give a detailed proof of the classification of extremal (=massless) unitary highest weight representations in the Neveu Schwarz and Ramond sectors of the big $N=4$ superconformal algebra which can be found in [5]. Our results agree with the general conjectures about classification of unitary highest weight representation of minimal $W$-algebras attached to basic Lie superalgebras formulated in [10], [11], and complete their proof for the big $N=4$ superconformal algebra.</description>

      <title>$2$-representation infinite algebras from non-abelian subgroups of $\operatorname{SL}_3$. Part II: Central extensions and exceptionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G \leq \operatorname{SL}_3(\mathbb{C})$ be a non-trivial finite group, acting on $R = \mathbb{C}[x_1, x_2, x_3]$. We continue our investigation from arXiv:2505.10683 [math.RT] into when the resulting skew-group algebra $R \ast G$ is a $3$-preprojective algebra of a $2$-representation infinite algebra, defined by a so-called cut. We consider the subgroups arising from $\operatorname{GL}_2(\mathbb{C}) \hookrightarrow \operatorname{SL}_3(\mathbb{C})$, called type (B), as well as the exceptional subgroups, called types (E) -- (L). For groups of type (B), we show that a $3$-preprojective cut exists on $R \ast G$ if and only if $G$ is not isomorphic to a subgroup of $\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb{C})$ or $\operatorname{PSL}_2(\mathbb{C})$. For groups $G$ of the remaining types (E) -- (L), every $R \ast G$ admits a $3$-preprojective cut, except for type (H) and (I). To prove our results for type (B), we explore how the notion of isoclinism interacts with the shape of McKay quivers. We compute the McKay quivers in detail, using a knitting-style heuristic. For the exceptional subgroups, we compute the McKay quivers directly, as well as cuts, and we discuss how this task can be done algorithmically. This provides many new examples of $2$-representation infinite algebras, and together with arXiv:2401.10720 [math.RT], arXiv:2505.10683 [math.RT] completes the classification of finite subgroups of $\operatorname{SL}_3(\mathbb{C})$ for which $R \ast G$ is a $3$-preprojective algebra.</description>

      <title>Notes on Chevalley Groups and Root Category II: Compact Lie Groups and Representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05752v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is a continuation of [5]. Using the root categories, we define the compact real forms of the complex semisimple Lie algebras, and maximal compact subgroups of the Chevalley groups over $\mathbb{C}$. In [7], Lusztig used the modified quantum group $\dot{\mathbf{U}}$ and its canonical basis to obtain the reductive group and its coordinate ring $\mathbf{O}_A$, in particular the tensor product decomposition of $\mathbf{O}_A$. By combining these two kinds of structures, we explore in this paper how the classical theory of the compact Lie groups, such as Peter-Weyl theorem and Plancherel theorem, can be recovered completely.</description>

Abstract: Let $G$ be a simple, simply connected, simply laced algebraic group. We construct a monoidal category of representations of the quantum affine algebra $U_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{g}})$ whose Grothendieck ring contains a cluster algebra with initial seed given by that of the coordinate ring of twisted products of flag varieties. This class of varieties includes, in particular, braid varieties and reduced double Bruhat cells.</description>

      <title>Minimal Projective Resolutions, M\"obius Inversion, and Bottleneck Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15726v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a stability theory for minimal projective resolutions of $\mathbf{P}$-modules, where $\mathbf{P}$ is a finite metric poset. On the module side, we introduce the Galois transport distance, defined by factoring two modules through a common "apex" poset via pairs of Galois insertions and measuring the maximal displacement in the index poset. This construction generalizes the interleaving distance in both the classical one-parameter and multiparameter settings, and yields an extended metric on isomorphism classes of $\mathbf{P}$-modules.
  On the homological side, we define a bottleneck distance between minimal projective resolutions by matching indecomposable projectives degreewise, with contractible cones playing the role of diagonal terms. Our main theorem shows that this resolution-level bottleneck distance is always bounded above by the Galois transport distance, providing a metric stability result formulated entirely at the level of modules and their minimal projective resolutions.
  We then treat persistence as an application. Passing to the interval poset and a kernel construction, we interpret persistence diagrams as minimal projective resolutions of kernel modules and obtain a corresponding stability inequality. In the one-parameter case this recovers classical bottleneck stability, while in the multiparameter setting it extends naturally to signed diagrams arising from minimal projective resolutions. Via a general relationship between minimal projective resolutions and M\"obius inversion, these results can be interpreted as a stability theorem for M\"obius homology, while remaining entirely phrased in the language of projective resolutions.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the Fukaya-Seidel categories of a certain family of singularities on $\mathbb{C}^d$ are equivalent to the perfect derived categories of higher Auslander algebras of Dynkin type A. We relate these to the Fukaya-Seidel categories of Brieskorn-Pham singularities and to the partially wrapped Fukaya categories considered by Dyckerhoff-Jasso-Lekili. We provide a symplectic interpretation to higher Auslander correspondence of type A in terms of Fukaya-Seidel categories of Lefschetz fibrations.</description>

      <title>Projective error models: Stabilizer codes, Clifford codes, and weak stabilizer codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01843v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By defining projective error models we study the mathematical structure of Clifford codes and stabilizer codes using tools from projective representation theory. Furthermore, we introduce a new class of codes which we have called weak stabilizer codes and we determine some relationships between these three classes of codes. We show that the obstruction for a stabilizer code to be non-trivial is given by a class in group cohomology, and we are able to determine similar obstructions for weak stabilizer codes to be non-trivial. In the case where the projective error model corresponds to a nice error basis we give a complete characterization of when a Clifford code is a weak stabilizer code in terms of the size of the group of logical operators and the size of the group of stabilizers of the code. Lastly, we produce two infinite families of Clifford codes that are not stabilizer codes, as well as a method of combining these examples into more examples of non-stabilizer Clifford codes.</description>

Abstract: By using Ikeda's theory for a compatible family of Eisenstein series, we explicitly construct Ikeda type lifts on the special orthogonal group $G={\rm SO}(3,n+1)$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ with $n\ge 3$ which splits everywhere at finite places. Our lifts are Hecke eigen cusp forms of weight $l$ ($l\ge n+2$, even) and come from elliptic newforms with respect to ${\rm SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$ which are of weight $l-\frac{n-2}{2}$ when $n$ is even and $2l-n+1$ when $n$ is odd.The corresponding cuspidal automorphic representations are cohomological but non-tempered at any places including the infinity place.</description>

Abstract: We prove the combinatorial invariance of the coefficient of $q$ in Kazhdan--Lusztig polynomials for arbitrary Coxeter groups. As a result, we obtain the Combinatorial Invariance Conjecture, of Lusztig and of Dyer, also for Bruhat intervals of length at most $6$. We also prove the Gabber--Joseph conjecture for the second-highest $Ext$ group of a pair of Verma modules, as well as the combinatorial invariance of the dimension of this group, and of the numbers of frozen and of mutable variables in the cluster structure on Richardson varieties.</description>
