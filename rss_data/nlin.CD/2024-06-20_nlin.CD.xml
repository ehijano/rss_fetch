      <title>Analyzing Dynamical Systems Inspired by Montgomery's Conjecture: Insights into Zeta Function Zeros and Chaos in Number Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we delve into a novel dynamic system inspired by Montgomery's pair correlation conjecture in number theory. The dynamic system is intricately designed to emulate the behavior of the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function. Our exploration encompasses bifurcation analysis and Lyapunov exponents to scrutinize the system's behavior and stability, offering insights into both small and large initial conditions. Our efforts extend to unveiling the probability distribution characterizing the dynamics for varying initial conditions. The dynamic system unfolds intricate behaviors, displaying sensitivity to initial conditions and revealing complex bifurcation patterns. Small deviations in the initial conditions unveil significantly different trajectories, reminiscent of chaotic systems. Lyapunov exponents become our lens into understanding stability and chaos within the system. A comparative analysis between the dynamic system's approximate solutions and the actual nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function enhances our comprehension of model accuracy and its potential implications for number theory.
  This research illuminates the versatility of dynamic systems as analogs for studying complex mathematical phenomena. It provides fresh perspectives on the pair correlation conjecture, establishing connections with nonlinear dynamics and chaos theory. Notably, we delve into the boundedness of solutions for both small and large initial conditions, unraveling the distinctive probability distribution governing the dynamics in each scenario. Furthermore, we introduce an in-depth analysis of the entropy of our dynamic system for both small and large initial conditions. The entropy study enhances our understanding of the predictability and stability of the system, shedding light on its behavior in different parameter regimes.</description>

      <title>Chaotic dynamics creates and destroys branched flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The phenomenon of branched flow, visualized as a chaotic arborescent pattern of propagating particles, waves, or rays, has been identified in disparate physical systems ranging from electrons to tsunamis, with periodic systems only recently being added to this list. Here, we explore the laws governing the evolution of the branches in periodic potentials. On one hand, we observe that branch formation follows a similar pattern in all non-integrable potentials, no matter whether the potentials are periodic or completely irregular. Chaotic dynamics ultimately drives the birth of the branches. On the other hand, our results reveal that for periodic potentials the decay of the branches exhibits new characteristics due to the presence of infinitely stable branches known as superwires. Again, the interplay between branched flow and superwires is deeply connected to Hamiltonian chaos. In this work, we explore the relationships between the laws of branched flow and the structures of phase space, providing extensive numerical and theoretical arguments to support our findings.</description>

      <title>New Reservoir Computing Kernel Based on Chaotic Chua Circuit and Investigating Application to Post-Quantum Cryptography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this project was to develop a new Reservoir Computer implementation, based on a chaotic Chua circuit. In addition to suitable classification and regression benchmarks, the Reservoir Computer was applied to Post-Quantum Cryptography, with its suitability for this application investigated and assessed. The cryptographic algorithm utilised was the Learning with Errors problem, for both encryption and decryption. To achieve this, the Chua circuit was characterised, in simulation, and by physical circuit testing. The Reservoir Computer was designed and implemented using the results of the characterisation. As part of this development, noise was considered and mitigated.
  The benchmarks demonstrate that the Reservoir Computer can achieve current literature benchmarks with low error. However, the results with Learning with Errors suggest that a Chua-based Reservoir Computer is not sufficiently complex to tackle the high non-linearity in Post-Quantum Cryptography. Future work would involve researching the use of different combinations of multiple Chua Reservoir Computers in larger neural network architectures. Such architectures may produce the required high-dimensional behaviour to achieve the Learning with Errors problem.
  This project is believed to be only the second instance of a Chua-based Reservoir Computer in academia, and it is the first to be applied to challenging real-world tasks such as Post-Quantum Cryptography. It is also original by its investigation of hitherto unexplored parameters, and their impact on performance. It demonstrates a proof-of-concept for a mass-producible, inexpensive, low-power consumption hardware neural network. It also enables the next stages in research to occur, paving the road for using Chua-based Reservoir Computers across various applications.</description>

      <title>On instabilities in neural network-based physics simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When neural networks are trained from data to simulate the dynamics of physical systems, they encounter a persistent challenge: the long-time dynamics they produce are often unphysical or unstable. We analyze the origin of such instabilities when learning linear dynamical systems, focusing on the training dynamics. We make several analytical findings which empirical observations suggest extend to nonlinear dynamical systems. First, the rate of convergence of the training dynamics is uneven and depends on the distribution of energy in the data. As a special case, the dynamics in directions where the data have no energy cannot be learned. Second, in the unlearnable directions, the dynamics produced by the neural network depend on the weight initialization, and common weight initialization schemes can produce unstable dynamics. Third, injecting synthetic noise into the data during training adds damping to the training dynamics and can stabilize the learned simulator, though doing so undesirably biases the learned dynamics. For each contributor to instability, we suggest mitigative strategies. We also highlight important differences between learning discrete-time and continuous-time dynamics, and discuss extensions to nonlinear systems.</description>

      <title>Complex fractal trainability boundary can arise from trivial non-convexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training neural networks involves optimizing parameters to minimize a loss function, where the nature of the loss function and the optimization strategy are crucial for effective training. Hyperparameter choices, such as the learning rate in gradient descent (GD), significantly affect the success and speed of convergence. Recent studies indicate that the boundary between bounded and divergent hyperparameters can be fractal, complicating reliable hyperparameter selection. However, the nature of this fractal boundary and methods to avoid it remain unclear. In this study, we focus on GD to investigate the loss landscape properties that might lead to fractal trainability boundaries. We discovered that fractal boundaries can emerge from simple non-convex perturbations, i.e., adding or multiplying cosine type perturbations to quadratic functions. The observed fractal dimensions are influenced by factors like parameter dimension, type of non-convexity, perturbation wavelength, and perturbation amplitude. Our analysis identifies "roughness of perturbation", which measures the gradient's sensitivity to parameter changes, as the factor controlling fractal dimensions of trainability boundaries. We observed a clear transition from non-fractal to fractal trainability boundaries as roughness increases, with the critical roughness causing the perturbed loss function non-convex. Thus, we conclude that fractal trainability boundaries can arise from very simple non-convexity. We anticipate that our findings will enhance the understanding of complex behaviors during neural network training, leading to more consistent and predictable training strategies.</description>

      <title>Prediction of Unobserved Bifurcation by Unsupervised Extraction of Slowly Time-Varying System Parameter Dynamics from Time Series Using Reservoir Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear and non-stationary processes are prevalent in various natural and physical phenomena, where system dynamics can change qualitatively due to bifurcation phenomena. Traditional machine learning methods have advanced our ability to learn and predict such systems from observed time series data. However, predicting the behavior of systems with temporal parameter variations without knowledge of true parameter values remains a significant challenge. This study leverages the reservoir computing framework to address this problem by unsupervised extraction of slowly varying system parameters from time series data. We propose a model architecture consisting of a slow reservoir with long timescale internal dynamics and a fast reservoir with short timescale dynamics. The slow reservoir extracts the temporal variation of system parameters, which are then used to predict unknown bifurcations in the fast dynamics. Through experiments using data generated from chaotic dynamical systems, we demonstrate the ability to predict bifurcations not present in the training data. Our approach shows potential for applications in fields such as neuroscience, material science, and weather prediction, where slow dynamics influencing qualitative changes are often unobservable.</description>

Abstract: We will study the relationship between two well-known theories, genetic evolution and random matrix theory in the context of many-body systems. We show that the time evolution of certain quantum mechanical toy models is similar to that of a living cell. It is also suggested that genetic evolution can be described by a random matrix theory with statistical distribution in which natural selection acts as a Gross-Witten-Wadia phase transition.</description>

      <title>Poles, Shocks and Tygers: The Time-reversible Burgers equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12624v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a formally time-reversible, one-dimensional forced Burgers equation by imposing a global constraint of energy conservation, wherein the constant viscosity is modified to a fluctuating state-dependent dissipation coefficient. The system exhibits dynamical properties which bear strong similarities with those observed for the Burgers equation and can be understood using the dynamics of the poles, shocks, and truncation effects, such as tygers. A complex interplay of these give rise to interesting statistical regimes ranging from hydrodynamic behavior to a completely thermalized warm phase. The end of the hydrodynamic regime is associated with the appearance of a shock in the solution and a continuous transition leading to a truncation-dependent state. Beyond this, the truncation effects such as tygers and the appearance of secondary discontinuity at the resonance point in the solution strongly influence the statistical properties. These disappear at the second transition, at which the global quantities exhibit a jump and attain values that are consistent with the establishment of a quasiequilibrium state characterized by energy equipartition among the Fourier modes. Our comparative analysis shows that the macroscopic statistical properties of the formally time-reversible system and the Burgers equation are equivalent in all the regimes, irrespective of the truncation effects, and this equivalence is not just limited to the hydrodynamic regime, thereby further strengthening the Gallavotti's equivalence conjecture. The properties of the system are further examined by inspecting the complex space singularities in the velocity field of the Burgers equation. Furthermore, an effective theory is proposed to describe the discontinuous transition.</description>

      <title>Attractor Memory for Long-Term Time Series Forecasting: A Chaos Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11463v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) tasks, an increasing number of models have acknowledged that discrete time series originate from continuous dynamic systems and have attempted to model their dynamical structures. Recognizing the chaotic nature of real-world data, our model, \textbf{\textit{Attraos}}, incorporates chaos theory into LTSF, perceiving real-world time series as observations from unknown high-dimensional chaotic dynamic systems. Under the concept of attractor invariance, Attraos utilizes non-parametric Phase Space Reconstruction embedding and the proposed multi-scale dynamic memory unit to memorize historical dynamics structure and predicts by a frequency-enhanced local evolution strategy. Detailed theoretical analysis and abundant empirical evidence consistently show that Attraos outperforms various LTSF methods on mainstream LTSF datasets and chaotic datasets with only one-twelfth of the parameters compared to PatchTST.</description>

      <title>ICO learning as a measure of transient chaos in PT-symmetric Li\'enard systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08414v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the implications of the unsupervised learning rule known as Input-Correlations (ICO) learning in the nonlinear dynamics of two linearly coupled PT-symmetric Li\'enard oscillators. The fixed points of the oscillator have been evaluated analytically and the Jacobian linearization is employed to study their stability. We find that on increasing the amplitude of the external periodic drive, the system exhibits period-doubling cascade to chaos within a specific parametric regime wherein we observe emergent chaotic dynamics. We further notice that the system indicates an intermittency route to chaos in the chaotic regime. Finally, in the period-4 regime of our bifurcation analysis, we predict the emergence of transient chaos which eventually settles down to a period-2 oscillator response which has been further validated by both the maximal Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE) using the well-known Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization technique and the Hilbert Transform of the time-series. In the transiently chaotic regime, we deploy the ICO learning to analyze the time-series from which we identify that when the chaotic evolution transforms into periodic dynamics, the synaptic weight associated with the time-series of the loss oscillator exhibits stationary temporal evolution. This signifies that in the periodic regime, there is no overlap between the filtered signals obtained from the time-series of the coupled PT-symmetric oscillators. In addition, the temporal evolution of the weight associated with the stimulus mimics the behaviour of the Hilbert transform of the time-series.</description>

      <title>Near-horizon chaos beyond Einstein gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09945v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate chaos in the dynamics of outgoing massless particles near the horizon of static spherically symmetric (SSS) black holes in two well-motivated models of $f(R)$ gravity. In both these models, we probe chaos in the particle trajectories (under suitable harmonic confinement) in the vicinity of the black hole horizons, for a set of initial conditions. The particle trajectories, associated Poincar$\acute{e}$ sections, and Lyapunov exponents clearly illustrate the role played by the black hole horizon in the growth of chaos. We find that with increasing energy, the particle trajectories explore regions closer to the black hole horizon, with reduced overlap between two initially close trajectories. We demonstrate how this energy range is controlled by the parameters of the modified gravity theory under consideration. The growth of chaos in such a classical setting is known to respect a surface gravity bound arising from universal aspects of particle dynamics close to the black hole horizon [K. Hashimoto and N. Tanahashi, Phys. Rev. D 95, 024007 (2017)], analogous to the quantum MSS bound [J. Maldacena, S.H. Shenker and D. Stanford, JHEP 08 (2016) 106]. Interestingly, both models studied in our work respect the bound, in contrast to some of the other models of $f(R)$ gravity in the existing literature. The work serves as a motivation to use chaos as an additional tool to probe Einstein gravity in the strong gravity regime in the vicinity of black hole horizons.</description>
