      <title>FFT reconstruction of signals from MIMO sampled data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative approach for signal reconstruction using data acquired through multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) sampling. First, we show that it is possible to perfectly reconstruct a set of periodic band-limited signals $\{x_r(t)\}_{r=1}^R$ from the samples of $\{y_m(t)\}_{m=1}^M$, which are the output signals of a MIMO system with inputs $\{x_r(t)\}_{r=1}^R$. Moreover, an FFT-based algorithm is designed to perform the reconstruction efficiently. It is demonstrated that this algorithm encompasses FFT interpolation and multi-channel interpolation as special cases. Then, we investigate the consistency property and the aliasing error of the proposed sampling and reconstruction framework to evaluate its effectiveness in reconstructing non-band-limited signals. The analytical expression for the averaged mean square error (MSE) caused by aliasing is presented. Finally, the theoretical results are validated by numerical simulations, and the performance of the proposed reconstruction method in the presence of noise is also examined.</description>

      <title>The Interference Broadcast Channel with Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces: A Cooperative Sum-Rate Maximization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the interference broadcast channel comprising multiple multi-antenna Base Stations (BSs), each controlling a beyond diagonal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) and serving multiple single-antenna users. Wideband transmissions are considered with the objective to jointly design the BS linear precoding vectors and the phase configurations at the RISs in a distributed manner. We take into account the frequency selectivity behavior of each RIS's tunable meta-element, and focusing on the sum rate as the system's performance criterion, we present a distributed optimization approach that enables cooperation between the RIS control units and their respective BSs. According to the proposed scheme, each design variable can be efficiently obtained in an iterative parallel way with guaranteed convergence properties. Our simulation results demonstrate the validity of the presented distributed algorithm and showcase its superiority over a non-cooperative scheme as well as over the special case where the RISs have a conventional diagonal structure.</description>

      <title>Generating High Dimensional User-Specific Wireless Channels using Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural network (DNN)-based algorithms are emerging as an important tool for many physical and MAC layer functions in future wireless communication systems, including for large multi-antenna channels. However, training such models typically requires a large dataset of high-dimensional channel measurements, which are very difficult and expensive to obtain. This paper introduces a novel method for generating synthetic wireless channel data using diffusion-based models to produce user-specific channels that accurately reflect real-world wireless environments. Our approach employs a conditional denoising diffusion implicit models (cDDIM) framework, effectively capturing the relationship between user location and multi-antenna channel characteristics. We generate synthetic high fidelity channel samples using user positions as conditional inputs, creating larger augmented datasets to overcome measurement scarcity. The utility of this method is demonstrated through its efficacy in training various downstream tasks such as channel compression and beam alignment. Our approach significantly improves over prior methods, such as adding noise or using generative adversarial networks (GANs), especially in scenarios with limited initial measurements.</description>

      <title>Low-Earth Orbit Satellite Network Analysis: Coverage under Distance-Dependent Shadowing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper offers a thorough analysis of the coverage performance of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite networks using a strongest satellite association approach, with a particular emphasis on shadowing effects modeled through a Poisson point process (PPP)-based network framework. We derive an analytical expression for the coverage probability, which incorporates key system parameters and a distance-dependent shadowing probability function, explicitly accounting for both line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight propagation channels. To enhance the practical relevance of our findings, we provide both lower and upper bounds for the coverage probability and introduce a closed-form solution based on a simplified shadowing model. Our analysis reveals several important network design insights, including the enhancement of coverage probability by distance-dependent shadowing effects and the identification of an optimal satellite altitude that balances beam gain benefits with interference drawbacks. Notably, our PPP-based network model shows strong alignment with other established models, confirming its accuracy and applicability across a variety of satellite network configurations. The insights gained from our analysis are valuable for optimizing LEO satellite deployment strategies and improving network performance in diverse scenarios.</description>

      <title>A Generalization of Axiomatic Approach to Information Leakage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the framework of quantitative information flow (QIF) to include adversaries that use Kolmogorov-Nagumo $f$-mean to infer secrets of a private system. Specifically, in our setting, an adversary uses Kolmogorov-Nagumo $f$-mean to compute its best actions before and after observing the system's randomized outputs. This leads to generalized notions of prior and posterior vulnerability and generalized axiomatic relations that we will derive to elucidate how these $f$-mean based vulnerabilities interact with each other. We demonstrate usefulness of this framework by showing how some notions of leakage that had been derived outside of the QIF framework and so far seemed incompatible with it are indeed explainable via such extension of QIF. These leakage measures include $\alpha$-leakage, which is the same as Arimoto mutual information of order $\alpha$, maximal $\alpha$-leakage which is the $\alpha$-leakage capacity, and $(\alpha,\beta)$ leakage, which is a generalization of the above and captures local differential privacy as a special case. We also propose a new pointwise notion of gain function, which we coin pointwise information gain. We show that this pointwise information gain can explain R\'eyni divergence and Sibson mutual information of order $\alpha \in [0,\infty]$ as the Kolmogorov-Nagumo average of the gain with a proper choice of function $f$.</description>

      <title>Locally recoverable algebro-geometric codes with multiple recovery sets from projective bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A code is locally recoverable when each symbol in one of its code words can be reconstructed as a function of $r$ other symbols. We use bundles of projective spaces over a line to construct locally recoverable codes with availability; that is, evaluation codes where each code word symbol can be reconstructed from several disjoint sets of other symbols. The simplest case, where the code's underlying variety is a plane, exhibits noteworthy properties: When $r = 1$, $2$, $3$, they are optimal; when $r \geq 4$, they are optimal with probability approaching $1$ as the alphabet size grows. Additionally, their information rate is close to the theoretical limit. In higher dimensions, our codes form a family of asymptotically good codes.</description>

      <title>Firefly Algorithm for Movable Antenna Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter addresses a multivariate optimization problem for linear movable antenna arrays (MAAs). Particularly, the position and beamforming vectors of the under-investigated MAA are optimized simultaneously to maximize the minimum beamforming gain across several intended directions, while ensuring interference levels at various unintended directions remain below specified thresholds. To this end, a swarm-intelligence-based firefly algorithm (FA) is introduced to acquire an effective solution to the optimization problem. Simulation results reveal the superior performance of the proposed FA approach compared to the state-of-the-art approach employing alternating optimization and successive convex approximation. This is attributed to the FA's effectiveness in handling non-convex multivariate and multimodal optimization problems without resorting approximations.</description>

      <title>Neural Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the connection between deep learning and information theory through the paradigm of diffusion models. Using well-established principles from non-equilibrium thermodynamics we can characterize the amount of information required to reverse a diffusive process. Neural networks store this information and operate in a manner reminiscent of Maxwell's demon during the generative stage. We illustrate this cycle using a novel diffusion scheme we call the entropy matching model, wherein the information conveyed to the network during training exactly corresponds to the entropy that must be negated during reversal. We demonstrate that this entropy can be used to analyze the encoding efficiency and storage capacity of the network. This conceptual picture blends elements of stochastic optimal control, thermodynamics, information theory, and optimal transport, and raises the prospect of applying diffusion models as a test bench to understand neural networks.</description>

      <title>3D-GP-LMVIC: Learning-based Multi-View Image Coding with 3D Gaussian Geometric Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-view image compression is vital for 3D-related applications. To effectively model correlations between views, existing methods typically predict disparity between two views on a 2D plane, which works well for small disparities, such as in stereo images, but struggles with larger disparities caused by significant view changes. To address this, we propose a novel approach: learning-based multi-view image coding with 3D Gaussian geometric priors (3D-GP-LMVIC). Our method leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting to derive geometric priors of the 3D scene, enabling more accurate disparity estimation across views within the compression model. Additionally, we introduce a depth map compression model to reduce redundancy in geometric information between views. A multi-view sequence ordering method is also proposed to enhance correlations between adjacent views. Experimental results demonstrate that 3D-GP-LMVIC surpasses both traditional and learning-based methods in performance, while maintaining fast encoding and decoding speed.</description>

      <title>Automatic Generation of Examinations in the Automatic Control Courses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Final written examination is the most important part of summative assessment in automatic control courses. Preparation of the examinations with a given number of points according to the concept of Constructive Alignment (which could be the main concept in future automatic control education) takes significant amount of time of the educator and motivates development of a toolkit for automatic compilation of examination problems. A decision support Matlab-LATEX toolkit based on random number generators for selection of examination problems is described in this report to facilitate the alignment. The toolkit allows application of Stepwise Constructive Alignment (a new method described in this report), where the alignment is achieved by a number of software runs associated with random trials. In each step the educator manually selects suitable problems before each run based on evaluation of the random choice from the previous run. Automatic generation of the examination together with solutions for the course 'Process control and measurement techniques' is presented as an example.</description>

      <title>Compressed Hypothesis Testing: To Mix or Not to Mix?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07528</link>
      <description>arXiv:1609.07528v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of determining $k$ anomalous random variables that have different probability distributions from the rest $(n-k)$ random variables. Instead of sampling each individual random variable separately as in the conventional hypothesis testing, we propose to perform hypothesis testing using mixed observations that are functions of multiple random variables. We characterize the error exponents for correctly identifying the $k$ anomalous random variables under fixed time-invariant mixed observations, random time-varying mixed observations, and deterministic time-varying mixed observations. For our error exponent characterization, we introduce the notions of inner conditional Chernoff information and outer conditional Chernoff information. It is demonstrated that mixed observations can strictly improve the error exponents of hypothesis testing, over separate observations of individual random variables. We further characterize the optimal sensing vector maximizing the error exponents, which leads to explicit constructions of the optimal mixed observations in special cases of hypothesis testing for Gaussian random variables. These results show that mixed observations of random variables can reduce the number of required samples in hypothesis testing applications. In order to solve large-scale hypothesis testing problems, we also propose efficient algorithms - LASSO based and message passing based hypothesis testing algorithms.</description>

      <title>Construction Methods Based on Minimum Weight Distribution for Polar Codes with Successive Cancellation List Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.13019v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Minimum weight distribution (MWD) is an important metric to calculate the first term of union bound called minimum weight union bound (MWUB). In this paper, we first prove the maximum likelihood (ML) performance approaches MWUB as signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) goes to infinity and provide the deviation when MWD and SNR are given. Then, we propose a nested reliability sequence, namely MWD sequence, to construct polar codes independently of channel information. In the sequence, synthetic channels are sorted by partial MWD which is used to evaluate the influence of information bit on MWD and we prove the MWD sequence is the optimum sequence evaluated by MWUB for polar codes obeying partial order. Finally, we introduce an entropy constraint to establish a relationship between list size and MWUB and propose a heuristic construction method named entropy constraint bit-swapping (ECBS) algorithm, where we initialize information set by the MWD sequence and gradually swap information bit and frozen bit to satisfy the entropy constraint. The simulation results show the MWD sequence is more suitable for constructing polar codes with short code length than the polar sequence in 5G and the ECBS algorithm can improve MWD to show better performance as list size increases.</description>

      <title>The Mutual Information In The Vicinity of Capacity-Achieving Input Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.14219v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mutual information is bounded from above by a decreasing affine function of the square of the distance between the input distribution and the set of all capacity-achieving input distributions $\Pi_{\mathcal{A}}$, on small enough neighborhoods of $\Pi_{\mathcal{A}}$, using an identity due to Tops{\o}e and the Pinsker's inequality, assuming that the input set of the channel is finite and the constraint set $\mathcal{A}$ is polyhedral, i.e., can be described by (possibly multiple but) finitely many linear constraints. Counterexamples demonstrating nonexistence of such a quadratic bound are provided for the case of infinitely many linear constraints and the case of infinite input sets. Using Taylor's theorem with the remainder term, rather than the Pinsker's inequality and invoking Moreau's decomposition theorem the exact characterization of the slowest decrease of the mutual information with the distance to $\Pi_{\mathcal{A}}$ is determined on small neighborhoods of $\Pi_{\mathcal{A}}$. Corresponding results for classical-quantum channels are established under separable output Hilbert space assumption for the quadratic bound and under finite-dimensional output Hilbert space assumption for the exact characterization. Implications of these observations for the channel coding problem and applications of the proof techniques to related problems are discussed.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Communications: A Tutorial Review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.17751v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extremely large-scale antenna arrays, tremendously high frequencies, and new types of antennas are three clear trends in multi-antenna technology for supporting the sixth-generation (6G) networks. To properly account for the new characteristics introduced by these three trends in communication system design, the near-field spherical-wave propagation model needs to be used, which differs from the classical far-field planar-wave one. As such, near-field communication (NFC) will become essential in 6G networks. In this tutorial, we cover three key aspects of NFC. 1) Channel Modelling: We commence by reviewing near-field spherical-wave-based channel models for spatially-discrete (SPD) antennas. Then, uniform spherical wave (USW) and non-uniform spherical wave (NUSW) models are discussed. Subsequently, we introduce a general near-field channel model for SPD antennas and a Green's function-based channel model for continuous-aperture (CAP) antennas. 2) Beamfocusing and Antenna Architectures: We highlight the properties of near-field beamfocusing and discuss NFC antenna architectures for both SPD and CAP antennas. Moreover, the basic principles of near-field beam training are introduced. 3) Performance Analysis: Finally, we provide a comprehensive performance analysis framework for NFC. For near-field line-of-sight channels, the received signal-to-noise ratio and power-scaling law are derived. For statistical near-field multipath channels, a general analytical framework is proposed, based on which analytical expressions for the outage probability, ergodic channel capacity, and ergodic mutual information are obtained. Finally, for each aspect, topics for future research are discussed.</description>

      <title>On the invariance of the Kolmogorov complexity of $\beta$-expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a relationship between the algorithmic (Kolmogorov) complexity of the prefixes of any binary expansion and a specific $\beta$-expansion, for every computable $\beta \in (1,2)$. The proof of the main statement crucially hinges on the development of a new dynamical system that generates this specific $\beta$-expansion. This dynamical system can be implemented on a computer.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Beamforming Design for Integrated Sensing and Communication Exploiting Prior Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the hybrid beamforming design for a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, where a multi-antenna base station (BS) with hybrid analog-digital transmit antenna arrays sends dual-functional signals to communicate with a multi-antenna user and simultaneously sense the location information of a point target based on the reflected echo signals. Specifically, we aim to sense the target's unknown and random angle information by exploiting its prior distribution information, with posterior Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound (PCRB) employed as the sensing performance metric. First, we consider a sensing-only case and study the hybrid beamforming optimization to minimize the sensing PCRB. We analytically prove that hybrid beamforming can achieve the same performance as the optimized digital beamforming as long as the number of radio frequency (RF) chains is larger than 1. Then, we propose a convex relaxation based algorithm for the hybrid beamforming design with a single RF chain. Next, we study the hybrid beamforming optimization to minimize the PCRB subject to a communication rate target. Due to the intractability of the exact PCRB expression, we replace it with a tight upper bound. Although this problem is still non-convex and challenging to solve, we propose an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm for finding a high-quality suboptimal solution based on the feasible point pursuit successive convex approximation (FPP-SCA) method. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of our proposed hybrid beamforming design.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Algorithm for Group Testing with Runlength Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide an efficient algorithm to construct almost optimal $(k,n,d)$-superimposed codes with runlength constraints. A $(k,n,d)$-superimposed code of length $t$ is a $t \times n$ binary matrix such that any two 1's in each column are separated by a run of at least $d$ 0's, and such that for any column $\mathbf{c}$ and any other $k-1$ columns, there exists a row where $\mathbf{c}$ has $1$ and all the remaining $k-1$ columns have $0$. These combinatorial structures were introduced by Agarwal et al. [1], in the context of Non-Adaptive Group Testing algorithms with runlength constraints.
  By using Moser and Tardos' constructive version of the Lov\'asz Local Lemma, we provide an efficient randomized Las Vegas algorithm of complexity $\Theta(t n^2)$ for the construction of $(k,n,d)$-superimposed codes of length $t=O(dk\log n +k^2\log n)$. We also show that the length of our codes is shorter, for $n$ sufficiently large, than that of the codes whose existence was proved in [1].</description>

      <title>Minimax Optimal Algorithms with Fixed-$k$-Nearest Neighbors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.02464v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents how to perform minimax optimal classification, regression, and density estimation based on fixed-$k$ nearest neighbor (NN) searches. We consider a distributed learning scenario, in which a massive dataset is split into smaller groups, where the $k$-NNs are found for a query point with respect to each subset of data. We propose \emph{optimal} rules to aggregate the fixed-$k$-NN information for classification, regression, and density estimation that achieve minimax optimal rates for the respective problems. We show that the distributed algorithm with a fixed $k$ over a sufficiently large number of groups attains a minimax optimal error rate up to a multiplicative logarithmic factor under some regularity conditions. Roughly speaking, distributed $k$-NN rules with $M$ groups has a performance comparable to the standard $\Theta(kM)$-NN rules even for fixed $k$.</description>

      <title>Quotient Space Quantum Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07265v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Additive codes and some nonadditive codes use the single and multiple invariant subspaces of the stabilizer G, respectively, to construct quantum codes, so the selection of the invariant subspaces is a key problem. In this paper, I provide the necessary and sufficient conditions for this problem and, establish the quotient space codes to construct quantum codes. These new codes unify additive codes and codeword stabilized codes and can transmit classical codewords. Actually, I give an alternative approach to constructing union stabilizer codes, which is different from that of Markus Grassl and Martin Roetteler, and which is easier to deal with degenerate codes. I also present new bounds for quantum codes and provide a simple proof of the quantum Singleton bound. The quotient space approach provides a concise and clear mathematical framework for the study of quantum error-correcting codes.</description>

      <title>Improving the Gilbert-Varshamov bound for permutation Codes in the Cayley metric and Kendall $\tau$-Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15126v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Cayley distance between two permutations $\pi, \sigma \in S_n$ is the minimum number of \textit{transpositions} required to obtain the permutation $\sigma$ from $\pi$. When we only allow adjacent transpositions, the minimum number of such transpositions to obtain $\sigma$ from $\pi$ is referred to the Kendall $\tau$-distance. A set $C$ of permutation words of length $n$ is called a $d$-Cayley permutation code if every pair of distinct permutations in $C$ has Cayley distance at least $d$. A $d$-Kendall permutation code is defined similarly. Let $C(n,d)$ and $K(n,d)$ be the maximum size of a $d$-Cayley and a $d$-Kendall permutation code of length $n$, respectively. In this paper, we improve the Gilbert-Varshamov bound asymptotically by a factor $\log(n)$, namely \[ C(n,d+1) \geq \Omega_d\left(\frac{n!\log n}{n^{2d}}\right) \text{ and } K(n,d+1) \geq \Omega_d\left(\frac{n! \log n}{n^d}\right).\] Our proof is based on graph theory techniques.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Nearly Self-Orthogonal Quasi-Twisted Codes and Related Quantum Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15057v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quasi-twisted codes are used here as the classical ingredients in the so-called Construction X for quantum error-control codes. The construction utilizes nearly self-orthogonal codes to design quantum stabilizer codes. We expand the choices of the inner product to also cover the symplectic and trace-symplectic inner products, in addition to the original Hermitian one. A refined lower bound on the minimum distance of the resulting quantum codes is established and illustrated. We report numerous record breaking quantum codes from our randomized search for inclusion in the updated online database.</description>

      <title>Joint Transmission and Compression Optimization for Networked Sensing with Limited-Capacity Fronthaul Links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03174v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers networked sensing in cellular network, where multiple base stations (BSs) first compress their received echo signals from multiple targets and then forward the quantized signals to the central unit (CU) via limited-capacity fronthaul links, such that the CU can leverage all useful echo signals to perform high-resolution localization. Under this setup, we manage to characterize the posterior Cramer-Rao Bound (PCRB) for localizing all the targets with random positions as a function of the transmit covariance matrix and the compression noise covariance matrix of each BS. Then, a PCRB minimization problem subject to the transmit power constraints and the fronthaul capacity constraints is formulated to jointly design the BSs' transmission and compression strategies. We propose an efficient algorithm to solve this problem based on the alternating optimization technique. Specifically, it is shown that when either the transmit covariance matrices or the compression noise covariance matrices are fixed, the successive convex approximation (SCA) technique can be leveraged to optimize the other type of covariance matrices locally optimally. Moreover, we also propose a novel estimate-then-beamform-then-compress strategy for the massive receive antenna scenario, under which each BS first estimates targets' angle-of-arrivals (AOAs) locally, then beamforms its high-dimension received signals into low-dimension ones based on the estimated AOAs, and last compresses the beamformed signals for fronthaul transmission. An efficient beamforming and compression design method is devised under this strategy. Numerical results are provided to verify the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms.</description>
