      <title>Entrywise dynamics and universality of general first order methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: General first order methods (GFOMs), including various gradient descent and AMP algorithms, constitute a broad class of iterative algorithms in modern statistical learning problems. Some GFOMs also serve as constructive proof devices, iteratively characterizing the empirical distributions of statistical estimators in the large system limits for any fixed number of iterations.
  This paper develops a non-asymptotic, entrywise characterization for a general class of GFOMs. Our characterizations capture the precise entrywise behavior of the GFOMs, and hold universally across a broad class of heterogeneous random matrix models. As a corollary, we provide the first non-asymptotic description of the empirical distributions of the GFOMs beyond Gaussian ensembles.
  We demonstrate the utility of these general results in two applications. In the first application, we prove entrywise universality for regularized least squares estimators in the linear model, by controlling the entrywise error relative to a suitably constructed GFOM. This algorithmic proof method also leads to systematically improved averaged universality results for regularized regression estimators in the linear model, and resolves the universality conjecture for (regularized) MLEs in logistic regression. In the second application, we obtain entrywise Gaussian approximations for a class of gradient descent algorithms. Our approach provides non-asymptotic state evolution for the bias and variance of the algorithm along the iteration path, applicable for non-convex loss functions.
  The proof relies on a new recursive leave-k-out method that provides almost delocalization for the GFOMs and their derivatives. Crucially, our method ensures entrywise universality for up to poly-logarithmic many iterations, which facilitates effective $\ell_2/\ell_\infty$ control between certain GFOMs and statistical estimators in applications.</description>

      <title>On asymptotic independence in higher dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the study of extremes, the presence of asymptotic independence signifies that extreme events across multiple variables are probably less likely to occur together. Although well-understood in a bivariate context, the concept remains relatively unexplored when addressing the nuances of joint occurrence of extremes in higher dimensions. In this paper, we propose a notion of mutual asymptotic independence to capture the behavior of joint extremes in dimensions larger than two and contrast it with the classical notion of (pairwise) asymptotic independence. Furthermore, we define $k$-wise asymptotic independence which lies in between pairwise and mutual asymptotic independence. The concepts are compared using examples of Archimedean, Gaussian and Marshall-Olkin copulas among others. Notably, for the popular Gaussian copula, we provide explicit conditions on the correlation matrix for mutual asymptotic independence to hold; moreover, we are able to compute exact tail orders for various tail events.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a change-point problem for a centered, stationary and $m$-dependent multivariate random field. Under the distribution free assumption, a change-point test using CUSUM statistic is proposed to detect anomalies within a multidimensional random field, controlling the false positive rate as well as the Family-Wise Error in the multiple hypotheses testing context.</description>

      <title>The Instrumental Variable Model with Categorical Instrument, Treatment and Outcome</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09510v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Instrumental variable models are central to the inference of causal effects in many settings. We consider the instrumental variable model with discrete variables where the instrument (Z), exposure (X) and outcome (Y) take Q, K, and M levels respectively. We assume that the instrument is randomized and that there is no direct effect of Z on Y so that Y(x,z) = Y(x). We first provide a simple characterization of the set of joint distributions of the potential outcomes P(Y(x=1), ..., Y(x=K)) compatible with a given observed distribution P(X, Y | Z). We then discuss the variation (in)dependence property of the marginal probability distribution of the potential outcomes P(Y(x=1)), ..., P(Y(x=K)) which has direct implications for partial identification of average causal effect contrasts such as E[Y(x=i) - Y(x=j)]. We also include simulation results on the volume of the observed distributions not compatible with the IV model as K and Q change.</description>

      <title>The Bayesian Infinitesimal Jackknife for Variance</title>

Abstract: The frequentist variability of Bayesian posterior expectations can provide meaningful measures of uncertainty even when models are misspecified. Classical methods to asymptotically approximate the frequentist covariance of Bayesian estimators such as the Laplace approximation and the nonparametric bootstrap can be practically inconvenient, since the Laplace approximation may require an intractable integral to compute the marginal log posterior, and the bootstrap requires computing the posterior for many different bootstrap datasets. We develop and explore the infinitesimal jackknife (IJ), an alternative method for computing asymptotic frequentist covariance of smooth functionals of exchangeable data, which is based on the "influence function" of robust statistics. We show that the influence function for posterior expectations has the form of a simple posterior covariance, and that the IJ covariance estimate is, in turn, easily computed from a single set of posterior samples. Under conditions similar to those required for a Bayesian central limit theorem to apply, we prove that the corresponding IJ covariance estimate is asymptotically equivalent to the Laplace approximation and the bootstrap. In the presence of nuisance parameters that may not obey a central limit theorem, we argue using a von Mises expansion that the IJ covariance is inconsistent, but can remain a good approximation to the limiting frequentist variance. We demonstrate the accuracy and computational benefits of the IJ covariance estimates with simulated and real-world experiments.</description>

      <title>Functional Adaptive Double-Sparsity Estimator for Functional Linear Regression Model with Multiple Functional Covariates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.10054v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sensor devices have been increasingly used in engineering and health studies recently, and the captured multi-dimensional activity and vital sign signals can be studied in association with health outcomes to inform public health. The common approach is the scalar-on-function regression model, in which health outcomes are the scalar responses while high-dimensional sensor signals are the functional covariates, but how to effectively interpret results becomes difficult. In this study, we propose a new Functional Adaptive Double-Sparsity (FadDoS) estimator based on functional regularization of sparse group lasso with multiple functional predictors, which can achieve global sparsity via functional variable selection and local sparsity via zero-subinterval identification within coefficient functions. We prove that the FadDoS estimator converges at a bounded rate and satisfies the oracle property under mild conditions. Extensive simulation studies confirm the theoretical properties and exhibit excellent performances compared to existing approaches. Application to a Kinect sensor study that utilized an advanced motion sensing device tracking human multiple joint movements and conducted among community-dwelling elderly demonstrates how the FadDoS estimator can effectively characterize the detailed association between joint movements and physical health assessments. The proposed method is not only effective in Kinect sensor analysis but also applicable to broader fields, where multi-dimensional sensor signals are collected simultaneously, to expand the use of sensor devices in health studies and facilitate sensor data analysis.</description>

      <title>Inference in Experiments with Matched Pairs and Imperfect Compliance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies inference for the local average treatment effect in randomized controlled trials with imperfect compliance where treatment status is determined according to "matched pairs." By "matched pairs," we mean that units are sampled i.i.d. from the population of interest, paired according to observed, baseline covariates and finally, within each pair, one unit is selected at random for treatment. Under weak assumptions governing the quality of the pairings, we first derive the limit distribution of the usual Wald (i.e., two-stage least squares) estimator of the local average treatment effect. We show further that conventional heteroskedasticity-robust estimators of the Wald estimator's limiting variance are generally conservative, in that their probability limits are (typically strictly) larger than the limiting variance. We therefore provide an alternative estimator of the limiting variance that is consistent. Finally, we consider the use of additional observed, baseline covariates not used in pairing units to increase the precision with which we can estimate the local average treatment effect. To this end, we derive the limiting behavior of a two-stage least squares estimator of the local average treatment effect which includes both the additional covariates in addition to pair fixed effects, and show that its limiting variance is always less than or equal to that of the Wald estimator. To complete our analysis, we provide a consistent estimator of this limiting variance. A simulation study confirms the practical relevance of our theoretical results. Finally, we apply our results to revisit a prominent experiment studying the effect of macroinsurance on microenterprise in Egypt.</description>

      <title>Cutting Feedback in Misspecified Copula Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03521v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In copula models the marginal distributions and copula function are specified separately. We treat these as two modules in a modular Bayesian inference framework, and propose conducting modified Bayesian inference by "cutting feedback". Cutting feedback limits the influence of potentially misspecified modules in posterior inference. We consider two types of cuts. The first limits the influence of a misspecified copula on inference for the marginals, which is a Bayesian analogue of the popular Inference for Margins (IFM) estimator. The second limits the influence of misspecified marginals on inference for the copula parameters by using a pseudo likelihood of the ranks to define the cut model. We establish that if only one of the modules is misspecified, then the appropriate cut posterior gives accurate uncertainty quantification asymptotically for the parameters in the other module. Computation of the cut posteriors is difficult, and new variational inference methods to do so are proposed. The efficacy of the new methodology is demonstrated using both simulated data and a substantive multivariate time series application from macroeconomic forecasting. In the latter, cutting feedback from misspecified marginals to a 1096 dimension copula improves posterior inference and predictive accuracy greatly, compared to conventional Bayesian inference.</description>

      <title>X-Vine Models for Multivariate Extremes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15205v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Regular vine sequences permit the organisation of variables in a random vector along a sequence of trees. Regular vine models have become greatly popular in dependence modelling as a way to combine arbitrary bivariate copulas into higher-dimensional ones, offering flexibility, parsimony, and tractability. In this project, we use regular vine structures to decompose and construct the exponent measure density of a multivariate extreme value distribution, or, equivalently, the tail copula density. Although these densities pose theoretical challenges due to their infinite mass, their homogeneity property offers simplifications. The theory sheds new light on existing parametric families and facilitates the construction of new ones, called X-vines. Computations proceed via recursive formulas in terms of bivariate model components. We develop simulation algorithms for X-vine multivariate Pareto distributions as well as methods for parameter estimation and model selection on the basis of threshold exceedances. The methods are illustrated by Monte Carlo experiments and a case study on US flight delay data.</description>

      <title>Sample Complexity of Offline Distributionally Robust Linear Markov Decision Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12946v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In offline reinforcement learning (RL), the absence of active exploration calls for attention on the model robustness to tackle the sim-to-real gap, where the discrepancy between the simulated and deployed environments can significantly undermine the performance of the learned policy. To endow the learned policy with robustness in a sample-efficient manner in the presence of high-dimensional state-action space, this paper considers the sample complexity of distributionally robust linear Markov decision processes (MDPs) with an uncertainty set characterized by the total variation distance using offline data. We develop a pessimistic model-based algorithm and establish its sample complexity bound under minimal data coverage assumptions, which outperforms prior art by at least $\widetilde{O}(d)$, where $d$ is the feature dimension. We further improve the performance guarantee of the proposed algorithm by incorporating a carefully-designed variance estimator.</description>

      <title>Functional knockoffs selection with applications to functional data analysis in high dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The knockoffs is a recently proposed powerful framework that effectively controls the false discovery rate (FDR) for variable selection. However, none of the existing knockoff solutions are directly suited to handle multivariate or high-dimensional functional data, which has become increasingly prevalent in various scientific applications. In this paper, we propose a novel functional model-X knockoffs selection framework tailored to sparse high-dimensional functional models, and show that our proposal can achieve the effective FDR control for any sample size. Furthermore, we illustrate the proposed functional model-X knockoffs selection procedure along with the associated theoretical guarantees for both FDR control and asymptotic power using examples of commonly adopted functional linear additive regression models and the functional graphical model. In the construction of functional knockoffs, we integrate essential components including the correlation operator matrix, the Karhunen-Lo\`eve expansion, and semidefinite programming, and develop executable algorithms. We demonstrate the superiority of our proposed methods over the competitors through both extensive simulations and the analysis of two brain imaging datasets.</description>
