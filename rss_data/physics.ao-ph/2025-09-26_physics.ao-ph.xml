      <title>An Analytical and AI-discovered Stable, Accurate, and Generalizable Subgrid-scale Closure for Geophysical Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By combining AI and fluid physics, we discover a closed-form closure for 2D turbulence from small direct numerical simulation (DNS) data. Large-eddy simulation (LES) with this closure is accurate and stable, reproducing DNS statistics including those of extremes. We also show that the new closure could be derived from a 4th-order truncated Taylor expansion. Prior analytical and AI-based work only found the 2nd-order expansion, which led to unstable LES. The additional terms emerge only when inter-scale energy transfer is considered alongside standard reconstruction criterion in the sparse-equation discovery.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of High-Resolution Gridded Precipitation Datasets Against a Dense Rain Gauge Network During the Indian Summer Monsoon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancements in remote sensing have led to development of several satellite-derived precipitation products; however, their accuracy must be evaluated before use in scientific and operational studies. This study comprehensively assesses six widely used datasets PERSIANN CCS, CHIRPS, MSWEP, IMERG, AgERA5, and GSMaP ISRO against a dense rain gauge network across Karnataka, a southern Indian state characterized by diverse climatic conditions and complex topography. The analysis focuses on the Indian summer monsoon season for 2011 to 2022. To complement traditional metrics, tools from complex network theory were applied to investigate spatial organization and connectivity patterns of rainfall. A functional climate network approach was used to construct rainfall correlation networks, while event synchronization, a nonlinear measure, quantified the co occurrence of extreme events. Most products reproduced large scale monsoon features, yet their ability to represent intensity categories and extremes varied. GSMaP ISRO showed the highest correlation, lowest bias, and RMSE across subregions, whereas PERSIANN CCS exhibited systematic errors, particularly in Western Ghats, though correlations improved over interior plains. Network-based analysis reaffirmed GSMaP ISROs skill in replicating spatial correlation structures, capturing high coherence in regions dominated by large-scale processes and lower coherence in areas influenced by localized dynamics. The observed rainfall network revealed strong synchronization between the coastal region and central Karnataka, indicating broad spatial co occurrence of extremes, while the Malnad region showed weaker connectivity, suggesting localized events. GSMaP ISRO closely reproduced this degree distribution, reflecting corrections using IMD gridded dataset. Future work should improve sub-daily and localized rainfall estimates, especially in complex terrain.</description>

      <title>Air Quality and Greenhouse Gas Emissions Assessment of Data Centers in Texas: Quantifying Impacts and Environmental Tradeoffs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study assesses air quality (AQ) and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the rapid expansion of data centers in Texas, a major hub due to infrastructure, electricity markets, and business conditions. AQ impacts were separated from GHG emissions to clarify sources, regulations, and mitigation strategies. Electricity consumption and cooling systems dominate GHG emissions, with a 10 megawatt data center generating about 37,668 metric tons CO2 annually, while construction materials and IT equipment add substantial embodied emissions. Local AQ impacts, often overlooked, arise from diesel backup generators, construction equipment, and commuting. Generator testing alone can emit about 12 metric tons of NOx annually per facility, worsening ozone issues in regions such as Houston and Dallas-Fort Worth. Mitigation strategies include advanced cooling, renewable energy procurement, cleaner backup power (fuel cells, batteries), sustainable construction, and standardized reporting. ERCOT forecasts project 39 to 78 gigawatts of new data center load by 2030, potentially leading to 170 to 205 million metric tons of annual CO2 emissions. Aggressive adoption of renewables and advanced technologies could cut emissions by 50 to 80 percent, avoiding 85 to 165 million metric tons of CO2. The study identifies research and policy gaps, including the need for cumulative air dispersion modeling, AQ-specific regulations, and mandatory efficiency standards. Findings underscore the importance of aligning Texas digital infrastructure growth with environmental and community health protections.</description>

      <title>mloz: A Highly Efficient Machine Learning-Based Ozone Parameterization for Climate Sensitivity Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atmospheric ozone is a crucial absorber of solar radiation and an important greenhouse gas. However, most climate models participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) still lack an interactive representation of ozone due to the high computational costs of atmospheric chemistry schemes. Here, we introduce a machine learning parameterization (mloz) to interactively model daily ozone variability and trends across the troposphere and stratosphere in standard climate sensitivity simulations, including two-way interactions of ozone with the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation. We demonstrate its high fidelity on decadal timescales and its flexible use online across two different climate models -- the UK Earth System Model (UKESM) and the German ICOsahedral Nonhydrostatic (ICON) model. With atmospheric temperature profile information as the only input, mloz produces stable ozone predictions around 31 times faster than the chemistry scheme in UKESM, contributing less than 4 percent of the respective total climate model runtimes. In particular, we also demonstrate its transferability to different climate models without chemistry schemes by transferring the parameterization from UKESM to ICON. This highlights the potential for widespread adoption in CMIP-level climate models that lack interactive chemistry for future climate change assessments, particularly when focusing on climate sensitivity simulations, where ozone trends and variability are known to significantly modulate atmospheric feedback processes.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Altitude Control of a Tethered Multirotor Autogyro under Varying Wind Speeds using Differential Rotor Braking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A tethered multirotor autogyro can function as an unmanned aerial vehicle for energy-efficient and prolonged deployment, as it uses the available wind energy to sustain flight. This article presents an adaptive altitude control strategy for such a device. At a constant wind speed, the equilibrium altitude can be approximated by a quadratic function of the pitch angle. The proposed adaptive control estimates the coefficients of this quadratic function. The estimates are used for altitude control and to attain the maximum altitude (and minimum horizontal drift) for a given wind speed. A feedback controller based on regenerative differential rotor braking is used as the actuation to modulate the autogyro's pitch angle. Implementation of the controller using a control-oriented, higher-order dynamic model demonstrates the controller's capability to regulate the altitude and maintain stable flights under varying wind speeds. Based on the system's maximum altitude tracking performance, the adaptive control is adjusted to improve performance under substantial changes in wind speeds.</description>

      <title>Vacuum Ultraviolet Photoabsorption Spectra of Icy Isoprene and its Oligomers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Isoprene and its oligomers, terpenes, are expected to be present, along with other complex organic molecules, in the diverse environments of the ISM and in our solar system. Due to insufficient spectral information of these molecules at low temperature, the detection and understanding of the importance of these molecules has been rather incomplete. For this purpose, we have carried out the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) photoabsorption measurements on pure molecular ices of isoprene and a few simple terpenes: limonene, $\alpha$-pinene and $\beta$-pinene by forming icy mantles on cold dust analogs. From these experiments, we report the first low-temperature (10 K) VUV spectra of isoprene and its oligomers, limonene, $\alpha$-pinene, and $\beta$-pinene. VUV photoabsorption spectra of all the molecules reported here reveal similarities in the ice and gas phase, as expected, except for isoprene, where a prominent red shift is observed in the ice phase absorption. This unique property of isoprene, along with distinctive absorption at longer wavelengths, supports its candidature for detection on icy bodies.</description>

      <title>Data-driven modeling of wind farm wake flow based on multi-scale feature recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate, efficient prediction of wind flow with wake effects is crucial for wind-farm layout and power forecasting. Existing approaches-physical measurements, numerical simulations, physics-based models, and data-driven models-face trade-offs: the first two are time- and resource-intensive; physics-based models can lack accuracy due to limited physics; data-driven methods leverage abundant, high-quality data and are increasingly popular. We propose a rapid, data-driven wake-flow model inspired by video-frame interpolation and the principle of similarity. Field data are transformed into images; multi-scale feature recognition then identifies, matches, and interpolates wake structures using Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to generate intermediate flow fields. Six representative mini wind-farm cases validate the approach, spanning variations in turbine spacing, turbine size, combined spacing-size variations, different turbine counts, and wind-direction misalignment. Across cases, the method achieves a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 0.68-2.28%. Because it flexibly computes both 2D and 3D wake fields, the method offers substantial computational-efficiency gains over large-eddy simulation (LES) and Meteodyn WT when 2D accuracy suffices for industrial needs. Accordingly, it provides a practical alternative to measurements, high-fidelity simulations, and simplified physics-based models, enabling efficient expansion of wake-flow databases for wind-farm design and power prediction while balancing speed and accuracy.</description>

      <title>S$^2$Transformer: Scalable Structured Transformers for Global Station Weather Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19648v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Global Station Weather Forecasting (GSWF) is a key meteorological research area, critical to energy, aviation, and agriculture. Existing time series forecasting methods often ignore or unidirectionally model spatial correlation when conducting large-scale global station forecasting. This contradicts the intrinsic nature underlying observations of the global weather system, limiting forecast performance. To address this, we propose a novel Spatial Structured Attention Block in this paper. It partitions the spatial graph into a set of subgraphs and instantiates Intra-subgraph Attention to learn local spatial correlation within each subgraph, and aggregates nodes into subgraph representations for message passing among the subgraphs via Inter-subgraph Attention -- considering both spatial proximity and global correlation. Building on this block, we develop a multiscale spatiotemporal forecasting model S$^2$Transformer by progressively expanding subgraph scales. The resulting model is both scalable and able to produce structured spatial correlation, and meanwhile, it is easy to implement. The experimental results show that it can achieve performance improvements up to 16.8% over time series forecasting baselines at low running costs.</description>
