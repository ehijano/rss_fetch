      <title>The evolution of the $M_{\mathrm{d}}-M_{\star}$ and $\dot M-M_{\star}$ correlations traces protoplanetary disc dispersal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: (Abridged) Observational surveys of entire star-forming regions have provided evidence of power-law correlations between the disc properties and the stellar mass, especially the disc mass (${M_d \propto M_*}^{\lambda_m}$) and the accretion rate ($\dot M \propto {M_*}^{\lambda_{acc}}$). Whether the secular disc evolution affects said correlations is still debated: while the purely viscous scenario has been probed, other mechanisms could impact differently. We study the evolution of the slopes $\lambda_m$ and $\lambda_{acc}$ in the wind-driven and hybrid case and compare it to the viscous prediction, using a combination of analytical calculations and numerical simulations (performed with the 1D population synthesis code Diskpop, that we also present and release). Assuming $M_d(0) \propto {M_*}^{\lambda_{m, 0}}$ and $\dot M(0) \propto {M_*}^{\lambda_{acc, 0}}$ as initial conditions, we find that viscous and hybrid accretion preserve the shape of the correlations and evolve their slope; on the other hand, MHD winds change the shape of the correlations, bending them according to the scaling of the accretion timescale with the stellar mass. We also show how a spread in the initial conditions conceals this behaviour. We then analyse the impact of disc dispersal, and find that the currently available sample sizes ($\sim 30$ discs at 5 Myr) introduce stochastic oscillations in the slopes evolution, which dominate over the physical signatures. Increasing the sample size could mitigate this issue: $\sim 140$ discs at 5 Myr, corresponding to the complete Upper Sco sample, would give small enough error bars to use the evolution of the slopes as a proxy for the driving mechanism of disc evolution. Finally, we discuss how the observational claim of steepening slopes necessarily leads to an initially steeper $M_d - M_*$ correlation with respect to $\dot M - M_*$.</description>

      <title>Clouds on partial atmospheres of lava planets and where to find them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With dayside temperatures hot enough to sustain a magma ocean and a silicate atmosphere, lava planets are the best targets to study the atmosphere of a rocky world. In the absence of nightside heating, the entire atmosphere collapses near the day-night terminator, so condensation seems inevitable, but the impact of clouds on radiative transfer, dynamics, and observables has not yet been studied in the non-global atmospheric regime. Therefore, we simulate cloud formation and determine which lava planets should be most affected by clouds. We find that despite the scattering of visible light by clouds, heat advection compensates for the cooling effect of clouds in the atmosphere. On the other hand, surface temperatures are significantly affected and can drop 100-200 K under a cloudy sky. We find that among our targets, HD213885b and HD20329b are most affected by cloud formation: there is a discernable difference between having clouds and not having them, but the precision required to make such an inference is at the limit of current instruments.</description>

      <title>Candidate Distant Trans-Neptunian Objects Detected by the New Horizons Subaru TNO Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the detection of 239 trans-Neptunian Objects discovered through the on-going New Horizons survey for distant minor bodies being performed with the Hyper Suprime-Cam mosaic imager on the Subaru Telescope. These objects were discovered in images acquired with either the r2 or the recently commissioned EB-gri filter using shift and stack routines. Due to the extremely high stellar density of the search region down stream of the spacecraft, new machine learning techniques had to be developed to manage the extremely high false positive rate of bogus candidates produced from the shift and stack routines. We report discoveries as faint as r2$\sim26.5$. We highlight an overabundance of objects found at heliocentric distances $R\gtrsim70$~au compared to expectations from modelling of the known outer Solar System. If confirmed, these objects betray the presence of a heretofore unrecognized abundance of distant objects that can help explain a number of other observations that otherwise remain at odds with the known Kuiper Belt, including detections of serendipitous stellar occultations, and recent results from the Student Dust Counter on-board the New Horizons spacecraft.</description>

      <title>An Earth-sized Planet on the Verge of Tidal Disruption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: TOI-6255~b (GJ 4256) is an Earth-sized planet (1.079$\pm0.065$ $R_\oplus$) with an orbital period of only 5.7 hours. With the newly commissioned Keck Planet Finder (KPF) and CARMENES spectrographs, we determined the planet's mass to be 1.44$\pm$0.14 $M_{\oplus}$. The planet is just outside the Roche limit, with $P_{\rm orb}/P_{\rm Roche}$ = 1.13 $\pm0.10$. The strong tidal force likely deforms the planet into a triaxial ellipsoid with a long axis that is $\sim$10\% longer than the short axis. Assuming a reduced stellar tidal quality factor $Q_\star^\prime \approx10^7$, we predict that tidal orbital decay will cause TOI-6255 to reach the Roche limit in roughly 400 Myr. Such tidal disruptions may produce the possible signatures of planet engulfment that have been on stars with anomalously high refractory elemental abundances compared to its conatal binary companion. TOI-6255 b is also a favorable target for searching for star-planet magnetic interactions, which might cause interior melting and hasten orbital decay. TOI-6255 b is a top target (Emission Spectroscopy Metric of about 24) for phase curve observations with the James Webb Space Telescope.</description>

      <title>The Trojan-like Colors of Low-Perihelion Kuiper Belt Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An important testable prediction of dynamical instability models for the early evolution of the Solar System is that Jupiter Trojans share a source population with the Kuiper belt. Concrete evidence of this prediction remains elusive, as Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) and Jupiter Trojans appear to have different surface compositions. We address the long-standing question of Trojan origin by finding a dynamical sub-population in the Kuiper belt with Trojan-like colors. Combining existing photometric data with our own surveys on Keck I and Palomar P200, we find that the low-perihelion ($q&lt;30 $AU, $a&gt;30 $AU) component of the Kuiper belt has colors that bifurcate similarly to the Jupiter Trojans, unlike Centaurs ($a&lt;30 $AU) which have redder, Kuiper belt-like colors. To connect the Jupiter Trojans to the Kuiper belt, we test whether the distinct Trojan-like colors of low-perihelion KBOs result from surface processing, or are sourced from a specific population in the Kuiper belt. By simulating the evolution of the Canada-France Ecliptic Plane Survey synthetic population of KBOs for four billion years, we find that differences in heating timescales cannot result in a significant depletion of Very Red low-perihelion KBOs as compared to the Centaurs. We find that the neutrally-colored scattered disk objects ($e&gt;0.6$ KBOs) contribute more to the low-perihelion KBO population rather than Centaurs, resulting in their different colors.</description>

      <title>Obliquity Constraints for the Extremely Eccentric Sub-Saturn Kepler-1656 b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The orbits of close-in exoplanets provide clues to their formation and evolutionary history. Many close-in exoplanets likely formed far out in their protoplanetary disks and migrated to their current orbits, perhaps via high-eccentricity migration (HEM), a process that can also excite obliquities. A handful of known exoplanets are perhaps caught in the act of HEM, as they are observed on highly eccentric orbits with tidal circularization timescales shorter than their ages. One such exoplanet is Kepler-1656 b, which is also the only known non-giant exoplanet (&lt;100 $M_\oplus$) with an extreme eccentricity (e=0.84). We measured the sky-projected obliquity of Kepler-1656 b by observing the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect during a transit with the Keck Planet Finder. Our data are consistent with an aligned orbit, but are also consistent with moderate misalignment with $\lambda &lt; 50$ deg at 95% confidence, with the most likely solution of $35^{+14.9}_{-21.6}$ deg. A low obliquity would be an unlikely outcome of most eccentricity-exciting scenarios, but we show that the properties of the outer companion in the system are consistent with the coplanar HEM mechanism. Alternatively, if the system is not relatively coplanar (&lt;20 deg mutual inclination), Kepler-1656 b may be presently at a rare snapshot of long-lived eccentricity oscillations that do not induce migration. Kepler-1656 b is only the fourth exoplanet with e&gt;0.8 to have its obliquity constrained; expanding this population will help establish the degree to which orbital misalignment accompanies migration. Future work that constrains the mutual inclinations of outer perturbers will be key for distinguishing plausible mechanisms.</description>

      <title>KPF Confirms a Polar Orbit for KELT-18 b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first spectroscopic transit results from the newly commissioned Keck Planet Finder on the Keck-I telescope at W. M. Keck Observatory. We observed a transit of KELT-18 b, an inflated ultra-hot Jupiter orbiting a hot star ($T_\text{eff} = 6670$ K) with a binary stellar companion. By modeling the perturbation to the measured cross correlation functions using the Reloaded Rossiter-McLaughlin technique, we derived a sky projected obliquity of $\lambda = -94.8 \pm 0.7$ deg ($\psi = 93.8_{-1.8}^{+1.6}$ deg for isotropic $i_\star$). The data are consistent with an extreme stellar differential rotation ($\alpha = 0.9$), though a more likely explanation is moderate center-to-limb variations of the emergent stellar spectrum. We see additional evidence for the latter from line widths increasing towards the limb. Using loose constraints on the stellar rotation period from observed variability in the available TESS photometry, we were able to constrain the stellar inclination and thus the true 3D stellar obliquity to $\psi = 91.7_{-1.8}^{+2.2}$ deg. KELT-18 b could have obtained its polar orbit through high-eccentricity migration initiated by Kozai-Lidov oscillations induced by the binary stellar companion KELT-18 B, as the two likely have a large mutual inclination as evidenced by Gaia astrometry. KELT-18 b adds another data point to the growing population of close-in polar planets, particularly around hot stars.</description>

      <title>The OATMEAL Survey. I. Low Stellar Obliquity in the Transiting Brown Dwarf System GPX-1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the OATMEAL survey, an effort to measure the obliquities of stars with transiting brown dwarf companions. We observed a transit of the close-in ($P_{\rm orb} = 1.74 \,$ days) brown dwarf GPX-1 b using the Keck Planet Finder (KPF) spectrograph to measure the sky-projected angle between its orbital axis and the spin axis of its early F-type host star ($\lambda$). We measured $\lambda = 6.88 \pm 1.72 ^\circ$ (with additional unquantified systematic uncertainty), suggesting an orbit that is prograde and well aligned with the stellar equator. Hot Jupiters around early F stars are frequently found to have highly misaligned orbits, with polar and retrograde orbits being commonplace. It has been theorized that these misalignments stem from dynamical interactions, such as von Zeipel-Kozai-Lidov cycles, and are retained over long timescales due to weak tidal dissipation in stars with radiative envelopes. By comparing GPX-1 to similar systems under the frameworks of different tidal evolution theories, we argued that the rate of tidal dissipation is too slow to have re-aligned the system. This suggests that GPX-1 may have arrived at its close-in orbit via coplanar high-eccentricity migration or migration through an aligned protoplanetary disk. Our result for GPX-1 is the fifth measurement of the obliquity of a star with a transiting brown dwarf. By enlarging the number of such measurements and comparing them with hot Jupiter systems, we will more clearly discern the differences between the mechanisms that dictate the formation and evolution of both classes of objects.</description>

      <title>SPECtrophotometer for TRansmission spectroscopy of exoplanets (SPECTR)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The SPECtrophotometer for TRansmission spectroscopy of exoplanets (SPECTR) is a new low-resolution optical (3800 {\AA} - 6850 {\AA}) spectrophotometer installed at the Bohyunsan Optical Astronomy Observatory (BOAO) 1.8 m telescope. SPECTR is designed for observing the transmission spectra of transiting exoplanets. Unique features of SPECTR are its long slit length of 10 arcminutes which facilitates observing the target and the comparison star simultaneously, and its wide slit width to minimize slit losses. SPECTR will be used to survey exoplanets, such as those identified by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), providing information about their radii across the wavelength range. In this paper, we present the design of SPECTR and the observational results of the partial transit of HD 189733 b and a full transit of Qatar-8 b. Analyses show the SPECTR's capability on the white light curves with an accuracy of one ppt. The transmission spectrum of HD 189733 b shows general agreement with previous studies.</description>

      <title>Spin-orbit coupling of the primary body in a binary asteroid system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-orbit coupling is widespread in binary asteroid systems and it has been widely studied for the case of ellipsoidal secondary. Due to angular momentum exchange, dynamical coupling is stronger when the orbital and rotational angular momenta are closer in magnitudes. Thus, the spin-orbit coupling effects are significantly different for ellipsoidal secondaries and primaries. In the present work, a high-order Hamiltonian model in terms of eccentricity is formulated to study the effects of spin-orbit coupling for the case of ellipsoidal primary body in a binary asteroid system. Our results show that the spin-orbit coupling problem for the ellipsoidal primary holds two kinds of spin equilibrium, while there is only one for the ellipsoidal secondary. In particular, 1:1 and 2:3 spin-orbit resonances are further studied by taking both the classical pendulum approximation as well as adiabatic approximation (Wisdom's perturbative treatment). It shows that there is a critical value of total angular momentum, around which the pendulum approximation fails to work. Dynamical structures are totally different when the total angular momentum is on two sides of the critical value.</description>

      <title>Observational Signatures of Circumbinary Discs II: Kinematic Signatures in Velocity Residuals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kinematic studies of protoplanetary discs are a valuable method for uncovering hidden companions. In the first paper of this series, we presented five morphological and kinematic criteria that aid in asserting the binary nature of a protoplanetary disc. In this work we study the kinematic signatures of circumbinary discs in the residuals of their velocity maps. We show that Doppler-flips, spiral arms, eccentric gas motion, fast flows inside of the cavity, and vortex-like kinematic signatures are commonly observed. Unlike in the planetary mass companion case, Doppler-flips in circumbinary discs are not necessarily centred on a companion, and can extend towards the cavity edge. We then compare the kinematic signatures in our simulations with observations and see similarities to the Doppler-flip signal in HD 100546 and the vortex-like kinematic signatures in HD 142527. Our analysis also reveals kinematic evidence for binarity in several protoplantary disks typically regarded as circumstellar rather than circumbinary, including AB Aurigae and HD 100546.</description>

Abstract: Characterizing outer companions to hot Jupiters plays a crucial role in deciphering their origins. We present the discovery of a long-period giant planet, HD 118203 c ($m_{c}=11.9^{+0.69}_{-0.63}\ \mathrm{M_{J}}$, $a_{c}=5.36^{+0.09}_{-0.10}$ AU, $e_{c}=0.26^{+0.03}_{-0.02}$) exterior to previously known close-in eccentric hot Jupiter HD 118203 b ($P_{b}=6.135\ \mathrm{days}$, $m_{b}=2.14\pm{0.12}\ \mathrm{M_{J}}$, $r_{b}=1.14\pm{0.029}\ \mathrm{R_{J}}$, $e_{b}=0.31\pm{0.007}$) based on twenty-year radial velocity observations. Using Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) observations from the Keck Planet Finder (KPF), we measured a low sky-projected obliquity $\lambda_{b}=-11^{\circ}.7^{+7.6}_{-10}$ for HD 118203 b and detected stellar oscillations in the host star, confirming its evolved status. Combining the RM observation with the stellar inclination measurement, we constrained the true obliquity of HD 118203 b as $\Psi_{b}&lt;33^{\circ}.5\ (2\sigma)$, indicating the orbit normal of the hot Jupiter nearly aligned with the stellar spin axis. Furthermore, by combining radial velocities and Hipparcos-Gaia astrometric acceleration, we constrained the line-of-sight mutual inclination between the hot Jupiter and the outer planet to be $9^{\circ}.8^{+16.2}_{-9.3}$ at $2\sigma$ level. HD 118203 is the first hot Jupiter system where both the true obliquity of the hot Jupiter and the mutual inclination between inner and outer planets have been determined. Our results are consistent with a system-wide alignment, with low mutual inclinations between the outer giant planet, the inner hot Jupiter, and the host star. This alignment, along with the moderate eccentricity of HD 118203 c, implies that the system may have undergone coplanar high-eccentricity tidal migration. Under this framework, our dynamical analysis suggests an initial semi-major axis of 0.3 to 3.2 AU for the proto-hot Jupiter.</description>

      <title>The Bulk Densities of Small Solar System Bodies as a Probe of Planetesimal Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constraining the formation processes of small solar system bodies is crucial for gaining insights into planetesimal formation. Their bulk densities, determined by their compressive strengths, offer valuable information about their formation history. In this paper, we utilize a formulation of the compressive strength of dust aggregates obtained from dust $N$-body simulations to establish the relation between bulk density and diameter. We find that this relation can be effectively approximated by a polytrope with an index of 0.5, coupled with a formulation of the compressive strength of dust aggregates. The lowest-density trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) and main-belt asteroids (MBAs) are well reproduced by dust aggregates composed of 0.1-$\mathrm{\mu}$m-sized grains. However, most TNOs, MBAs, comets, and near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) exhibit higher densities, suggesting the influence of compaction mechanisms such as collision, dust grain disruption, sintering, or melting, leading to further growth. We speculate that there are two potential formation paths for small solar system bodies: one involves the direct coagulation of primordial dust grains, resulting in the formation of first-generation planetesimals, including the lowest-density TNOs, MBAs, and parent bodies of comets and NEAs. In this case, comets and NEAs are fragments or rubble piles of first-generation planetesimals, and objects themselves or rubbles are composed of 0.1-$\mathrm{\mu}$m-sized grains. The other path involves further potential fragmentation of first-generation planetesimals into compact dust aggregates observed in protoplanetary disks, resulting in the formation of second-generation planetesimals composed of compact dust aggregates, which may contribute to explaining another formation process of comets and NEAs.</description>

      <title>Detection of Dimethyl Ether in the Central Region of the MWC 480 Protoplanetary Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterizing the chemistry of complex organic molecules (COMs) at the epoch of planet formation provides insights into the chemical evolution of the interstellar medium (ISM) and the origin of organic materials in our Solar System. We report a detection of dimethyl ether (CH$_3$OCH$_3$) in the disk around the Herbig Ae star MWC 480 with the sensitive Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations. This is the first detection of CH$_3$OCH$_3$ in a non-transitional Class II disk. The spatially unresolved, compact (${\lesssim}$25 au in radius) nature, the broad line width ($\sim$30 km s$^{-1}$), and the high excitation temperature (${\sim}$200 K) indicate sublimation of COMs in the warm inner disk. Despite the detection of CH$_3$OCH$_3$, methanol (CH$_3$OH), the most abundant COM in the ISM, has not been detected, from which we constrain the column density ratio of CH$_3$OCH$_3$/CH$_3$OH ${\gtrsim}$7. This high ratio may indicate the reprocessing of COMs during the disk phase, as well as the effect of the physical structure in the inner disk. We also find that this ratio is higher than in COM-rich transition disks recently discovered. This may indicate that, in the full disk of MWC 480, COMs have experienced substantial chemical reprocessing in the innermost region, while the COM emission in the transition disks predominantly traces the inherited ice sublimating at the dust cavity edge located at larger radii (${\gtrsim}$20 au).</description>

      <title>Schumann Resonances as a tool to constrain the depth of Titan's buried water ocean: Re-assessment of Huygens observations and preparation of the EFIELD/Dragonfly experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among the lines of evidence for a buried ocean on Titan is the possible detection, in 2005, by the Permittivity, Wave and Altimetry (PWA) analyzer on board the ESA Huygens probe of Schumann-like Resonances (SR). SR are Extremely Low Frequency electromagnetic waves resonating between two electrically conductive layers. On Titan, it has been proposed that they propagate between the moon's ionosphere and a salty subsurface water ocean. Their characterization by electric field sensors can provide constraints on Titan's cavity characteristics and in particular on the depth of Titan's ocean which is key to better assess Titan's habitability. For this work we have developed a numerical model of Titan's electromagnetic cavity as well as a surrogate model to conduct simulations and sensitivity analyses at a low computational cost. This surrogate model is used both to re-assess PWA/Huygens measurements and to predict the future performance of the EFIELD experiment on board the NASA Dragonfly mission. We demonstrate that the PWA/Huygens measurements, in particular due to their low spectral resolution, do not bring any meaningful constraint on Titan's ocean depth. On the other hand, the finer resolution of the EFIELD experiment and its ability to capture several harmonics of SR should provide more robust constraints on Titan's internal structure, especially if the electrical properties of the ice crust and the atmosphere can be better constrained.</description>

      <title>The effect of dynamical interactions in stellar birth environments on the orbits of young close-in planetary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stars do not form in isolation but together with other stars, and often in a clustered environment. Depending on the initial conditions in these environments, such as initial density and substructure, the distances of encounters between stars will differ. These encounters can also affect just-formed exoplanetary systems. Using N-body simulations, we show the effect of a single fly-by on a common type of exoplanetary system: close-in Super-Earths/sub-Neptunes with or without a distant Giant planet. Even a single encounter can significantly modify the architecture of these exoplanetary systems over their long lifetimes. We test fly-bys with different characteristics, such as distance and mass, and show how they perturb the inner planets long after the encounter, leading to collisions and mutual inclination excitation, which can significantly modify the observed architecture of these systems in transit. We find that our initially four-planet inner systems reduce to three or two inner planets depending on their initial separation and that the mutual inclinations of these remaining planets can be high enough to reduce the number of observable, transiting planets. In our 500 Myr simulations, we show that this reduction in the number of transiting planets due to stellar fly-bys can contribute to the observed excess of single-transit systems.</description>

      <title>TESS Giants Transiting Giants. VI. Newly Discovered Hot Jupiters Provide Evidence for Efficient Obliquity Damping after the Main Sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The degree of alignment between a star's spin axis and the orbital plane of its planets (the stellar obliquity) is related to interesting and poorly understood processes that occur during planet formation and evolution. Hot Jupiters orbiting hot stars ($\gtrsim$6250 K) display a wide range of obliquities, while similar planets orbiting cool stars are preferentially aligned. Tidal dissipation is expected to be more rapid in stars with thick convective envelopes, potentially explaining this trend. Evolved stars provide an opportunity to test the damping hypothesis, particularly stars that were hot on the main sequence and have since cooled and developed deep convective envelopes. We present the first systematic study of the obliquities of hot Jupiters orbiting subgiants that recently developed convective envelopes using Rossiter-McLaughlin observations. Our sample includes two newly discovered systems in the Giants Transiting Giants Survey (TOI-6029 b, TOI-4379 b). We find that the orbits of hot Jupiters orbiting subgiants that have cooled below $\sim$6250 K are aligned or nearly aligned with the spin-axis of their host stars, indicating rapid tidal realignment after the emergence of a stellar convective envelope. We place an upper limit for the timescale of realignment for hot Jupiters orbiting subgiants at $\sim$500 Myr. Comparison with a simplified tidal evolution model shows that obliquity damping needs to be $\sim$4 orders of magnitude more efficient than orbital period decay to damp the obliquity without destroying the planet, which is consistent with recent predictions for tidal dissipation from inertial waves excited by hot Jupiters on misaligned orbits.</description>

      <title>GEO and LEO: The Final Frontier for Plutonic FFP Parallax</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I show that microlens parallaxes, $\pi_{\rm E}$, can be derived for free-floating planets (FFPs) with masses down to that of Pluto, by combining observations from a satellite in geosynchronous (GEO) orbit with another observatory that is on or near Earth's surface, i.e., either ground-based or in low Earth orbit (LEO). Because these low-mass FFPs typically have measurements of the angular Einstein radius, $\theta_{\rm E}$, from finite-source effects, such $\pi_{\rm E}$ measurements directly yield the FFP mass $M=\theta_{\rm E}/\kappa \pi_{\rm E}$ where $\kappa$ is a physical constant. Such Earth-GEO measurements almost perfectly complement Earth-L2 measurements, which extend to higher FFP mass and greater FFP distance. LEO-only observations can yield mass measurement at even smaller FFP mass and nearer FFP distances. I discuss methods for breaking the Refsdal (1966) two-fold degeneracy in $\pi_{{\rm E},\pm}$.</description>

      <title>The frequency of transiting planetary systems around polluted white dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the frequency of transiting planetary systems around metal-polluted white dwarfs using high-cadence photometry from ULTRACAM and ULTRASPEC on the ground, and space-based observations with TESS. Within a sample of 313 metal-polluted white dwarfs with available TESS light curves, two systems known to have irregular transits are blindly recovered by box-least-squares and Lomb-Scargle analyses, with no new detections, yielding a transit fraction of 0.8 (-0.4, +0.6) per cent. Planet detection sensitivities are determined using simulated transit injection and recovery for all light curves, producing upper limit occurrences over radii from dwarf to Kronian planets, with periods from 1 h to 27 d. The dearth of short-period, transiting planets orbiting polluted white dwarfs is consistent with engulfment during the giant phases of stellar evolution, and modestly constrains dynamical re-injection of planets to the shortest orbital periods. Based on simple predictions of transit probability, where (R + Rp)/a ~ 0.01, the findings here are nominally consistent with a model where 100 per cent of polluted white dwarfs have circumstellar debris near the Roche limit; however, the small sample size precludes statistical confidence in this result. Single transits are also ruled out in all light curves using a search for correlated outliers, providing weak constraints on the role of Oort-like comet clouds in white dwarf pollution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The SSPACE Astrobiology Payload (SAP) series, starting with the SAP-1 project is designed to conduct in-situ microbiology experiments in low earth orbit. This payload series aims to understand the behaviour of microbial organisms in space, particularly those critical for human health, and the corresponding effects due to microgravity and solar/galactic radiation. SAP-1 focuses on studying Bacillus clausii and Bacillus coagulans, bacteria beneficial to humans. It aims to provide a space laboratory for astrobiology experiments under microgravity conditions. The hardware developed for these experiments is indigenous and tailored to meet the unique requirements of autonomous microbiology experiments by controlling pressure, temperature, and nutrition flow to bacteria. A rotating platform, which forms the core design, is innovatively utilised to regulate the flow and mixing of nutrients with dormant bacteria. The technology demonstration models developed at SSPACE have yielded promising results, with ongoing efforts to refine, adapt for space conditions, and prepare for integration with nanosatellites or space modules. The anticipated payload will be compact, approximately 1U in size (10cm x 10cm x 10cm), consume less than 5W power, and offer flexibility for various microbiological studies.</description>

      <title>Asteroseismology of the Nearby K-Dwarf $\sigma$ Draconis using the Keck Planet Finder and TESS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Asteroseismology of dwarf stars cooler than the Sun is very challenging due to the low amplitudes and rapid timescales of oscillations. Here, we present the asteroseismic detection of solar-like oscillations at 4-minute timescales ($\nu_{\mathrm{max}}\sim4300\mu$Hz) in the nearby K-dwarf $\sigma$ Draconis using extreme precision Doppler velocity observations from the Keck Planet Finder and 20-second cadence photometry from NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite. The star is the coolest dwarf star to date with both velocity and luminosity observations of solar-like oscillations, having amplitudes of $5.9\pm0.8\,$cm$\,\text{s}^{-1}$ and $0.8\pm0.2$ ppm, respectively. These measured values are in excellent agreement with established luminosity-velocity amplitude relations for oscillations and provide further evidence that mode amplitudes for stars with $T_{\mathrm{eff}}&lt;\,5500\,$K diminish in scale following a $(L/M)^{1.5}$ relation. By modeling the star's oscillation frequencies from photometric data, we measure an asteroseismic age of $4.5\pm0.9\,\rm{(ran)} \pm 1.0\,\rm{(sys)}$ Gyr. The observations demonstrate the capability of next-generation spectrographs and precise space-based photometry to extend observational asteroseismology to nearby cool dwarfs, which are benchmarks for stellar astrophysics and prime targets for directly imaging planets using future space-based telescopes.</description>

      <title>FCN4Flare: Fully Convolution Neural Networks for Flare Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar flares originate from the sudden reconnection of magnetic flux lines within the star's atmosphere, particularly in the chromosphere. Automated flare detection enables exploiting vast photometric datasets from missions like Kepler. Prior methods rely on outlier detection, facing challenges of complexity, detection accuracy, and scalability. This paper presents FCN4Flare, a deep learning approach using fully convolutional networks for precise point-to-point flare prediction regardless of light curve length. Key innovations include the NaN Mask to handle missing data, dilated convolutions to preserve local information, and the MaskDice loss to mitigate severe class imbalance. Experiments demonstrate significantly improved detection performance over previous models, with a 0.64 Dice coefficient on Kepler data. Applying FCN4Flare to Kepler and LAMOST, we compile a catalog of 30,285 high-confidence flares across 1426 stars. Flare energies are estimated and stellar/exoplanet properties analyzed, identifying pronounced activity for an M-dwarf hosting a habitable zone planet. This work overcomes limitations of prior flare detection methods via deep learning, enabling new scientific discoveries through analysis of photometric time-series data.</description>

      <title>Non-radial oscillations mimicking a brown dwarf orbiting the cluster giant NGC 4349 No. 127</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several evolved stars have been found to exhibit long-period radial velocity variations that cannot be explained by planetary or brown dwarf companions. Non-radial oscillations caused by oscillatory convective modes have been put forth as an alternative explanation, but no modeling attempt has yet been undertaken. We provide a model of a non-radial oscillation, aiming to explain the observed variations of the cluster giant NGC 4349 No. 127. The star was previously reported to host a brown dwarf companion, but whose existence was later refuted in the literature. We reanalyzed 58 archival HARPS spectra, acquiring additional activity indicators using the SERVAL and RACCOON pipelines. We searched for periodicity in the indicators and correlations between the indicators and radial velocities. We further present a simulation code able to produce synthetic HARPS spectra, incorporating the effect of non-radial oscillations, and compare the simulated results to the observed variations. We find a positive correlation between chromatic index and radial velocity, along with closed-loop Lissajous-like correlations between radial velocity and each of the spectral line shape indicators (full width at half maximum, and contrast of the cross-correlation function and differential line width). Simulations of a low-amplitude, retrograde, dipole (l = 1, m = 1), non-radial oscillation can reproduce the observed behavior and explain the observables. Photometric variations below the detection threshold of the available ASAS-3 photometry are predicted. The oscillation and stellar parameters are largely in agreement with the prediction of oscillatory convective modes. The periodic variations of the radial velocities and activity indicators, along with the respective phase shifts, measured for the intermediate-mass cluster giant NGC 4349 No. 127, can be explained by a non-radial oscillation.</description>

Abstract: The search for atmospheric biosignatures in Earth-like exoplanets is one of the most pressing challenges in observational astrobiology. Detecting biogenic gases in terrestrial planets requires high resolution and long integration times. In this work, we developed and tested a machine-learning general methodology, intended to classify transmission spectra with low Signal-to-Noise Ratio according to their potential to contain biosignatures. For that purpose, we trained a set of models capable of classifying noisy transmission spectra, as having methane, ozone, and/or water (multilabel classification), or simply as being interesting for follow-up observations (binary classification). The models were trained with $\sim\, 10^6$ synthetic spectra of planets similar to TRAPPIST-1 e, which were generated with the package MultiREx, especially developed for this work. The trained algorithms correctly classified test planets with transmission spectra having SNR $&lt;$ 6 and containing methane and/or ozone at mixing ratios similar to those of modern and Proterozoic Earth. Tests on realistic synthetic spectra based on the current Earth\'s atmosphere show at least one of our models would classify as likely having biosignatures and using only one transit, most of the inhabited terrestrial planets observed with the JWST/NIRSpec PRISM around M-dwarfs located at distances similar or smaller than that of TRAPPIST-1 e. The implication of this result for the designing of observing programs and future surveys is enormous since machine-assisted strategies similar to those presented here could significantly optimize the usage of JWST resources for biosignature searching, while maximizing the chances of a real discovery after dedicated follow-up observations of promising candidates.</description>

      <title>Martian time-series unraveled: A multi-scale nested approach with factorial variational autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16189</link>

Abstract: Unsupervised source separation involves unraveling an unknown set of source signals recorded through a mixing operator, with limited prior knowledge about the sources, and only access to a dataset of signal mixtures. This problem is inherently ill-posed and is further challenged by the variety of timescales exhibited by sources in time series data from planetary space missions. As such, a systematic multi-scale unsupervised approach is needed to identify and separate sources at different timescales. Existing methods typically rely on a preselected window size that determines their operating timescale, limiting their capacity to handle multi-scale sources. To address this issue, we propose an unsupervised multi-scale clustering and source separation framework by leveraging wavelet scattering spectra that provide a low-dimensional representation of stochastic processes, capable of distinguishing between different non-Gaussian stochastic processes. Nested within this representation space, we develop a factorial variational autoencoder that is trained to probabilistically cluster sources at different timescales. To perform source separation, we use samples from clusters at multiple timescales obtained via the factorial variational autoencoder as prior information and formulate an optimization problem in the wavelet scattering spectra representation space. When applied to the entire seismic dataset recorded during the NASA InSight mission on Mars, containing sources varying greatly in timescale, our approach disentangles such different sources, e.g., minute-long transient one-sided pulses (known as "glitches") and structured ambient noises resulting from atmospheric activities that typically last for tens of minutes, and provides an opportunity to conduct further investigations into the isolated sources.</description>

      <title>Analysis and Predictive Modeling of Solar Coronal Holes Using Computer Vision and ARIMA-LSTM Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09802v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the era of space exploration, coronal holes on the sun play a significant role due to their impact on satellites and aircraft through their open magnetic fields and increased solar wind emissions. This study employs computer vision techniques to detect coronal hole regions and estimate their sizes using imagery from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). Additionally, we utilize hybrid time series prediction model, specifically combination of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and ARIMA, to analyze trends in the area of coronal holes and predict their areas across various solar regions over a span of seven days. By examining time series data, we aim to identify patterns in coronal hole behavior and understand their potential effects on space weather.</description>
