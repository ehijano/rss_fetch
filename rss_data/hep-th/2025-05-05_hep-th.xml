      <title>Quantum correlation engineering and the causal structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starting with the assumption that propagation of classical light determines the causal structure of spacetime and the assumption that the causal structure may be emergent from quantum correlations I show a method through which the causal structure can be engineered by the manipulation of carefully chosen ancillas that allow the manipulation of properties of classical light by means of a quantum entanglement structure obtained using an ancilla purification of classical light. The application of Uhlmann gauge and the creation of a dynamical Uhlmann gauge theory enables us to access the quantum informational structure that determines the classical propagation speed of light in vacuum, and hence gives us a dictionary that allows us to modify the quantum entanglement structure that determines the causal structure. As such, a modification of the causal structure is obtained from purely quantum informational principles, without the need for any "exotic" matter or other impossible types, geometries, or distributions of matter inside a relativistic stress energy tensor. In fact, it is shown that the quantum information tools necessary to produce measurable modifications of the causal structure are experimentally accessible today in a quantum optics or quantum sensors lab.</description>

      <title>What is a photon in de Sitter spacetime?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The states of a single photon in four-dimensional de Sitter (dS) spacetime form a Unitary Irreducible Representation (UIR) of SO(1,4), which we call the photon UIR. While in flat spacetime photons are intimately tied to gauge symmetry, we demonstrate that in de Sitter, photon states emerge generically in any quantum field theory, even without an underlying U(1) gauge field. We derive a K\"all\'en-Lehmann representation for antisymmetric tensor two-point functions and show that numerous composite operators constructed from massive free fields can create states in the photon UIR. Remarkably, we find that some of these operators exhibit two-point functions with slower late-time and large-distance decay than the electromagnetic field strength itself, challenging the conventional notion that photons dominate the infrared regime. Using our spectral representation, we establish non-perturbative bounds on the late-time behavior of electric and magnetic fields in de Sitter, with potential implications for primordial magnetogenesis. Through one-loop calculations, we demonstrate that both the creation of photon states and the enhanced late-time large-distance behavior persist in weakly interacting theories.</description>

      <title>Soft Oscillons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel type of soliton dubbed soft oscillons. In contrast with conventional oscillons the soft counterparts come in a continuum of unboundedly large sizes. They are peculiar also in that the oscillation frequency is set by their size and in their high harmonic content, that leads to a peculiar core structure and pulsating emission of radiation. Soft oscillons appear in a broad class of scalar field theories with plateau potentials and owe their existence to a simple confinement mechanism: a large field perturbation automatically acts as a cavity that traps massless modes. We study the classical evaporation rate, lifetime and stability under anisotropic deformations. Soft oscillons are longer lived in gapless models, where lifetimes can reach 100 times the initial radius or more.</description>

      <title>Exploring String Theory Solutions: Black hole thermodynamics with $\alpha'$ corrections and type II compactifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This PhD thesis explores the properties of certain solutions in stringy effective field theories (EFTs). In the context of heterotic string theory (HST), we study $\alpha'$ corrections to well-known black hole solutions. We present explicit, analytical expressions for the $\alpha'$ corrections to these solutions and fully characterize their thermodynamics refining Iyer-Wald's prescription. In the context of type II theories, we study compactifications of the form $X_4 \times X_6$. We begin with AdS$_4$ Calabi-Yau orientifold compactifications with localized sources and investigate their non-perturbative stability. We then consider internal manifolds with non-trivial integer (co)homology and demonstrate how integer homology data can leak into the EFT.</description>

      <title>Hexagonal Wilson loop with Lagrangian insertion at two loops in $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we compute the two-loop result of the null hexagonal Wilson loop with a Lagrangian insertion in planar, maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory via a bootstrap approach. Normalized by the null polygonal Wilson loop itself, the integrand-level result of this observable corresponds to the logarithm of the six-point three-loop amplitude in this theory, while its integrated result is conjectured to match the maximal transcendental part of the six-point three-loop all-plus amplitude in pure Yang-Mills theory. Our work builds on two recent advances. On the one hand, the set of leading singularities relevant to this observable was recently classified. On the other hand, the relevant space of special functions that may in principle accompany these leading singularities was determined at two loops and for six particles by a dedicated Feynman integral calculation. These two ingredients serve as the foundation of our bootstrap ansatz. We fix all indeterminates in this ansatz by imposing physical constraints, such as symmetries, absence of spurious divergences, and correct behavior in soft and collinear limits. Finally, we discuss and verify certain physical properties of our symbol result, including physical singularities, behavior under multi-Regge limit, as well as Steinmann relations between symbol entries. The latter relations are motivated by the correspondence to all-plus amplitudes in pure Yang-Mills theory, and successfully checking them constitutes a consistency check of this conjectured correspondence.</description>

      <title>Perturbative LVS and Inflation: A Review of Volume Modulus and Fibre Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In type IIB superstring compactifications, incorporating log-loop corrections and higher-derivative ${(\alpha^\prime)}^3$-corrections can stabilize the overall volume of the compact internal space at exponentially large values. This mechanism forms the basis of the perturbative Large Volume Scenario (LVS). In this report, we briefly review two inflationary models realized within the perturbative LVS framework. The first one is the volume modulus inflation (also known as inflection point inflation) and the second one is popularly known as fibre inflation. Using an explict Calabi-Yau orientifold, some concrete global embeddings of both models are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Exact islands scenario for CFT systems and critical ratios in higher geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study $CFT_d$ systems which are in contact with each other and symmetrically arranged. The system-B is treated as bath that surrounds system-A in the middle. Our focus is to learn how the entanglement entropy of a bath pair system changes as a function of its size. The total size of systems A and B taken together is kept fixed in this process. It is found that for strip shaped systems the bath entropy becomes maximum when respective system sizes follow Fibonacci type critical ratio condition. Beyond critical point when bath size increases the bath entropy starts decreasing, where
  island and icebergs entropies play important role. Interestingly entire effect of icebergs can be resummed giving rise to 'exact island' scenario for $CFT_d$ with $d&gt;2$. Post criticality we also find important identity involving entropy differences $S[B]-S[A]=S_l-S_{island}$ where island contribution is exact. The mutual information of far separated bath pair follows specific law $I(B:B) \propto {b^2\over (Distance)^d}$. It never vanishes for finite systems. Once system-A size approaches to Kaluza-Klein scale the bath entropy becomes discretized. In summary knowing island corrections is vital for large bath entanglement entropy.</description>

      <title>$\eta$ regularisation and the functional measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit Fujikawa's path integral formulation of the chiral anomaly and develop a generalised framework for systematically defining a regularised functional measure. This construction extends the $\eta$ regularisation scheme to operator language, making the connection between spectral asymmetry and measure transformation fully explicit. Before recovering Fujikawa's expression for the chiral anomaly from the regularised measure, we explore the deeper number-theoretic structure underlying the ill-defined spectral sum associated with the anomaly, interpreting it through the lens of smoothed asymptotics. Our approach unifies two complementary perspectives: the analytic regularisation of Fujikawa and the topological characterisation given by the Atiyah-Singer index theorem. We further investigate how the measure transforms under changes to the regularisation scale and derive a function $\iota_E(\Lambda)$ that encodes this dependence, showing how its Mellin moments govern the appearance of divergences. Finally, we comment on the conceptual relationship between the regularised measure, $\eta$ regularisation, and the generalised Schwinger proper-time formalism, with a particular focus on the two-dimensional Schwinger model.</description>

      <title>Holographic Conformal Anomaly and a-Theorem in 5D Scalar-Tensor Theories from Heterotic Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel derivation of the full holographic conformal anomaly in two five-dimensional scalar-tensor theories-one Lovelock-Horndeski type and one Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet-obtained via a unified mechanism for Kaluza-Klein reduction of the ten-dimensional heterotic string effective action. In the Lovelock-Horndeski case, we also construct exact asymptotically AdS solutions with linear dilaton profiles and establish a holographic a-theorem. Our results confirm the consistency of AdS/CFT in the presence of non-minimal scalar couplings and higher curvature terms, and show how string-theoretic modifications control the emergence of conformal anomalies and constrain the RG structure of dual field theories.</description>

      <title>Weyl symmetry in $(D_4,D_4)$ conformal matter on a circle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Weyl symmetry in quadrivalently glued 5-brane webs of rank $N$ $(D_4,D_4)$ conformal matter theories on a circle. We find that these theories all have affine $E_8$ Weyl symmetry in their brane webs, which indicates that they all have affine $E_8$ global symmetry. When $N\geq 2$, the theory has 64 different sets of affine $E_8$ invariant Coulomb branch parameters.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Maximization and Mirror Symmetry in Two-Higgs-Doublet Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider 2-to-2 scatterings of Higgs bosons in a CP-conserving two-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM) and study the implication of maximizing the entanglement in the flavor space, where the two doublets $\Phi_a$, $a=1,2$, can be viewed as a qubit: $\Phi_1=|0\rangle$ and $\Phi_2=|1\rangle$. More specifically, we compute the scattering amplitudes for $\Phi_a \Phi_b \to \Phi_c \Phi_d$ and require the outgoing flavor entanglement to be maximal for a full product basis such as the computational basis, which consists of $\{|00\rangle,|01\rangle,|10\rangle,|11\rangle\}$. In the unbroken phase and turning off the gauge interactions, entanglement maximization results in the appearance of an $U(2)\times U(2)$ global symmetry among the quartic couplings, which in general is broken softly by the mass terms. Interestingly, once the Higgs bosons acquire vacuum expectation values, maximal entanglement enforces an exact $U(2) \times U(2)$ symmetry, which is spontaneously broken to $U(1)\times U(1)$. As a byproduct, this gives rise to Higgs alignment as well as to the existence of 6 massless Nambu-Goldstone bosons. The $U(2)\times U(2)$ symmetry can be gauged to lift the massless Goldstones, while maintaining maximal entanglement demands the presence of a discrete $\mathrm{Z}_2$ symmetry interchanging the two gauge sectors. The model is custodially invariant in the scalar sector, and the inclusion of fermions requires a mirror dark sector, related to the standard one by the $\mathrm{Z}_2$ symmetry.</description>

      <title>No-hair theorems in General Relativity and scalar-tensor theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present review, we consider the status of the classification of the vacuum, stationary and asymptotically flat black holes in scalar-tensor gravity. Contrary to the similar problem in general relativity, the black hole classification in scalar-tensor theories is much more challenging due to the very complicated character of the field equations and the very complex mathematical structure of the scalar-tensor gravity as a whole. We review most of the known no-hair results, and where possible new ones, as well demonstrate some of the difficulties that appear in our attempts to classify the black holes within scalar-tensor gravity. The proofs of the theorems and the underlying mathematical techniques are given in sufficient detail. To make the review self-contained we also present the vacuum black hole uniqueness theorems in general relativity and their proofs.</description>

      <title>On homomorphisms from finite subgroups of $SU(2)$ to Langlands dual pairs of groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $N(\Gamma,G)$ be the number of homomorphisms from $\Gamma$ to $G$ up to conjugation by $G$. Physics of four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric gauge theories predicts that $N(\Gamma,G)=N(\Gamma , \tilde G)$ when $\Gamma$ is a finite subgroup of $SU(2)$, $G$ is a connected compact simple Lie group and $\tilde G$ is its Langlands dual. This statement is known to be true when $\Gamma=\mathbb{Z}_n$, but the statement for non-Abelian $\Gamma$ is new, to the knowledge of the authors. To lend credence to this conjecture, we prove this equality in a couple of examples, namely $(G,\tilde G)=(SU(n),PU(n))$ and $(Sp(n),SO(2n+1))$ for arbitrary $\Gamma$, and $(PSp(n),Spin(2n+1))$ for exceptional $\Gamma$. A more refined version of the conjecture, together with proofs of some concrete cases, will also be presented. The authors would like to ask mathematicians to provide a more uniform proof applicable to all cases.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Analysis of Pre-geometric Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Einstein-Cartan theory of gravity can arise from a mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking within the context of pre-geometric gauge theories. In this work, we develop the Hamiltonian analysis of such theories. By making contact with the ADM formalism, we show that all the results of canonical General Relativity are correctly recovered in the IR limit of the spontaneously broken phase. We then apply Dirac's algorithm to study the algebra of constraints and determine the number of degrees of freedom in the UV limit of the unbroken phase. We also discuss possible pathways toward a UV completion of General Relativity, including a pre-geometric generalisation of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation and an extended BF formulation of the pre-geometric theory.</description>

      <title>Innermost stable circular orbit of arbitrary-mass compact binaries at fourth post-Newtonian order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute by means of post-Newtonian (PN) methods the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) of arbitrary-mass (in particular, comparable-mass) compact binaries. Two methods are used with equivalent results: dynamical perturbation of the conservative equations of motion in harmonic coordinates, and dynamical perturbation of the conservative Hamiltonian in ADM coordinates. The perturbation of the non-local tail term at 4PN order in both approaches is carefully investigated. Our final gauge invariant result for the location of the ISCO at 4PN order is close to the numerical value of the ISCO shift computed by the gravitational self-force (GSF) approach in the small mass-ratio limit, and is also in good agreement with the full numerical-relativity calculation in the case of equal masses. The PN method followed here is considered in standard Taylor-expanded form, without any resummation techniques applied. As a complement, we also compute explicitly the gauge transformation from harmonic coordinates to ADM coordinates up to 4PN order, including the tail contribution therein.</description>

Abstract: The gravitational wave signal of binary compact objects has two main contributions at frequencies below the characteristic merger frequency: the gravitational wave signal associated with the early inspiral stage of the binary and the non-linear gravitational wave memory. We compare the sensitivity of upcoming gravitational wave detectors to these two contributions, with a particular interest in events with a merger phase at frequencies higher than the detector's peak sensitivity. We demonstrate that for light primordial black holes, current and upcoming detectors are more sensitive to the inspiral signal. Our analysis incorporates the evolution history of primordial black hole binaries, key to accurately estimating the relevant event rates. We also discuss the waveform templates of the memory signal at ground- and space-based interferometers, and the implications for a matched filtering search. This allows us to compare the sensitivity of high-frequency gravitational wave detectors, sensitive to the merger phase, with the sensitivity of existing interferometers.</description>

      <title>Spin Precession in magnetized Kerr spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an exact analytical investigation of spin precession for a test gyroscope in the magnetized Kerr spacetime--an exact electrovacuum solution to the Einstein-Maxwell equations. Our approach accommodates arbitrary magnetic field strengths, enabling a unified treatment across both weak and ultra-strong field regimes. The analysis reveals distinct spin precession behaviors near rotating collapsed objects, which differ characteristically between black holes and naked singularities, offering a potential observational means to differentiate them. The external magnetic field induces a nontrivial modification of the precession frequency through its interaction with the spacetime's gravitoelectromagnetic structure. In the weak-field limit, magnetic fields generally reduce the precession rate, though the effect depends sensitively on the motion and orientation of the test gyro close to the collapsed object. As a special case, we show that in the presence of magnetic fields, the spin precession frequency due to gravitomagnetic effect acquires a long-range $1/r$ (where $r$ is the distance from the central object to the test gyro) correction in contrast to the standard $1/r^3$ falloff. In addition, we obtain the exact geodetic precession (gravitoelectric effect) frequency in magnetized Schwarzschild spacetime, showing that the magnetic field enhances ($\propto r^{1/2}$) geodetic precession in contrast to the standard $1/r^{5/2}$ falloff. Our results provide observationally testable predictions relevant for black holes in strong magnetic environments, including those possibly realized near magnetars or in the early universe. In particular, the strong-field behavior of spin precession could have important implications for transmuted black holes formed via collapse or mergers of magnetized progenitors in both astrophysical and cosmological contexts.</description>

      <title>Identifying regions for asymptotic expansions of amplitudes: fundamentals and recent advances</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This review paper discusses the identification of regions, a crucial first step in applying the "method-of-regions" technique. A systematic approach based on Newton polytope geometry has proven successful and efficient for many cases. However, obtaining the correct list of regions becomes increasingly subtle with higher loop numbers or specific Feynman graph topologies. This paper explores the scenarios where such subtleties arise, outlines general strategies to address them, and reviews the current understanding of region structures in various asymptotic expansions of Feynman integrals.</description>

Abstract: Recently, a plethora of multivariable knot polynomials were introduced by Kashaev and one of the authors, by applying the Reshetikhin-Turaev functor to rigid $R$-matrices that come for braided Hopf algebras with automorphisms. We study the extension of these knot invariants to links, and use this to identify some of them with known link invariants, as conjectured in that same recent work.</description>

      <title>Neutrino mass generation in asymptotically safe gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There exist several distinct phenomenological models to generate neutrino masses. We explore, which of these models can consistently be embedded in a quantum theory of gravity and matter. We proceed by invoking a minimal number of degrees of freedom beyond the Standard Model. Thus, we first investigate whether the Weinberg operator, a dimension-five-operator that generates neutrino masses without requiring degrees of freedom beyond the Standard Model, can arise in asymptotically safe quantum gravity. We find a negative answer with far-reaching consequences: new degrees of freedom beyond gravity and the Standard Model are necessary to give neutrinos a mass in the asymptotic-safety paradigm. Second, we explore whether the type-I Seesaw mechanism is viable and discover an upper bound on the Seesaw scale. The bound depends on the mass of the visible neutrino. We find a numerical value of $10^{14}\, \rm GeV$ for this bound when neglecting neutrino mixing for a visible mass of $10^{-10}\, \rm GeV$. Conversely, for the most ``natural" value of the Seesaw scale in a quantum-gravity setting, which is the Planck scale, we predict an upper bound for the neutrino mass of the visible neutrino of approximately $10^{-15}\, \rm GeV$. Third, we explore whether neutrinos could also be Pseudo-Dirac-neutrinos in asymptotic safety and find that this possibility can be accommodated.</description>

      <title>The Club Sandwich: Gapless Phases and Phase Transitions with Non-Invertible Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17322v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a generalization of the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) framework to characterize phase transitions and gapless phases with categorical symmetries. The central tool is the club sandwich, which extends the SymTFT setup to include an interface between two topological orders: there is a symmetry boundary, which is gapped, and a physical boundary that may be gapless, but in addition, there is also a gapped interface in the middle. The club sandwich generalizes so-called Kennedy-Tasaki (KT) transformations. Building on the results in [1, 2] on gapped phases with categorical symmetries, we construct gapless theories describing phase transitions with non-invertible symmetries by applying suitable KT transformations on known phase transitions provided by the critical Ising model and the 3-state Potts model. We also describe in detail the order parameters in these gapless theories characterizing the phase transitions, which are generally mixtures of conventional and string-type order parameters mixed together by the action of categorical symmetries. Additionally, removing the physical boundary from the club sandwiches results in club quiches, which characterize all possible gapped boundary phases with (possibly non-invertible) symmetries that can arise on the boundary of a bulk gapped phase. We also provide a mathematical characterization of gapped boundary phases with symmetries as pivotal tensor functors whose targets are pivotal multi-fusion categories.</description>

Abstract: We construct an explicit realization of the action of the $Lw_{1+\infty}$ loop algebra on fields at null infinity. This action is directly derived by Penrose transform of the geometrical action of $Lw_{1+\infty}$ symmetries in twistor space, ensuring that it forms a representation of the algebra. Finally, we show that this action coincides with the canonical action of $Lw_{1+\infty}$ Noether charges on the asymptotic phase space.</description>

      <title>Density of States, Black Holes and the Emergent String Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study universal features of the density of one-particle states $\rho(E)$ in weakly coupled theories of gravity at energies above the quantum gravity cutoff $\Lambda$, defined as the scale suppressing higher-derivative corrections to the Einstein--Hilbert action. Using thermodynamic properties of black holes, we show that in asymptotically flat spacetimes, certain features of $\rho(E)$ above the black hole threshold $M_{\rm min}$ are an indicator for the existence of large extra dimensions, and cannot be reproduced by any lower-dimensional field theory with finitely many fields satisfying the weak energy condition. Based on the properties of gravitational scattering amplitudes, we argue that there needs to exist a (possibly higher-dimensional) effective description of gravity valid up to the cutoff $\Lambda$. Combining this with thermodynamic arguments we demonstrate that $\rho(E)$ has to grow exponentially for energies $\Lambda \ll E \ll M_{\rm min}$. Furthermore we show that the tension of any weakly coupled $p$-brane with $p\geq 1$ is bounded from below by $\Lambda^{p+1}$. We use this to argue that any tower of weakly coupled states with mass below $\Lambda$ has to be a Kaluza--Klein (KK) tower. Altogether these results indicate that in gravitational weak-coupling limits the lightest tower of states is either a KK tower, or has an exponentially growing degeneracy thereby resembling a string tower. This provides evidence for the Emergent String Conjecture without explicitly relying on string theory or supersymmetry.</description>

      <title>What is the Curvature of 2D Euclidean Quantum Gravity?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18120v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We re-examine the nonperturbative curvature properties of two-dimensional Euclidean quantum gravity, obtained as the scaling limit of a path integral over dynamical triangulations of a two-sphere, which lies in the same universality class as Liouville quantum gravity. The diffeomorphism-invariant observable that allows us to compare the averaged curvature of highly quantum-fluctuating geometries with that of classical spaces is the so-called curvature profile. A Monte Carlo analysis on three geometric ensembles, which are physically equivalent but differ by the inclusion of local degeneracies, leads to new insights on the influence of finite-size effects. After eliminating them, we find strong evidence that the curvature profile of 2D Euclidean quantum gravity is best matched by that of a classical round four-sphere, rather than the five-sphere found in previous work. Our analysis suggests the existence of a well-defined quantum Ricci curvature in the scaling limit.</description>

Abstract: Carroll hydrodynamics arises in the $c\to 0$ limit of relativistic hydrodynamics. Instances of its relevance include the Bjorken and Gubser flow models of heavy-ion collisions, where the ultrarelativistic nature of the flow makes the physics effectively Carrollian. In this paper, we explore the structure of hydrodynamics in what can be termed as the Carrollian regime, where instead of keeping only the leading terms in the $c\to 0$ limit of relativistic hydrodynamics, we perform a small-$c$ expansion and retain the subleading terms as well. We do so both for perfect fluids as well as viscous fluids incorporating first order derivative corrections. As apposite applications of the formalism, we utilize the subleading terms to compute modifications to the Bjorken and Gubser flow equations which bring in, in particular, dependence on rapidity.</description>

Abstract: We describe the self-duality symmetries for 4d Maxwell theory at any value of the coupling $\tau$ via topological manipulations that include gauging continuous symmetries with flat connections. Moreover, we demonstrate that the $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ duality of Maxwell can be realized by trivial gauging operations. Using a non-compact symmetry topological field theory (symTFT) to encode continuous global symmetries of the boundary theory, we reproduce the symTFT for Maxwell and find within this framework condensation defects that implement the non-invertible $SO(2)$ self-duality symmetry. These defects are systematically constructed by higher gauging subsets of the bulk $\mathbb{R}\times \mathbb{R}$ symmetry with appropriate discrete torsion.</description>

Abstract: We investigate integrability properties of Gukov-Witten 1/2-BPS surface defects in $SU(N)$ $\mathcal{N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills (SYM) theory in the large-$N$ limit. We demonstrate that ordinary Gukov-Witten defects, which depend on a set of continuous parameters, are not integrable except for special sub-sectors. In contrast to these, we show that rigid Gukov-Witten defects, which depend on a discrete parameter but not on continuous ones, appear integrable in a corner of the discrete parameter space. Whenever we find an integrable sector, we derive a closed-form factorised expression for the leading-order one-point function of unprotected operators built out of the adjoint scalars of $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM theory. Our results raise the possibility of finding an all-loop formula for one-point functions of unprotected operators in the presence of a rigid Gukov-Witten defect at the corner in parameter space.</description>

Abstract: By leveraging the limits on primordial magnetic fields (PMFs), their contributions to secondary gravitational waves (GWs), and the recent observations by the pulsar timing arrays (PTAs), we arrive at constraints on the epoch of reheating. We find that the combined spectral energy density of primary and secondary (generated by the PMFs) GWs can be described as a broken power law with different indices. We show that PMFs with blue spectra and appropriate reheating scenarios can successfully explain the PTA observations without invoking any new physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15037v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the gravitational perturbations of black holes in quadratic gravity, in which the Einstein-Hilbert term is supplemented by quadratic terms in the curvature tensor. In this class of theories, the Schwarzschild solution can coexist with modified black hole solutions, and both families are radially stable in a wide region of the parameter space. Here we study non-radial perturbations of both families of static, spherically symmetric black holes, computing the quasi-normal modes with axial parity and finding strong numerical evidence for the stability of these solutions under axial perturbations. The perturbation equations describe the propagation of a massless and a massive spin-two fields. We show that the Schwarzschild solution admits the same quasi-normal modes as in general relativity, together with new classes of modes corresponding to the massive spin-two degrees of freedom. The spectrum of the modified black hole solution has the same structure, but all modes are different from those of general relativity. We argue that both classes of modes can be excited in physical processes, suggesting that a characteristic signature of this theory is the presence of massive spin-two modes in the gravitational ringdown, even when the stationary solution is the same as in general relativity.</description>

      <title>Hierarchies from deterministic non-locality in theory space Anderson localisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05137v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nearest-neighbour or local mass terms in theory space among quantum fields, with their generic disordered values, are known to lead to the localisation of mass eigenstates, analogous to Anderson localisation in a one-dimensional lattice. This mechanism can be used to create an exponential hierarchy in the coupling between two fields by placing them at opposite ends of the lattice chain. Extending this mechanism, we show that when copies of such fields are appropriately attached to the lattice chain, it leads to the emergence of multiple massless modes. These vanishing masses are a direct consequence of the locality of interactions in theory space. The latter may break down in an ordered and deterministic manner through quantum effects if additional interactions exist among the chain fields. Such non-locality can induce small masses for the otherwise massless modes without necessarily delocalising the mass eigenstates. We provide examples of interactions that preserve or even enhance localisation. Applications to flavour hierarchies, neutrino mass, and the $\mu$-problem in supersymmetric theories are discussed.</description>

      <title>Shadows aspect of rotating black holes in the Einstein-AdS SU(N)-nonlinear sigma model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02179</link>

Abstract: Recent observations of the supermassive black holes M87* and Sgr A* by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) have opened new avenues for testing gravity theories through black hole shadow observables. These observations offer a means to distinguish between general relativity and modified gravity theories while providing insights into the astrophysical properties of the observed black holes. In this work, we investigate photon orbits and shadow characteristics of rotating black holes within the Einstein-$\mathrm{SU}(N)$ nonlinear sigma model. We first analyze the static, spherically symmetric black hole solution, focusing on its asymptotically Anti-de Sitter behavior and causal structure. The Modified Newman-Janis Algorithm is then applied to obtain the rotating counterpart, followed by an examination of its geometric properties, ergoregions, and causal structure. Utilizing the Lagrangian formalism, we derive the equations of motion for photons and study the resulting black hole shadow on the celestial plane. We explore the dependence of the shadow's size and shape on the black hole parameters $K$ and $N$, imposing constraints using EHT observational data for M87* and Sgr A*. Finally, we analyze the black hole's evaporation rate under different scenarios.</description>

      <title>Quantum Electrodynamics from Quantum Cellular Automata, and the Tension Between Symmetry, Locality and Positive Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05998v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that free QED is equivalent to the continuous-space-and-time limit of Fermi and Bose lattice quantum cellular automata theories derived from quantum random walks satisfying simple symmetry and unitarity conditions. In doing so we define the Fermi and Bose theories in a unified manner using the usual fermion internal space but a boson internal space that is six-dimensional. We show that the reduction to a two-dimensional boson internal space (two helicity states arising from spin-1 plus the photon transversality condition) comes from restricting the quantum cellular automaton theory to positive energies. We briefly examine common symmetries of quantum cellular automata, and how time-reversal symmetry demands the existence of negative-energy solutions. These solutions produce a tension in coupling the Fermi and Bose theories, in which the strong locality of quantum cellular automata seems to require a nonzero amplitude to produce negative-energy states, leading to an unphysical cascade of negative-energy particles. However, we show in a 1D model that by extending interactions over a larger (but finite) range it is possible to exponentially suppress the production of negative-energy particles to the point where they can be neglected.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Scattering: Connections Across Theory and Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23556v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this document drafted by the Neutrino Scattering Theory Experiment Collaboration (NuSTEC), we provide input on the synergies between theoretical and experimental efforts that can provide critical input to the prediction accuracy needed for the forthcoming high-precision neutrino measurements. These efforts involve a wide range of energies and interaction processes, as well as target nuclei and interaction probes. The challenges discussed will be overcome only through the active support of integrated collaboration across strong and electroweak physics from both the nuclear and high energy physics communities.</description>

      <title>Quantum Galilei group as quantum reference frame transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum groups have been widely explored as a tool to encode possible nontrivial generalisations of reference frame transformations, relevant in quantum gravity. In quantum information, it was found that the reference frames can be associated to quantum particles, leading to quantum reference frames transformations. The connection between these two frameworks is still unexplored, but if clarified it will lead to a more profound understanding of symmetries in quantum mechanics and quantum gravity. Here, we establish a correspondence between quantum reference frame transformations and transformations generated by a quantum deformation of the Galilei group with commutative time, taken at first order in the quantum deformation parameter. This is found once the quantum group noncommutative transformation parameters are represented on the phase space of a quantum particle, and upon setting the quantum deformation parameter to be proportional to the inverse of the mass of the particle serving as the quantum reference frame. These results allow us to show that quantum reference frame transformations are physically relevant when the state of the quantum reference frame is in a quantum superposition of semiclassical states. We conjecture that the all-order quantum Galilei group describes quantum reference frame transformations between more general quantum states of the quantum reference frame.</description>

      <title>A Universal Equilibration Condition for Heavy Quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21139v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kinetic equilibration at late times is physically required for heavy particles in a finite temperature medium. In Fokker-Planck dynamics, it is ensured by the Einstein relation between the drag and longitudinal momentum diffusion coefficients. However, in certain gauge field theories, this relation is violated at any nonzero heavy quark velocity. Recent work in strongly coupled $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM gauge theory shows that the Kolmogorov equation for the heavy quark phase space distribution (that reduces to Fokker-Planck form upon truncating the momentum transfer probability distribution to second moments) does equilibrate even though the Fokker-Planck equation does not. Here, we generalize some of these (to date theory-specific) insights to any quantum field theory at any coupling strength. Starting from quantum field theory first principles, we derive a universal equilibration condition for the kernel of the Kolmogorov equation and, consequently, for the momentum transfer probability distribution. Remarkably, this condition reveals that the asymmetry between energy loss and energy gain in the momentum transfer probability distribution takes a simple, theory-independent, form.</description>
