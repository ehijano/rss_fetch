      <title>Negative curvature in locally reducible Artin groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we define the 2-complete Artin complex and show that it is systolic for locally reducible Artin groups. The stabilizers of simplices in this complex are exactly the proper parabolic subgroups which are "2-complete." We use this systolicity to show that parabolic subgroups, with 2-completions that are not the whole Artin group, are weakly malnormal. This allows us to conclude that many locally reducible Artin groups are acylindrically hyperbolic.</description>

      <title>Bi-Lipschitz rigidity of discrete subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain a bi-Lipschitz rigidity theorem for a Zariski dense discrete subgroup of a connected simple real algebraic group. As an application, we show that any Zariski dense discrete subgroup of a higher rank semisimple algebraic group $G$ cannot have a $C^1$-smooth antipodal limit set in $G/P$ for any non-maximal parabolic subgroup $P$.</description>

      <title>Growth in products of matrices: fastest, average, and generic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problems that we consider in this paper are as follows. Let A and B be 2x2 matrices (over reals). Let w(A, B) be a word of length n. After evaluating w(A, B) as a product of matrices, we get a 2x2 matrix, call it W. What is the largest (by the absolute value) possible entry of W, over all w(A, B) of length n, as a function of n? What is the expected absolute value of the largest (by the absolute value) entry in a random product of n matrices, where each matrix is A or B with probability 0.5? What is the Lyapunov exponent for a random matrix product like that? We give partial answer to the first of these questions and an essentially complete answer to the second question. For the third question (the most difficult of the three), we offer a very simple method to produce an upper bound on the Lyapunov exponent in the case where all entries of the matrices A and B are nonnegative.</description>

      <title>A computer-friendly construction of the monster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.10921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2002.10921v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{M}$ be the monster group which is the largest sporadic finite simple group, and has first been constructed in 1982 by Griess. In 1985, Conway has constructed a 196884-dimensional representation $\rho$ of $\mathbb{M}$ with matrix coefficients in $\mathbb{Z}[\frac{1}{2}]$. So these matrices may be reduced modulo any (not necessarily prime) odd number $p$, leading to representations of $\mathbb{M}$ in odd characteristic. The representation $\rho$ is based on representations of two maximal subgroups $G_{x0}$ and $N_0$ of $\mathbb{M}$. In ATLAS notation, $G_{x0}$ has structure $2_+^{1+24}.\mbox{Co}_1$ and $N_0$ has structure $2^{2+11+22}.( M_{24} \times S_3)$. Conway has constructed an explicit set of generators of $N_0$, but not of $G_{x0}$.
  This paper is essentially a rewrite of Conway's construction augmented by an explicit construction of an element of $G_{x0} \setminus N_0$. This gives us a complete set of generators of $\mathbb{M}$. It turns out that the matrices of all generators of $\mathbb{M}$ consist of monomial blocks, and of blocks which are essentially Hadamard matrices scaled by a negative power of two. Multiplication with such a generator can be programmed very efficiently if the modulus $p$ is of shape $2^k-1$.
  So this paper may be considered a as programmer's reference for Conway's construction of the monster group $\mathbb{M}$. We have implemented representations of $\mathbb{M}$ modulo 3, 7, 15, 31, 127, and 255.</description>

      <title>Rationality of representation zeta functions of compact $p$-adic analytic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.10694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2007.10694v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that for any FAb compact $p$-adic analytic group $G$, its representation zeta function is a finite sum of terms $n_{i}^{-s}f_{i}(p^{-s})$, where $n_{i}$ are natural numbers and $f_{i}(t)\in\mathbb{Q}(t)$ are rational functions. Meromorphic continuation and rationality of the abscissa of the zeta function follow as corollaries. If $G$ is moreover a pro-$p$ group, we prove that its representation zeta function is rational in $p^{-s}$. These results were proved by Jaikin-Zapirain for $p&gt;2$ or for $G$ uniform and pro-$2$, respectively. We give a new proof which avoids the Kirillov orbit method and works for all $p$.

      <title>Forest-skein groups II: construction from homogeneously presented monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.01993v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the reconstruction program of conformal field theories of Vaughan Jones we recently introduced a vast class of so called forest-skein groups. They are built from a skein presentation: a set of colours and a set of pairs of coloured trees. Each nice skein presentation produces four groups similar to Richard Thompson's group F,T,V and the braided version BV of Brin and Dehornoy.
  In this article, we consider forest-skein groups obtained from one-dimensional skein presentations; the data of a homogeneous monoid presentation. We decompose these groups as wreath products. This permits to classify them up to isomorphisms. Moreover, we prove that a number of properties of the fraction group of the monoid pass through the forest-skein groups such as the Haagerup property, homological and topological finiteness properties, and orderability.</description>

      <title>Rationality of twist representation zeta functions of compact $p$-adic analytic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.05825v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that for any twist rigid compact $p$-adic analytic group $G$, its twist representation zeta function is a finite sum of terms $n_{i}^{-s}f_{i}(p^{-s})$, where $n_{i}$ are natural numbers and $f_{i}(t)\in\mathbb{Q}(t)$ are rational functions. Meromorphic continuation and rationality of the abscissa of the zeta function follow as corollaries. If $G$ is moreover a pro-$p$ group, we prove that its twist representation zeta function is rational in $p^{-s}$. To establish these results we develop a Clifford theory for twist isoclasses of representations, including a new cohomological invariant of a twist isoclass.

      <title>Surjectivity of polynomial maps on Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.19731v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For $n\geq 2$, we consider the map on $M_n(\mathbb K)$ given by evaluation of a polynomial $f(X_1, \ldots, X_m)$ over the field $\mathbb K$. In this article, we explore the image of the diagonal map given by $f=\delta_1 X_1^{k_1} + \delta_2 X_2^{k_2} + \cdots +\delta_m X_m^{k_m}$ in terms of the solution of certain equations over $\mathbb K$. In particular, we show that for $m\geq 2$, the diagonal map is surjective when (a) $\mathbb K= \mathbb C$, (b) $\mathbb K= \mathbb F_q$ for large enough $q$. Moreover, when $\mathbb K= \mathbb R$ and $m=2$ it is surjective except when $n$ is odd, $k_1, k_2$ are both even, and $\delta _1\delta_2&gt;0$ (in that case the image misses negative scalars), and the map is surjective for $m\geq 3$. We further show that on $M_n(\mathbb H)$ the diagonal map is surjective for $m\geq 2$, where $\mathbb H$ is the algebra of Hamiltonian quaternions.</description>

      <title>Simple $p$-adic Lie groups with abelian Lie algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.04408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For each prime $p$ and each positive integer $d$, we construct the first examples of second countable, topologically simple, $p$-adic Lie groups of dimension $d$ whose Lie algebras are abelian. This answers several questions of Gl\"ockner and Caprace-Monod. The proof relies on a generalization of small cancellation methods that applies to central extensions of acylindrically hyperbolic groups.</description>

      <title>On subgroups with narrow Schreier graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study finitely generated pairs of groups $H \leq G$ such that the Schreier graph of $H$ has at least two ends and is \emph{narrow}. Examples of narrow Schreier graphs include those that are quasi-isometric to finitely ended trees or have linear growth. Under this hypothesis, we show that $H$ is a virtual fiber subgroup if and only if $G$ contains infinitely many double cosets of $H$. Along the way, we prove that if a group acts essentially on a finite dimensional CAT(0) cube complex with no facing triples then it virtually surjects onto the integers with kernel commensurable to a hyperplane stabiliser.</description>

Abstract: Fix $\varepsilon&gt;0$. We say that a finite group $G$ is $\varepsilon$-quasirandom if every nontrivial irreducible complex representation of $G$ has degree at least $|G|^\varepsilon$. In this paper, we give a structure theorem for large $\varepsilon$-quasirandom groups, and we completely classify the $\frac{1}{5}$-quasirandom groups.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Stable Processes on Amenable Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.04159v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that if $G$ is a countable amenable group, then every stationary non-Gaussian symmetric $\alpha$-stable (S$\alpha$S) process indexed by $G$ is ergodic if and only if it is weakly-mixing, and it is ergodic if and only if its Rosinski minimal spectral representation is null. This extends the results for $\mathbb{Z}^d$, and answers a question of P. Roy on discrete nilpotent groups to the extent of all countable amenable groups. As a result we construct on the Heisenberg group and on many Abelian groups, for all $\alpha$ in (0,2), stationary S$\alpha$S processes that are weakly-mixing but not strongly-mixing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.03196v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study growth of absolute and homological $k$-dimensional systoles of arithmetic $n$-manifolds along congruence coverings. Our main interest is in the growth of systoles of manifolds whose real rank $r &gt; 1$. We observe, in particular, that in some cases for $k = r$ the growth function tends to oscillate between a power of a logarithm and a power function of the degree of the covering. This is a new phenomenon. We also prove the expected polylogarithmic and constant power bounds for small and large $k$, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18140v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a locally compact group and $\mu$ an admissible probability measure on $G$. Let $(B,\nu)$ be the universal topological Poisson $\mu$-boundary of $(G,\mu)$ and $\Pi_s(G)$ the universal minimal strongly proximal $G$-flow. This note is inspired by a recent result of Hartman and Kalantar. We show that for a locally compact second countable group $G$ the following conditions are equivalent: (i) the measure $\nu$ is the unique $\mu$-stationary measure on $B$, (ii) $(B,G) \cong (\Pi_s(G),G)$.</description>
