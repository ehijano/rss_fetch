      <title>Theoretical Prediction of High-Temperature Superconductivity in SrAuH$_3$ at Ambient Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive computational investigation of electron-phonon interactions in MXH$_3$ hydride compounds, where $M$ represents alkali and post-transition metals, and $X$ denotes 3$d$, 4$d$, and 5$d$ transition metals. Our density functional theory calculations identify 17 dynamically stable compounds. Notably, SrAuH$_3$ and SrZnH$_3$ emerge as theoretical ambient-pressure superconductors with predicted critical temperatures ($T_c$) exceeding 100 K. Analysis of the electronic structure reveals that the $X$ component dominates the density of states at the Fermi level, playing a crucial role in determining electron-phonon coupling strength and superconducting properties. We elucidate the underlying mechanisms governing these properties through detailed examination of the electronic and vibrational spectra. Our findings may challenge the prevailing notion that high-$T_c$ superconductivity in hydrides requires extreme pressures, potentially paving the way for practical applications. This study also provides valuable insights to guide future experimental efforts in the synthesis of ambient-pressure hydride superconductors.</description>

      <title>Conformal approach to physics simulations for thin curved 3D membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensional nanoarchitectures are widely used across various areas of physics, including spintronics, photonics, and superconductivity. In this regard, thin curved 3D membranes are especially interesting for applications in nano- and optoelectronics, sensorics, and information processing, making physics simulations in complex 3D geometries indispensable for unveiling new physical phenomena and the development of devices. Here, we present a general-purpose approach to physics simulations for thin curved 3D membranes, that allows for performing simulations using finite difference methods instead of meshless methods or methods with irregular meshes. The approach utilizes a numerical conformal mapping of the initial surface to a flat domain and is based on the uniformization theorem stating that any simply-connected Riemann surface is conformally equivalent to an open unit disk, a complex plane, or a Riemann sphere. We reveal that for many physical problems involving the Laplace operator and divergence, a flat-domain formulation of the initial problem only requires a modification of the equations of motion and the boundary conditions by including a conformal factor and the mean/Gaussian curvatures. We demonstrate the method's capabilities for case studies of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation for a charged particle in static electric and magnetic fields for 3D geometries, including C-shaped and ring-shaped structures, as well as for the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation.</description>

      <title>Experimental discovery of Sarma state in atomically thick superconducting FeSe films under high magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many-body ground states of imbalanced Fermi gas have been studied both theoretically and experimentally for several decades because of their fundamental significance in condensed matter physics, cold atom physics and nuclear physics. The Sarma state, a gapless spin-polarized superfluid, is one of those long sought-after exotic ground states of spin imbalanced Fermi gas. Yet, an unambiguous experimental evidence of Sarma superfluid state has not been found. Here, we report the experimental discovery of the Sarma state in atomically thick FeSe films by a dilution-refrigerator scanning tunneling microscope under high magnetic fields. In the bilayer or trilayer FeSe films, we directly observe the key evidence of the entrance of the Sarma state: the inner Zeeman splitting coherence peaks cross the Fermi level under high in-plane magnetic fields. The angle dependent critical in-plane magnetic field of coherence peak crossing shows a two-fold symmetry due to the anisotropy of the in-plane g-factor of FeSe films. Moreover, in a superconducting FeSe monolayer of a lateral size of several hundred nanometers, the Sarma state can also be induced by strong out-of-plane magnetic fields. Our findings pave the way to explore the unusual physical properties and potential applications in superconducting spintronics of the spin-polarized Sarma superfluid state.</description>

      <title>Magnetic bound states embedded in tantalum superconducting thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the fabrication of superconducting devices, both in situ and ex situ processes are utilized, making the removal of unwanted oxide layers and impurities under vacuum conditions crucial. Oxygen descumming and argon milling are standard in situ cleaning methods employed for device preparation. We investigated the impact of these techniques on tantalum superconducting thin films using scanning tunneling microscopy at millikelvin temperatures. We demonstrate that these cleaning methods inadvertently introduce magnetic bound states within the superconducting gap of tantalum, likely by oxygen impurities. These bound states can be detrimental to superconducting qubit devices, as they add to dephasing and energy relaxation.</description>

      <title>Local structure and phonon states mediated by intercalation-driven doping in superconducting $Li_{1.0}(C_5H_5N)_yFe_{2-z}Se_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intercalation of two-dimensional (2D) iron chalcogenides with molecular species requires disentangling electronic and structural contributions to understand the puzzling limit to superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) at the frontier of long interlayer separations. Here, synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) at the Se K-edge sheds light on the impact of carrier-doping on the local structure of the high-$T_c$ (~39 K) $Li_{1.0}(C_5H_5N)_yFe_{2-z}Se_2$ phase. This material is derived by annealing the structurally related as-made derivative ($T_c$~ 44 K), with layers being primed apart by [alkali-molecule] guests. Metrics, such as, a reduced filling of Se $4p$ orbitals and shorter Fe-Se bonds in the annealed phase, corroborate to a lower electron doping level with respect to the as-made one. Analysis of the metal-ligand thermal motion, based on the correlated Debye model, further relates the higher $T_c$ intercalates with the softening of the local Fe-Se bond. Beyond electronic effects, intercalation brings forth host-guest interactions that mediate the dynamics of the bulk crystal structure. For this, neutron time-of-flight spectroscopy on the annealed derivative, corroborates to the Se-Fe-Se layer being sensitive to chemical pressure effects imposed by the confined organic guests. This reflects in the phonon density of states, where harder low-energy transverse acoustic matrix phonons and molecular vibrations are witnessed, with respect to the pristine inorganic ($\beta$-FeSe) and organic ($C_5D_5N$) counterparts. On cooling through $T_c$, these excitations arrive without a collective magnetic-resonance mode - essential in unconventional, spin-mediated mechanisms - enquiring about deviations from optimal doping. The work highlights that when the Fe-square planes are tuned far apart, carrier-doping leveraged by intercalation plays a key role in the $T_c$ parametrization.</description>

      <title>Millikelvin Nb nanoSQUID-embedded tuneable resonator fabricated with a neon focused-ion-beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: SQUID-embedded superconducting resonators are of great interest due to their potential for coupling highly scalable superconducting circuits with quantum memories based on solid-state spin ensembles. Such an application requires a high-$Q$, frequency-tuneable resonator which is both resilient to magnetic field, and able to operate at millikelvin temperatures. These requirements motivate the use of a higher $H_{c}$ metal such as niobium, however the challenge then becomes to sufficiently reduce the operating temperature. We address this by presenting a monolithic Nb nanoSQUID-embedded resonator, where neon focused-ion-beam fabrication of the nanoSQUID results in a device displaying frequency tuneability at $T = 16$ mK. In order to assess the applicability of the device for coupling to small spin clusters, we characterise the flux sensitivity as a function of microwave drive power and externally applied magnetic field, and find that the noise is dominated by dielectric noise in the resonator. Finally, we discuss improvements to the device design which can dramatically improve the flux sensitivity, which highlights the promise of Nb SQUID-embedded resonators for hybrid superconductor-spin applications.</description>

      <title>Engineering high-Q superconducting tantalum microwave coplanar waveguide resonators for compact coherent quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tantalum (Ta) has recently received considerable attention in manufacturing robust superconducting quantum circuits. Ta offers low microwave loss, high kinetic inductance compared to aluminium (Al) and niobium (Nb), and good compatibility with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology, which is essential for quantum computing applications. Here, we demonstrate the fabrication engineering of thickness-dependent high quality factor (high-Q_i) Ta superconducting microwave coplanar waveguide resonators. All films are deposited on high-resistivity silicon substrates at room temperature without additional substrate heating. Before Ta deposition, a niobium (Nb) seed layer is used to ensure a body-centred cubic lattice ({\alpha}-Ta) formation. We further engineer the kinetic inductance (L_K) resonators by varying Ta film thicknesses. High L_K is a key advantage for applications because it facilitates the realisation of high-impedance, compact quantum circuits with enhanced coupling to qubits. The maximum internal quality factor Q_i of ~ 3.6 * 10^6 is achieved at the high power regime for 100 nm Ta, while the highest kinetic inductance is obtained to be 0.6 pH/sq for the thinnest film, which is 40 nm. This combination of high Q_i and high L_K highlights the potential of Ta microwave circuits for high-fidelity operations of compact quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Kramers-protected hardware-efficient error correction with Andreev spin qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an architecture for bit flip error correction of Andreev spins that is protected by Kramers' degeneracy. Specifically, we show that a coupling network of linear inductors results in a static Hamiltonian composed of the stabilizers of a bit flip code. Thereby, without detuning from the Kramers' point, reflectometry off a single coupled resonator accomplishes a projective measurement of multiple stabilizers. We further show how circuit-mediated spin couplings enable error correction operations and a complete set of logical quantum gates. The concept is experimentally feasible.</description>

      <title>Robust gap closing and reopening in topological-insulator Josephson junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08265v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the seminal proposal by Fu and Kane, the superconducting proximity effect is used to realize topological superconductivity in the topological surface state (TSS) of a 3D topological insulator (TI). In a line Josephson junction made on the TI surface, the spin-momentum locking of the TSS guarantees the existence of a pair of spin-non-degenerate, perfectly transmitted Andreev modes. These modes lead to robust gap closing and parity alteration as a function of the superconducting phase difference $\varphi$ across the junction. Here, we report the observation of the predicted gap closing at $\varphi = (2n+1)\pi$ in a TI Josephson junction ($n$ integer), where the local density of states is probed via tunnel contacts and $\varphi$ is controlled by a flux loop. This phenomenon is robust for a wide range of chemical potentials, supporting its TSS origin. Under an applied perpendicular magnetic field, Josephson vortices form, making $\varphi$ position-dependent. In this case, the gap closing occurs locally at the Josephson vortex cores where $\varphi = (2n+1)\pi$, which we also observe. Our results confirm the fundamental role of spin-momentum locking in the Andreev physics in the TSS, which implies that the observed gap closing and reopening has a topological nature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19894v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe a numerical approach to modeling magnetoelectric effects generated by spin-orbit coupling in inhomogeneous diffusive 2D superconductors. It is based on direct minimization of the free energy of diffusion modes, including their coupling to the spin-orbit field strength, described by a recently discovered $\sigma$-model action. We explain how to retain exact conservation laws in the discretized model, and detail the numerical procedure. We apply the approach to the spin-galvanic and the inverse spin-galvanic effects in finite-size 2D superconductors, and describe short-range oscillations of circulating currents and spin densities originating from the spin-orbit coupling.</description>

      <title>Josephson diode effect in one-dimensional quantum wires connected to superconductors with mixed singlet-triplet pairing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02794v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Josephson diode effect (JDE), characterized by asymmetric critical currents in a Josephson junction, has drawn considerable attention in the field of condensed matter physics. We investigate the conditions under which JDE can manifest in a one-dimensional Josephson junction composed of a spin-orbit-coupled quantum wire with an applied Zeeman field, connected between two superconductors. Our study reveals that while spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and a Zeeman field in the quantum wire are not sufficient to induce JDE when the superconductors are purely singlet, introduction of triplet pairing in the superconductors leads to the emergence of JDE. This finding highlights the potential of JDE as a probe for triplet superconductivity. We further demonstrate that even in absence of SOC in the quantum wire, JDE can arise when the directions of the triplet pairing and the Zeeman field are non-collinear, provided the superconductors exhibit mixed singlet-triplet pairing. Additionally, we identify specific conditions under which JDE is absent, namely, when the pairing is purely triplet and the directions of the SOC and the triplet pairing are perpendicular. Our findings indicate that JDE is always accompanied by anomalous Josephson effect. The diode effect coefficient is found to oscillate with variations in the chemical potential of the quantum wire, driven by Fabry-P\'erot interference effects. Our results suggest that quantum wires connected across superconductors can serve as effective platforms for probing triplet superconductivity through the observation of JDE.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Nuclear Magnetism at Ultralow and Zero Field using SQUIDs</title>

Abstract: Nuclear magnetism underpins areas such as medicine in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Hyperpolarization of nuclei enhances the quantity and quality of information that can be determined from these techniques by increasing their signal to noise ratios by orders of magnitude. However, some of these hyperpolarization techniques rely on the use of low to ultralow magnetic fields (ULF) (nTs-mTs). The broadband character and ultrasensitive field sensitivity of superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUID) allow for probing nuclear magnetism at these fields, where other magnetometers, such as Faraday coils and flux gates do not. To this end, we designed a reactor to hyperpolarize [1-$^{13}$C]pyruvate with the technique, signal amplification by reversible exchange in shield enables alignment transfer to heteronuclei (SABRE-SHEATH). Hyperpolarized pyruvate has been shown to be very powerful for the diagnosis of tumours with MRI as its metabolism is associated with various pathologies. We were able to characterize the field sensitivity of our setup by simulating the filled reactor in relation to its placement in our ultralow noise, ULF MRI setup. Using the simulations, we determined that our hyperpolarization setup results in a $^{13}$C polarization of 0.4 %, a signal enhancement of $\sim$100~000~000 versus the predicted thermal equilibrium signal at earth field ($\sim$50 $\mu$T). This results in a $^{13}$C signal of 6.20$\pm$0.34~pT, which with our ultralow noise setup, opens the possibility for direct observation of the hyperpolarization and the subsequent spin-lattice relaxation without system perturbation.</description>

      <title>Sublattice modulated superconductivity in the Kagome Hubbard model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.08517v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We identify a superconducting order featuring spatial pair modulations on the kagome lattice subject to onsite Hubbard U and nearest neighbor V interactions. Within our functional renormalization group analysis, this state appears with a concomitant d-wave superconducting (SC) instability at zero lattice momentum, where it distinguishes itself through intra-unit cell modulations of the pairing function thus breaking the discrete space group symmetry. The relative weight of the sublattice modulated superconductor (SMS) and d-wave SC is influenced by the absolute interaction strength and coupling ratio V /U . Parametrically adjacent to this domain at weak coupling, we find an intra-unit cell modulated vestigial charge density wave and an s-wave SC instability. Our study provides a microscopic setting and thorough description of this novel SMS arising within a translation symmetry broken background.</description>

      <title>Van-Hove tuning of Fermi surface instabilities through compensated metallicity</title>

Abstract: Van-Hove (vH) singularities in the vicinity of the Fermi level facilitate the emergence of electronically mediated Fermi surface instabilities. This is because they provide a momentum-localized enhancement of density of states promoting selective electronic scattering channels. High-temperature topological superconductivity has been argued for in graphene at vH filling which, however, has so far proven inaccessible due to the demanded large doping from pristine half filling. We propose compensated metallicity as a path to unlock vH-driven pairing close to half filling in an electronic honeycomb lattice model. Enabled by an emergent multi-pocket fermiology, charge compensation is realized by strong breaking of chiral symmetry from intra-sublattice hybridization, while retaining vH dominated physics at the Fermi level. We conclude by proposing tangible realizations through quantum material design.</description>

      <title>Surface topological quantum criticality: Conformal manifolds and Discrete Strong Coupling Fixed Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14682</link>

Abstract: In this article, we study quantum critical phenomena in surfaces of symmetry-protected topological matter, i.e. surface topological quantum criticality. A generic phase boundary of gapless surfaces in a symmetry-protected state shall be a co-dimension one manifold in an interaction parameter space of dimension $D_p$ (where $p$ refers to the parameter space) where the value of $D_p$ further depends on bulk topologies. In the context of fermionic topological insulators that we focus on, $D_p$ depends on the number of half-Dirac cones $\mathcal{N}$. We construct such manifolds explicitly for a few interaction parameter spaces with various $D_p$ values. Most importantly, we further illustrate that in cases with $D_p=3$ and $6$, there are sub-manifolds of fixed points that dictate the universalities of surface topological quantum criticality. These infrared stable manifolds are associated with emergent symmetries in the renormalization-group-equation flow naturally appearing in the loop expansion. Unlike in the usual order-disorder quantum critical phenomena, typically governed by an isolated Wilson-Fisher fixed point, we find in the one-loop approximation surface topological quantum criticalities are naturally captured by conformal manifolds where the number of marginal operators uniquely determines their co-dimensions. Isolated strong coupling fixed points also appear, usually as the endpoints in the phase boundary of surface topological quantum phases. However, their extreme infrared instabilities along multiple directions suggest that they shall be related to multi-critical surface topological quantum critical phenomena rather than generic surface topological quantum criticality. We also discuss and classify higher-loop symmetry-breaking effects, which can either distort the conformal manifolds or further break the conformal manifolds down to a few distinct fixed points.</description>

      <title>Fabrication of low-loss Josephson parametric devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11280</link>

Abstract: Superconducting circuits incorporating Josephson elements represent a promising hardware platform for quantum technologies. Potential applications include scalable quantum computing, microwave quantum networks, and quantum-limited amplifiers. However, progress in Josephson junction-based quantum technologies is facing the ongoing challenge of minimizing loss channels. This is also true for parametric superconducting devices based on nonlinear Josephson resonators. In this work, we report on the fabrication and characterization of low-loss Josephson parametric devices operated in the GHz frequency range, showing record internal quality factors. Specifically, we achieve internal quality factors significantly above $10^5$ for both Josephson parametric converters and the Josephson parametric amplifiers at low microwave power ranging in the single-photon regime. These low-loss devices mark a significant step forward in realizing high-performance quantum circuits, enabling further advancements in superconducting quantum technologies.</description>
