      <title>Incentivizing Truthful Data Contributions in a Marketplace for Mean Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a data marketplace where a broker mediates transactions between buyers and contributors. Buyers estimate the mean mu of an unknown normal distribution N(mu, sigma^2), with valuations based on estimation error. Contributors, incurring different data collection costs, gather and report samples (not necessarily truthfully) to the broker, who sells subsets at varying prices and redistributes revenue. We model this as a mechanism design problem to maximize profit (revenue minus data costs) while ensuring individual rationality (participation benefits all), envy-freeness (no buyer prefers another allocation), budget balance (payments cover costs), and incentive compatibility (contributors truthfully report sufficient data).
  We design a mechanism which satisfies these requirements. We first establish a connection between envy-free data pricing and ordered-item pricing (OIP) for unit-demand buyers and leverage OIP algorithms to determine the optimal data allocation and expected prices for buyers. The actual prices paid by buyers are centered around these expected prices, but also vary based on discrepancies in contributors' reported data. This variation is then passed on to the contributors via their payments. This scheme results in a Nash equilibrium (NE) where only the two lowest-cost contributors collect all the data and report it truthfully. Including this variation in the prices also helps us achieve individual rationality for buyers, as buyers will pay less if there are significant discrepancies in contributors' datasets.
  To complement these findings, we prove a nearly matching upper bound on the maximum possible profit achievable in any NE of any mechanism, thus proving that our mechanism is essentially unimprovable. We also show that no nontrivial dominant-strategy incentive-compatible mechanism exists in this problem.</description>

      <title>Infinite Horizon Markov Economies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a generalization of Markov games and pseudo-games that we call Markov pseudo-games, which, like the former, captures time and uncertainty, and like the latter, allows for the players' actions to determine the set of actions available to the other players. In the same vein as Arrow and Debreu, we intend for this model to be rich enough to encapsulate a broad mathematical framework for modeling economies. We then prove the existence of a game-theoretic equilibrium in our model, which in turn implies the existence of a general equilibrium in the corresponding economies. Finally, going beyond Arrow and Debreu, we introduce a solution method for Markov pseudo-games and prove its polynomial-time convergence.
  We then provide an application of Markov pseudo-games to infinite-horizon Markov exchange economies, a stochastic economic model that extends Radner's stochastic exchange economy and Magill and Quinzii's infinite-horizon incomplete markets model. We show that under suitable assumptions, the solutions of any infinite-horizon Markov exchange economy (i.e., recursive Radner equilibria -- RRE) can be formulated as the solution to a concave Markov pseudo-game, thus establishing the existence of RRE and providing first-order methods for approximating RRE. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in practice by building the corresponding generative adversarial policy neural network and using it to compute RRE in a variety of infinite-horizon Markov exchange economies.</description>

      <title>Multi-Party Data Pricing for Complex Data Trading Markets: A Rubinstein Bargaining Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence technologies, data has become an important strategic resource in the new era. However, the growing demand for data has exacerbated the issue of \textit{data silos}. Existing data pricing models primarily focus on single factors such as data quality or market demand, failing to adequately address issues such as data seller monopolies and the diverse needs of buyers, resulting in biased pricing that cannot meet the complexities of evolving transaction scenarios. To address these problems, this paper proposes a multi-party data pricing model based on the Rubinstein bargaining model. The model introduces buyer data utility indicators and data quality assessments, comprehensively considering factors such as the utility, accuracy, and timeliness of data sets, to more accurately evaluate their value to buyers. To overcome the limitations of single-factor models, this paper innovatively introduces the buyer data set satisfaction indicator, which reflects the overall satisfaction of buyers with data sets by integrating both data utility and quality assessments. Based on this, the model uses the Rubinstein bargaining model to simulate the pricing process between multiple sellers and multiple buyers, yielding pricing results that better align with market demands. Experimental results show that the proposed model effectively addresses the pricing imbalance caused by data monopolies and demonstrates good applicability and accuracy in multi-seller, multi-buyer transaction environments. This research provides an effective pricing mechanism for complex data trading markets and has significant theoretical and practical value in solving pricing issues in actual data transactions.</description>

      <title>From Independence of Clones to Composition Consistency: A Hierarchy of Barriers to Strategic Nomination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study two axioms for social choice functions that capture the impact of similar candidates: independence of clones (IoC) and composition consistency (CC). We clarify the relationship between these axioms by observing that CC is strictly more demanding than IoC, and investigate whether common voting rules that are known to be independent of clones (such as STV, Ranked Pairs, Schulze, and Split Cycle) are composition-consistent. While for most of these rules the answer is negative, we identify a variant of Ranked Pairs that satisfies CC. Further, we show how to efficiently modify any (neutral) social choice function so that it satisfies CC, while maintaining its other desirable properties. Our transformation relies on the hierarchical representation of clone structures via PQ-trees. We extend our analysis to social preference functions. Finally, we interpret IoC and CC as measures of robustness against strategic manipulation by candidates, with IoC corresponding to strategy-proofness and CC corresponding to obvious strategy-proofness.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Bidding Strategies for Prosumers Trading in Double Auction-Based Transactive Energy Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the large number of prosumers deploying distributed energy resources (DERs), integrating these prosumers into a transactive energy market (TEM) is a trend for the future smart grid. A community-based double auction market is considered a promising TEM that can encourage prosumers to participate and maximize social welfare. However, the traditional TEM is challenging to model explicitly due to the random bidding behavior of prosumers and uncertainties caused by the energy operation of DERs. Furthermore, although reinforcement learning algorithms provide a model-free solution to optimize prosumers' bidding strategies, their use in TEM is still challenging due to their scalability, stability, and privacy protection limitations. To address the above challenges, in this study, we design a double auction-based TEM with multiple DERs-equipped prosumers to transparently and efficiently manage energy transactions. We also propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) model with distributed learning and execution to ensure the scalability and privacy of the market environment. Additionally, the design of two bidding actions (i.e., bidding price and quantity) optimizes the bidding strategies for prosumers. Simulation results show that (1) the designed TEM and DRL model are robust; (2) the proposed DRL model effectively balances the energy payment and comfort satisfaction for prosumers and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in optimizing the bidding strategies.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Iterative Water-Filling in Multi-User Non-Cooperative Power Control: A Comprehensive Analysis for Sequential, Simultaneous, and Asynchronous Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-cooperative game theory provides a robust framework for analyzing distributed resource allocation in multi-user wireless networks, with \emph{Iterative Water-Filling} (IWF) emerging as a canonical solution for power control problems. Although classical fixed-point theorems guarantee the existence of a Nash Equilibrium (NE) under mild concavity and compactness conditions, the convergence of practical iterative algorithms to that equilibrium remains a challenging endeavor. This challenge intensifies under varying update schedules, interference regimes, and imperfections such as channel estimation errors or feedback delay.
  In this paper, we present an in-depth examination of IWF in multi-user systems under three different update schemes: (1) synchronous \emph{sequential} updates, (2) synchronous \emph{simultaneous} updates, and (3) \emph{totally asynchronous} updates. We first formulate the water-filling operator in a multi-carrier environment, then recast the iterative process as a fixed-point problem. Using contraction mapping principles, we demonstrate sufficient conditions under which IWF converges to a unique NE and highlight how spectral radius constraints, diagonal dominance, and careful step-size selection are pivotal for guaranteeing convergence. We further discuss robustness to measurement noise, partial updates, and network scaling to emphasize the practical viability of these schemes. This comprehensive analysis unifies diverse threads in the literature while offering novel insights into asynchronous implementations. Our findings enable network designers to ascertain system parameters that foster both stable convergence and efficient spectrum usage.</description>

      <title>Opinion Dynamics with Multiple Adversaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Opinion dynamics model how the publicly expressed opinions of users in a social network coevolve according to their neighbors as well as their own intrinsic opinion. Motivated by the real-world manipulation of social networks during the 2016 US elections and the 2019 Hong Kong protests, a growing body of work models the effects of a strategic actor who interferes with the network to induce disagreement or polarization. We lift the assumption of a single strategic actor by introducing a model in which any subset of network users can manipulate network outcomes. They do so by acting according to a fictitious intrinsic opinion. Strategic actors can have conflicting goals, and push competing narratives. We characterize the Nash Equilibrium of the resulting meta-game played by the strategic actors. Experiments on real-world social network datasets from Twitter, Reddit, and Political Blogs show that strategic agents can significantly increase polarization and disagreement, as well as increase the "cost" of the equilibrium. To this end, we give worst-case upper bounds on the Price of Misreporting (analogous to the Price of Anarchy). Finally, we give efficient learning algorithms for the platform to (i) detect whether strategic manipulation has occurred, and (ii) learn who the strategic actors are. Our algorithms are accurate on the same real-world datasets, suggesting how platforms can take steps to mitigate the effects of strategic behavior.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Bandits with Parsimonious Hints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a hinted heterogeneous multi-agent multi-armed bandits problem (HMA2B), where agents can query low-cost observations (hints) in addition to pulling arms. In this framework, each of the $M$ agents has a unique reward distribution over $K$ arms, and in $T$ rounds, they can observe the reward of the arm they pull only if no other agent pulls that arm. The goal is to maximize the total utility by querying the minimal necessary hints without pulling arms, achieving time-independent regret. We study HMA2B in both centralized and decentralized setups. Our main centralized algorithm, GP-HCLA, which is an extension of HCLA, uses a central decision-maker for arm-pulling and hint queries, achieving $O(M^4K)$ regret with $O(MK\log T)$ adaptive hints. In decentralized setups, we propose two algorithms, HD-ETC and EBHD-ETC, that allow agents to choose actions independently through collision-based communication and query hints uniformly until stopping, yielding $O(M^3K^2)$ regret with $O(M^3K\log T)$ hints, where the former requires knowledge of the minimum gap and the latter does not. Finally, we establish lower bounds to prove the optimality of our results and verify them through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Urban Emergency Rescue Based on Multi-Agent Collaborative Learning: Coordination Between Fire Engines and Traffic Lights</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nowadays, traffic management in urban areas is one of the major economic problems. In particular, when faced with emergency situations like firefighting, timely and efficient traffic dispatching is crucial. Intelligent coordination between multiple departments is essential to realize efficient emergency rescue. In this demo, we present a framework that integrates techniques for collaborative learning methods into the well-known Unity Engine simulator, and thus these techniques can be evaluated in realistic settings. In particular, the framework allows flexible settings such as the number and type of collaborative agents, learning strategies, reward functions, and constraint conditions in practice. The framework is evaluated for an emergency rescue scenario, which could be used as a simulation tool for urban emergency departments.</description>

      <title>DUPRE: Data Utility Prediction for Efficient Data Valuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data valuation is increasingly used in machine learning (ML) to decide the fair compensation for data owners and identify valuable or harmful data for improving ML models. Cooperative game theory-based data valuation, such as Data Shapley, requires evaluating the data utility (e.g., validation accuracy) and retraining the ML model for multiple data subsets. While most existing works on efficient estimation of the Shapley values have focused on reducing the number of subsets to evaluate, our framework, \texttt{DUPRE}, takes an alternative yet complementary approach that reduces the cost per subset evaluation by predicting data utilities instead of evaluating them by model retraining. Specifically, given the evaluated data utilities of some data subsets, \texttt{DUPRE} fits a \emph{Gaussian process} (GP) regression model to predict the utility of every other data subset. Our key contribution lies in the design of our GP kernel based on the sliced Wasserstein distance between empirical data distributions. In particular, we show that the kernel is valid and positive semi-definite, encodes prior knowledge of similarities between different data subsets, and can be efficiently computed. We empirically verify that \texttt{DUPRE} introduces low prediction error and speeds up data valuation for various ML models, datasets, and utility functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16208v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce polytopal stochastic games, an extension of two-player, zero-sum, turn-based stochastic games, in which we may have uncertainty over the transition probabilities. In these games the uncertainty over the probabilities distributions is captured via linear (in)equalities whose space of solutions forms a polytope. We give a formal definition of these games and prove their basic properties: determinacy and existence of optimal memoryless and deterministic strategies. We do this for reachability and different types of reward objectives and show that the solution exists in a finite representation of the game. We also state that the corresponding decision problems are in the intersection of NP and coNP. We motivate the use of polytopal stochastic games via a simple example. Finally, we report some experiments we performed with a prototype tool.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Coalition Structure Detection in Natural Language-based Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In strategic multi-agent sequential interactions, detecting dynamic coalition structures is crucial for understanding how self-interested agents coordinate to influence outcomes. However, natural-language-based interactions introduce unique challenges to coalition detection due to ambiguity over intents and difficulty in modeling players' subjective perspectives. We propose a new method that leverages recent advancements in large language models and game theory to predict dynamic multilateral coalition formation in Diplomacy, a strategic multi-agent game where agents negotiate coalitions using natural language. The method consists of two stages. The first stage extracts the set of agreements discussed by two agents in their private dialogue, by combining a parsing-based filtering function with a fine-tuned language model trained to predict player intents. In the second stage, we define a new metric using the concept of subjective rationalizability from hypergame theory to evaluate the expected value of an agreement for each player. We then compute this metric for each agreement identified in the first stage by assessing the strategic value of the agreement for both players and taking into account the subjective belief of one player that the second player would honor the agreement. We demonstrate that our method effectively detects potential coalition structures in online Diplomacy gameplay by assigning high values to agreements likely to be honored and low values to those likely to be violated. The proposed method provides foundational insights into coalition formation in multi-agent environments with language-based negotiation and offers key directions for future research on the analysis of complex natural language-based interactions between agents.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Swap Regret Minimization via KL-Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Calibration is a fundamental concept that aims at ensuring the reliability of probabilistic predictions by aligning them with real-world outcomes. There is a surge of studies on new calibration measures that are easier to optimize compared to the classical $\ell_1$-Calibration while still having strong implications for downstream applications. One recent such example is the work by Fishelson et al. (2025) who show that it is possible to achieve $O(T^{1/3})$ pseudo $\ell_2$-Calibration error via minimizing pseudo swap regret of the squared loss, which in fact implies the same bound for all bounded proper losses with a smooth univariate form. In this work, we significantly generalize their result in the following ways: (a) in addition to smooth univariate forms, our algorithm also simultaneously achieves $O(T^{1/3})$ swap regret for any proper loss with a twice continuously differentiable univariate form (such as Tsallis entropy); (b) our bounds hold not only for pseudo swap regret that measures losses using the forecaster's distributions on predictions, but also hold for the actual swap regret that measures losses using the forecaster's actual realized predictions.
  We achieve so by introducing a new stronger notion of calibration called (pseudo) KL-Calibration, which we show is equivalent to the (pseudo) swap regret for log loss. We prove that there exists an algorithm that achieves $O(T^{1/3})$ KL-Calibration error and provide an explicit algorithm that achieves $O(T^{1/3})$ pseudo KL-Calibration error. Moreover, we show that the same algorithm achieves $O(T^{1/3}(\log T)^{-1/3}\log(T/\delta))$ swap regret w.p. $\ge 1-\delta$ for any proper loss with a smooth univariate form, which implies $O(T^{1/3})$ $\ell_2$-Calibration error. A technical contribution of our work is a new randomized rounding procedure and a non-uniform discretization scheme to minimize the swap regret for log loss.</description>

      <title>Tarski Lower Bounds from Multi-Dimensional Herringbones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tarski's theorem states that every monotone function from a complete lattice to itself has a fixed point. We analyze the query complexity of finding such a fixed point on the $k$-dimensional grid of side length $n$ under the $\leq$ relation. In this setting, there is an unknown monotone function $f: \{0,1,\ldots, n-1\}^k \to \{0,1,\ldots, n-1\}^k$ and an algorithm must query a vertex $v$ to learn $f(v)$. The goal is to find a fixed point of $f$ using as few oracle queries as possible.
  We show that the randomized query complexity of this problem is $\Omega\left( \frac{k \cdot \log^2{n}}{\log{k}} \right)$ for all $n,k \geq 2$. This unifies and improves upon two prior results: a lower bound of $\Omega(\log^2{n})$ from [EPRY 2019] and a lower bound of $\Omega\left( \frac{k \cdot \log{n}}{\log{k}}\right)$ from [BPR 2024], respectively.</description>

      <title>Exclusion Zones of Instant Runoff Voting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent research on instant runoff voting (IRV) shows that it exhibits a striking combinatorial property in one-dimensional preference spaces: there is an "exclusion zone" around the median voter such that if a candidate from the exclusion zone is on the ballot, then the winner must come from the exclusion zone. Thus, in one dimension, IRV cannot elect an extreme candidate as long as a sufficiently moderate candidate is running. In this work, we examine the mathematical structure of exclusion zones as a broad phenomenon in more general preference spaces. We prove that with voters uniformly distributed over any $d$-dimensional hyperrectangle (for $d &gt; 1$), IRV has no nontrivial exclusion zone. However, we also show that IRV exclusion zones are not solely a one-dimensional phenomenon. For irregular higher-dimensional preference spaces with fewer symmetries than hyperrectangles, IRV can exhibit nontrivial exclusion zones. As a further exploration, we study IRV exclusion zones in graph voting, where nodes represent voters who prefer candidates closer to them in the graph. Here, we show that IRV exclusion zones present a surprising computational challenge: even checking whether a given set of positions is an IRV exclusion zone is NP-hard. We develop an efficient randomized approximation algorithm for checking and finding exclusion zones. We also report on computational experiments with exclusion zones in two directions: (i) applying our approximation algorithm to a collection of real-world school friendship networks, we find that about 60% of these networks have probable nontrivial IRV exclusion zones; and (ii) performing an exhaustive computer search of small graphs and trees, we also find nontrivial IRV exclusion zones in most graphs. While our focus is on IRV, the properties of exclusion zones we establish provide a novel method for analyzing voting systems in metric spaces more generally.</description>

      <title>A new solution for cooperative game with public externalities: Analysis based on axiomatic method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new solution concept for the Cooperative Game with Public Externalities, called the w-value, which is characterized by three properties (axioms), namely Pareto-optimality (PO), Market-equilbrium (ME) and Fiscal-balance (FB). Additionally, the implementation mechanism for w-value is also provided. The w-value exists and is unique. It belongs to the core. And, more specifically, it belongs to the -core. Meanwhile, the computational cost of w-value is very low. Therefore, the w-value is a theoretically more compelling solution concept than the existing cooperation game solutions when analyzing cooperative games with public externalities. A numerical illustration shows the calculation steps of w-value. Meanwhile, the w-value well explains the reason why the mandatory emission reduction mechanism must be transformed into a "nationally determined contribution" mechanism in current international climate negotiations.</description>

      <title>Joint Value Estimation and Bidding in Repeated First-Price Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study regret minimization in repeated first-price auctions (FPAs), where a bidder observes only the realized outcome after each auction -- win or loss. This setup reflects practical scenarios in online display advertising where the actual value of an impression depends on the difference between two potential outcomes, such as clicks or conversion rates, when the auction is won versus lost. We analyze three outcome models: (1) adversarial outcomes without features, (2) linear potential outcomes with features, and (3) linear treatment effects in features. For each setting, we propose algorithms that jointly estimate private values and optimize bidding strategies, achieving near-optimal regret bounds. Notably, our framework enjoys a unique feature that the treatments are also actively chosen, and hence eliminates the need for the overlap condition commonly required in causal inference.</description>

      <title>Survey on Strategic Mining in Blockchain: A Reinforcement Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17307v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strategic mining attacks, such as selfish mining, exploit blockchain consensus protocols by deviating from honest behavior to maximize rewards. Markov Decision Process (MDP) analysis faces scalability challenges in modern digital economics, including blockchain. To address these limitations, reinforcement learning (RL) provides a scalable alternative, enabling adaptive strategy optimization in complex dynamic environments.
  In this survey, we examine RL's role in strategic mining analysis, comparing it to MDP-based approaches. We begin by reviewing foundational MDP models and their limitations, before exploring RL frameworks that can learn near-optimal strategies across various protocols. Building on this analysis, we compare RL techniques and their effectiveness in deriving security thresholds, such as the minimum attacker power required for profitable attacks. Expanding the discussion further, we classify consensus protocols and propose open challenges, such as multi-agent dynamics and real-world validation.
  This survey highlights the potential of reinforcement learning (RL) to address the challenges of selfish mining, including protocol design, threat detection, and security analysis, while offering a strategic roadmap for researchers in decentralized systems and AI-driven analytics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2103.03769v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a natural competitive-information-design strategic variant for the celebrated Pandora's Box problem (Weitzman, 1979), where each box is associated with a strategic information sender who can design what information about the box's prize value to be revealed to the agent when the agent inspects the box. This variant with strategic boxes is motivated by a wide range of real-world economic applications for Pandora's Box. Our contributions are three-fold: (1) given the boxes' information policies, we characterize the agent's optimal search and stopping strategy; (2) we fully characterize the pure symmetric equilibrium for the game of boxes' competitive information revelation in a symmetric environment; and (3) we reveal various insights regarding information competition and the resultant agent payoff at equilibrium, and additionally, we study informational properties of Pandora's Box by establishing an intrinsic connection between informativeness of any box's value distribution and the utility order of the search agent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.04880v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Independence of Clones (IoC) criterion measures a voting rule's robustness to strategic nomination. Prior literature has established empirically that individuals may still submit costly, distortionary misreports even in strategy-proof (SP) settings, due to failure to recognize the SP property. The intersection of these issues motivates the search for mechanisms that are Obviously Independent of Clones (OIoC): where strategic nomination/exiting of clones obviously has no effect on the outcome. We construct a formal and intuitive definition of a voting rule being OIoC and examine five IoC rules to identify whether they satisfy OIoC.</description>

      <title>Metric Distortion of Line-up Elections: The Right Person for the Right Job</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04020v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide mechanisms and new metric distortion bounds for line-up elections. In such elections, a set of $n$ voters, $m$ candidates, and $\ell$ positions are all located in a metric space. The goal is to choose a set of candidates and assign them to different positions, so as to minimize the total cost of the voters. The cost of each voter consists of the distances from itself to the chosen candidates (measuring how much the voter likes the chosen candidates, or how similar it is to them), as well as the distances from the candidates to the positions they are assigned to (measuring the fitness of the candidates for their positions). Our mechanisms, however, do not know the exact distances, and instead produce good outcomes while only using a smaller amount of information, resulting in small distortion.
  We consider several different types of information: ordinal voter preferences, ordinal position preferences, and knowing the exact locations of candidates and positions, but not those of voters. In each of these cases, we provide constant distortion bounds, thus showing that only a small amount of information is enough to form outcomes close to optimum in line-up elections.</description>

      <title>Weighted Envy Freeness With Bounded Subsidies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12696v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore solutions for fairly allocating indivisible items among agents assigned weights representing their entitlements. Our fairness goal is weighted-envy-freeness (WEF), where each agent deems their allocated portion relative to their entitlement at least as favorable as any other's relative to their own. In many cases, achieving WEF necessitates monetary transfers, which can be modeled as third-party subsidies. The goal is to attain WEF with bounded subsidies.
  Previous work in the unweighted setting of subsidies relied on basic characterizations of EF that fail in the weighted settings. This makes our new setting challenging and theoretically intriguing. We present polynomial-time algorithms that compute WEF-able allocations with an upper bound on the subsidy per agent in three distinct additive valuation scenarios: (1) general, (2) identical, and (3) binary. When all weights are equal, our bounds reduce to the bounds derived in the literature for the unweighted setting.</description>

      <title>Metric Distortion of Small-group Deliberation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01380v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider models for social choice where voters rank a set of choices (or alternatives) by deliberating in small groups of size at most $k$, and these outcomes are aggregated by a social choice rule to find the winning alternative. We ground these models in the metric distortion framework, where the voters and alternatives are embedded in a latent metric space, with closer alternative being more desirable for a voter. We posit that the outcome of a small-group interaction optimally uses the voters' collective knowledge of the metric, either deterministically or probabilistically.
  We characterize the distortion of our deliberation models for small $k$, showing that groups of size $k=3$ suffice to drive the distortion bound below the deterministic metric distortion lower bound of $3$, and groups of size $4$ suffice to break the randomized lower bound of $2.11$. We also show nearly tight asymptotic distortion bounds in the group size, showing that for any constant $\epsilon &gt; 0$, achieving a distortion of $1+\epsilon$ needs group size that only depends on $1/\epsilon$, and not the number of alternatives. We obtain these results via formulating a basic optimization problem in small deviations of the sum of $i.i.d.$ random variables, which we solve to global optimality via non-convex optimization. The resulting bounds may be of independent interest in probability theory.</description>

Abstract: We explore solutions for fairly allocating indivisible items among agents assigned weights representing their entitlements. Our fairness goal is weighted-envy-freeness (WEF), where each agent deems their allocated portion relative to their entitlement at least as favorable as any others relative to their own. Often, achieving WEF necessitates monetary transfers, which can be modeled as third-party subsidies. The goal is to attain WEF with bounded subsidies.
  Previous work relied on characterizations of unweighted envy-freeness (EF), that fail in the weighted setting. This makes our new setting challenging. We present polynomial-time algorithms that compute WEF allocations with a guaranteed upper bound on total subsidy for monotone valuations and various subclasses thereof.
  We also present an efficient algorithm to compute a fair allocation of items and money, when the budget is not enough to make the allocation WEF. This algorithm is new even for the unweighted setting.</description>

      <title>Shapley Value-based Approach for Redistributing Revenue of Matchmaking of Private Transactions in Blockchains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15420v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of blockchain, MEV refers to the maximum value that can be extracted from block production through the inclusion, exclusion, or reordering of transactions. Searchers often participate in order flow auctions (OFAs) to obtain exclusive rights to private transactions, available through entities called matchmakers, also known as order flow providers (OFPs). Most often, redistributing the revenue generated through such auctions among transaction creators is desirable. In this work, we formally introduce the matchmaking problem in MEV, its desirable properties, and associated challenges. Using cooperative game theory, we formalize the notion of fair revenue redistribution in matchmaking and present its potential possibilities and impossibilities. Precisely, we define a characteristic form game, referred to as RST-Game, for the transaction creators. We propose to redistribute the revenue using the Shapley value of RST-Game. We show that the corresponding problem could be SUBEXP (i.e. $2^{o(n)}$, where $n$ is the number of transactions); therefore, approximating the Shapley value is necessary. Further, we propose a randomized algorithm for computing the Shapley value in RST-Game and empirically verify its efficacy.</description>

      <title>From External to Swap Regret 2.0: An Efficient Reduction and Oblivious Adversary for Large Action Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19786v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a novel reduction from swap-regret minimization to external-regret minimization, which improves upon the classical reductions of Blum-Mansour [BM07] and Stolz-Lugosi [SL05] in that it does not require finiteness of the space of actions. We show that, whenever there exists a no-external-regret algorithm for some hypothesis class, there must also exist a no-swap-regret algorithm for that same class. For the problem of learning with expert advice, our result implies that it is possible to guarantee that the swap regret is bounded by {\epsilon} after $\log(N)^{O(1/\epsilon)}$ rounds and with $O(N)$ per iteration complexity, where $N$ is the number of experts, while the classical reductions of Blum-Mansour and Stolz-Lugosi require $O(N/\epsilon^2)$ rounds and at least $\Omega(N^2)$ per iteration complexity. Our result comes with an associated lower bound, which -- in contrast to that in [BM07] -- holds for oblivious and $\ell_1$-constrained adversaries and learners that can employ distributions over experts, showing that the number of rounds must be $\tilde\Omega(N/\epsilon^2)$ or exponential in $1/\epsilon$.
  Our reduction implies that, if no-regret learning is possible in some game, then this game must have approximate correlated equilibria, of arbitrarily good approximation. This strengthens the folklore implication of no-regret learning that approximate coarse correlated equilibria exist. Importantly, it provides a sufficient condition for the existence of correlated equilibrium which vastly extends the requirement that the action set is finite, thus answering a question left open by [DG22; Ass+23]. Moreover, it answers several outstanding questions about equilibrium computation and learning in games.</description>

      <title>Learning to Manipulate under Limited Information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16412v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By classic results in social choice theory, any reasonable preferential voting method sometimes gives individuals an incentive to report an insincere preference. The extent to which different voting methods are more or less resistant to such strategic manipulation has become a key consideration for comparing voting methods. Here we measure resistance to manipulation by whether neural networks of various sizes can learn to profitably manipulate a given voting method in expectation, given different types of limited information about how other voters will vote. We trained over 100,000 neural networks of 26 sizes to manipulate against 8 different voting methods, under 6 types of limited information, in committee-sized elections with 5-21 voters and 3-6 candidates. We find that some voting methods, such as Borda, are highly manipulable by networks with limited information, while others, such as Instant Runoff, are not, despite being quite profitably manipulated by an ideal manipulator with full information. For the three probability models for elections that we use, the overall least manipulable of the 8 methods we study are Condorcet methods, namely Minimax and Split Cycle.</description>

Abstract: Adversarial training aims to defend against *adversaries*: malicious opponents whose sole aim is to harm predictive performance in any way possible - a rather harsh perspective, which we assert results in unnecessarily conservative models. Instead, we propose to model opponents as simply pursuing their own goals, rather than working directly against the classifier. Employing tools from strategic modeling, our approach uses knowledge or beliefs regarding the opponent's possible incentives as inductive bias for learning. Our method of *strategic training* is designed to defend against opponents within an *incentive uncertainty set*: this resorts to adversarial learning when the set is maximal, but offers potential gains when it can be appropriately reduced. We conduct a series of experiments that show how even mild knowledge regarding the adversary's incentives can be useful, and that the degree of potential gains depends on how incentives relate to the structure of the learning task.</description>

      <title>Practical Performative Policy Learning with Strategic Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01344v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the performative policy learning problem, where agents adjust their features in response to a released policy to improve their potential outcomes, inducing an endogenous distribution shift. There has been growing interest in training machine learning models in strategic environments, including strategic classification and performative prediction. However, existing approaches often rely on restrictive parametric assumptions: micro-level utility models in strategic classification and macro-level data distribution maps in performative prediction, severely limiting scalability and generalizability. We approach this problem as a complex causal inference task, relaxing parametric assumptions on both micro-level agent behavior and macro-level data distribution. Leveraging bounded rationality, we uncover a practical low-dimensional structure in distribution shifts and construct an effective mediator in the causal path from the deployed model to the shifted data. We then propose a gradient-based policy optimization algorithm with a differentiable classifier as a substitute for the high-dimensional distribution map. Our algorithm efficiently utilizes batch feedback and limited manipulation patterns. Our approach achieves high sample efficiency compared to methods reliant on bandit feedback or zero-order optimization. We also provide theoretical guarantees for algorithmic convergence. Extensive and challenging experiments on high-dimensional settings demonstrate our method's practical efficacy.</description>

      <title>Nested Removal of Strictly Dominated Strategies in Infinite Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compare two procedures for the iterated removal of strictly dominated strategies. In the nested procedure, a strategy of a player is removed only if it is dominated by an unremoved strategy. The universal procedure is more comprehensive for it allows the removal of strategies that are dominated by previously removed ones. Outside the class of finite games, the two procedures may lead to different outcomes in that the universal one is always order independent while the other is not. Here we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the equivalence of the two procedures. The conditions we give are variations of the bounded mechanisms from the literature on full implementation. The two elimination procedures are shown to be equivalent in quasisupermodular games as well as in games with compact strategy spaces and upper semicontinuous payoff functions. We show by example that order independence of the nested procedure is not sufficient for its being equivalent to the universal one.</description>
