      <title>Proposal to Observe Transverse Sound in Normal Liquid $^3$He in Aerogel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Fermi liquid metallic state, a static local magnetic moment is induced on the application of a circularly polarized electromagnetic wave, via the inverse Fara-day effect (IFE). The direction of this moment is along the direction of propagation of light, and the magnitude of the moment depends on the frequency of light, the temperature and various material parameters characteristic of the metal. I propose an analogous effect in the Fermi liquid state of $^3$H. A static circulating current is induced when liquid $^3$H is driven by a circularly polarized transverse acoustic wave. For liquid $^3$H filled into aerogel, the coupled system supports a low-attenuation transverse sound mode. I estimate the magnitude of induced circulating currents for this system and find that these are within the range of experimental measurement in the low-attenuation regime. The axis of circulation is along the direction of propagation of the acoustic wave. I propose this analogue of the inverse Faraday effect as a scheme to experimentally demonstrate the propagation of transverse sound in $^3$H-aerogel.</description>

      <title>Bulk and surface electron scattering in disordered Bi$_{2}$Te$_{3}$ probed by quasiparticle interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigated the electronic properties of the topological insulator Bi$_{2}$Te$_{3}$ by scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy at low temperature. We obtained high-resolution quasiparticle interference data of the topological surface Dirac electrons at different energies. Spin-selective joint density of states calculations were performed for surface and bulk electronic states to interpret the observed quasiparticle interference data. The topological properties of our crystals are demonstrated by the absence of backscattering along with the linear energy dispersion of the dominant scattering vector. In addition, we detect non-dispersive scattering modes which we associate with bulk-surface scattering and, thus, allow an approximate identification of the bulk energy gap range based on our quasiparticle interference data. Measurements of differential conductance maps in magnetic fields up to 15 T have been carried out, but no strong modifications could be observed.</description>

      <title>Characterization of the spin and crystal field Hamiltonian of erbium dopants in silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of coherent emitters into low-loss photonic circuits is a key technology for quantum networking. In this context, nanophotonic silicon devices implanted with erbium are a promising hardware platform that combines advanced wafer-scale nanofabrication technology with coherent emission in the minimal-loss band of optical fibers. Recent studies have reported two distinct sites in the silicon lattice in which erbium can be reproducibly integrated with particularly promising properties. Here, for an in-depth analysis of these sites, resonant fluorescence spectroscopy is performed on a nanophotonic waveguide in magnetic fields applied along different orientations. In this way, the site symmetry is determined, the spin Hamiltonian is reconstructed and a partial fit of the crystal field Hamiltonian is performed. The obtained quantitative description of the magnetic interaction allows the optimization of Zeeman splittings, optical branching ratios or microwave driving to the needs of future experiments. Beyond that, the derived site symmetry constrains the location of the erbium dopant in the silicon unit cell. This is a key step towards a detailed microscopic understanding of the erbium sites, which may help to improve the integration yield, thus paving the way to efficient nanophotonic quantum memories based on the Er:Si platform.</description>

      <title>Symmetry constraints on topological invariants and irreducible band representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16658v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: EBR is considered the building block in TQC and fundamental concept in SI methods. One of the hypophysis is that a fully occupied EBR has zero Berry-Wilczek-Zee phase and those occupied corresponds to trivial topology. Associated with it are the concepts of atomic limit and equivalence between BRs. In this manuscript, an explicit link between the BWZ phase of connected bands and that of its EBR or irreducible band representation (IBR) basis is established. When gapped system occurs under the TB model, the relation between the BWZ phase of a set of connected bands and its BR basis only persist if the later are IBRs. Thus the BWZ phase can be evaluated in terms of the IBRs. Equivalent segments of path integral of BWZ connection with respect to IBRs are established as representation of the space group and selection rule for corresponding BWZ phase established where possible. The occurrence of IBRs is rooted in real space symmetry but dependent on dynamic interaction and band topology. Three gapped systems in honeycomb lattices are discussed. Two spin-less cases are shown to be topologically trivial, whereas the selection rule cannot be developed for the spin-full pz orbital as in graphene. Two necessary conditions for topologically trivial phase are established, namely 1.Connected bands having the same closed set of IBR basis for all k and, 2.The reduced tensor element for the path integral of BWZ connection for such basis is symmetry forbidden due to contractable close loop having zero BWZ phase. Thus the IBRs are the building block of topologically trivial phase and symmetry constraint on BWZ phase are obtained through IBRs and selection rules via Wigner-Eckart theorem. Some examples demonstrate that the basic hypothesis of SI method is false. The analysis here advocate a paradigm shift from EBR to IBR as building block of topologically trivial phase.</description>
