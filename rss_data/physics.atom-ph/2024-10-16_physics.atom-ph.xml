      <title>Graspg -- An extension to Grasp2018 based on Configuration State Function Generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Graspg program package is an extension of Grasp2018 [Comput. Phys. Commun. 237 (2019) 184-187] based on configuration state function generators (CSFGs). The generators keep spin-angular integrations at a minimum and reduce substantially the execution time and the memory requirements for large-scale multiconfiguration Dirac-Hartree-Fock (MCDHF) and relativistic configuration interaction (CI) atomic structure calculations. The package includes the improvements reported in [Atoms 11 (2023) 12] in terms of redesigned and efficient constructions of direct- and exchange potentials, as well as Lagrange multipliers, and additional parallelization of the diagonalization procedure. Tools have been developed for predicting configuration state functions (CSFs) that are unimportant and can be discarded for large MCDHF or CI calculations based on results from smaller calculations, thus providing efficient methods for a priori condensation. The package provides a seamless interoperability with Grasp2018. From extensive test runs and benchmarking, we have demonstrated reductions in the execution time and disk file sizes with factors of 37 and 98, respectively, for MCDHF calculations based on large orbital sets compared to corresponding Grasp2018 calculations. For CI calculations, reductions of the execution time with factors over 200 have been attained. With a sensible use of the new possibilities for a priori condensation, CI calculations with nominally hundreds of millions of CSFs can be handled.</description>

      <title>Primary quantum thermometry of mm-wave blackbody radiation via induced state transfer in Rydberg states of cold atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rydberg states of alkali atoms are highly sensitive to electromagnetic radiation in the GHz-to-THz regime because their transitions have large electric dipole moments. Consequently, environmental blackbody radiation (BBR) can couple Rydberg states together at $\mu$s timescales. Here, we track the BBR-induced transfer of a prepared Rydberg state to its neighbors and use the evolution of these state populations to characterize the BBR field at the relevant wavelengths, primarily at 130 GHz. We use selective field ionization readout of Rydberg states with principal quantum number $n\sim30$ in $^{85}$Rb and substantiate our ionization signal with a theoretical model. With this detection method, we measure the associated blackbody-radiation-induced time dynamics of these states, reproduce the results with a simple semi-classical population transfer model, and demonstrate that this measurement is temperature sensitive with a statistical sensitivity to the fractional temperature uncertainty of 0.09 Hz$^{-1/2}$, corresponding to 26 K$\cdot$Hz$^{-1/2}$ at room temperature. This represents a calibration-free SI-traceable temperature measurement, for which we calculate a systematic fractional temperature uncertainty of 0.006, corresponding to 2 K at room temperature when used as a primary temperature standard.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Polariton Dynamics in a Multimode Cavity: Noise-enhanced Ballistic Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advances in optical measurements enable precise tracking of cavity polariton dynamics with exceptional spatiotemporal resolution. Building on these developments, we present a comprehensive theoretical analysis of wave packet dynamics in a noisy emitter lattice embedded in a multi-mode microcavity. We uncover a series of dynamic phenomena in both the noise-free and noisy cases: (i) In the noise-free case, the emitters' probability density splits into two Gaussians whose group velocities are defined by the lower and upper polariton branches. (ii) Noise induces dephasing and leads to multiple dynamical stages with different time scales spanning several orders of magnitude. These stages include, in order of increasing duration: underdamped Rabi oscillations; damping of the center of mass velocity of the emitters' probability density; population thermalization; and the transition from the ballistic to the diffusive regimes of the probability density spreading. (iii) Most strikingly, dephasing enhances the ballistic spreading, which persists for several orders of magnitude longer than it does without a cavity. Some of our predictions align with recent experimental observations, while others can be tested in existing platforms. Understanding wave packet dynamics across multiple time scales in the presence of noise is crucial for optimizing polaritonic devices. This study paves the way for future experiments focused on light-matter interactions in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Cavity-Enhanced High-order Harmonic Generation for High-Performance Time-resolved Photoemission Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in high repetition-rate extreme ultraviolet (XUV) light sources and photoelectron analyzers have led to dramatic advances in the performance of time-resolved photoemission experiments. In this perspective article, we discuss the application of cavity-enhanced high-order harmonic generation (CE-HHG), with repetition rates exceeding 10 MHz, to photoemission experiments using advanced endstations incorporating time-of-flight photoelectron analyzers. We discuss recent results, perspective on future areas for further technological improvement, and the wide array of science enabled by ultrafast XUV photoemission experiments, now in a qualitatively new regime.</description>

      <title>Measurement-Induced Heating of Trapped Ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09327v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We experimentally study the heating of trapped atomic ions during measurement of their internal qubit states. During measurement, ions are projected into one of two basis states and discriminated by their state-dependent fluorescence. We observe that ions in the fluorescing state rapidly scatter photons and heat at a rate of \mbox{$\dot{\bar{n}}\gtrsim 2\times 10^4$ quanta/s}, which is orders of magnitude faster than typical anomalous ion heating rates. We introduce a quantum trajectory-based framework that accurately reproduces the experimental results and provides a unified description of ion heating for both continuous and discrete sources.</description>

      <title>Transition of dimuonium through foil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04460v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article presents a study of the passage of dimuonium through the foil of ordinary matter. First, we provide an overview of how dimuonium is planned to be produced for such a type of experiment and how it is expected to interact with the ordinary atoms -- predominantly electromagnetically via the screened coulomb potential of the atomic nuclei. Then, we describe the transport equations that represent the evolution of dimuonium states during the passage and their solution methods. Finally, for three different foils (Beryllium, Aluminium and Lead), we present the results of this study. To estimate impact of uncertainties in the potential of a target atom, we study 15 different approximations of the atomic potential and show that the corresponding atomic-potential-model-dependent error in the yields of the low lying states of dimuonium is quite small within the framework of the applied Born approximation. The convergence of the results after truncation of the infinite system of transport equations to the finite number of quantum states of dimuonium is also studied, and good convergence for the yields of low-lying states is demonstrated.</description>
