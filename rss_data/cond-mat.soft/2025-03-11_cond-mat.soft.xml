      <title>Revealing Actual Viscoelastic Relaxation Times in Capillary Breakup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use experiments and theory to elucidate the size effect in capillary breakup rheometry, where pre-stretching in the visco-capillary stage causes the apparent relaxation time to be consistently smaller than the actual value. We propose a method accounting for both the experimental size and the finite extensibility of polymers to extract the actual relaxation time. A phase diagram characterizes the expected measurement variability and delineates scaling law conditions. The results refine capillary breakup rheometry for viscoelastic fluids and advance the understanding of breakup dynamics across scales.</description>

      <title>Modeling dynamic impact, shock waves, and injury in liver tissue with a constrained mixture theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A nonlinear continuum theory is advanced for high-rate mechanics and thermodynamics of liver parenchyma. The homogenized continuum is idealized as a solid-fluid mixture of dense viscoelastic tissue and liquid blood. The solid consists of a matrix material comprising the liver lobules and a collagenous fiber network. Under high loading rates pertinent to impact and blast, the velocity difference between solid and fluid is assumed negligible, leading to a constrained mixture theory. The model captures nonlinear isotropic elasticity, viscoelasticity, temperature changes from thermoelasticity and dissipation, and tissue damage, the latter via a scale-free phase-field representation. Effects of blood volume and initial constituent pressures are included. The model is implemented in 3-D finite element software. Analytical and numerical solutions for planar shock loading are compared with observations of liver trauma from shock-tube experiments. Finite-element simulations of dynamic impact are compared with cylinder drop-weight experiments. Model results, including matrix damage exceeding fiber damage at high rates and reduced mechanical stiffness with higher perfused blood volume, agree with experimental trends. Viscoelasticity is important at modest impact speeds.</description>

      <title>Geometrically Templated Dynamic Wrinkling from Suspended Poly(vinyl alcohol) Soap Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wrinkling is commonly observed as mechanical instability when a stiff thin film bound on a compliant thick substrate undergoes in-plane compression exceeding a threshold. Despite significant efforts to create a broad range of surface patterns via wrinkling, little has been studied about a dynamic and transient wrinkling process, where a suspended polymer thin film undergoes liquid-to-solid phase transitions. Here, a spontaneous wrinkling process is reported, when drying poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) soap films suspended on 3D printed wireframes with near zero or negative Gaussian curvatures. As water evaporates, a thickness gradient across the sample is developed, leading to non-uniform drying rates, and a concentration gradient between the inner and outer sides (exposed to air) of the suspended PVA soap film induces a differential osmotic pressure. Together, these effects contribute to an in-plane compressive stress, leading to the formation of surface wrinkles, whose growth is guided by the geometry of the frame. Importantly, the wrinkles evolve dynamically: the wavelength and number of the wrinkles can be tuned by altering the concentration of the PVA aqueous solutions, the initial mass, the relative humidity of the drying environment; the patterns of the resulting wrinkles can be programmed by the geometry of the wireframe.</description>

      <title>Driven Polymer Translocation through a Nanopore from a Confining Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the dynamics of pore-driven polymer translocation through a nanopore to semi-infinite space when the chain is initially confined and equilibrated in a narrow channel. To this end, we use Langevin dynamics (LD) simulations and iso-flux tension propagation (IFTP) theory to characterize local and global dynamics of the translocating chain. The dynamics of the process can be described by the IFTP theory in very good agreement with the LD simulations for all values of confinement in the channel. The theory reveals that for channels with size comparable to or less than the end-to-end distance of the unconfined chain, in which the blob theory works, the scaling form of the translocation time depends on both the chain contour length as well as the channel width. %originating from the confinement of the spatial fluctuations of the chain inside the channel. Conversely, for a very narrow channel the translocation time only depends on the chain contour length and is similar to that of a rod due to the absence of spatial chain fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Reflection of Phase Anisotropy on Molecule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores how molecular shape changes influence the phase behavior of liquid crystals, particularly the nematic (N) phase of 5CB, through all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The results demonstrate that molecular shape anisotropy increases in the N phase, with molecules adopting more elongated conformations as aggregation occurs. We find that the shape distribution is temperature- and aggregation-dependent, and the molecular shape relaxation time is longer in the N phase compared to isolated molecules. Additionally, the study proposes a revision to Onsager and Maier-Saupe theories, considering molecular shape distribution changes, which could improve the explanation of the N-I phase transition in liquid crystals. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the molecular behavior in liquid crystalline phases.</description>

      <title>Don't look back: Ordering and defect cloaking in non-reciprocal lattice XY models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed analytical and numerical examination, on square and triangular lattices, of the non-reciprocal planar spin model introduced in Dadhichi et al., Phys. Rev. E 101, 052601 (2020). We show that in principle the effect of lattice anisotropy should persist at large scales, leading to a ''mass'' for the angle field of the spins, and behaviour not in the ''Malthusian Toner-Tu'' universality class. Numerically, however, we find power-law scaling of long-wavelength equal-time correlators in the polar-ordered phase of our lattice model. The mass, if present, is very small. Focussing on topological defects, we show numerically that defect interactions are highly anisotropic with respect to the mean ordering direction. In particular, the constituents of a $\pm 1$ pair are shielded from each other in a class of configurations, deferring their annihilation and allowing time for the nucleation of further defects. The result, we show numerically, is the destruction of the polarised phase via an aster apocalypse reminiscent of that found by Besse et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 268003 (2022), for the Malthusian Toner-Tu equation.</description>

      <title>High temperature 1H DOSY NMR reveals sourdough fermentation of wheat flour alters the molecular structure of water-extractable arabinoxylans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Arabinoxylans are constituents of wheat flour that contribute to the dietary fiber properties of wheat. They exist in water-extractable and water-unextractable forms and contribute to human health. In bakery technology, especially the water-extractable arabinoxylans (WE-AX) are important due to their impact on viscosity and dough rheology. This study provides insights into the impact of wheat flour fermentation on WE-AX during sourdough production, offering potential applications for improving sourdough bread quality and its health benefits. The production of sourdoughs is known to increase the WE-AX fraction, yet the underlying (bio)chemical mechanisms remain unclear. This study investigated the alteration of WE-AX during the fermentation of wheat flour for sourdough production using 1H Diffusion Ordered SpectroscopY (DOSY) Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) at elevated temperature to analyze the structural changes of WE-AX during wheat flour fermentation for sourdough production with different lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains. The results confirmed that DOSY NMR at elevated temperatures greatly improved the applicability of the method for analyzing larger biomolecules. Overall, a size reduction of the WE-AX compounds with increasing fermentation time was found. This was indicated both by the occurrence of higher self-diffusion coefficients, and increased transverse relaxation times. Further research is necessary to explain deviations from the general trend.</description>

      <title>Photometric Decision-Making During the Dawn Choruses of Cicadas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first quantitative study of the onset of dawn choruses of cicadas in several natural habitats. A time-frequency analysis of the acoustical signals is used to define an order parameter for the development of collective singing. The ensemble of recordings reveals that the chorus onset times accurately track the changing sunrise times over the course of many weeks, occurring within civil twilight at a solar elevation of -$3.8^\circ \pm 0.2^\circ$. Despite day-to-day variations in the amplitude of fully developed choruses, the order parameter data collapse to a common sigmoidal curve when scaled by those amplitudes and shifted by the onset time, revealing a characteristic rise time of ~60 s for a chorus to reach saturation amplitude. The results are used to obtain the cumulative distribution function of singing as a function of ground illumination, from which is obtained a generalized susceptibility which exhibits a narrow peak with a half-width of $\sim\! 12\%$. The variance of the order parameter exhibits a similar peak, suggesting that a generalized fluctuation-dissipation theorem holds for this system. A model of decision-making under ramps of a control parameter is developed and can achieve a quantitative match to the data. It suggest that sharpness of the susceptibility peak reflects cooperative decision-making arising from acoustic communication.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic nuclear analogs with active wave-particle clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active particles are non-equilibrium entities that uptake energy and convert it into self-propulsion. A dynamically rich class of active particles having features of wave-particle coupling and memory are walking/superwalking droplets. Such classical, active wave-particle entities (WPEs) have been shown to exhibit hydrodynamic analogs of many single-particle quantum systems. We numerically investigate the dynamics of several WPEs and find that they self-organize into a bound cluster, akin to a nucleus. This active cluster exhibits various modes of collective excitations as the memory of the system is increased. Dynamically distinct excitation modes create a common time-averaged collective potential indicating an analogy with the bag model of a nucleus. At high memory, the active cluster can destabilize and eject WPEs whose decay statistics follow exponential laws analogous to radioactive nuclear decay. Hydrodynamic nuclear analogs open up new directions to pursue, both experimentally and numerically, within the nascent field of hydrodynamic quantum analogs.</description>

      <title>Molecular Weight-Dependent Evaporation Dynamics and Morphology of PEG Sessile Drops on Hydrophobic Substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evaporation dynamics of sessile drops are crucial for material deposition in applications like inkjet printing and pharmaceutical development. However, the evaporation behavior of high molecular weight polymer solutions and their impact on deposit morphology and flow fields are not well understood. This study investigates the evaporation dynamics and deposit morphology of polyethylene glycol (PEG) solution drops on hydrophobic substrates, with molecular weights ranging from 200 to 1000k g/mol, covering five orders of magnitude. The results show that vapor diffusion dominates the evaporation process across all PEG molecular weights. Using image analysis and micro-particle image velocimetry ($\mu$-PIV), we reveal that molecular weight affects contact line dynamics and internal flow, leading to diverse deposit morphologies, including spherical caps, pillars, pool-shaped disks, and flat disks. Transient divergence and P\'eclet number calculations further confirm the role of hydrodynamics in deposit formation. These findings provide insights into the hydrodynamic and thermodynamic factors governing evaporation in polymeric sessile drops, with implications for material fabrication and the development of inkjet printing and coating techniques.</description>

      <title>Freedericskz Transitions in the Nematic and Smectic ZA Phases of DIO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The remarkable material DIO presents fascinating behaviors. It has been extensively studied as one of the first materials exhibiting a ferroelectric nematic phase. However, at higher temperatures it exhibits what has been termed the Smectic ZA: identified as an orientationally ordered, antiferroelectric phase with a density modulation in direction perpendicular to the optic axis. At even higher temperatures, this transitions to an apparently normal nematic phase. We have studied the splay-bend Freedericksz transition in the nematic and SmZA phases of the material DIO. Both the magnetic and electric field transitions were utilized. We observed the transitions by measuring effective birefringence and capacitance as well as with polarizing light microscopy. In both the nematic and the SmZA states the field induced transitions resemble (in numerous aspects) the classical Freedericksz transition. These enable determinations of several fundamental material parameters and also reveal intriguing aspects of the SmZA phase, including the surprising behavior of the elastic constants and the dielectric anisotropy. Detailed comparison with Frank elastic theory of the Freedericksz transition shows that the N phase behaves largely as expected, but the transition in the SmZA phase differs significantly. Two specific examples of this are the onset of striations in the Freedericksz distorted state, and the presence of optical biaxiality. The former may be related to the periodic Freedericksz transition as it coincides with a large increase in the splay elastic constant. The latter has been predicted for the SmZA phase, but not previously observed.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Theory of Nonlinear Rheology and Double Yielding in Dense Attractive Glass Forming Colloidal Suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Yielding of amorphous glasses and gels is a mechanically driven transformation of a material from the solid to liquid state on the experimental timescale. It is a ubiquitous fundamental problem of nonequilibrium physics of high importance in material science, biology, and engineering applications such as processing, ink printing, and manufacturing. However, the underlying microscopic mechanisms and degree of universality of the yielding problem remain theoretically poorly understood. We address this problem for dense Brownian suspensions of nanoparticles or colloids that interact via repulsions that induce steric caging and tunable short range attractions that drive physical bond formation. In the absence of deformation, these competing forces can result in fluids, repulsive glasses, attractive glasses, and dense gels of widely varying elastic rigidity and viscosity. Building on a quiescent microscopic theoretical approach that explicitly treats attractive bonding and thermally-induced activated hopping, we formulate a self-consistent theory for the coupled evolution of the transient and steady state mechanical response, and structure as a function of stress, strain, and deformation rate over a wide range of high packing fractions and attraction strengths and ranges. Depending on the latter variables, under step rate shear the theory predicts three qualitatively different transient responses: plastic-like (of two distinct types), static yielding via a single elastic-viscous stress overshoot, and double or 2-step yielding due to an intricate competition between deformation-induced bond breaking and de-caging. A predictive understanding of multiple puzzling experimental observations is achieved, and the approach can be extended to other nonlinear rheological protocols and soft matter systems.</description>

      <title>Finite deformations induce friction hysteresis in normal wavy contacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since Hertz's pioneering work in 1882, contact mechanics traditionally grounds on linear elasticity, assuming small strains and displacements. However, recent experiments clearly highlighted linear elasticity limitations in accurately predicting the contact behaviour of rubbers and elastomers, particularly during frictional slip, which is governed by geometric and material nonlinearity. In this study, we investigate the basic scenario involving normal approach-retraction contact cycles between a wavy rigid indenter and a flat, deformable substrate. Both frictionless and frictional interfacial conditions are examined, considering finite strains, displacements, and nonlinear rheology. We developed a finite element model for this purpose and compared our numerical results with Westergaard's linear theory. Our findings show that, even in frictionless conditions, the contact response is significantly influenced by geometric and material nonlinearity, particularly for wavy indenters with high aspect ratios, where normal-tangential stresses and displacements coupling emerges. More importantly, interfacial friction in nonlinear elasticity leads to contact hysteresis (i.e., frictional energy dissipation) during normal loading-unloading cycles. This behavior cannot be explained in a linear framework; therefore, most of the experiments reporting hysteresis are typically explained invoking other interfacial phenomena (e.g., adhesion, plasticity, or viscoelasticity). Here we present an additional suitable explanation relying on finite strains/displacements with detailed peculiarities, such as vanishing pull-off force. Moreover, we also report an increase of hysteretic losses as for confined systems, stemming from the enhanced normal-tangential nonlinear coupling.</description>

      <title>Three-phase equilibria of CO$_2$ hydrate from computer simulation in presence of NaCl</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the cryoscopic decrease effect, as a function of the NaCl concentration, on the carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) hydrate dissociation line conditions has been determined through molecular dynamic simulations. In particular, we have determined the three-phase (solid hydrate-aqueous phase-liquid CO$_2$) coexistence temperature at 100, 400, and 1000 at several initial NaCl concentrations in the aqueous phase, from 0.0 to $3.0\,\text{m}$, using the direct-coexistence technique. We have used the well-known TIP4P/2005 and TraPPE force fields for water and CO$_2$ molecules, respectively. Also, the water-salt interactions are described using the Madrid-2019 force field, which has been specifically developed for various salts in combination with the TIP4P/2005 water model. According to the results obtained in this work, the dissociation temperature of the CO$_2$ hydrate decreases when the NaCl concentration in the initial aqueous phase increases. The results obtained are in excellent agreement with experimental data reported in the literature. We have also observed how the dynamic of melting and growth of the CO$_2$ hydrate becomes slower when the NaCl concentration is increased. As a consequence, larger simulation times (in the order of dozens of microseconds) are necessary when the NaCl concentration increases. Finally, we have also analyzed finite-size effects on the three-phase coexistence temperature of these systems by performing simulations, at 400 bar, with two different system sizes at two different NaCl concentrations (0.0 and $3.0\,\text{m}$). Non-negligible deviations have been found between the results obtained from both system sizes.</description>

      <title>Phase Diagram of the Non-Reciprocal Cahn-Hilliard Model and the Effects of Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interactions between active particles may be non-reciprocal, breaking action-reaction symmetry and leading to novel physics not seen in equilibrium systems. In this work, we study the phase diagram for the non-reciprocal Cahn-Hilliard (NRCH) model with different types of symmetry -- discrete and continuous -- and examine the effects of non-reciprocity on phase separation. The models are analyzed by drawing the full linear stability diagrams, indicating the onset of phase separation, allowing us to demonstrate how non-reciprocity gives rise to out-of-equilibrium steady states with non-zero currents. These observations are robust to noise and valid in a large part of parameter space. By describing the effects of symmetry on conserved, non-reciprocal models, this work adds to our understanding of the rich phase-behavior of such models.</description>

      <title>Scaling laws of shrinkage induced fragmentation phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the shrinkage induced breakup of thin layers of heterogeneous materials attached to a substrate, a ubiquitous natural phenomenon with a wide range of potential applications. Focusing on the evolution of the fragment ensemble, we demonstrate that the system has two distinct phases: damage phase, where the layer is cracked, however, a dominant piece persists retaining the structural integrity of the layer, and a fragmentation phase, where the layer disintegrates into numerous small pieces. Based on finite size scaling we show that the transition between the two phases occurs at a critical damage analogous to continuous phase transitions. At the critical point a fully connected crack network emerges whose structure is controlled by the strength of adhesion to the substrate. In the strong adhesion limit, damage arises from random microcrack nucleation, resembling bond percolation, while weak adhesion facilitates stress concentration and the growth of cracks to large extensions. The critical exponents of the damage to fragmentation transition agree to a reasonable accuracy with those of the two-dimensional Ising model. Our findings provide a novel insights into the mechanism of shrinkage-induced cracking revealing generic scaling laws of the phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Cell mechanics, environmental geometry, and cell polarity control cell-cell collision outcomes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interactions between crawling cells, which are essential for many biological processes, can be quantified by measuring cell-cell collisions. Conventionally, experiments of cell-cell collisions are conducted on two-dimensional flat substrates, where colliding cells repolarize and move away upon contact with one another in "contact inhibition of locomotion" (CIL). Inspired by recent experiments that show cells on suspended nanofibers have qualitatively different CIL behaviors than those on flat substrates, we develop a phase field model of cell motility and two-cell collisions in fiber geometries. Our model includes cell-cell and cell-fiber adhesion, and a simple positive feedback mechanism of cell polarity. We focus on cell collisions on two parallel fibers, finding that larger cell deformability (lower membrane tension), larger positive feedback of polarization, and larger fiber spacing promote more occurrences of cells walking past one another. We can capture this behavior using a simple linear stability analysis on the cell-cell interface upon collision.</description>

      <title>Efficient single-precision simulations of nematohydrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulations of nematohydrodynamics on graphics processing units (GPUs) are typically performed using double precision, which ensures accuracy but significantly increases computational cost. However, consumer-grade GPUs are optimized for single-precision calculations, making double-precision simulations inefficient on widely available hardware. In this work, we demonstrate that single-precision simulations can achieve the same accuracy as double-precision methods while delivering a 27-fold increase in computational speed. To achieve this, we introduce two key improvements: (i) the shifted distribution function in the lattice Boltzmann method, which mitigates precision loss at low velocities, and (ii) the use of larger time steps in the finite-difference solver, which reduces numerical errors and improves overall accuracy. We find that, unlike in double precision, accuracy in single-precision simulations follows a non-monotonic trend with respect to the finite-difference time step, revealing an optimal regime for precise computations. To illustrate the effectiveness of our approach, we simulate the dynamics of single and multiple skyrmionic tubes in Poiseuille flow. Our results confirm that optimized single-precision simulations enable fast and accurate modeling of complex nematohydrodynamic systems, making large-scale simulations feasible on standard gaming GPUs.</description>

Abstract: Mammalian cell polarization and motility are important processes involved in many physiological and pathological phenomena, such as embryonic development, wound healing, and cancer metastasis. The traditional view of mammalian cell motility suggests that molecular motors, adhesion, and cell deformation are all necessary components for mammalian cell movement. However, experiments on immune system cells have shown that the inhibition of molecular motors does not significantly affect cell motility. We present a new theory and simulations demonstrating that actin polymerization alone is sufficient to induce spontaneously cell polarity accompanied by the retrograde flow. These findings provide a new understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of cell movement and at the same time provide a simple mechanism for cell motility in diverse configurations, e.g. on an adherent substrate, in a non-adherent matrix, or in liquids.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics of thermal active matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active matter concerns many-body systems comprised of living or self-driven agents that collectively exhibit macroscopic phenomena distinct from conventional passive matter. Using Schwinger-Keldysh effective field theory, we develop a novel hydrodynamic framework for thermal active matter that accounts for energy balance, local temperature variations, and the ensuing stochastic effects. By modelling active matter as a driven open system, we show that the source of active contributions to hydrodynamics, violations of fluctuation-dissipation theorems, and detailed balance is rooted in the breaking of time-translation symmetry due to the presence of fuel consumption and an external environmental bath. In addition, our framework allows for non-equilibrium steady states that produce entropy, with a well-defined notion of steady-state temperature. We use our framework of active hydrodynamics to develop effective field theory actions for active superfluids and active nematics that offer a first-principle derivation of various active transport coefficients and feature activity-induced phase transitions. We also show how to incorporate temperature, energy and noise in fluctuating hydrodynamics for active matter. Our work suggests a broader perspective on active matter that can leave an imprint across scales.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the question of what instantaneous normal modes tell us about liquid dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The lack of a well-defined equilibrium reference configuration has long hindered a comprehensive atomic-level understanding of liquid dynamics and properties. The Instantaneous Normal Mode (INM) approach, which involves diagonalizing the Hessian matrix of potential energy in instantaneous liquid configurations, has emerged as a promising framework in this direction. However, several conceptual challenges remain, particularly related to the approach's inability to capture anharmonic effects. In this study, we present a set of "experimental facts" through a comprehensive INM analysis of simulated systems, including Ar, Xe, N$_2$, CS$_2$, Ga, and Pb, across a wide temperature range from the solid to gas phase. First, we examine the INM density of states (DOS) and compare it to the DOS obtained from the velocity auto-correlation function. We then analyze the temperature dependence of the fraction of unstable modes and the low-frequency slope of the INM DOS in search of potential universal behaviors. Furthermore, we explore the relationship between INMs and other properties of liquids, including the liquid-like to gas-like dynamical crossover and the momentum gap of collective shear waves. In addition, we investigate the INM spectrum at low temperatures as the system approaches the solid phase, revealing a significant fraction of unstable modes even in crystalline solids. Finally, we confirm the existence of a recently discussed cusp-like singularity in the INM eigenvalue spectrum and uncover its complex temperature-dependent behavior, challenging current theoretical models.</description>

      <title>Turbulence to order transitions in activity patterned active nematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15479v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We numerically study two-dimensional active nematics with periodic activity patterning. For stripes of activity, we observe a transition from two-dimensional to one-dimensional active turbulence as the maximum active force and distance between activity stripes increases, followed by a transition to stable vortices ordered antiferromagnetically along the stripes and ferromagnetically transverse to the stripes. By comparing to a triangular lattice of activity circles, we find that transitions to two-dimensional active turbulence emerge from interplays between the active length scale and activity density, independent of the patterning geometry. The vortex ordering, on the other hand, is highly sensitive to patterning geometry, which we show by comparing the activity stripes to columns of activity circles, where the vortex ordering is lost. Our results provide a mechanism for inducing non-equilibrium phase transitions in active nematics using activity inhomogeneity, which can be further exploited to create activity patterned ordered phases.</description>

      <title>Smart navigation through a rotating barrier: Deep reinforcement learning with application to size-based separation of active microagents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ deep reinforcement learning methods to investigate shortest-time navigation strategies for smart active Brownian particles (microagents), which self-propel through a rotating potential barrier in a static, viscous, fluid background. The microagent's motion begins at a specified origin and terminates at a designated destination. The potential barrier is modeled as a localized, repulsive Gaussian potential with finite support, whose peak location rotates at a given angular velocity about a fixed center within the plane of motion. We use the Advantage Actor-Critic approach to train microagents for their origin-to-destination navigation through the barrier. By employing this approach, we demonstrate that the rotating potential (as opposed to a static one) enables size-based sorting and separation of the microagents. In other words, microagents of different radii arrive at the destination at sufficiently well-separated average times, facilitating their sorting. The efficiency of particle sorting is quantified by introducing specific separation measures. We also demonstrate how training the microagents in a noisy background, as opposed to a noise-free one, can improve the precision of their size-based sorting. Our findings suggest promising avenues for future research on smart active particles equipped with deep reinforcement learning to navigate complex environments, particularly in microscale applications.</description>

      <title>Self-diffusive dynamics of active Brownian particles at moderate densities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01251v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Active Brownian Particle (ABP) model has become a prototype of self-propelled particles. ABPs move persistently at a constant speed $V$ along a direction that changes slowly by rotational diffusion, characterized by a coefficient $\Dr$. Persistent motion plus random reorientations generate a random walk at long times with a diffusion coefficient that, for isolated ABPs in two dimensions, is given by $D_0=V^2/(2\Dr)$. Here we study the density effects on the self-diffusive dynamics using a recently proposed kinetic theory for ABPs, in which persistent collisions are described as producing a net displacement on the particles. On intermediate timescales, where many collisions have taken place but the director of the tracer particle has not yet changed, it is possible to solve the Lorentz kinetic equation for a tracer particle. It turns out that, as a result of collisions, the tracer follows an effective stochastic dynamics, characterized by an effective reduced streaming velocity $V_\text{eff}$ and anisotropic diffusion, with coefficients explicitly depending on the density. Based on this result, an effective theoretical and numerical approach is proposed in which the particles in a bath follow stochastic dynamics with mean-field interactions based on the local density. Finally, on time scales larger than $\Dr^{-1}$, studying the van Hove function at small wavevectors, it is shown that the tracer particle presents an effective diffusive motion with a coefficient $D=V_\text{eff}^2/(2\Dr)$. The dependence of $V_\text{eff}$ on the density indicates that the kinetic theory is limited to area fractions smaller than 0.42, and beyond this limit unphysical results appear.</description>

      <title>Effect of particle and substrate wettability on evaporation-driven assembly of colloidal monolayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Assembled monolayers of colloidal particles are crucial for various applications, including opto-electronics, surface engineering, as well as light harvesting, and catalysis. A common approach for self-assembly is the drying of a colloidal suspension film on a solid substrate using technologies such as printing and coating. However, this approach often presents challenges such as low surface coverage, stacking faults, and the formation of multiple layers. We numerically investigate the influence of substrate and particle wettability on the deposited pattern. Higher substrate wettability results in a monolayer with a hexagonal arrangement of deposited particles on the substrate. Conversely, lower substrate wettability leads to droplet formation after the film ruptures, leading to the formation of particle clusters. Furthermore, we reveal that higher particle wettability can mitigate the impact of the substrate wettability and facilitate the formation of highly ordered monolayers. We propose theoretical models predicting the surface coverage fraction dependent on particle volume fraction, initial film thickness, particle radius, as well as substrate and particle wettability, and validate these models with simulations. Our findings provide valuable insights for optimizing the deposition process in the creation of assembled monolayers of colloidal particles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08835v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we examine the relative knotting probabilities in a lattice model of ring polymers confined in a cavity. The model is of a lattice knot of size $n$ in the cubic lattice, confined to a cube of side-length $L$ and with volume $V=(L{+}1)^3$ sites. We use Monte Carlo algorithms to approximately enumerate the number of conformations of lattice knots in the confining cube. If $p_{n,L}(K)$ is the number of conformations of a lattice polygon of length $n$ and knot type $K$ in a cube of volume $L^3$, then the relative knotting probability of a lattice polygon to have knot type $K$, relative to the probability that the polygon is the unknot (the trivial knot, denoted by $0_1$), is $\rho_{n,L}(K/0_1) = p_{n,L}(K)/p_{n,L}(0_1)$. We determine $\rho_{n,L}(K/0_1)$ for various knot types $K$ up to six crossing knots. Our data show that these relative knotting probabilities are small so that the model is dominated by lattice polygons of knot type the unknot. Moreover, if the concentration of the monomers of the lattice knot is $\varphi = n/V$, then the relative knot probability increases with $\varphi$ along a curve that flattens off as the Hamiltonian state is approached.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01257v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Drawing inspiration from the motility behaviour of microorganisms, we introduce a highly tunable, robotic system self-actuating into the run-and-tumble (RT)-like motion. It comprises two disk-shaped, centimeter-scale programmable robots individually programmed to perform overdamped active Brownian (AB) motion and connected by a rigid rod. The rod is attached to pivot points located on off-centered, mirror-symmetric points on each robot, allowing for its free rotation at both ends. We show that the collective dynamics of this system execute RT-like motion with characteristic sharp tumble events and exponentially distributed run times, similar to those observed in microorganisms. We further quantify emerging dynamics in terms of tumbling frequency and tune it over a wide range of experimental parameters. We also develop a theoretical model that reproduces our experimental results and elucidates the underlying physical mechanisms governing the rich phase behavior of RT motion. Together, these results highlight the importance of our robotic platform in offering valuable insights into the mechanism of motility characteristics in microorganisms.</description>

      <title>Propelling Ferrimagnetic Domain Walls by Dynamical Frustration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14320v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many-particle systems driven out of thermal equilibrium can show properties qualitatively different from any thermal state. Here, we study a ferrimagnet in a weak oscillating magnetic field. In this model, domain walls are not static, but are shown to move actively in a direction chosen by spontaneous symmetry breaking. Thus they act like self-propelling units. Their collective behaviour is reminiscent of other systems with actively moving units studied in the field of 'active matter', where, e.g., flocks of birds are investigated. The active motion of the domain walls emerges from 'dynamical frustration'. The antiferromagnetic xy-order rotates clockwise or anticlockwise, determined by the sign of the ferromagnetic component. This necessarily leads to frustration at a domain wall, which gets resolved by propelling the domain wall with a velocity proportional to the square root of the driving power across large parameter regimes. This motion and strong hydrodynamic interactions lead to a linear growth of the magnetic correlation length over time, much faster than in equilibrium. The dynamical frustration furthermore makes the system highly resilient to noise. The correlation length of the weakly driven one-dimensional system can be orders of magnitude larger than in the corresponding equilibrium system with the same noise level.</description>

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials display nanoscale dynamic ripples that significantly impact their properties. Defects within the crystal lattice are the elementary building blocks to tailor the material's morphology. While some studies have explored the link between defective structures and rippling dynamics in 2D materials, a comprehensive understanding of this relationship has yet to be achieved. Here, we address this using machine learning-driven molecular dynamics simulations. Specifically, we find that above a critical concentration of defects, free-standing graphene sheets undergo a dynamic transition from freely propagating to static ripples. Our computational approach captures the dynamics with atomic resolution, and reveals that the transition is driven by elastic interactions between defects. The strength of these interactions is found to vary across defect types and we identify a unifying set of principles driving the dynamic-to-static transition in 2D materials. Our work not only rationalises puzzling experimental results for defective 2D materials, but also paves the way to design two-dimensional devices with tailored rippling dynamics. These insights could lay the foundations for a new class of disorder-based catalytic and interfacial materials.</description>

      <title>Gyromorphs: a new class of functional disordered materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09023v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of functional correlated disordered materials, termed Gyromorphs, which uniquely combine liquid-like translational disorder with quasi-long-range rotational order, induced by a ring of $G$ delta peaks in their structure factor. We generate gyromorphs in $2d$ and $3d$ by spectral optimization methods, verifying that they display strong discrete rotational order but no long-range translational order, while maintaining rotational isotropy at short range for sufficiently large $G$. We show that they are distinct from quasicrystals, which we argue are akin to Fourier ''duals'' of gyromorphs. Using a coupled dipoles approximation, we show that these structures outperform quasicrystals, stealthy hyperuniformity, and Vogel spirals in the formation of low-index-contrast isotropic bandgaps in $2d$, for both scalar and vector waves, and open complete isotropic bandgaps in $3d$. Finally, we introduce ''polygyromorphs'' with several rotational symmetries at different length scales (i.e., multiple rings of delta peaks), enabling the formation of multiple bandgaps in a single structure, thereby paving the way for fine control over optical properties.</description>
