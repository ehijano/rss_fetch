      <title>An ELIXIR scoping review on domain-specific evaluation metrics for synthetic data in life sciences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthetic data has emerged as a powerful resource in life sciences, offering solutions for data scarcity, privacy protection and accessibility constraints. By creating artificial datasets that mirror the characteristics of real data, allows researchers to develop and validate computational methods in controlled environments. Despite its promise, the adoption of synthetic data in Life Sciences hinges on rigorous evaluation metrics designed to assess their fidelity and reliability. To explore the current landscape of synthetic data evaluation metrics in several Life Sciences domains, the ELIXIR Machine Learning Focus Group performed a systematic review of the scientific literature following the PRISMA guidelines. Six critical domains were examined to identify current practices for assessing synthetic data. Findings reveal that, while generation methods are rapidly evolving, systematic evaluation is often overlooked, limiting researchers ability to compare, validate, and trust synthetic datasets across different domains. This systematic review underscores the urgent need for robust, standardized evaluation approaches that not only bolster confidence in synthetic data but also guide its effective and responsible implementation. By laying the groundwork for establishing domain-specific yet interoperable standards, this scoping review paves the way for future initiatives aimed at enhancing the role of synthetic data in scientific discovery, clinical practice and beyond.</description>

      <title>The Cell Ontology in the age of single-cell omics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10037v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Single-cell omics technologies have transformed our understanding of cellular diversity by enabling high-resolution profiling of individual cells. However, the unprecedented scale and heterogeneity of these datasets demand robust frameworks for data integration and annotation. The Cell Ontology (CL) has emerged as a pivotal resource for achieving FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data principles by providing standardized, species-agnostic terms for canonical cell types - forming a core component of a wide range of platforms and tools. In this paper, we describe the wide variety of uses of CL in these platforms and tools and detail ongoing work to improve and extend CL content including the addition of transcriptomically defined types, working closely with major atlasing efforts including the Human Cell Atlas and the Brain Initiative Cell Atlas Network to support their needs. We cover the challenges and future plans for harmonising classical and transcriptomic cell type definitions, integrating markers and using Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve content and efficiency of CL workflows.</description>
