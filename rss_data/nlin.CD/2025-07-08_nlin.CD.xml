      <title>A Novel Four-Stage Synchronized Chaotic Map: Design and Statistical Characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital implementations of chaotic systems often suffer from inherent degradation, limiting their long-term performance and statistical quality. To address this challenge, we propose a novel four-stage synchronized piecewise linear chaotic map. This new map is meticulously designed with four independent segments, each possessing its own control parameters, specifically engineered to mitigate the natural degradation observed in digitally realized dynamical systems. We characterize its behavior using established tools from nonlinear dynamics, including bifurcation diagrams and graphical analysis, which provide a comprehensive qualitative understanding of its complex dynamics. To rigorously validate the statistical features of the generated sequences, we employed the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) statistical testing suite. A substantial 100 MB dataset, comprising sequences produced by the proposed map, was generated via a Matlab script and subjected to this rigorous battery of tests. Our results demonstrate that the proposed map exhibits superior statistical properties compared to the classic Bernoulli map, successfully passing all NIST tests where the traditional map did not. This research confirms the proposed map's potential as a robust and high-quality source for chaotic sequence generation.</description>

      <title>Topological characterisation of a chaotic attractor with an additional branch generated from economic data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are insights of chaotic properties in economic systems and data. To prove the existence of chaotic dynamics, the establishment of a deterministic model is mandatory. A global modelling tool (GPoM) is used to search for mathematical models of equations from economic data: unemployment, inflation and nominal exchange rate over 30 years. A system of three differential equations is chosen as a model, whose solution is a chaotic attractor in $\mathbb{R}^3$. The model extracted from the data is not able to fit them, but it provides equations linking those multiple economic variables and reveals significant impact of exchange rate on unemployment and inflation evolution. The topological characterisation of the chaotic attractor solution exhibits an additional branch in its first return map to the Poincar\'e section. Consequences of this particular structure are analysed and interpreted economically.</description>

      <title>A Novel Approach for Estimating Positive Lyapunov Exponents in One-Dimensional Chaotic Time Series Using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and quantifying chaos in nonlinear dynamical systems remains a fundamental challenge in science and engineering. The Lyapunov exponent is a key measure of chaotic behavior, but its accurate estimation from experimental data is often hindered by methodological and computational limitations. In this work, we present a novel machine-learning-based approach for estimating the positive Lyapunov exponent (MLE) from one-dimensional time series, using the growth of out-of-sample prediction errors as a proxy for trajectory divergence. Our method demonstrates high scientific relevance, offering a robust, data-driven alternative to traditional analytic techniques. Through comprehensive testing on several canonical chaotic maps - including the logistic, sine, cubic, and Chebyshev maps - we achieved a coefficient of determination R2pos &gt; 0.9 between predicted and theoretical MLE values for time series as short as M = 200 points. The best accuracy was observed for the Chebyshev map (R2pos = 0.999). Notably, the proposed method maintains high computational efficiency and generalizes well across various machine learning algorithms. These results highlight the significance of our approach for practical chaos analysis in both synthetic and experimental settings, opening new possibilities for robust nonlinear dynamics assessment when only time series data are available.</description>

      <title>Structure analysis of the Lorenz-84 chaotic attractor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structure of the Lorenz-84 attractor is investigated in this study. Its dynamics belonging to weakly dissipative chaos, classical approaches cannot be used to analyze its structure. The color tracer mapping is introduced for this purpose and used to extract the three-dimensional structure of the attractor. The analysis shows that the attractor is a non trivial case of toroidal chaos: it is organized around a period-2 cavity. Moreover, the structure reveals a new mechanism generating chaos in the attractor: a multidirectional stretching. The attractor structure is then artificially represented on a two-dimensional branched manifold and its validation performed using a set of periodic orbits previously extracted.</description>

      <title>Topological gravity for arbitrary Dyson index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the well established duality of topological gravity to a double scaled matrix model with the Airy spectral curve to define what we refer to as topological gravity with arbitrary Dyson index $\upbeta$ ($\upbeta$ topological gravity). On the matrix model side this is an interpolation in the Dyson index between the Wigner-Dyson classes, on the gravity side it can be thought of as interpolating between orientable and unorientable manifolds in the gravitational path integral, opening up the possibility to study moduli space volumes of manifolds ``in between''. Using the perturbative loop equations we study correlation functions of this theory and prove several structural properties, having clear implications on the generalised moduli space volumes. Additionally we give a geometric interpretation of these properties using the generalisation to arbitrary Dyson index of the recently found Mirzakhani-like recursion for unorientable surfaces. Using these properties, we investigate whether $\upbeta$-topological gravity is quantum chaotic in the sense of the BGS conjecture. Along the way we answer this question for the last Wigner-Dyson class not studied in the literature, the symplectic one, and establish strong evidence for quantum chaos for this variety of the theory, and thus for all bosonic varieties of topological gravity. For the general $\upbeta$ case we also argue for the case of quantum chaoticity, based on novel constraints we find to be obeyed by genuinely non Wigner-Dyson parts of the moduli space volumes. As for the general $\upbeta$ case the universal behaviour expected from a chaotic system is not known analytically we give first steps how to obtain it, starting with the result of $\upbeta$ topological gravity and comparing then to a numerical evaluation of the universal result.</description>

      <title>Scientific Machine Learning of Chaotic Systems Discovers Governing Equations for Neural Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discovering governing equations that describe complex chaotic systems remains a fundamental challenge in physics and neuroscience. Here, we introduce the PEM-UDE method, which combines the prediction-error method with universal differential equations to extract interpretable mathematical expressions from chaotic dynamical systems, even with limited or noisy observations. This approach succeeds where traditional techniques fail by smoothing optimization landscapes and removing the chaotic properties during the fitting process without distorting optimal parameters. We demonstrate its efficacy by recovering hidden states in the Rossler system and reconstructing dynamics from noise-corrupted electrical circuit data, where the correct functional form of the dynamics is recovered even when one of the observed time series is corrupted by noise 5x the magnitude of the true signal. We demonstrate that this method is capable of recovering the correct dynamics, whereas direct symbolic regression methods, such as SINDy, fail to do so with the given amount of data and noise. Importantly, when applied to neural populations, our method derives novel governing equations that respect biological constraints such as network sparsity - a constraint necessary for cortical information processing yet not captured in next-generation neural mass models - while preserving microscale neuronal parameters. These equations predict an emergent relationship between connection density and both oscillation frequency and synchrony in neural circuits. We validate these predictions using three intracranial electrode recording datasets from the medial entorhinal cortex, prefrontal cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex. Our work provides a pathway to develop mechanistic, multi-scale brain models that generalize across diverse neural architectures, bridging the gap between single-neuron dynamics and macroscale brain activity.</description>

      <title>Universal quantum melting of quasiperiodic attractors in driven-dissipative cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear classical mechanics has established countless intriguing and profound phenomena. These include limit tori defined by toroidal attractors that support quasiperiodic motion of at least two incommensurate frequencies. Here we address the question, whether and how such phenomena persist in open quantum systems. We develop a quantum description of limit tori within the Lindblad master-equation formalism for a system of two coupled driven-dissipative Kerr cavities. Using the spectral theory of the Liouvillian and the truncated Wigner approximation, we analyze the system across the quantum-to-classical transition. In the classical limit, we identify two pairs of purely imaginary Liouvillian eigenvalues, corresponding to persistent quasiperiodic modes of the limit torus. Quantum fluctuations induce small negative real parts to these eigenvalues, giving rise to finite lifetimes of these modes. The corresponding Liouvillian gaps vanish algebraically in the classical limit. This behavior signals a genuine continuous dynamical phase transition, marked by the spontaneous breaking of time-translational symmetry. Analysis of individual quantum trajectories reveals quantum-fluctuation-induced dephasing as the primary mechanism behind this "quantum melting" of the torus. We quantify this dephasing using a circular-variance-based order parameter, revealing universal scaling with both system size and time. These scaling laws are robust and independent of microscopic parameters. Our results establish the quantum melting of limit tori as a distinct non-equilibrium critical phenomenon and provide concrete signatures for experimental observation in trapped ions and superconducting circuits.</description>

      <title>Noise Reinstates Collapsed Populations: Stochastic Reversal of Deterministic Extinction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional wisdom suggests that environmental noise drives populations toward extinction. In contrast, we report a paradoxical phenomenon in which stochasticity reverses a deterministic tipping point, thereby preventing collapse. Using a hybrid model that integrates logistic growth with a density-triggered sigmoidal collapse, we uncover a striking reversal: deterministic fragility on one side, and stochastic rescue under weak noise on the other. Our analysis demonstrates that noise disrupts the convergence of deterministic trajectories toward extinction by altering the phase space topology, enabling back-transitions to viable states. This mechanism gives rise to noise-induced metastability and reveals a form of stochastic robustness not captured by deterministic models. These findings suggest that natural fluctuations can serve as a stabilizing force in complex systems, offering a compelling counter-narrative to classical models in ecology, epidemiology, and beyond. We advocate for a re-evaluation of stabilization strategies, emphasizing the constructive role of stochasticity in averting population collapse.</description>

      <title>Context-sensitive norm enforcement reduces sanctioning costs in spatial public goods games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uniform punishment policies can sustain cooperation in social dilemmas but impose severe costs on enforcers, creating a second-order free-rider problem that undermines the very mechanism designed to prevent exploitation. We show that the remedy is not a harsher stick but a smarter one. In a four-strategy spatial public-goods game we pit conventional punishers, who levy a fixed fine, against norm-responsive punishers that double both fine and cost only when at least half of their current group already cooperates. Extensive large scale Monte Carlo simulations on lattices demonstrate that context-sensitive punishment achieves complete defector elimination at fine levels 15\% lower than uniform enforcement, despite identical marginal costs per sanctioning event. The efficiency gain emerges because norm-responsive punishers conserve resources in defector-dominated regions while concentrating intensified sanctions at cooperative-defector boundaries, creating self-reinforcing fronts that amplify the spread of prosocial behavior. These findings reveal that enforcement efficiency can be dramatically improved by targeting punishment at cooperative-defector interfaces rather than applying uniform sanctions, offering quantitative guidelines for designing adaptive regulatory mechanisms that maximize compliance while minimizing institutional costs.</description>

      <title>Retrodicting Chaotic Systems: An Algorithmic Information Theory Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Making accurate inferences about data is a key task in science and mathematics. Here we study the problem of \emph{retrodiction}, inferring past values of a series, in the context of chaotic dynamical systems. Specifically, we are interested in inferring the starting value $x_0$ in the series $x_0,x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n$ given the value of $x_n$, and the associated function $f$ which determines the series as $f(x_i)=x_{i+1}$. Even in the deterministic case this is a challenging problem, due to mixing and the typically exponentially many candidate past values in the pre-image of any given value $x_n$ (e.g., a current observation). We study this task from the perspective of algorithmic information theory, which motivates two approaches: One to search for the `simplest' value in the set of candidates, and one to look for the value in the lowest density region of the candidates. We test these methods numerically on the logistic map, Tent map, Bernoulli map, and Julia/Mandelbrot map, which are well-studied maps in chaos theory. The methods aid in retrodiction by assigning low ranks to candidates which are more likely to be the true starting value, which works well in some parameter and map cases, but the methods are not effective in all cases, and several open problems remain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Frustrated random interactions are a key ingredient of spin glasses. From this perspective, we study the dynamics of the Kuramoto model with quenched random couplings: the simplest oscillator ensemble with fully disordered interactions. We answer some open questions by means of extensive numerical simulations and a perturbative calculation (the cavity method). We show frequency entrainment is not realized in the thermodynamic limit and that chaotic dynamics are pervasive in parameter space. In the weak coupling regime, we find closed formulas for the frequency shift and the dissipativeness of the model. Interestingly, the largest Lyapunov exponent is found to exhibit the same asymptotic dependence on the coupling constant irrespective of the coupling asymmetry, within the numerical accuracy.</description>

      <title>Neural models of multiscale systems: conceptual limitations, stochastic parametrizations, and a climate application</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work explores key conceptual limitations in data-driven modeling of multiscale dynamical systems, focusing on neural emulators and stochastic climate modeling. A skillful climate model should capture both stationary statistics and responses to external perturbations. While current autoregressive neural models often reproduce the former, they typically struggle with the latter. We begin by analyzing a low-dimensional dynamical system to expose, by analogy, fundamental limitations that persist in high-dimensional settings. Specifically, we construct neural stochastic models under two scenarios: one where the full state vector is observed, and another with only partial observations (i.e. a subset of variables). In the first case, the models accurately capture both equilibrium statistics and forced responses in ensemble mean and variance. In the more realistic case of partial observations, two key challenges emerge: (i) identifying the \textit{proper} variables to model, and (ii) parameterizing the influence of unobserved degrees of freedom. These issues are not specific to neural networks but reflect fundamental limitations of data-driven modeling and the need to target the slow dynamics of the system. We argue that physically grounded strategies -- such as coarse-graining and stochastic parameterizations -- are critical, both conceptually and practically, for the skillful emulation of complex systems like the coupled climate system. Building on these insights, we turn to a more realistic application: a stochastic reduced neural model of the sea surface temperature field and the net radiative flux at the top of the atmosphere, assessing its stationary statistics, response to temperature forcing, and interpretability.</description>

      <title>Periodic classical trajectories and quantum scars in many-spin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00258v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the stability of exceptional periodic classical trajectories in rather generic chaotic many-body systems and explore a possible connection between these trajectories and exceptional nonthermal quantum eigenstates known as "quantum many-body scars". The systems considered are chaotic spin chains with short-range interactions, both classical and quantum. On the classical side, the chosen periodic trajectories are such that all spins instantaneously point in the same direction, which evolves as a function of time. We find that the largest Lyapunov exponents characterising the stabillity of these trajectories have surprisingly strong and nontrivial dependencies on the interaction constants and chain lengths. In particular, we identify rather long spin chains, where the above periodic trajectories are Lyapunov-stable on many-body energy shells overwhelmingly dominated by chaotic motion. We also find that instabilities around periodic trajectories in modestly large spin chains develop into a transient nearly quasiperiodic non-ergodic regime. In some cases, the lifetime of this regime is extremely long, which we interpret as a manifestation of Arnold diffusion in the vicinity of integrable dynamics. On the quantum side, we numerically investigate the dynamics of quantum states starting with all spins initially pointing in the same direction: these are the quantum counterparts of the initial conditions for the above periodic classical trajectories. Our investigation reveals the existence of quantum many-body scars for numerically accessible finite chains of spins 3/2 and higher. The dynamic thermalisation process dominated by quantum scars is shown to exhibit a slowdown in comparison with generic thermalisation at the same energy. Finally, we identify quantum signatures of the proximity to a classical separatrix of the periodic motion.</description>

Abstract: We study the double kicked top (DKT), which is an extension of the standard quantum kicked top (QKT) model. The model allows us to study the transition from time-reversal symmetric to broken time-reversal symmetric dynamics. Our transformation in the kick strength parameter space $(k, k') \to (k_r, k_\theta)$ reveals interesting features. The transformed kicked strength parameter $k_r$ drives a higher growth of chaos and is equivalent to the standard QKT, whereas the other transformed kicked strength parameter $k_\theta$ leads to a weaker growth. We discuss the fixed points, their stability, and verify results obtained by computing the largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE) and the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy (KSE). We exactly solve 2- to 4-qubit versions of DKT by obtaining its eigenvalues, eigenvectors and the entanglement dynamics. Furthermore, we find the criteria for periodicity of the entanglement dynamics. We investigate measures of quantum correlations from two perspectives: the deep quantum and the semi-classical regime. Signatures of phase-space structure are numerically shown in the long-time averages of the quantum correlations. Our model can be realised experimentally as an extension of the standard QKT.</description>
