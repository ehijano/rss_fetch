      <title>Thermodynamics for Reduced Models of Breakable Amyloid Filaments Based on Maximum Entropy Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amyloid filaments are associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Simplified models of amyloid aggregation are crucial because the original mass-action equations involve numerous variables, complicating analysis and understanding. While dynamical aspects of simplified models have been widely studied, their thermodynamic properties are less understood. In this study, we explore the Maximum Entropy Principle (MEP)-reduced models, initially developed for dynamical analysis, from a brand-new thermodynamic perspective. Analytical expressions along with numerical simulations demonstrate that the discrete MEP-reduced model strictly retains laws of thermodynamics, which holds true even when filament lengths transit from discrete values to continuous real numbers. Our findings not only clarify the thermodynamic consistency between the MEP-reduced models and the original models of amyloid filaments for the first time, but also suggest avenues for future research into the model-reduction thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Water Absorption Dynamics in Medical Foam: Empirical Validation of the Lucas-Washburn Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study extends the Lucas-Washburn theory through non-equilibrium thermodynamic analysis to examine fluid absorption in medical foams used for hemorrhage control. As a universal model for capillary flow in porous media, the theory demonstrated strong agreement with experimental results, confirming its semi-quantitative accuracy. Minor deviations, likely due to material heterogeneity, were observed and explained, enhancing the theory's applicability to real-world conditions. Our findings underscore the universality of the Lucas-Washburn framework and provide valuable insights for optimizing the design of medical foams, ultimately contributing to more effective bleeding control solutions in clinical applications.</description>

      <title>Mechanistic Modeling of Continuous Lyophilization for Pharmaceutical Manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lyophilization (also known as freeze drying) is a process that is commonly used to increase the stability of drug products, e.g., mRNA vaccines, in pharmaceutical manufacturing. While extensive efforts have been dedicated to shift the pharmaceutical industry towards continuous manufacturing, the majority of industrial-scale lyophilization is still being operated in a batch mode. This article proposes the first mechanistic model for a complete continuous lyophilization process, which includes freezing, primary drying, and secondary drying. The state-of-the-art lyophilization technology is considered, in which vials are suspended and moved continuously through the process. The model can describe the evolution of several critical process parameters, namely the product temperature, ice/water fraction, sublimation front position, and concentration of bound water, for the entire lyophilization process. The model is also demonstrated for several applications related to process design and optimization. Ultimately, the framework and results presented in this work can serve as a solid foundation to guide the design and development of future continuous lyophilization processes.</description>

      <title>Social Physics of Bacteria: Avoidance of an Information Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16691v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Social physics explores responses to information exchange in a social network, and can be mapped down to bacterial collective signaling. Here, we explore how social inter-bacterial communication includes coordination of response to communication loss, as opposed to solitary searching for food, with collective response emergence at the population level. We present a 2-dimensional enclosed microfluidic environment that utilizes concentric rings of funnel ratchets, which direct motile E.coli bacteria towards a sole exit hole, an information ``black hole'', passage into the black hole irreversibly sweeps the bacteria away via hydrodynamic flow. We show that the spatiotemporal evolution of entropy production reveals how bacteria avoid crossing the hydrodynamic black hole information horizon.</description>

      <title>Traveling waves at the surface of active liquid crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active liquid crystals exert nonequilibrium stresses on their surroundings through constant consumption of energy, giving rise to dynamical steady states not present in equilibrium. The paradigmatic example of an active liquid crystal is a suspension of microtubule bundles powered by kinesin motor proteins, which exhibits self-sustained spatiotemporal chaotic flows. This system has been modelled using continuum theories that couple the microtubule orientation to active flows. Recently the focus has shifted to the interfacial properties of mixtures of active liquid crystals and passive fluids. Active/passive interfaces have been shown to support propagating capillary waves in the absence of inertia and offer a promising route for relating experimental parameters to those of the continuum theory. In this paper we report the derivation of a minimal model that captures the linear dynamics of the interface between an active liquid crystal and a passive fluid. We show that the dynamics of the interface, although powered by active flows throughout the bulk, is qualitatively captured by equations that couple non-reciprocally interface height and nematic director at the interface. This minimal model reproduces the dynamical structure factor evaluated from numerical simulations and the qualitative form of the wave dispersion relation seen in experiments.</description>
