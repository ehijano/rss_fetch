      <title>$\mathbb{Z}_2^3$-grading of the Lie algebra $G_2$ and related color algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a special and attractive basis for the exceptional Lie algebra $G_2$, which turns $G_2$ into a $\mathbb{Z}_2^3$-graded Lie algebra. There are two basis elements for each degree of $\mathbb{Z}_2^3\setminus\{(0,0,0)\}$, thus yielding 14 basis elements. We give a general and simple closed form expression for commutators between these basis elements. Next, we use this $\mathbb{Z}_2^3$-grading in order to examine graded color algebras. Our analysis yields three different $\mathbb{Z}_2^3$-graded color algebras of type $G_2$. Since the $\mathbb{Z}_2^3$-grading is not compatible with a Cartan-Weyl basis of $G_2$, we also study another grading of $G_2$. This is a $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-grading, compatible with a Cartan-Weyl basis, and for which we can also construct a $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-graded color algebra of type $G_2$.</description>

      <title>Birkhoff normal form via decorated trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive an explicit tree based ansatz for the Birkhoff normal form up to any order in the context of Hamiltonian PDEs. To do so we make use of a tree based representation of iterated Poisson brackets to encode the nested Taylor expansions along flows of a sequence of symplectic transformations. As an example we consider the cubic Schr\"odinger equation.</description>

      <title>Absolute algebras, contramodules, and duality squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.09833v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Absolute algebras are a new type of algebraic structures, endowed with a meaningful notion of infinite sums of operations without supposing any underlying topology. Opposite to the usual definition of operadic calculus, they are defined as algebras over cooperads. The goal of this article is to develop this new theory. First, we relate the homotopy theory of absolute algebras to the homotopy theory of usual algebras via a duality square. It intertwines bar-cobar adjunctions with linear duality adjunctions. In particular, we show that linear duality functors between types of coalgebras and types of algebras are Quillen functors and that they induce equivalences between objects with finiteness conditions on their homology. We give general comparison results between absolute types of algebras and their classical counterparts. We work out examples of this theory such as absolute associative algebras and absolute Lie algebras, and show that it includes the theory of contramodules. Campos--Petersen--Robert-Nicoud--Wierstra showed that two nilpotent Lie algebras whose universal enveloping algebras are isomorphic as associative algebras must be isomorphic. As an application of our results, we generalize their theorem to the setting of absolute Lie algebras and absolute $\mathcal{L}_\infty$-algebras.</description>

      <title>Quantum Max d-Cut via qudit swap operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20942v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum Max Cut (QMC) problem for systems of qubits is an example of a 2-local Hamiltonian problem, and a prominent paradigm in computational complexity theory. This paper investigates the algebraic structure of a higher-dimensional analog of the QMC problem for systems of qudits. The Quantum Max d-Cut (d-QMC) problem asks for the largest eigenvalue of a Hamiltonian on a graph with n vertices whose edges correspond to swap operators acting on $(\mathbb C^d)^{\otimes n}$. The algebra generated by the swap operators is identified as a quotient of a free algebra modulo symmetric group relations and a single additional relation of degree d. This presentation leads to a tailored hierarchy of semidefinite programs, leveraging noncommutative polynomial optimization (NPO) methods, that converges to the solution of the d-QMC problem. For complete bipartite graphs, exact solutions for the d-QMC problem are derived using the representation theory of symmetric groups and Littlewood-Richardson coefficients. This in particular includes the d-QMC problem for clique and star graphs on n vertices, for all d and n. Lastly, the paper addresses a refined d-QMC problem focused on finding the largest eigenvalue within each isotypic component (irreducible block) of the graph Hamiltonian. It is shown that the spectrum of the star graph Hamiltonian distinguishes between isotypic components of the 3-QMC problem. For general d, low-degree relations for separating isotypic components are presented, enabling adaptation of the global NPO hierarchy to efficiently compute the largest eigenvalue in each isotypic component.</description>
