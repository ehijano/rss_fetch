      <title>Inverse limits of various posets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known when we call a poset P, a $\mathcal{P}$-chain permutational poset, given a subset of permutations $\mathcal{P}$ of the symmetric group $S_{n}$. In this work, we use the same idea to study subsets of words of length $n$, that are not necessarily permutations, for example: especially when they are certain classes of restricted growth functions induced by set partitions in standard form over $[n]=\{1,2\cdots n\}$. Varying $n$ only, and also varying $n$ and $k$ (the number of blocks of the set partitions) simultaneously, we can show that those posets form a projective system of trees and lattices (after giving a lattice structure in a natural way). These poset structures can be extended over signed restricted growth functions for standard type B set partitions over $\langle n\rangle=\{-1,-2,\cdots n,0,1,2\cdots n\}$ as well. We investigate properties of the tree and lattice structures of these projective systems. In this scenario we further bring up some other posets like $\mathcal{P}$-Partition posets of snake graph of continued fractions, Ascent lattices on Dyck Paths, certain type of lattice induced by generalisec fibonnaci number and Stanley order, lattices induced by non-crossing set partitions.</description>

      <title>Generalized Jacobians of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define a generalized Jacobian $\mathrm{J}_\mathfrak{m}(\mathit{Gr})$ and a generalized Picard group $\mathrm{P}_\mathfrak{m}(\mathit{Gr})$ of a graph $\mathit{Gr}$ with respect to a modulus $ \mathfrak{m}=\sum_{i=1}^s m_iw_i$ with $w_i$ vertices of $\mathit{Gr}$ and $m_i\geq 1$. These groups occur as the component groups of N\'{e}ron models of generalized Jacobians. We prove a universal mapping property for $\mathrm{J}_\mathfrak{m}(\mathit{Gr})$ and show that an Abel-Jacobi map in this context induces an isomorphism from $\mathrm{P}_\frak{m}(\mathit{Gr})$ to $\mathrm{J}_\mathfrak{m}(\mathit{Gr})$. We also reinterpret $\mathrm{P}_\mathfrak{m}(\mathit{Gr})$ in terms of sheaves on the geometric realization $\left| \mathit{Gr}\right|$ of $\mathit{Gr}$, making a connection with tropical geometry.</description>

      <title>Chen-Chv\'atal Conjecture for Graphs of Diameter 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2008, Chen and Chv\'atal conjectured that in every finite metric space of $n$ points, there are at least $n$ distinct lines, or the whole set of points is a line. This is a generalization of a classical result in the Euclidean plane. The Chen-Chv\'atal conjecture is open even in metric spaces induced by connected graphs. In 2018, it was asked by Chv\'atal whether graphs of diameter three satisfy the conjecture. In this work, we find all graphs of diameter three having fewer lines than vertices. As a direct consequence, we prove that graphs of diameter three satisfy the Chen-Chv\'atal conjecture.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically half of binary words are shuffle squares</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A binary shuffle square is a binary word of even length that can be partitioned into two disjoint, identical subwords. Huang, Nam, Thaper, and the first author conjectured that as $n\rightarrow \infty$, asymptotically half of all binary words of length $2n$ are shuffle squares. We prove this conjecture in a strong form, by showing that the number of binary shuffle squares of length $2n$ is $(\frac{1}{2} - o(n^{-1/15})) 2^{2n}$.</description>

      <title>An equitable partition for the distance-regular graph of the bilinear forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a type of distance-regular graph $\Gamma=(X, \mathcal R)$ called a bilinear forms graph. We assume that the diameter $D$ of $\Gamma$ is at least $3$. Fix adjacent vertices $x,y \in X$. In our first main result, we introduce an equitable partition of $X$ that has $6D-2$ subsets and the following feature: for every subset in the equitable partition, the vertices in the subset are equidistant to $x$ and equidistant to $y$. This equitable partition is called the $(x,y)$-partition of $X$. By definition, the subconstituent algebra $T=T(x)$ is generated by the Bose-Mesner algebra of $\Gamma$ and the dual Bose-Mesner algebra of $\Gamma$ with respect to $x$. As we will see, for the $(x,y)$-partition of $X$ the characteristic vectors of the subsets form a basis for a $T$-module $U=U(x,y)$. In our second main result, we decompose $U$ into an orthogonal direct sum of irreducible $T$-modules. This sum has five summands: the primary $T$-module and four irreducible $T$-modules that have endpoint one.
  We show that every irreducible $T$-module with endpoint one is isomorphic to exactly one of the nonprimary summands.</description>

      <title>How to Tropicalize a non-Archimedean Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tropicalization of a linear space over a non-archimedean field is a tropical linear space. In this paper, we present a method for computing the tropicalization of any lattice over a valuation ring. The resulting tropical semimodule is the support of a polyhedral complex constructed from a certain multilinear polynomial we call the entropy polynomial. The key idea in our argument is the tropicalization of Haar measures on lattices over local fields.</description>

      <title>Ore's Theorem for rainbow Hamiltonian-connected graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G = (G_1, G_2, \ldots, G_m)$ be a collection of $m$ graphs on a common vertex set $V$. For a graph $H$ with vertices in $V$, we say that $G$ contains a rainbow $H$ if there is an injection $c: E(H) \to [m]$ such that for every edge $e \in E(H)$, we have $e \in E(G_{c(e)})$.
  In this paper, we show that if $G = (G_1, \ldots, G_n)$ is a collection of graphs on $n$ vertices such that for every $i \in [n]$, $d_{G_i}(u) + d_{G_i}(v) \geq n$ whenever $uv \notin E(G_i)$, then either $G$ contains rainbow Hamiltonian paths between every pair of vertices, or $G$ contains a rainbow Hamiltonian cycle. Moreover, we prove a stronger version in which we may also embed prescribed rainbow linear forests into the Hamiltonian paths.</description>

      <title>A positive combinatorial formula for the double Edelman--Greene coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lam, Lee, and Shimozono introduced the double Stanley symmetric functions in their study of the equivariant geometry of the affine Grassmannian. They proved that the associated double Edelman--Greene coefficients, the double Schur expansion coefficients of these functions, are positive, a result later refined by Anderson. They further asked for a combinatorial proof of this positivity. In this paper, we provide the first such proof, together with a combinatorial formula that manifests the finer positivity established by Anderson. Our formula is built from two combinatorial models: bumpless pipedreams and increasing chains in the Bruhat order. The proof relies on three key ingredients: a correspondence between these two models, a natural subdivision of bumpless pipedreams, and a symmetry property of increasing chains.</description>

      <title>Solving Admissibility for the Spatial X-Ray Transform On the Two Element Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The admissibility problem in integral geometry asks for which collections of affine subspaces the Radon transform remains injective. In the discrete setting, this becomes a purely combinatorial question about recovering a function on a finite vector space from its sums over a prescribed family of affine subspaces. In this paper, we study the spatial X-ray transform (line transform) over the finite vector spaces $\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{n}$ and give a complete structural and enumerative description of admissible line complexes in $\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{4}$. We prove that any admissible line complex in $\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{4}$ can be obtained by taking a disjoint union of one or more odd cycles and attaching trees to the cycle vertices. Using this structural description, we carry out a systematic case-by-case enumeration of all admissible complexes in $\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{4}$ and derive an exact total count. We then generalize our approach to an algorithm that applies to $\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{n}$ for arbitrary $n$, and we then implement it to obtain the total number of admissible complexes in $\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{5}$. Our results extend previous small-dimensional classifications and provide an algorithmic framework for studying admissibility in higher dimensions. Beyond their intrinsic combinatorial interest, these structures model discrete sampling schemes for tomographic imaging, and they suggest further connections between admissibility, incidence matrices, and spectral properties of the associated graphs.</description>

      <title>On Well-VE-Dominated Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph G=(V, E), a vertex is said to ve-dominate an edge if it is either incident with the edge or adjacent to one of its endpoints. A set of vertices is a ve-dominating set if it ve-dominates every edge of the graph. We introduce the class of well-ve-dominated graphs, defined as graphs in which all minimal ve-dominating sets have the same cardinality. After establishing several general structural properties of well-ve-dominated graphs, we show that recognizing whether a graph belongs to this class is co--NP--complete, highlighting the computational difficulty of the problem. Our main result is a complete structural characterization of well-ve-dominated trees, which yields a simple linear-time recognition algorithm and a constructive description of all trees in this class.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mutual-visibility chromatic number of a graph $G$ is the smallest number of colors needed to color the vertices of $G$ such that each color class is a mutual-visibility set. In this paper, we prove that determining the mutual-visibility chromatic number of a graph is NP-complete even when restricted to the class of graphs having diameter four and mutual-visibility chromatic number two. We further determine the exact value of the mutual-visibility chromatic number for glued binary trees and glued $t$-ary trees.</description>

      <title>Forbidden Induced Subgraph Characterization of Word-Representable Split Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The class of word-representable graphs, introduced in connection with the study of the Perkins semigroup by Kitaev and Seif, has attracted significant attention in combinatorics and theoretical computer science due to its deep connections with graph orientations and combinatorics on words. A graph is word-representable if and only if it admits a semi-transitive orientation, which is an acyclic orientation such that for any directed path $v_0 \rightarrow v_1 \rightarrow \cdots \rightarrow v_m$ with $m \ge 2$, either there is no arc between $v_0$ and $v_m$, or, for all $1 \le i &lt; j \le m$, there exists an arc from $v_i$ to $v_j$. Split graphs, whose vertex set can be partitioned into a clique and an independent set, constitute a natural yet nontrivial subclass for studying word-representability. However, not all split graphs are semi-transitive, and the characterization of minimal forbidden induced subgraphs for semi-transitive split graphs remains an open problem.
  In this paper, we introduce a new matrix property called the $I$-circular property, which is closely related to the well-known $D$-circular property introduced by Safe. The $I$-circular property requires that both the rows of a matrix and the pairwise intersections of rows form circular intervals under some linear ordering of the columns. Using this property, we establish a direct connection between the structure of semi-transitive split graphs and the matrix representation of their adjacency relationships. Our main result is a complete forbidden submatrix characterization of the $I$-circular property, which in turn provides a characterization for semi-transitive split graphs in terms of minimal forbidden induced subgraphs.</description>

      <title>Forbidden Induced Subgraph Characterization of Word-Representable Co-bipartite Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph $G$ with vertex set $V(G)$ and edge set $E(G)$ is said to be word-representable if there exists a word $w$ over the alphabet $V(G)$ such that, for any two distinct letters $x,y \in V(G)$, the letters $x$ and $y$ alternate in $w$ if and only if $(x,y) \in E(G)$. Equivalently, a graph is word-representable if and only if it admits a semi-transitive orientation, that is, an acyclic orientation in which, for every directed path $v_0 \rightarrow v_1 \rightarrow \cdots \rightarrow v_m$ with $m \ge 2$, either there is no arc between $v_0$ and $v_m$, or, for all $1 \le i &lt; j \le m$, there exists an arc from $v_i$ to $v_j$. In this work, we provide a comprehensive structural and algorithmic characterization of word-representable co-bipartite graphs, a class of graphs whose vertex set can be partitioned into two cliques.
  This work unifies graph-theoretic and matrix-theoretic perspectives. We first establish that a co-bipartite graph is a circle graph if and only if it is a permutation graph, thereby deriving a minimal forbidden induced subgraph characterization for co-bipartite circle graphs. The central contribution then connects semi-transitivity with the circularly compatible ones property of binary matrices. In addition to the structural characterization, the paper introduces a linear-time recognition algorithm for semi-transitive co-bipartite graphs, utilizing Safe's matrix recognition framework.</description>

      <title>Counting permutations by alternating runs via Hetyei-Reiner trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generating polynomial of permutations of size $n$, counted by the number of alternating runs, has a root at $-1$ of multiplicity $\lfloor (n-2)/2 \rfloor$ for all $n \ge 2$. This result can be derived by combining the David--Barton formula for Eulerian polynomials with the Foata--Sch\"utzenberger $\gamma$--decomposition. More recently, B\'ona gave a group--action proof of this phenomenon.
  In this paper, we present an alternative approach based on the Hetyei--Reiner action on binary trees, which leads to a new combinatorial interpretation of B\'ona's quotient polynomial. Moreover, we extend our analysis to analogous results for permutations of types~$B$ and~$D$. As a by--product of our bijective framework, we also obtain combinatorial proofs of David--Barton--type identities for permutations of types~$A$ and~$B$.</description>

      <title>Vertex-edge domination on subclasses of bipartite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a simple undirected graph $G = (V, E)$, the open neighbourhood of a vertex $v \in V$ is defined as $N_G(v) = \{u \in V \mid uv \in E\}$, and the closed neighbourhood as $N_G[v] = N_G(v) \cup \{v\}$. A subset $D \subseteq V$ is called a vertex-edge dominating set if, for every edge $uv \in E$, at least one vertex from $D$ appears in $N_G[u] \cup N_G[v]$; that is, $\vert (N_G[u] \cup N_G[v]) \cap D\vert \geq 1$. Intuitively, a vertex-edge dominating set ensures that every edge, as well as all edges incident to either of its endpoints, is dominated by at least one vertex from the set. The \textsc{Min-VEDS} problem asks for a vertex-edge dominating set of minimum size in a given graph. This problem is known to be NP-complete even for bipartite graphs. In this paper, we strengthen this hardness result by proving that the problem remains NP-complete for two specific subclasses of bipartite graphs: star-convex and comb-convex bipartite graphs. For a graph $G$ on $n$ vertices, it is known that the \textsc{Min-VEDS} problem cannot be approximated within a factor of $(1 - \epsilon)\ln |V|$ for any $\epsilon &gt; 0$, unless $\text{NP} \subseteq \text{DTIME}(|V|^{O(\log \log |V|)})$. We also prove that this inapproximability result holds even for star-convex and comb-convex bipartite graphs. On the positive side, we present a polynomial-time algorithm for computing a minimum vertex-edge dominating set in convex bipartite graphs. A polynomial-time algorithm for this graph class was also proposed by B{\"u}y{\"u}k{\c{c}}olak et al.~\cite{buyukccolak2025linear}, but we show that their algorithm has certain flaws by providing instances where it fails to produce an optimal solution. We address this issue by presenting a modified algorithm that correctly computes an optimal solution.</description>

      <title>Maximum number of spanning trees and connectivity: Graphs with a fixed minimum degree and bipartite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The number of spanning trees in a graph $G$ is the total number of distinct spanning subgraphs of $G$ that are trees. In this paper we characterize the unique graph with a prescribed vertex (resp. edge) connectivity, minimum degree and order that attains the maximum number of spanning trees. Moreover, all the bipartite graphs are determined with a given vertex (resp. edge) connectivity and order maximizing the number of spanning trees.</description>

      <title>Dominated balanced separators in wheel-induced-minor-free graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gartland and Lokshtanov conjectured that every graph that excludes some planar graph as an induced minor has a balanced separator, that is, a separator whose deletion leaves every component with no more than half of the vertices of the graph, which is dominated by a bounded number of vertices. We confirm this conjecture for excluding any fixed wheel, that is, a cycle together with a universal vertex, as an induced minor.</description>

      <title>On Glashier's Partition Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Glashier's theorem states that the number of partitions of $n$ into parts which repeat at most $m-1$ times is equal to the number of partitions of $n$ into parts which are not divisible by $m$. The $m=2$ case is Euler's famous partition theorem. Recently, Andrews, Kumar, and Yee gave two new partition functions $C(n)$ and $D(n)$ related to Euler's theorem. Lin and Zhang extended their result to Glashier's theorem by generalizing $C(n)$. We generalize $D(n)$, prove an analogous partition identity for the $m=3$ case, and provide a new series equal to Glashier's product both in the finite and infinite cases.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is $k$-vertex-critical if $\chi(G)=k$, but $\chi(G')&lt;k$ for every proper induced subgraph $G'$ of $G$. For a family of graphs $\mathcal{F}$, $G$ is $\mathcal{F}$-free if no graph $F \in \mathcal{F}$ is an induced subgraph of $G$. We show that there are exactly three 4-vertex-critical $\{P_7,C_3\}$-free graphs containing an induced $C_7$, thereby settling the first of the two cases of a conjecture by Goedgebeur and Schaudt [J.~Graph Theory, 87:188--207, 2018]. Moreover, we show that all $\{P_5+P_1,C_3\}$-free graphs are $3$-colorable and by combining our result with known results from the literature, we completely characterize the maximum chromatic number of $\{F,C_3\}$-free graphs if $F$ is a six-vertex induced subgraph of $P_7$. Finally, we construct an infinite family of $4$-vertex-critical $\{4K_2,C_3\}$-free graphs. These graphs are also $\{P_{11},C_3\}$-free and this is the first value of $t$ for which an infinite family of $4$-vertex-critical $\{P_{t},C_3\}$-free graphs is known.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carlitz considered integer compositions in which adjacent parts must be unequal. Arndt recently initiated the study of restricted compositions based on conditions applied to certain pairs of parts rather than to individual parts. Here, we combine and generalize these notions, establishing enumeration results using both combinatorial proofs and generating functions. Motivations for our generalizations include the gap-free compositions studied by Hitczenko and Knopfmacher and the Rogers-Ramanujan integer partitions.</description>

      <title>Counting Cholesky factorizations of the zero matrix over $\mathbb{F}_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A square, upper-triangular matrix $U$ is a Cholesky root of a matrix $M$ provided $U^*U=M$, where $\cdot^*$ represents the conjugate transpose when working over the complex field and $U^*=U^T$ over the reals and finite fields. In this paper, we investigate the number of such factorizations over the finite field with two elements, $\mathbb{F}_2$, and prove the equinumerosity, for each fixed rank, of the Cholesky roots of and the upper-triangular square roots of the zero matrix. We then provide asymptotics for this count and finish with a few directions for future inquiry.</description>

      <title>On a generalization of the Johnson-Newman theorem to multiple rank-one perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wang and Zhao (Adv. Appl. Math. 173 (2026) 102994) generalized the classic Johnson-Newman theorem on simultaneous similarity of symmetric matrices from a single rank-one perturbation to multiple rank-one perturbations. However, their result applies only to specific rank-one perturbations, and the given condition is quite involved as it relies on multivariate polynomials. We provide a simple proof of their result, leading to an improved version with a simplified condition that holds for arbitrary rank-one perturbations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove and generalize a conjecture of Johann Cigler on the Hankel determinants of convolution powers of Narayana polynomials. Our method follows a "guess-and-prove" strategy, relying on established techniques involving Hankel continued fractions. While the final forms of our theorems are given by simple closed expressions, the proofs require us to formulate and manage extremely large and intricate explicit expressions at intermediate stages. Most of the technically involved and lengthy formal verifications are carried out using a symbolic computation program, whose code is available on the author's personal webpage for independent verification. We emphasize that our program delivers rigorous symbolic proofs, rather than merely verifying the initial terms.</description>

Abstract: We study the dual variants of the Erd\H{o}s's distinct distance and unit distance problems. Instead of considering distances and simplex volumes determined by points, we consider simplex volumes determined by hyperplanes. We investigate: (1) the maximum number of unit volume $d$-simplices determined by an arrangement of $n$ hyperplanes in $\mathbb{R}^d$, (2) the maximum number of minimum/maximum volume $d$-simplices determined by an arrangement of $n$ hyperplanes in $\mathbb{R}^d$, and (3) the maximum number $D_d(n)$ such that any arrangement of $n$ hyperplanes in $\mathbb{R}^d$ in general position contains $D_d(n)$ hyperplanes forming $d$-simplices of distinct volumes.</description>

Abstract: Consider the random process that starts with $n$ vertices and no edges, where the edges of $K_n$ are added one at a time in a uniformly chosen random order $e_1, e_2,\ldots, e_{\binom{n}{2}}$. Let $T$ be the earliest time at which $e_1$ belongs to a cycle in this evolving random graph. By solving the appropriate graph enumeration problem we show that $\mathbb{E}[T]=n$. This fact turns out to be an instance of a much more general phenomenon and we are able to extend this theorem to all graphs and even to every matroid.</description>

      <title>On the minimal forts of trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2008, the zero forcing number of a graph was shown to be an upper bound on the graph's maximum nullity. In 2018, the concept of forts was introduced to provide a set covering characterization of zero forcing sets. Since then, forts have been integrated into integer programming models for zero forcing and have been used to yield bounds on the zero forcing number. In 2025, researchers explored the combinatorial question of how many minimal forts a graph can have. They demonstrated that the number of minimal forts in a graph with an order of at least six is strictly less than Sperner's bound. Moreover, the authors derived an explicit formula for the number of minimal forts in path, cycle, and spider graphs. For example, the number of minimal forts in a path graph aligns with the Padovan sequence, and thus exhibits exponential growth. In this article, we demonstrate that no tree with an order of $n$ can have fewer than $n/3$ minimal forts. Additionally, we provide a characterization of the trees that possess exactly $n/3$ minimal forts. We conjecture that the $n/3$ bound is valid for all graphs of order $n$. We present experimental evidence supporting this conjecture and prove that it holds for all Eulerian graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue on a recent concept introduced by Kariuki and Okoth, about skew 2-Dyck paths, introducing an additional down-step $L$, together with the usual steps
  $U$ (up) and $D$ down. There is the syntactical condition that $UL$ and $LU$ can never occur. An automaton that checks these conditions is introduced, and the
  relevant generating functions are obtained by applying the kernel method to three functional equations. It is briefly discussed how the setting can be extended to $t$-Dyck paths. As a benefit, prefixes of skew $t$-Dyck paths are also enumerated.</description>

Abstract: A 1-planar graph refers to a graph that can be drawn on the plane such that each edge has at most one crossing. In this paper, focusing on the spectral Tur\'{a}n-type problems of $1$-planar graphs, we determine completely the unique spectral extremal graph among all $K_3$-free or $K_4$-free $1$-planar graphs, and provide a characterization of the spectral extremal graphs for $K_5$-free $1$-planar graphs, confining the candidates to a specific, small family.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate three fundamental problems regarding cut complexes of graphs: their realizability, the uniqueness of graph reconstruction from them, and their algorithmic recognition. We define the parameter $m(d,n)$ as the minimum number of additional vertices needed to realize any $d$-dimensional simplicial complex on $n$ vertices as a cut complex, and prove foundational bounds. Furthermore, we characterize precisely when a graph on $n \geq 5$ vertices is uniquely reconstructible from its $3$-cut complex. Based on this characterization, we develop an $O(n^4)$ recognition algorithm. These results deepen the connection between graph structure and the topology of cut complexes.</description>

      <title>Decomposition theorems for unmatchable pairs in groups and field extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A theory of matchings for finite subsets of an abelian group, introduced in connection with a conjecture of Wakeford on canonical forms for symmetric tensors, has since been extended to the setting of field extensions and to that of matroids. Earlier approaches have produced numerous criteria for matchability and unmatchability, but have offered little structural insight. In this paper, we develop parallel structure theorems which characterize unmatchable pairs in both abelian groups and field extensions. Our framework reveals analogous obstructions to matchability: nearly periodic decompositions of sets in the group setting correspond to decompositions of subspaces involving translates of simple extensions in the linear setting. This perspective not only recovers previously known results through short proofs, but also leads to new matching criteria and guarantees the existence of nontrivial unmatchable pairs.</description>

      <title>Binary normal networks without near reticulations can be reconstructed from their rooted triples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Normal networks are an important class of phylogenetic networks that have compelling mathematical properties which align with intuition about inference from genetic data. While tools enabling widespread use of phylogenetic networks in the biological literature are still under mathematical, statistical, and computational development, many such results are being assembled, and in particular for normal phylogenetic networks. For instance, it has been shown that binary normal networks can be reconstructed from the sets of three- and four-leaf rooted phylogenetic trees that they display. It is also known that one can reconstruct particular subclasses of normal networks from just the displayed rooted triples. This applies, for instance, to rooted binary phylogenetic trees and to binary level-$1$ normal networks. In this paper we address the question of how much of the class of binary normal networks can be reconstructed from just the rooted triples that they display. We find that all except those with substructures that we call ``near-sibling reticulations'' and ``near-stack reticulations'' can be reconstructed just from their rooted triples. This goes some way to answering the natural question of how much information can be extracted from a set of displayed rooted triples, which are arguably the simplest substructure that one may hope for in a phylogenetic object.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proves that two differently defined rooted binary trees are isomorphic. The first tree is one associated to a version of Farey sequences where the vertices correspond to the open intervals formed by two successive terms in the sequence. The other tree has the vertices consisting of pairs of positive integers whose adjacency is defined by a simple recursive relation. These trees appeared in a study of a generalization of a class of the permutations defined by S\'{o}s and the bijection between it and the set of the Farey intervals due to Sur\'{a}nyi.</description>

      <title>The maximum number of nonzero weights of linear rank-metric codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the maximum number \( L_{\mathrm{rk}}(n, m, k, q) \) of distinct nonzero rank weights that an \( \mathbb{F}_{q^m} \)-linear rank-metric code of dimension \( k \) in \( \mathbb{F}_{q^m}^n \) can attain. We determine the exact value of the function \( L_{\mathrm{rk}}(n, m, k, q) \) for all admissible parameters \( n, m, k, q \). In particular, we characterize when a code achieves the full weight spectrum (FWS), i.e. when the number of distinct nonzero rank weights equals \( \min\{n, m\} \). We provide both necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of FWS codes, along with explicit constructions of codes attaining the maximum number of distinct weights. We discuss the equivalence of such codes and also present classification results for 2-dimensional codes. Finally, we investigate further properties of these optimal codes, like their behavior under duality.</description>

      <title>Tales of Hoffman: from a distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hoffman proved that a graph $G$ with adjacency eigenvalues $\lambda_1\geq \cdots \geq \lambda_n$ and chromatic number $\chi(G)$ satisfies $\chi(G)\geq 1+\kappa,$ where $\kappa$ is the smallest integer such that $$\lambda_1+\sum_{i=1}^{\kappa}\lambda_{n+1-i}\leq 0.$$ We extend this eigenvalue bound to the distance-$k$ setting, and also show a strengthening of it by proving that it also lower bounds the corresponding quantum distance coloring graph parameter. The new bound depends on a degree-$k$ polynomial which can be chosen freely, so one needs to make a good choice of the polynomial to obtain as strong a bound as possible. We thus propose linear programming methods to optimize it. We also investigate the implications of the new bound for the quantum distance chromatic number, showing that it is sharp for some classes of graphs. Finally, we extend the Hoffman bound to the distance setting of the vector chromatic number. Our results extend and unify several previous bounds in the literature.</description>

      <title>A tropical version of Martens' theorem for metric graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the conjecture stated by Jensen and Len on a tropical version on Martens' theorem via the Brill--Noether rank of a tropical curve. We recall Coppens' counterexample of Martens-special chain of cycles, and we generalize the construction defining another class of graphs, Martens-special trees of cycles, for which the conjecture does not hold in a similar setting. These are not the only counterexamples. However, we prove that the conjecture holds for all metric graphs with a stricter assumption on the degree in the Brill--Noether rank.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain Hamel--Goulden-type ribbon decomposition determinantal formulas for flagged supersymmetric Schur functions. As an application, we derive corresponding new determinantal formulas dual refined canonical stable Grothendieck polynomials. These results generalize and produce a number of new determinantal formulas for these symmetric functions including Jacobi--Trudi and skew Giambelli-type determinants.</description>

      <title>Cyclotomic Euler-Mahonian polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cyclotomic Eulerian polynomials and the cyclotomic Mahonian polynomials have each been the subject of extensive studies in Combinatorics, with particular attention to their signed versions. In contrast, the joint study of cyclotomic Euler-Mahonian polynomials has received far less consideration. To the best of our knowledge, the only prior result in this direction is a formula due to Wachs for the signed Euler-Mahonian polynomials in the even case. In this paper, we focus on the cyclotomic Euler-Mahonian polynomials and derive a formula based on the Hadamard product.
  As corollaries, we obtain the $I$-analogue (where $I=\sqrt{-1}$) of Wachs' formula for signed Euler-Mahonian polynomials, as well as the previously missing odd case for the signed Euler-Mahonian polynomials.</description>

      <title>Linear maps preserving the Cullis' determinant. I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is the first in the series of papers devoted to the explicit description of linear maps preserving the Cullis' determinant of rectangular matrices with entries belonging to an arbitrary ground field which is large enough.
  The Cullis' determinant is defined for every matrix of size $n\times k$, where $n \ge k \ge 1$ and is equal to the ordinary determinant if $n = k$. In this paper we solve the linear preserver problem for the Cullis' determinant for $k \ge 4, n \ge k + 2$ and $n + k$ is even. It appears that in this case all linear maps preserving the Cullis' determinant are non-singular and could be represented by two-sided matrix multiplication.
  Note that the cases where $n = k$ or $n = k + 1$ admit slightly different description allowing (sub)matrix transposition and were completely studied before: the case where $n = k$ is a classical linear preserver problem for the ordinary determinant and was solved by Frobenius; the complete characterisation for the case where $n = k + 1$ was obtained in the previous paper by the authors.</description>

Abstract: This paper is the second in the series of papers devoted to the explicit description of linear maps preserving the Cullis' determinant of rectangular matrices with entries belonging to an arbitrary ground field which is large enough.
  In this part we solve the linear preserver problem for the Cullis' determinant defined on the spaces of matrices of size $n\times k$ with $k \ge 4,\; n \ge k + 2$ and $n + k$ is odd.
  In comparison with the case when $n + k$ is even, in this case linear maps preserving the Cullis' determinant could be singular and are represented as a sum of two linear maps: first is two-sided matrix multiplication and second is any linear map whose image consists of matrices, all rows of which are equal.</description>

Abstract: We show that if a subset $\Psi$ of the ends of a graph $G$ can be displayed by a tree-decomposition of finite adhesion, then it can also be displayed by a linked such tree-decomposition. This tree-decomposition captures all combinatorial information of the ends in $\Psi$: their degrees, their sets of dominating vertices, and their combined degrees.</description>

      <title>Peripheral hyper-Wiener index of a graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we introduce a new topological index of a graph G that we term peripheral hyper-Wiener index, denoted PWW(G). It is a natural extension of the peripheral Wiener index PW(G) initiated in [NB17] and is to the peripheral Wiener index what the hyper-Wiener index is to the Wiener index. We investigate its basic properties. We compute the peripheral hyper-Wiener index of the cartesian product and trees. In particular, we get an explicit formula for the case of the hypercubes. We also give lower and upper bounds on PW(G) and PWW(G) in terms of the order, size, diameter and the number of peripheral vertices. This paper is an echo to [NB17], most of the results we get are analogues of the ones therein.</description>

      <title>On the transmission irregular trees with the maximum Wiener index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transmission of a vertex $v$ in a (chemical) graph $G$ is the sum of distances from $v$ to other vertices in $G$. If any two vertices of $G$ have different transmissions, then $G$ is transmission irregular. The Wiener index $W(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the sum of all distances between all unordered pairs of vertices in $G$, which has another formula as the half of the sum of transmissions of all vertices of $G$. In this paper, we consider the Wiener index maximization problem on the set of transmission irregular trees of a given order $n \in \mathbb{N}$. We solve the problem for all odd values of $n$ and for almost all even values of $n$. Each resolved extremal problem has a unique solution that is a chemical tree.</description>

      <title>Laplacian Spectrum of cozero-divisor graphs of commutative polynomial rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cozero-divisor graph of a commutative ring $R$, denoted $\Gamma'(R)$, is the graph whose vertices are the non-zero and non-unit elements of $R$, with two distinct vertices $x$ and $y$ adjacent if and only if $x \notin Ry$ and $y \notin Rx$. This paper studies the structural properties of $\Gamma'(R)$ for the polynomial ring $R = \Z_n[x]/(x^2)$, where $n$ has the prime power decomposition of $p_1^{a_1}p_2^{a_2}\cdots p_q^{a_q}$. We provide a complete structure of the cozero-divisor graph for all $n$ up to cubic prime power decompositions. Furthermore, we determine the Laplacian spectrum of these graphs. Finally, we discuss the connectivity of such a cozero-divisor graph of the polynomial rings for any $n$. Our work provides the first comprehensive spectral analysis of cozero-divisor graphs for non-local polynomial rings and establishes powerful new techniques for bridging commutative algebra with spectral graph theory.</description>

      <title>Large Components and Trees of Random Mappings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{T}_n$ be the set of all mappings $T:[n]\to[n]$, where $[n]=\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$. The corresponding graph $G_T$ of $T$, called a functional digraph, is a union of disjoint connected components. Each component is a directed cycle of rooted labeled trees. We assume that each $T\in\mathcal{T}_n$ is chosen uniformly at random from the set $\mathcal{T}_n$. The components and trees of $G_T$ are distinguished by their size. In this paper, we compute the limiting conditional probability ($n\to\infty$) that a vertex from the largest component of the random graph $G_T$, chosen uniformly at random from $[n]$, belongs to its $s$-th largest tree, where $s\ge 1$ is a fixed integer. This limit can be also viewed as an approximation of the probability that the $s$-th largest tree of $G_T$ is a subgraph of its largest component, which is a solution of a problem suggested by Mutafchiev and Finch (2024).</description>

      <title>Optimal non-adaptive algorithm for edge estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a simple nonadaptive randomized algorithm that estimates the number of edges in a simple, unweighted, undirected graph, possibly containing isolated vertices, using only degree and random edge queries. For an $n$-vertex graph, our method requires only $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{n})$ queries, achieving sublinear query complexity. The algorithm independently samples a set of vertices and queries their degrees, and also independently samples a set of edges, using the answers to these queries to estimate the total number of edges in the graph. We further prove a matching lower bound, establishing the optimality of our algorithm and resolving the non-adaptive query complexity of this problem with respect to degree and random-edge queries.</description>

      <title>Skew-symmetrizable cluster algebras from surfaces and symmetric quivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study skew-symmetrizable cluster algebras $\mathcal{A}$ associated with unpunctured surfaces $\mathbf{S}$ endowed with an orientation-preserving involution $\sigma$. Cluster variables of $\mathcal{A}$ correspond to $\sigma$-orbits of arcs of $\mathbf{S}$, while clusters are given by admissible $\sigma$-invariant ideal triangulations. We provide a cluster expansion formula for any $\sigma$-orbit $[\gamma]$ in terms of perfect matchings of some labeled modified snake graphs constructed from the arcs of $[\gamma]$. Then, we associate a symmetric finite-dimensional algebra $A$ to any seed of $\mathcal{A}$, such that non-initial cluster variables bijectively correspond to orthogonal indecomposable $A$-modules. Finally, we exhibit a purely representation-theoretic map from the category of orthogonal $A$-modules to $\mathcal{A}$.
  If $\mathbf{S}$ is a regular polygon, we recover the results proved in arXiv:2403.11308, arXiv:2405.14915, and arXiv:2502.06410 for cluster algebras of type B.</description>

      <title>Optimal Mistake Bounds for Transductive Online Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We resolve a 30-year-old open problem concerning the power of unlabeled data in online learning by tightly quantifying the gap between transductive and standard online learning. In the standard setting, the optimal mistake bound is characterized by the Littlestone dimension $d$ of the concept class $H$ (Littlestone 1987). We prove that in the transductive setting, the mistake bound is at least $\Omega(\sqrt{d})$. This constitutes an exponential improvement over previous lower bounds of $\Omega(\log\log d)$, $\Omega(\sqrt{\log d})$, and $\Omega(\log d)$, due respectively to Ben-David, Kushilevitz, and Mansour (1995, 1997) and Hanneke, Moran, and Shafer (2023). We also show that this lower bound is tight: for every $d$, there exists a class of Littlestone dimension $d$ with transductive mistake bound $O(\sqrt{d})$. Our upper bound also improves upon the best known upper bound of $(2/3)d$ from Ben-David, Kushilevitz, and Mansour (1997). These results establish a quadratic gap between transductive and standard online learning, thereby highlighting the benefit of advance access to the unlabeled instance sequence. This contrasts with the PAC setting, where transductive and standard learning exhibit similar sample complexities.</description>

Abstract: The equation commonly known as Sury's identity is a deceptively simple summation formula that connects the Lucas numbers, Fibonacci numbers, and powers of two. Many authors have given extensions and generalizations over the years; in this paper, we take a different approach that allows us to produce a good number of new summation formulas, all from elementary (but non-trivial) methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A lattice polytope $\mathcal{P} \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ of dimension $n$ is called level* if (i) $\mathcal{P}$ is normal, (ii) $(\mathcal{P} \setminus \partial \mathcal{P}) \cap \mathbb{Z}^n \neq \emptyset$ and (iii) for each $N = 2,3, \ldots$ and for each $\textbf{a} \in N(\mathcal{P} \setminus \partial \mathcal{P}) \cap \mathbb{Z}^n$, there is $\textbf{a}_0 \in (\mathcal{P} \setminus \partial \mathcal{P}) \cap \mathbb{Z}^n$ together with $\textbf{a}' \in (N-1)\mathcal{P} \cap \mathbb{Z}^n$ for which $\textbf{a} = \textbf{a}_0 + \textbf{a}'$, where $N\mathcal{P} = \{N\textbf{a} : \textbf{a} \in \mathcal{P}\}$. A normal polytope $\mathcal{P} \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ of dimension $n$ is called pseudo-Gorenstein* [4] if $
|(\mathcal{P} \setminus \partial \mathcal{P}) \cap \mathbb{Z}^n| = 1. $ A pseudo-Gorenstein* polytope $\mathcal{P}$ is level* if and only if $\mathcal{P}$ is reflexive up to translation. In the present paper, level* polytopes together with pseudo-Gorenstein* polytopes arising from discrete polymatroids of bounded powers of edge ideals are studied.</description>

      <title>Numeration systems without a dominant root and regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Positional numeration systems are a large family of numeration systems used to represent natural numbers. Whether the set of all representations forms a regular language or not is one of the most important questions that can be asked of such a system. This question was investigated in a 1998 article by Hollander. Central to his analysis is a property linking positional numeration systems and R\'{e}nyi numeration systems, which use a real base to represent real numbers. However, this link only exists when the initial numeration system has a dominant root, which is not a necessary condition for regularity. In this article, we show a more general link between positional numeration systems and alternate base numeration systems, a family generalizing R\'{e}nyi systems. We then take advantage of this link to provide a full characterization of those numeration systems that generate a regular language. We also discuss the effectiveness of our method, and comment Hollander's results and conjecture in the light of ours.</description>

      <title>Kernelization dichotomies for hitting minors under structural parameterizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a finite collection of connected graphs $\mathcal{F}$, the $\mathcal{F}$-MINOR-DELETION problem consists in, given a graph $G$ and an integer $\ell$, deciding whether $G$ contains a vertex set of size at most $\ell$ whose removal results in an $\mathcal{F}$-minor-free graph. We lift the existence of (approximate) polynomial kernels for $\mathcal{F}$-MINOR-DELETION by the solution size to (approximate) polynomial kernels parameterized by the vertex-deletion distance to graphs of bounded elimination distance to $\mathcal{F}$-minor-free graphs. This results in exact polynomial kernels for every family $\mathcal{F}$ that contains a planar graph, and an approximate polynomial kernel for PLANAR VERTEX DELETION. Moreover, combining our result with a previous lower bound, we obtain the following infinite set of dichotomies, assuming $NP \not\subseteq coNP/poly$: for any finite set $\mathcal{F}$ of biconnected graphs on at least three vertices containing a planar graph, and any minor-closed class of graphs $\mathcal{C}$, $\mathcal{F}$-MINOR-DELETION admits a polynomial kernel parameterized by the vertex-deletion distance to $\mathcal{C}$ if and only if $\mathcal{C}$ has bounded elimination distance to $\mathcal{F}$-minor-free graphs. For instance, this yields dichotomies for CACTUS VERTEX DELETION, OUTERPLANAR VERTEX DELETION, and TREEWIDTH-$t$ VERTEX DELETION for every integer $t \geq 0$. Prior to our work, such dichotomies were only known for the particular cases of VERTEX COVER and FEEDBACK VERTEX SET. Our approach builds on the techniques developed by Jansen and Pieterse [Theor. Comput. Sci. 2020] and also uses adaptations of some of the results by Jansen, de Kroon, and Wlodarczyk [STOC 2021].</description>

      <title>Space Efficient Algorithms for Parameterised Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study "space efficient" FPT algorithms for graph problems with limited memory. Let n be the size of the input graph and k be the parameter. We present algorithms that run in time f(k)*poly(n) and use g(k)*polylog(n) working space, where f and g are functions of k alone, for k-Path, MaxLeaf SubTree and Multicut in Trees. These algorithms are motivated by big-data settings where very large problem instances must be solved, and using poly(n) memory is prohibitively expensive. They are also theoretically interesting, since most of the standard methods tools, such as deleting a large set of vertices or edges, are unavailable, and we must a develop different way to tackle them.</description>

      <title>Tropical KP Theory on Banana Curves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) equation is the cornerstone of integrable systems, whose solutions reflect deep connections in algebraic geometry. Banana curves are reducible rational curves obtained as a degeneration of hyperelliptic curves. In this work, we relate the family of KP multi-solitons arising from banana curves together with non-special divisors of fixed degree to the combinatorics of the tropical theta divisor of the curve. We describe the Voronoi and Delaunay polytopes and show that the latter are combinatorially equivalent to uniform matroid polytopes. As a consequence, the combinatorics of the tropical theta divisor canonically encodes the matroid and Grassmannian structures underlying the associated KP multi-soliton solutions. We define the Hirota variety of a banana graph, which parametrizes all tau functions arising from such a graph. Starting from the matroid arising from Delaunay polytopes and the periods in the tropical limit, we construct an explicit parametrization of this variety which realizes the tau function as a multi-soliton. Our framework specializes naturally to real and positive settings.</description>

      <title>Machine learning discovers new champion codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Linear error-correcting codes form the mathematical backbone of modern digital communication and storage systems, but identifying champion linear codes (linear codes achieving or exceeding the best known minimum Hamming distance) remains challenging. By training a transformer to predict the minimum Hamming distance of a class of linear codes and pairing it with a genetic algorithm over the search space, we develop a novel method for discovering champion codes. This model effectively reduces the search space of linear codes needed to achieve champion codes. Our results present the use of this method in the study and construction of error-correcting codes, applicable to codes such as generalised toric, Reed-Muller, Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem, algebrogeometric, and potentially quantum codes.</description>

      <title>Tropical Invariants for Permutation Group Actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the action of a permutation group $G$ of order $k$ on the tropical polynomial semiring in $n$ variables. We prove that the sub-semiring of invariant polynomials is finitely generated if and only if $G$ is generated by $2$-cycles. There do exist finitely many separating invariants of degree at most $\max\{n,{n\choose 2}\}$. Separating tropical invariants can be used to construct bi-Lipschitz embeddings of the orbit space ${\mathbb R}^n/G$ into Euclidean space. We also show that the invariant polynomials of degree $\leq n p_1p_2\cdots p_k$ generate the semifield of invariant rational tropical functions, where $p_1,p_2,\dots,p_k$ are the first $k$ prime numbers. Most results are also true over arbitrary semirings that are additively idempotent and multiplicatively cancellative.</description>

      <title>Hyper-Minrank: A Unified Hypergraph Characterization of Multi-Sender Index Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a hypergraph formulation that generalizes the classical paradigm of Bar-Yossef et al. to the multi-sender index coding (MSIC) setting. Central to the model is a 4-regular side-information hypergraph G, a new adjacency representation A_G = [A_1 ... A_N], and a simple fitting criterion for sub-hypergraph validity, in the presence of specially designed hyperedges that capture both side information and cross-sender signal cancellation. This formulation establishes a tight achievability-converse equivalence for the general N-sender, K-receiver problem: every valid fitting induces a valid linear multi-sender index code, every linear code induces a valid fitting, and the optimal scalar linear broadcast length equals the hyper-minrank l**lin(G) = hyperminrank(G) = min*{A fits G} sum_{n=1}^N rank(A_n). Beyond this exact characterization, the approach yields hypergraph analogues of Haemers-type bounds on the broadcast length, including a clique-cover upper bound and a lower bound via the clique number of a carefully defined complement hypergraph. Algorithmically, we provide an exact procedure to compute hyperminrank(G), and show that in certain regimes its complexity is asymptotically better than approximate LT-CMAR solutions. The framework captures well-known settings such as embedded index coding, and applies directly to multi-sender cache-aided communications, coded computation, distributed storage, and edge/satellite systems, where hyperminrank can serve as a unified design target.</description>

      <title>When is a cut and project set substitutional?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cut and project sets are obtained by projecting an irrational slice through a lattice to a lower dimensional subspace. Under standard conditions, the resulting pattern has no translational periods even though it retains some regularity of the lattice. Cut and project sets are one of the archetypical examples of patterns featuring aperiodic order, the other construction methods being by substitution and matching rules. Many early examples of aperiodic tilings, including the famous Penrose and Ammann--Beenker tilings, have a description from all of these methods. In this article we answer the following question, in the case of a Euclidean total space: what property of the cut and project data characterises when the resulting cut and project sets may also be defined by a substitution rule?</description>

      <description>arXiv:1703.02147v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We solve a problem in enumerative combinatorics which is equivalent to counting topological types of certain group actions on compact Riemann surfaces. Let $V_2(F_p)$ be the two-dimensional vector space over $F_p$, the field with $p$ elements, $p$ an odd prime. We count orbits of the general linear group $GL_2(F_p)$ on certain multisets consisting of $R \geq 3$ non-zero columns from $V_2(F_p)$. The $R$-multisets are `zero-sum,' that is, the sum (mod $p$) over the columns in the multiset is $[\begin{smallmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{smallmatrix}]$. The orbit count yields the number of topological types of fully ramified actions of the elementary abelian $p$-group of rank $2$ on compact Riemann surfaces of genus $1+ Rp(p-1)/2-p^2.$</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.16760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For graphs $G, H_1,\dots,H_r$, write $G \to (H_1, \ldots, H_r)$ to denote the property that whenever we $r$-colour the edges of $G$, there is a monochromatic copy of $H_i$ in colour $i$ for some $i \in \{1,\dots,r\}$. Mousset, Nenadov and Samotij proved an upper bound on the threshold function for the property that $G_{n,p} \to (H_1,\dots,H_r)$, thereby resolving the $1$-statement of the Kohayakawa--Kreuter conjecture. We reduce the $0$-statement of the Kohayakawa--Kreuter conjecture to a natural deterministic colouring problem and resolve this problem for almost all cases, which in particular includes (but is not limited to) when $H_2$ is strictly $2$-balanced and either has density greater than $2$ or is not bipartite. In addition, we extend our reduction to hypergraphs, proving the colouring problem in almost all cases there as well.</description>

Abstract: A vertex coloring of a graph $G$ is called a $2$-distance coloring if any two vertices at a distance at most $2$ from each other receive different colors. Recently, Bousquet et al. (Discrete Mathematics, 346(4), 113288, 2023) proved that $2\Delta+7$ colors are sufficient for the $2$-distance coloring of planar graphs with maximum degree $\Delta\geq 9$. In this paper, we strengthen their result by removing the maximum degree constraint and show that all planar graphs admit a 2-distance $(2\Delta+7)$-coloring. This particularly improves the result of Van den Heuvel and McGuinness (Journal of Graph Theory, 42(2), 110-124, 2003).</description>

Abstract: This paper studies the stability of tensor ranks under field extensions. Our main contributions are fourfold: (1) We prove that the analytic rank is stable under field extensions. (2) We establish the equivalence between the partition rank vs. analytic rank conjecture and the stability conjecture for partition rank. We also prove that they are equivalent to other two important conjectures. (3) We resolve the Adiprasito-Kazhdan-Ziegler conjecture on the stability of the slice rank of linear subspaces under field extensions. (4) As an application of (1), we show that the geometric rank is equal to the analytic rank up to a constant factor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18637v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a graph family $\mathcal F$, let $\mathrm{ex}(n,\mathcal F)$ and $\mathrm{spex}(n,\mathcal F)$ denote the maximum number of edges and maximum spectral radius of an $n$-vertex $\mathcal F$-free graph, respectively, and let $\mathrm{EX}(n,\mathcal F)$ and $\mathrm{SPEX}(n,\mathcal F)$ denote the corresponding sets of extremal graphs. Wang, Kang, and Xue showed that if $r\ge 2$ and $\mathrm{ex}(n,F)=e(T_{n,r})+O(1)$ then $\mathrm{SPEX}(n,\mathcal F)\subseteq\mathrm{EX}(n,\mathcal F)$ for $n$ large enough. Fang, Tait, and Zhai extended this result by showing if $e(T_{n,r})\le\mathrm{ex}(n,\mathcal F)&lt;e(T_{n,r})+\lfloor n/2r\rfloor$ then $\mathrm{SPEX}(n,\mathcal F)\subseteq\mathrm{EX}(n,\mathcal F)$ for $n$ large enough, and asked for the maximum constant $c(r)$ such that $\mathrm{ex}(n,\mathcal F)\le e(T_{n,r})+(c(r)-\varepsilon)n$ guarantees such containment. In this paper we determine $c(r)$ exactly for all $r\ge 3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18842v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For positive integers $s,t,m$ and $n$, the Zarankiewicz number $z(m,n;s,t)$ is the maximum number of edges in a subgraph of $K_{m,n}$ that has no complete bipartite subgraph containing $s$ vertices in the part of size $m$ and $t$ vertices in the part of size $n$. The best general upper bound on Zarankiewicz numbers is a bound due to Roman that can be viewed as the optimal value of a simple linear program. Here we show that in many cases this bound can be improved by adding additional constraints to this linear program. This allows us to prove new upper bounds on Zarankiewicz numbers for many small parameter sets. We are also able to establish a new family of closed form upper bounds on $z(m,n;s,t)$ that captures much, but not all, of the power of the new constraints. This bound generalises a recent result of Chen, Horsley and Mammoliti that applied only in the case $s=2$.</description>

Abstract: Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a positive integer cone and $k\in \mathcal{C}$. A $\mathcal{C}$-semigroup $S$ is $k$-positioned if for every $h\in \mathcal{C}\setminus S$ we have that $k-h$ belongs to $S$. In this work, we focus on this family of semigroups and introduce primary positioned $\mathcal{C}$-semigroups, characterizing a subfamily of them through the perspective of irreducibility. Furthermore, we provide some procedures to compute all such semigroups, describing a family of graphs containing all the primary positioned $\mathcal{C}$-semigroups for a fixed $k\in \mathcal{C}$.</description>

Abstract: A real matrix is said to be positive if its every entry is positive, and a real square matrix A is algebraically positive if there exists a real polynomial f such that f(A) is a positive matrix. A sign pattern matrix A is said to require a property if all matrices having sign pattern as A have that property. In this paper, we characterize all sign pattern matrices associated with cycle graphs that require algebraic positivity.</description>

Abstract: We show that every graph $G$ on $n$ vertices with $\delta(G) \geq (1/2+\varepsilon)n$ is spanned by a complete blow-up of a cycle with clusters of nearly uniform size $\Omega(\log n)$. The proof is based on a recently introduced approach for finding vertex-spanning substructures via blow-up covers.</description>

      <title>Regularities of Typical Sigma Index on Caterpillar Trees of Pendent Vertices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10469v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, topological indices play a significant role in the analysis of caterpillar trees, especially due to their applications in chemical graph theory. We presented a study on topological indices related to the Sigma index, which we carefully selected on caterpillar trees with multiple levels. Through the election of these topological indices, we provide efficient models of these indices on caterpillar trees, as it is known that the Albertson index is the basis on which most of the topological indices are built and we have shown this through the close correlation between the Albertson's index and the Sigma index.</description>

Abstract: Let $G$ be a group. The directed endomorphism graph, \dend of $G$ is a directed graph with vertex set $G$ and there is a directed edge from the vertex `$a$' to the vertex `$\, b$' $(a \neq b) $ if and only if there exists an endomorphism on $G$ mapping $a$ to $b$. The endomorphism graph, \uend $\,$ of $G$ is the corresponding undirected simple graph. The automorphism graph, ${Auto}(G)$ of $G$ is an undirected graph with vertex set $G$ and there is an edge from the vertex `$a$' to the vertex `$\,b$' $(a \neq b) $ if and only if there exists an automorphism on $G$ mapping $a$ to $b$. We have explored graph theoretic properties like size, planarity, girth etc. and tried finding out for which types of groups these graphs are complete, diconnected, trees, bipartite and so on.</description>

      <title>Topological Indices With Degree Sequence $\mathscr{D}$ of Tree</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12909v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we refer to a asymptotic degree sequence as $\mathscr{D}=(d_1,d_2,\dots,d_n)$. The examination of topological indices on trees gives us a general overview through bounds to find the maximum and minimum bounds which reflect the maximum and minimum number of edges incident to every vertex in the graph, Albertson index known as $\sum_{uv\in E(G)}\lvert d_u(G)-d_v(G) \rvert$, Sigma index $\sigma(G)$ among $\mathscr{D}$ of tree $T$ when $d_n\geqslant \dots \geqslant d_1$. According to the first zegrb we show for a degree sequence of order $n=4$, $\operatorname{irr}(T)=M_1(T)^2-2\sqrt{M_1(T)}+\sum_{i=1}^4\left|x_i-x_{i+1}\right|-(b+c)-1$.</description>

      <title>Configurations, Tessellations and Tone Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08752v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Eulerian tonnetz, which associates three minor chords to each major chord and three major chords to each minor chord, can be represented by a bipartite graph with twelve white vertices denoting major chords and twelve black vertices denoting minor chords. This so-called Levi graph determines a configuration of twelve points and twelve lines in $\mathbb R^2$ with the property that three points lie on each line and three lines pass through each point. Interesting features of the tonnetz, such as the existence of the four hexatonic hexacycles and the three octatonic octacycles, crucial for the understanding of nineteenth-century harmony and voice leading, can be read off rather directly as properties of this $\{12_3\}$ and its Levi graph. Analogous tone networks together with their associated Levi graphs and configurations can be constructed for pentatonic music and twelve-tone music, offering the promise of new methods of composition. When the constraints of the Eulerian tonnetz are relaxed so as to allow movements between major and minor triads with variations at exactly two tones, the resulting bipartite graph has two components, each of which generates a tessellation of the plane, of a type known to Kepler, based on hexagons, squares and dodecagons. When the same combinatorial idea is applied to tetrachords of the Tristan genus (dominant sevenths and minor sixths) the cycles of the resulting bipartite graph are sufficiently ample in girth to ensure the existence of a second geometrical configuration of type $\{12_3\}$, distinct from the Eulerian tonnetz as an incidence geometry, which can be used as the basis for a new approach to the analysis of the music of Chopin, Wagner, Tchaikovsky, Brahms and their contemporaries.</description>

      <title>Extremal Degree Irregularity Bounds for Albertson and Sigma Indices in Trees and Bipartite Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14568v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, the study of extreme value bounds for topological indices is crucial for understanding their influence on trees and bipartite graphs. For integers $\alpha, p$ satisfying $1 \leq p \leq \alpha \leq \Delta - 3$, the minimum Albertson index $\operatorname{irr}_{\min}$ has the following lower bound: $$ \operatorname{irr}_{\min} \geq \Delta^2 (\Delta - 1) \frac{2^{\alpha}}{(\Delta - p)^2}. $$ This work examines the maximum and minimum values of the Albertson index in bipartite graphs, depending on the sizes of their bipartition sets. Utilizing a known corollary, explicit formulas and bounds are derived to characterize the irregularity measure under various vertex size conditions. Additionally, upper bounds for the Albertson and Sigma indices are established using graph parameters such as degrees and edge counts. The theoretical findings are illustrated with examples and inequalities involving degree sequences, advancing the understanding of extremal irregularity behavior in bipartite graphs.</description>

      <title>Extremal Bounds on the Properties of Sigma and Albertson Indices for Non-Decreasing Degree Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish bounds on the topological index -- the Sigma index -- focusing on analyzing the upper bound of its maximum value, which is known as $\sigma_{\max}(\mathcal{S}) = \max \{\sigma(\mathscr{G}) \mid \mathscr{G} \in \mathcal{S}\}$, where $\mathcal{S}$ is a class of graphs. We establish precise lower and upper bounds for the Sigma index by leveraging degree sequences $\mathscr{D} = (d_1, d_2, \dots, d_n)$, $\mathscr{R} = (t_1, t_2, \dots, t_m)$, and $\mathscr{A} = (a_1, a_2, \dots, a_r)$.
  The minimum bound for the Albertson index related to the Sigma index bounds incorporates terms such as $\mathrm{irr}(T)$ and $\left\lfloor \frac{n-2}{a_r - t_m} \right\rfloor $. These results, rooted in extremal graph theory, enhance the understanding of topological indices in molecular and network analysis.</description>

Abstract: Recently, bidirected graphs have received increasing attention from the graph theory community with both structural and algorithmic results. Bidirected graphs are a generalization of directed graphs, consisting of an undirected graph together with a map assigning each endpoint of every edge either sign $+$ or $-$. The connectivity properties of bidirected graphs are more complex than those of directed graphs and not yet well understood. In this paper, we show a structure theorem about rooted connectivity in bidirected graphs in terms of directed graphs. As applications, we prove Lov\'asz' flame theorem, Pym's theorem and a strong variant of Menger's theorem for a class of bidirected graphs and provide counterexamples in the general case.</description>

We establish precise lower and upper bounds for the Sigma index, leveraging a non-increasing degree sequence $\mathscr{D} = (d_1, d_2, \dots, d_n)$, A fundamental challenge in the study of topological indices lies in establishing precise bounds, as such findings illuminate intrinsic relationships among diverse indices.</description>

Abstract: The theory of graphons has proven to be a powerful tool in many areas of graph theory. In this paper, we introduce several foundational aspects of the theory of digraphons -- asymmetric two-variable functions that arise as limits of sequences of directed graphs (digraphs). Our results address their decomposition into strongly connected components, periodicity, spectral properties, and asymptotic behaviour of their large powers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19490v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores the irregularity properties of trees with prescribed degree sequences by analyzing two prominent topological indices: the Albertson index and the sigma index.
  With a particular emphasis on caterpillar trees -frequently used to model molecular chains- we derive a closed-form expression for the Albertson index: \[ \mathrm{irr}(\mathscr{C}(n,m)) = m(m+1)n - 2m + 2, \quad \text{for } n \geq 3. \] Furthermore, we establish extremal bounds for both indices across tree families characterized by fixed degree sequences. The results yield a unified analytical framework for comparing linear and quadratic irregularity measures, and provide new structural insights relevant to applications in chemical graph theory and extremal graph analysis.</description>

      <title>A new spectral Tur\'an theorem for weighted graphs and consequences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Confirming a conjecture of Elphick and Edwards and strengthening a spectral theorem of Wilf, Nikiforov proved that for any $K_{r+1}$-free graph $G$, $\lambda(G)^2 \leq 2 (1 - 1/r) m$, where $\lambda(G)$ is the spectral radius of $G$, and $m$ is the number of edges of $G$. This result was later improved in \cite{LiuN26}, where it was shown that for any graph $G$, $\lambda(G)^2 \leq 2 \sum_{e \in E(G)} \frac{\mathrm{cl}(e) - 1}{\mathrm{cl}(e)}$, where $\mathrm{cl}(e)$ denotes the order of the largest clique containing the edge $e$. In this paper, we further extend this inequality to weighted graphs, proving that \[ \lambda(G)^2 \leq 2 \sum_{e \in E(G)} \frac{\mathrm{cl}(e) - 1}{\mathrm{cl}(e)} w(e)^2, \] and we characterize all extremal graphs attaining this bound. Our main theorem yields several new consequences, including two vertex-based and vertex-degree-based local versions of Tur\'an's theorem, as well as weighted generalizations of the Edwards--Elphick theorem and the Cvetkovi\'c theorem, and two localized versions of Wilf's theorems. One of these localized Wilf's theorem confirms a conjecture that originates from Probability and Operator Algebras and was proposed by R. Tripathi independently of us. Moreover, our main result unifies and implies numerous earlier ones from spectral graph theory and extremal graph theory, including Stanley's spectral inequality, Hong's inequality, a localized Tur\'an-type theorem, and a recent extremal theorem by Adak and Chandran. Notably, while Nikiforov's earlier spectral inequality implied Stanley's bound, it did not imply Hong's inequality -- a gap that is now bridged by our result. As a key tool, we establish the inequality $\sum_{e \in E(G)} \frac{2}{\mathrm{cl}(e)} \geq n-1$, which complements an upper bound $\sum_{e \in E(G)} \frac{2}{\mathrm{cl}(e)-1} \leq n^2 - 2m$ due to Brada\v{c}, and Malec and Tompkins, independently.</description>

      <title>Growing Avoiders from the Right: An Operator-Theoretic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06118v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: (Work in progress) Marcus and Tardos \cite{MarcusTardos2004} proved the Stanley--Wilf conjecture by reducing pattern avoidance to an extremal problem on $0$--$1$ matrices. We give a parallel proof for classical permutation patterns that stays entirely in the ``grow from the right'' world of enumerative combinatorics. A $v$-avoiding permutation is built by right insertion; at each step we keep a pruned family of locations of $(k{-}1)$-partial occurrences of $v$ (the \emph{frontier}), each carrying its forbidden rank interval. The insertion step then induces a nonnegative transfer operator on a doubly weighted $\ell^\infty$ space. A quadratic penalty in the length makes this operator bounded, and a Neumann-series argument on a natural separable predual yields analyticity of the growth series, hence finite exponential growth for $\Av(v)$.
  The formulation is completely internal -- we never pass to $0$--$1$ matrices -- and it cleanly separates the pattern-dependent combinatorics of the frontier from a purely operator-theoretic core. In particular, we obtain an abstract ``right-insertion/transfer-operator'' theorem: any system whose frontier grows at most linearly and whose transfer operator satisfies a uniform quadratic length bound has an analytic growth series.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02314v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fox's conjecture (1962) states that the sequence of absolute values of the coefficients of the Alexander polynomial of alternating links is trapezoidal. While the conjecture remains open in general, a number of special cases have been settled, some quite recently: Fox's conjecture was shown to hold for special alternating links by Hafner, M\'esz\'aros, and Vidinas (2023) and for certain diagrammatic Murasugi sums of special alternating links by Azarpendar, Juh\'asz, and K\'alm\'an (2024). In this paper, we give an alternative proof of Azarpendar, Juh\'asz, and K\'alm\'an's aforementioned beautiful result via a dimer model for the Alexander polynomial. In doing so, we not only obtain a significantly shorter proof of Azarpendar, Juh\'asz, and K\'alm\'an's result than the original, but we also obtain several theorems of independent interest regarding the Alexander polynomial, which are readily visible from the dimer point of view.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate three properties conjectured to hold for a certain function by Levin (2025) in a study of the blimpy graphical shape of the number of bit strings with a given score under an interesting scoring system. The properties include discrete convexity, a simple formula for the greatest argument at which the function is negative, and a positive expectation under a certain probability function. A new set of inequalities which imply the latter is presented and proved under some monotonicity assumptions.</description>

Abstract: We study a conductance-weighted arboricity for a finite simple undirected graph $G=(V,E,c)$ with a conductance assignment $c:E\to[0,\infty)$: \[ A_c(G):=\max\bigl\{ D_c(H): H\subseteq G\text{ connected}, |V(H)|\ge 2 \bigr\},\qquad D_c(H):=\frac{\sum_{e\in E(H)}c(e)}{|V(H)|-1}. \] This functional reduces to the classical Nash--Williams identity when $c\equiv 1$, is isomorphism invariant, monotone under subgraphs and edge additions, positively homogeneous, and convex. We prove sharp global bounds \[ \max_{e\in E}c(e)\le A_c(G)\le\sum_{e\in E}c(e), \] with attainment by some connected subgraph. On the analytic side, we introduce a local variant and derive conductance--resistance inequalities using effective resistances in the ambient network. If $R^{G}_{\mathrm{eff}}(e)$ denotes the effective resistance between the endpoints of $e$ in $G$, we show that every connected $H\subseteq G$ satisfies \[ \sum_{e\in E(H)}c(e)\,R^{G}_{\mathrm{eff}}(e)\le |V(H)|-1, \] which in turn yields the upper bound \[ D_c(H)\le\sqrt{\frac{\sum_{e\in E(H)}c(e)/R^{G}_{\mathrm{eff}}(e)}{|V(H)|-1}} \] and hence an explicit effective resistance-based upper bound on $A_c(G)$. On the structural side, we describe the algebraic behavior of $A_c(G)$. We show that under edge-disjoint union, $A_c(G)$ behaves as a max invariant: for a finite disjoint union of weighted graphs one has $A_c(G)= \max_i A_{c_i}(G_i)$. In particular, disjoint union induces a commutative idempotent monoid structure at the level of isomorphism classes, with $A_c(G)$ idempotent with respect to this operation. We also provide a computational exhibit on the hypercube family $Q_d$, including random conductance sampling, illustrating numerical evaluation of the resulting resistance-based bound.</description>

      <title>Magic Gems: A Polyhedral Framework for Magic Squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce Magic Gems, a geometric representation of magic squares as three-dimensional polyhedra. By mapping an n times n magic square onto a centered coordinate grid with cell values as vertical displacements, we construct a point cloud whose convex hull defines the Magic Gem. Building on prior work connecting magic squares to physical properties such as moment of inertia, this construction reveals an explicit statistical structure: we show that magic squares have vanishing covariances between position and value. We develop a covariance energy functional (the sum of squared covariances with individual row, column, and diagonal indicator variables) and prove that for all n great thank or equal to 3, an arrangement is a magic square if and only if this complete energy vanishes. This characterization transforms the classical line-sum definition into a statistical orthogonality condition. We also study a simpler low-mode relaxation using only four aggregate position indicators; this coincides with the complete characterization for n = 3 (verified exhaustively) but defines a strictly larger class for n greater than or equal to 4 (explicit counterexamples computed). Perturbation analysis demonstrates that magic squares are isolated local minima in the energy landscape. The representation is invariant under dihedral symmetry D4, yielding canonical geometric objects for equivalence classes.</description>

      <title>Homomorphisms of (n,m)-graphs with respect to generalised switch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.01258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.01258v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of homomorphisms of $(n,m)$-graphs, that is, adjacency preserving vertex mappings of graphs with $n$ types of arcs and $m$ types of edges was initiated by Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il and Raspaud in 2000. Later, some attempts were made to generalize the switch operation that is popularly used in the study of signed graphs, and study its effect on the above mentioned homomorphism.
  In this article, we too provide a generalization of the switch operation on $(n,m)$-graphs, which to the best of our knowledge, encapsulates all the previously known generalizations as special cases. We approach the study of homomorphisms with respect to the switch operation axiomatically. We prove some fundamental results that are essential tools in the further study of this topic. In the process of proving the fundamental results, we have provided yet another solution to an open problem posed by Klostermeyer and MacGillivray in 2004. We also prove the existence of a categorical product for $(n,m)$-graphs with respect to a particular class of generalized switch which implicitly uses category theory. This is a counter intuitive solution as the number of vertices in the Categorical product of two $(n,m)$-graphs on $p$ and $q$ vertices has a multiple of $pq$ many vertices, where the multiple depends on the switch. This solves an open question asked by Brewster in the PEPS 2012 workshop as a corollary. We also provide a way to calculate the product explicitly, and prove general properties of the product. We define the analog of chromatic number for $(n,m)$-graphs with respect to generalized switch and explore the interrelations between chromatic numbers with respect to different switch operations. We find the value of this chromatic number for the family of forests using group theoretic notions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.14368v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a colorful extension of a Helly-type theorem by Danzer and Gr\"{u}nbaum (Combinatorica, 1982) concerning two-piercing families of axis-parallel boxes in $\mathbb{R}^d$. We also show that our result is tight by constructing extremal families that achieve the bound. Related work includes a graph-theoretic proof of the original theorem by Pendavingh, Puite, and Woeginger (Discrete Applied Mathematics, 2008), and a two-piercing result for lower-dimensional boxes by Ba\~{n}os and Oliveros (Acta Mathematica Hungarica, 2018).</description>

      <title>Quantum Rainbow Codes: Achieving Linear Rate, Growing Distance and Transversal Non-Clifford Gates with Generalised Colour Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13130v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce rainbow codes, a novel class of quantum error correcting codes generalising colour codes and pin codes. Rainbow codes can be defined on any $D$-dimensional simplicial complex that admits a valid $(D + 1)$-colouring of its $0$-simplices. We study in detail the case where these simplicial complexes are derived from chain complexes obtained via the hypergraph product and, by reinterpreting these codes as collections of colour codes joined at domain walls, show that we can obtain code families with growing distance and number of encoded qubits as well as logical non-Clifford gates implemented by transversal application of $T$ and $T^\dag$. By combining these techniques with the quasi-hyperbolic colour codes of Zhu et al. (arXiv:2310.16982) we obtain a family of codes with transversal non-Clifford gates and parameters $[\![n, \Theta(n), \Theta(log(n))]\!]$. This is the first example of a family of LDPC codes with linear rate, growing distance and transversal non-Clifford gates, which are necessary conditions for the magic-state distillation parameter $\gamma =\textrm{log}_d (n/k)$ to be made arbitrarily small. In contrast to several other constructions that satisfy these requirements, our codes are natively defined on qubits, are LDPC, and have non-Clifford gates implementable by single-qubit (rather than entangling) physical operations, but are not asymptotically good.</description>

      <title>Profile and neighbourhood complexity of graphs excluding a minor and tree-structured graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08895v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The \emph{$r$-neighbourhood complexity} of a graph $G$ is the function counting, for a given integer $k$, the largest possible number, over all vertex-subsets $A$ of size $k$, of subsets of $A$ realized as the intersection between the $r$-neighbourhood of some vertex and $A$. A~refinement of this notion is the \emph{$r$-profile complexity}, that counts the maximum number of distinct distance-vectors from any vertex to the vertices of $A$, ignoring distances larger than~$r$. Typically, in structured graph classes such as graphs of bounded VC-dimension or chordal graphs, these functions are bounded, leading to insights into their structural properties and efficient algorithms.
  We improve existing bounds on the $r$-profile complexity (and thus on the $r$-neighbourhood complexity) for graphs in several structured graph classes. We show that the $r$-profile complexity of graphs excluding $K_h$ as a minor is in $O_h(r^{3h-3}k)$. For graphs of treewidth at most~$t$, we give a bound in $O_t(r^{t+1}k)$, which is tight up to a function of~$t$ as a factor. These bounds improve results of Joret and Rambaud and answer a question of their paper [Combinatorica, 2024]. We also apply our methods to other classes of bounded expansion such as graphs excluding a fixed complete graph as a subdivision.
  For outerplanar graphs, we can improve our treewidth bound by a factor of $r$ and conjecture that a similar improvement holds for graphs with bounded simple treewidth. For graphs of treelength at most~$\ell$, we give the upper bound of $O(k(r^2(\ell+1)^k))$, which we improve to $O\left (k\cdot (r 2^k + r^2k^2) \right)$ in the case of chordal graphs and $O(k^2r)$ for interval graphs.
  Our bounds also imply relations between the order, diameter and metric dimension of graphs in these classes, improving results from [Beaudou et al., SIDMA 2017].</description>

      <title>Manipulation of social choice correspondences under incomplete information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23141v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the manipulability of social choice correspondences in situations where individuals have incomplete information about others' preferences. We propose a general concept of manipulability that depends on the extension rule used to derive preferences over sets of alternatives from preferences over alternatives, as well as on individuals' level of information. We then focus on the manipulability of social choice correspondences when the Kelly extension rule is used, and individuals are assumed to have the capability to anticipate the outcome of the collective decision. Under these assumptions, we introduce some monotonicity and sensitivity properties for social choice correspondences that combined imply manipulability. Then we prove a result of manipulability for unanimous positional social choice correspondences, and present a detailed analysis of the manipulability properties for the Borda, the plurality, the negative plurality and the Copeland social choice correspondences.</description>

      <title>Correlator Polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19907v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, "cosmohedra" have been introduced as polytopes underlying the cosmological wavefunction for conformally coupled Tr($\Phi^3$) theory in FRW cosmologies, generalizing associahedra for flat space scattering amplitudes. In this letter we show that correlation functions are also directly captured by a new polytope - the "Correlatron". The combinatorics of correlation functions is an interesting blend of flat space scattering amplitudes and wavefunctions. This is reflected in the correlatron geometry, which is a one-higher dimensional polytope sandwiched between cosmohedron and associahedron facets. We provide an explicit embedding for the correlatron, which is a natural extension of the "shaving" picture for cosmohedra to one higher dimension. As a byproduct, we also define "graph correlahedra" as polytopes for the contribution to correlators from any fixed graph. We show how the canonical form of these polytopes directly computes the graph correlator, without the power of two weights seen in previous geometric formulations. Finally, we give a prescription for extracting the full correlator from the canonical form of the correlatron.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10370v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the type A, BC, and D root systems, we determine equivalent conditions between the coefficients of an exponential holomorphic function and the asymptotic values taken by the Dunkl bilinear form when one of its entries is the function. We establish these conditions over the $|\theta N| \rightarrow\infty$ regime for the type A and D root systems and over the $|\theta_0 N|\rightarrow \infty, \frac{\theta_1}{\theta_0 N}\rightarrow c\in\mathbb{C}$ regime for the type BC root system. We also generalize existing equivalent conditions over the $\theta N \rightarrow c\in\mathbb{C}$ regime for the type A root system and over the $\theta_0 N\rightarrow c_0\in\mathbb{C}, \frac{\theta_1}{\theta_0 N}\rightarrow c_1\in\mathbb{C}$ regime for the type BC root system and prove new equivalent conditions over the $\theta N \rightarrow c\in\mathbb{C}$ regime for the type D root system. Furthermore, we determine the asymptotics of the coefficients of the Bessel functions over the regimes that we have mentioned.</description>

      <title>Las Vegas algorithms to generate universal cycles and de Bruijn sequences uniformly at random</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16545v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present practical algorithms for generating universal cycles uniformly at random. In particular, we consider universal cycles for shorthand permutations, subsets and multiset permutations, weak orders, and orientable sequences. Additionally, we consider de Bruijn sequences, weight-range de Bruin sequences, and de Bruijn sequences, with forbidden $0^z$ substring. Each algorithm, seeded with a random element from the given set, applies a random walk of an underlying Eulerian de Bruijn graph to obtain a random arborescence (spanning in-tree). Given the random arborescence and the de Bruijn graph, a corresponding random universal cycle can be generated in constant time per symbol. We present experimental results on the average cover time needed to compute a random arborescence for each object using a Las Vegas algorithm.</description>

Abstract: AlphaEvolve (Novikov et al., 2025) is a generic evolutionary coding agent that combines the generative capabilities of LLMs with automated evaluation in an iterative evolutionary framework that proposes, tests, and refines algorithmic solutions to challenging scientific and practical problems. In this paper we showcase AlphaEvolve as a tool for autonomously discovering novel mathematical constructions and advancing our understanding of long-standing open problems.
  To demonstrate its breadth, we considered a list of 67 problems spanning mathematical analysis, combinatorics, geometry, and number theory. The system rediscovered the best known solutions in most of the cases and discovered improved solutions in several. In some instances, AlphaEvolve is also able to generalize results for a finite number of input values into a formula valid for all input values. Furthermore, we are able to combine this methodology with Deep Think and AlphaProof in a broader framework where the additional proof-assistants and reasoning systems provide automated proof generation and further mathematical insights.
  These results demonstrate that large language model-guided evolutionary search can autonomously discover mathematical constructions that complement human intuition, at times matching or even improving the best known results, highlighting the potential for significant new ways of interaction between mathematicians and AI systems. We present AlphaEvolve as a powerful new tool for mathematical discovery, capable of exploring vast search spaces to solve complex optimization problems at scale, often with significantly reduced requirements on preparation and computation time.</description>

      <title>Threshold Graphs Are Globally Synchronizing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12646v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kuramoto model describes phase oscillators on the unit circle whose interactions are encoded by a graph. Each edge acts like a spring that pulls the two adjacent oscillators toward each other whenever their phases differ. A central question is to determine which graphs are globally synchronizing, meaning that trajectories of the Kuramoto dynamics converge to the fully synchronized state from almost all initial conditions. This property is tightly linked to the benign nonconvexity of the model's energy landscape. Existing guarantees for global synchronization rely on minimum-degree thresholds, which require the graph to be highly dense. In this work, we show that connected threshold graphs, whose density may vary from $2/n$ to $1$, are globally synchronizing. Our proof relies on a phasor-geometric analysis of the stationary points of the associated energy landscape.</description>
