      <title>Measures of association for approximating copulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies closed-form expressions for multiple association measures of copulas commonly used for approximation purposes, including Bernstein, shuffle--of--min, checkerboard and check--min copulas. In particular, closed-form expressions are provided for the recently popularized Chatterjee's xi (also known as Chatterjee's rank correlation), which quantifies the dependence between two random variables. Given any bivariate copula $C$, we show that the closed-form formula for Chatterjee's xi of an approximating checkerboard copula serves as a lower bound that converges to the true value of $\xi(C)$ as one lets the grid size $n\rightarrow\infty$.</description>

      <title>On eigenvalues of a renormalized sample correlation matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the asymptotic spectral properties of a renormalized sample correlation matrix, including the limiting spectral distribution, the properties of largest eigenvalues, and the central limit theorem for linear spectral statistics. All asymptotic results are derived under a unified framework where the dimension-to-sample size ratio $p/n\rightarrow c\in (0,\infty]$. Based on our CLT result, we propose an independence test statistic capable of operating effectively in both high and ultrahigh dimensional scenarios. Simulation experiments demonstrate the accuracy of theoretical results.</description>

      <title>On testing the class of symmetry using entropy characterization and empirical likelihood approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain a new characterization result for symmetric distributions based on the entropy measure. Using the characterization, we propose a nonparametric test to test the symmetry of a distribution. We also develop the jackknife empirical likelihood and the adjusted jackknife empirical likelihood ratio tests. The asymptotic properties of the proposed test statistics are studied. We conduct extensive Monte Carlo simulation studies to assess the finite sample performance of the proposed tests. The simulation results indicate that the jackknife empirical likelihood and adjusted jackknife empirical likelihood ratio tests show better performance than the existing tests. Finally, two real data sets are analysed to illustrate the applicability of the proposed tests.</description>

      <title>Channel Fingerprint Construction for Massive MIMO: A Deep Conditional Generative Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate channel state information (CSI) acquisition for massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems is essential for future mobile communication networks. Channel fingerprint (CF), also referred to as channel knowledge map, is a key enabler for intelligent environment-aware communication and can facilitate CSI acquisition. However, due to the cost limitations of practical sensing nodes and test vehicles, the resulting CF is typically coarse-grained, making it insufficient for wireless transceiver design. In this work, we introduce the concept of CF twins and design a conditional generative diffusion model (CGDM) with strong implicit prior learning capabilities as the computational core of the CF twin to establish the connection between coarse- and fine-grained CFs. Specifically, we employ a variational inference technique to derive the evidence lower bound (ELBO) for the log-marginal distribution of the observed fine-grained CF conditioned on the coarse-grained CF, enabling the CGDM to learn the complicated distribution of the target data. During the denoising neural network optimization, the coarse-grained CF is introduced as side information to accurately guide the conditioned generation of the CGDM. To make the proposed CGDM lightweight, we further leverage the additivity of network layers and introduce a one-shot pruning approach along with a multi-objective knowledge distillation technique. Experimental results show that the proposed approach exhibits significant improvement in reconstruction performance compared to the baselines. Additionally, zero-shot testing on reconstruction tasks with different magnification factors further demonstrates the scalability and generalization ability of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>EnvCDiff: Joint Refinement of Environmental Information and Channel Fingerprints via Conditional Generative Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paradigm shift from environment-unaware communication to intelligent environment-aware communication is expected to facilitate the acquisition of channel state information for future wireless communications. Channel Fingerprint (CF), as an emerging enabling technology for environment-aware communication, provides channel-related knowledge for potential locations within the target communication area. However, due to the limited availability of practical devices for sensing environmental information and measuring channel-related knowledge, most of the acquired environmental information and CF are coarse-grained, insufficient to guide the design of wireless transmissions. To address this, this paper proposes a deep conditional generative learning approach, namely a customized conditional generative diffusion model (CDiff). The proposed CDiff simultaneously refines environmental information and CF, reconstructing a fine-grained CF that incorporates environmental information, referred to as EnvCF, from its coarse-grained counterpart. Experimental results show that the proposed approach significantly improves the performance of EnvCF construction compared to the baselines.</description>

      <title>Laws of Large Numbers for Information Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Laws of large numbers establish asymptotic guarantees for recovering features of a probability distribution using independent samples. We introduce a framework for proving analogous results for recovery of the $\sigma$-field of a probability space, interpreted as information resolution--the granularity of measurable events given by comparison to our samples. Our main results show that, under iid sampling, the Borel $\sigma$-field in $\mathbb R^d$ and in more general metric spaces can be recovered in the strongest possible mode of convergence. We also derive finite-sample $L^1$ bounds for uniform convergence of $\sigma$-fields on $[0,1]^d$.
  We illustrate the use of our framework with two applications: constructing randomized solutions to the Skorokhod embedding problem, and analyzing the loss of variants of random forests for regression.</description>

      <title>Sharp Gaussian approximations for Decentralized Federated Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning has gained traction in privacy-sensitive collaborative environments, with local SGD emerging as a key optimization method in decentralized settings. While its convergence properties are well-studied, asymptotic statistical guarantees beyond convergence remain limited. In this paper, we present two generalized Gaussian approximation results for local SGD and explore their implications. First, we prove a Berry-Esseen theorem for the final local SGD iterates, enabling valid multiplier bootstrap procedures. Second, motivated by robustness considerations, we introduce two distinct time-uniform Gaussian approximations for the entire trajectory of local SGD. The time-uniform approximations support Gaussian bootstrap-based tests for detecting adversarial attacks. Extensive simulations are provided to support our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Beyond Basic A/B testing: Improving Statistical Efficiency for Business Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The standard A/B testing approaches are mostly based on t-test in large scale industry applications. These standard approaches however suffers from low statistical power in business settings, due to nature of small sample-size or non-Gaussian distribution or return-on-investment (ROI) consideration. In this paper, we propose several approaches to addresses these challenges: (i) regression adjustment, generalized estimating equation, Man-Whitney U and Zero-Trimmed U that addresses each of these issues separately, and (ii) a novel doubly robust generalized U that handles ROI consideration, distribution robustness and small samples in one framework. We provide theoretical results on asymptotic normality and efficiency bounds, together with insights on the efficiency gain from theoretical analysis. We further conduct comprehensive simulation studies and apply the methods to multiple real A/B tests.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the classical binary classification problem for hypothesis spaces of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) with ReLU activation under Tsybakov's low-noise condition with exponent $q&gt;0$, and its limit-case $q\to\infty$ which we refer to as the "hard-margin condition". We show that DNNs which minimize the empirical risk with square loss surrogate and $\ell_p$ penalty can achieve finite-sample excess risk bounds of order $\mathcal{O}\left(n^{-\alpha}\right)$ for arbitrarily large $\alpha&gt;0$ under the hard-margin condition, provided that the regression function $\eta$ is sufficiently smooth. The proof relies on a novel decomposition of the excess risk which might be of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The impressive practical performance of neural networks is often attributed to their ability to learn low-dimensional data representations and hierarchical structure directly from data. In this work, we argue that these two phenomena are not unique to neural networks, and can be elicited from classical kernel methods. Namely, we show that the derivative of the kernel predictor can detect the influential coordinates with low sample complexity. Moreover, by iteratively using the derivatives to reweight the data and retrain kernel machines, one is able to efficiently learn hierarchical polynomials with finite leap complexity. Numerical experiments illustrate the developed theory.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional Bayesian Tobit regression for censored response with Horseshoe prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Censored response variables--where outcomes are only partially observed due to known bounds--arise in numerous scientific domains and present serious challenges for regression analysis. The Tobit model, a classical solution for handling left-censoring, has been widely used in economics and beyond. However, with the increasing prevalence of high-dimensional data, where the number of covariates exceeds the sample size, traditional Tobit methods become inadequate. While frequentist approaches for high-dimensional Tobit regression have recently been developed, notably through Lasso-based estimators, the Bayesian literature remains sparse and lacks theoretical guarantees. In this work, we propose a novel Bayesian framework for high-dimensional Tobit regression that addresses both censoring and sparsity. Our method leverages the Horseshoe prior to induce shrinkage and employs a data augmentation strategy to facilitate efficient posterior computation via Gibbs sampling. We establish posterior consistency and derive concentration rates under sparsity, providing the first theoretical results for Bayesian Tobit models in high dimensions. Numerical experiments show that our approach outperforms favorably with the recent Lasso-Tobit method.
  Our method is implemented in the R package tobitbayes, which can be found on Github.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the concentration properties of quadratic forms associated with Markov chains using the martingale decomposition method introduced by Atchad\'e and Cattaneo (2014). In particular, we derive concentration inequalities for the overlapped batch mean (OBM) estimators of the asymptotic variance for uniformly geometrically ergodic Markov chains. Our main result provides an explicit control of the $p$-th moment of the difference between the OBM estimator and the asymptotic variance of the Markov chain with explicit dependence upon $p$ and mixing time of the underlying Markov chain.</description>

      <title>PCS-UQ: Uncertainty Quantification via the Predictability-Computability-Stability Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As machine learning (ML) models are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains, trustworthy uncertainty quantification (UQ) is critical for ensuring the safety and reliability of these models. Traditional UQ methods rely on specifying a true generative model and are not robust to misspecification. On the other hand, conformal inference allows for arbitrary ML models but does not consider model selection, which leads to large interval sizes. We tackle these drawbacks by proposing a UQ method based on the predictability, computability, and stability (PCS) framework for veridical data science proposed by Yu and Kumbier. Specifically, PCS-UQ addresses model selection by using a prediction check to screen out unsuitable models. PCS-UQ then fits these screened algorithms across multiple bootstraps to assess inter-sample variability and algorithmic instability, enabling more reliable uncertainty estimates. Further, we propose a novel calibration scheme that improves local adaptivity of our prediction sets. Experiments across $17$ regression and $6$ classification datasets show that PCS-UQ achieves the desired coverage and reduces width over conformal approaches by $\approx 20\%$. Further, our local analysis shows PCS-UQ often achieves target coverage across subgroups while conformal methods fail to do so. For large deep-learning models, we propose computationally efficient approximation schemes that avoid the expensive multiple bootstrap trainings of PCS-UQ. Across three computer vision benchmarks, PCS-UQ reduces prediction set size over conformal methods by $20\%$. Theoretically, we show a modified PCS-UQ algorithm is a form of split conformal inference and achieves the desired coverage with exchangeable data.</description>

      <title>Statistical Inference for the Rough Homogenization Limit of Multiscale Fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09703v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of parameter estimation for the homogenization limit of multiscale systems involving fractional dynamics. In the case of stochastic multiscale systems driven by Brownian motion, it has been shown that in order for the Maximum Likelihood Estimators of the parameters of the limiting dynamics to be consistent, data needs to be subsampled at an appropriate rate. We extend these results to a class of fractional multiscale systems, often described as scaled fractional kinetic Brownian motions. We provide convergence results for the MLE of the diffusion coefficient of the limiting dynamics, computed using multiscale data. This requires the development of a different methodology to that used in the standard Brownian motion case, which is based on controlling the spectral norm of the inverse covariance matrix of a discretized fractional Gaussian noise on an interval.</description>

Abstract: Recent research shows the susceptibility of machine learning models to adversarial attacks, wherein minor but maliciously chosen perturbations of the input can significantly degrade model performance. In this paper, we theoretically analyse the limits of robustness against such adversarial attacks in a nonparametric regression setting, by examining the minimax rates of convergence in an adversarial sup-norm. Our work reveals that the minimax rate under adversarial attacks in the input is the same as sum of two terms: one represents the minimax rate in the standard setting without adversarial attacks, and the other reflects the maximum deviation of the true regression function value within the target function class when subjected to the input perturbations. The optimal rates under the adversarial setup can be achieved by an adversarial plug-in procedure constructed from a minimax optimal estimator in the corresponding standard setting. Two specific examples are given to illustrate the established minimax results.</description>

      <title>Sparse High-Dimensional Vector Autoregressive Bootstrap</title>

Abstract: We introduce a high-dimensional multiplier bootstrap for time series data based on capturing dependence through a sparsely estimated vector autoregressive model. We prove its consistency for inference on high-dimensional means under two different moment assumptions on the errors, namely sub-gaussian moments and a finite number of absolute moments. In establishing these results, we derive a Gaussian approximation for the maximum mean of a linear process, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Robust Quickest Change Detection in Non-Stationary Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09673v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimal algorithms are developed for robust detection of changes in non-stationary processes. These are processes in which the distribution of the data after change varies with time. The decision-maker does not have access to precise information on the post-change distribution. It is shown that if the post-change non-stationary family has a distribution that is least favorable in a well-defined sense, then the algorithms designed using the least favorable distributions are robust and optimal. Non-stationary processes are encountered in public health monitoring and space and military applications. The robust algorithms are applied to real and simulated data to show their effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Nonparametrics for Principal Stratification with Continuous Post-Treatment Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17669v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Principal stratification provides a causal inference framework for investigating treatment effects in the presence of a post-treatment variable. Principal strata play a key role in characterizing the treatment effect by identifying groups of units with the same or similar values for the potential post-treatment variable under both treatment levels. The literature has focused mainly on binary post-treatment variables. Few papers considered continuous post-treatment variables. In the presence of a continuous post-treatment, a challenge is how to identify and characterize meaningful coarsening of the latent principal strata that lead to interpretable principal causal effects. This paper introduces the confounders-aware shared-atom Bayesian mixture, a novel approach for principal stratification with binary treatment and continuous post-treatment variables. Our method leverages Bayesian nonparametric priors with an innovative hierarchical structure for the potential post-treatment variable that overcomes some of the limitations of previous works. Specifically, the novel features of our method allow for (i) identifying coarsened principal strata through a data-adaptive approach and (ii) providing a comprehensive quantification of the uncertainty surrounding stratum membership. Through Monte Carlo simulations, we show that the proposed methodology performs better than existing methods in characterizing the principal strata and estimating principal effects of the treatment. Finally, our proposed model is applied to a case study in which we estimate the causal effects of US national air quality regulations on pollution levels and health outcomes.</description>

      <title>Computing High-dimensional Confidence Sets for Arbitrary Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02723v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of learning a high-density region of an arbitrary distribution over $\mathbb{R}^d$. Given a target coverage parameter $\delta$, and sample access to an arbitrary distribution $D$, we want to output a confidence set $S \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ such that $S$ achieves $\delta$ coverage of $D$, i.e., $\mathbb{P}_{y \sim D} \left[ y \in S \right] \ge \delta$, and the volume of $S$ is as small as possible. This is a central problem in high-dimensional statistics with applications in finding confidence sets, uncertainty quantification, and support estimation.
  In the most general setting, this problem is statistically intractable, so we restrict our attention to competing with sets from a concept class $C$ with bounded VC-dimension. An algorithm is competitive with class $C$ if, given samples from an arbitrary distribution $D$, it outputs in polynomial time a set that achieves $\delta$ coverage of $D$, and whose volume is competitive with the smallest set in $C$ with the required coverage $\delta$. This problem is computationally challenging even in the basic setting when $C$ is the set of all Euclidean balls. Existing algorithms based on coresets find in polynomial time a ball whose volume is $\exp(\tilde{O}( d/ \log d))$-factor competitive with the volume of the best ball.
  Our main result is an algorithm that finds a confidence set whose volume is $\exp(\tilde{O}(d^{1/2}))$ factor competitive with the optimal ball having the desired coverage. The algorithm is improper (it outputs an ellipsoid). Combined with our computational intractability result for proper learning balls within an $\exp(\tilde{O}(d^{1-o(1)}))$ approximation factor in volume, our results provide an interesting separation between proper and (improper) learning of confidence sets.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Model Averaging in Causal Instrumental Variable Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13520v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Instrumental variables are a popular tool to infer causal effects under unobserved confounding, but choosing suitable instruments is challenging in practice. We propose gIVBMA, a Bayesian model averaging procedure that addresses this challenge by averaging across different sets of instrumental variables and covariates in a structural equation model. Our approach extends previous work through a scale-invariant prior structure and accommodates non-Gaussian outcomes and treatments, offering greater flexibility than existing methods. The computational strategy uses conditional Bayes factors to update models separately for the outcome and treatments. We prove that this model selection procedure is consistent. By explicitly accounting for model uncertainty, gIVBMA allows instruments and covariates to switch roles and provides robustness against invalid instruments. In simulation experiments, gIVBMA outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. We demonstrate its usefulness in two empirical applications: the effects of malaria and institutions on income per capita and the returns to schooling. A software implementation of gIVBMA is available in Julia.</description>
