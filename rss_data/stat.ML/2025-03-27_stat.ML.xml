      <title>A stochastic gradient descent algorithm with random search directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic coordinate descent algorithms are efficient methods in which each iterate is obtained by fixing most coordinates at their values from the current iteration, and approximately minimizing the objective with respect to the remaining coordinates. However, this approach is usually restricted to canonical basis vectors of $\mathbb{R}^d$. In this paper, we develop a new class of stochastic gradient descent algorithms with random search directions which uses the directional derivative of the gradient estimate following more general random vectors. We establish the almost sure convergence of these algorithms with decreasing step. We further investigate their central limit theorem and pay particular attention to analyze the impact of the search distributions on the asymptotic covariance matrix. We also provide the non-asymptotic $\mathbb{L}^p$ rates of convergence.</description>

      <title>On the Robustness of Kernel Ridge Regression Using the Cauchy Loss Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust regression aims to develop methods for estimating an unknown regression function in the presence of outliers, heavy-tailed distributions, or contaminated data, which can severely impact performance. Most existing theoretical results in robust regression assume that the noise has a finite absolute mean, an assumption violated by certain distributions, such as Cauchy and some Pareto noise. In this paper, we introduce a generalized Cauchy noise framework that accommodates all noise distributions with finite moments of any order, even when the absolute mean is infinite. Within this framework, we study the \textit{kernel Cauchy ridge regressor} (\textit{KCRR}), which minimizes a regularized empirical Cauchy risk to achieve robustness. To derive the $L_2$-risk bound for KCRR, we establish a connection between the excess Cauchy risk and $L_2$-risk for sufficiently large scale parameters of the Cauchy loss, which reveals that these two risks are equivalent. Furthermore, under the assumption that the regression function satisfies H\"older smoothness, we derive excess Cauchy risk bounds for KCRR, showing improved performance as the scale parameter decreases. By considering the twofold effect of the scale parameter on the excess Cauchy risk and its equivalence with the $L_2$-risk, we establish the almost minimax-optimal convergence rate for KCRR in terms of $L_2$-risk, highlighting the robustness of the Cauchy loss in handling various types of noise. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of KCRR through experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets under diverse noise corruption scenarios.</description>

      <title>An $(\epsilon,\delta)$-accurate level set estimation with a stopping criterion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The level set estimation problem seeks to identify regions within a set of candidate points where an unknown and costly to evaluate function's value exceeds a specified threshold, providing an efficient alternative to exhaustive evaluations of function values. Traditional methods often use sequential optimization strategies to find $\epsilon$-accurate solutions, which permit a margin around the threshold contour but frequently lack effective stopping criteria, leading to excessive exploration and inefficiencies. This paper introduces an acquisition strategy for level set estimation that incorporates a stopping criterion, ensuring the algorithm halts when further exploration is unlikely to yield improvements, thereby reducing unnecessary function evaluations. We theoretically prove that our method satisfies $\epsilon$-accuracy with a confidence level of $1 - \delta$, addressing a key gap in existing approaches. Furthermore, we show that this also leads to guarantees on the lower bounds of performance metrics such as F-score. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed acquisition function achieves comparable precision to existing methods while confirming that the stopping criterion effectively terminates the algorithm once adequate exploration is completed.</description>

      <title>Learning Data-Driven Uncertainty Set Partitions for Robust and Adaptive Energy Forecasting with Missing Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Short-term forecasting models typically assume the availability of input data (features) when they are deployed and in use. However, equipment failures, disruptions, cyberattacks, may lead to missing features when such models are used operationally, which could negatively affect forecast accuracy, and result in suboptimal operational decisions. In this paper, we use adaptive robust optimization and adversarial machine learning to develop forecasting models that seamlessly handle missing data operationally. We propose linear- and neural network-based forecasting models with parameters that adapt to available features, combining linear adaptation with a novel algorithm for learning data-driven uncertainty set partitions. The proposed adaptive models do not rely on identifying historical missing data patterns and are suitable for real-time operations under stringent time constraints. Extensive numerical experiments on short-term wind power forecasting considering horizons from 15 minutes to 4 hours ahead illustrate that our proposed adaptive models are on par with imputation when data are missing for very short periods (e.g., when only the latest measurement is missing) whereas they significantly outperform imputation when data are missing for longer periods. We further provide insights by showcasing how linear adaptation and data-driven partitions (even with a few subsets) approach the performance of the optimal, yet impractical, method of retraining for every possible realization of missing data.</description>

      <title>Regression-Based Estimation of Causal Effects in the Presence of Selection Bias and Confounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating the expected causal effect $E[Y|do(X)]$ for a target variable $Y$ when treatment $X$ is set by intervention, focusing on continuous random variables. In settings without selection bias or confounding, $E[Y|do(X)] = E[Y|X]$, which can be estimated using standard regression methods. However, regression fails when systematic missingness induced by selection bias, or confounding distorts the data. Boeken et al. [2023] show that when training data is subject to selection, proxy variables unaffected by this process can, under certain constraints, be used to correct for selection bias to estimate $E[Y|X]$, and hence $E[Y|do(X)]$, reliably. When data is additionally affected by confounding, however, this equality is no longer valid.
  Building on these results, we consider a more general setting and propose a framework that incorporates both selection bias and confounding. Specifically, we derive theoretical conditions ensuring identifiability and recoverability of causal effects under access to external data and proxy variables. We further introduce a two-step regression estimator (TSR), capable of exploiting proxy variables to adjust for selection bias while accounting for confounding. We show that TSR coincides with prior work if confounding is absent, but achieves a lower variance. Extensive simulation studies validate TSR's correctness for scenarios which may include both selection bias and confounding with proxy variables.</description>

      <title>Continual learning via probabilistic exchangeable sequence modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continual learning (CL) refers to the ability to continuously learn and accumulate new knowledge while retaining useful information from past experiences. Although numerous CL methods have been proposed in recent years, it is not straightforward to deploy them directly to real-world decision-making problems due to their computational cost and lack of uncertainty quantification. To address these issues, we propose CL-BRUNO, a probabilistic, Neural Process-based CL model that performs scalable and tractable Bayesian update and prediction. Our proposed approach uses deep-generative models to create a unified probabilistic framework capable of handling different types of CL problems such as task- and class-incremental learning, allowing users to integrate information across different CL scenarios using a single model. Our approach is able to prevent catastrophic forgetting through distributional and functional regularisation without the need of retaining any previously seen samples, making it appealing to applications where data privacy or storage capacity is of concern. Experiments show that CL-BRUNO outperforms existing methods on both natural image and biomedical data sets, confirming its effectiveness in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric MLE for Gaussian Location Mixtures: Certified Computation and Generic Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator $\widehat{\pi}$ for Gaussian location mixtures in one dimension. It has been known since (Lindsay, 1983) that given an $n$-point dataset, this estimator always returns a mixture with at most $n$ components, and more recently (Wu-Polyanskiy, 2020) gave a sharp $O(\log n)$ bound for subgaussian data. In this work we study computational aspects of $\widehat{\pi}$. We provide an algorithm which for small enough $\varepsilon&gt;0$ computes an $\varepsilon$-approximation of $\widehat\pi$ in Wasserstein distance in time $K+Cnk^2\log\log(1/\varepsilon)$. Here $K$ is data-dependent but independent of $\varepsilon$, while $C$ is an absolute constant and $k=|supp(\widehat{\pi})|\leq n$ is the number of atoms in $\widehat\pi$. We also certifiably compute the exact value of $|supp(\widehat\pi)|$ in finite time. These guarantees hold almost surely whenever the dataset $(x_1,\dots,x_n)\in [-cn^{1/4},cn^{1/4}]$ consists of independent points from a probability distribution with a density (relative to Lebesgue measure). We also show the distribution of $\widehat\pi$ conditioned to be $k$-atomic admits a density on the associated $2k-1$ dimensional parameter space for all $k\leq \sqrt{n}/3$, and almost sure locally linear convergence of the EM algorithm. One key tool is a classical Fourier analytic estimate for non-degenerate curves.</description>

      <title>Revisit Time Series Classification Benchmark: The Impact of Temporal Information for Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time series classification is usually regarded as a distinct task from tabular data classification due to the importance of temporal information. However, in this paper, by performing permutation tests that disrupt temporal information on the UCR time series classification archive, the most widely used benchmark for time series classification, we identify a significant proportion of datasets where temporal information has little to no impact on classification. Many of these datasets are tabular in nature or rely mainly on tabular features, leading to potentially biased evaluations of time series classifiers focused on temporal information. To address this, we propose UCR Augmented, a benchmark based on the UCR time series classification archive designed to evaluate classifiers' ability to extract and utilize temporal information. Testing classifiers from seven categories on this benchmark revealed notable shifts in performance rankings. Some previously overlooked approaches perform well, while others see their performance decline significantly when temporal information is crucial. UCR Augmented provides a more robust framework for assessing time series classifiers, ensuring fairer evaluations.

      <title>Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Bayesian Optimization with Continuous Context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the challenge of sequential data-driven decision-making under context distributional uncertainty. This problem arises in numerous real-world scenarios where the learner optimizes black-box objective functions in the presence of uncontrollable contextual variables. We consider the setting where the context distribution is uncertain but known to lie within an ambiguity set defined as a ball in the Wasserstein distance. We propose a novel algorithm for Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Bayesian Optimization that can handle continuous context distributions while maintaining computational tractability. Our theoretical analysis combines recent results in self-normalized concentration in Hilbert spaces and finite-sample bounds for distributionally robust optimization to establish sublinear regret bounds that match state-of-the-art results. Through extensive comparisons with existing approaches on both synthetic and real-world problems, we demonstrate the simplicity, effectiveness, and practical applicability of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Seasonal Climate Predictions via Variational Inference and Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most operational climate services providers base their seasonal predictions on initialised general circulation models (GCMs) or statistical techniques that fit past observations. GCMs require substantial computational resources, which limits their capacity. In contrast, statistical methods often lack robustness due to short historical records. Recent works propose machine learning methods trained on climate model output, leveraging larger sample sizes and simulated scenarios. Yet, many of these studies focus on prediction tasks that might be restricted in spatial extent or temporal coverage, opening a gap with existing operational predictions. Thus, the present study evaluates the effectiveness of a methodology that combines variational inference with transformer models to predict fields of seasonal anomalies. The predictions cover all four seasons and are initialised one month before the start of each season. The model was trained on climate model output from CMIP6 and tested using ERA5 reanalysis data. We analyse the method's performance in predicting interannual anomalies beyond the climate change-induced trend. We also test the proposed methodology in a regional context with a use case focused on Europe. While climate change trends dominate the skill of temperature predictions, the method presents additional skill over the climatological forecast in regions influenced by known teleconnections. We reach similar conclusions based on the validation of precipitation predictions. Despite underperforming SEAS5 in most tropics, our model offers added value in numerous extratropical inland regions. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of training generative models on climate model output for seasonal predictions, providing skilful predictions beyond the induced climate change trend at time scales and lead times relevant for user applications.</description>

      <title>Automated and Risk-Aware Engine Control Calibration Using Constrained Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decarbonization of the transport sector sets increasingly strict demands to maximize thermal efficiency and minimize greenhouse gas emissions of Internal Combustion Engines. This has led to complex engines with a surge in the number of corresponding tunable parameters in actuator set points and control settings. Automated calibration is therefore essential to keep development time and costs at acceptable levels. In this work, an innovative self-learning calibration method is presented based on in-cylinder pressure curve shaping. This method combines Principal Component Decomposition with constrained Bayesian Optimization. To realize maximal thermal engine efficiency, the optimization problem aims at minimizing the difference between the actual in-cylinder pressure curve and an Idealized Thermodynamic Cycle. By continuously updating a Gaussian Process Regression model of the pressure's Principal Components weights using measurements of the actual operating conditions, the mean in-cylinder pressure curve as well as its uncertainty bounds are learned. This information drives the optimization of calibration parameters, which are automatically adapted while dealing with the risks and uncertainties associated with operational safety and combustion stability. This data-driven method does not require prior knowledge of the system. The proposed method is successfully demonstrated in simulation using a Reactivity Controlled Compression Ignition engine model. The difference between the Gross Indicated Efficiency of the optimal solution found and the true optimum is 0.017%. For this complex engine, the optimal solution was found after 64.4s, which is relatively fast compared to conventional calibration methods.</description>

      <title>Riemannian Optimization on Relaxed Indicator Matrix Manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The indicator matrix plays an important role in machine learning, but optimizing it is an NP-hard problem. We propose a new relaxation of the indicator matrix and prove that this relaxation forms a manifold, which we call the Relaxed Indicator Matrix Manifold (RIM manifold). Based on Riemannian geometry, we develop a Riemannian toolbox for optimization on the RIM manifold. Specifically, we provide several methods of Retraction, including a fast Retraction method to obtain geodesics. We point out that the RIM manifold is a generalization of the double stochastic manifold, and it is much faster than existing methods on the double stochastic manifold, which has a complexity of \( \mathcal{O}(n^3) \), while RIM manifold optimization is \( \mathcal{O}(n) \) and often yields better results. We conducted extensive experiments, including image denoising, with millions of variables to support our conclusion, and applied the RIM manifold to Ratio Cut, achieving clustering results that outperform the state-of-the-art methods.

      <title>A Theoretical Framework for Prompt Engineering: Approximating Smooth Functions with Transformer Prompts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prompt engineering has emerged as a powerful technique for guiding large language models (LLMs) toward desired responses, significantly enhancing their performance across diverse tasks. Beyond their role as static predictors, LLMs increasingly function as intelligent agents, capable of reasoning, decision-making, and adapting dynamically to complex environments. However, the theoretical underpinnings of prompt engineering remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce a formal framework demonstrating that transformer models, when provided with carefully designed prompts, can act as a configurable computational system by emulating a ``virtual'' neural network during inference. Specifically, input prompts effectively translate into the corresponding network configuration, enabling LLMs to adjust their internal computations dynamically. Building on this construction, we establish an approximation theory for $\beta$-times differentiable functions, proving that transformers can approximate such functions with arbitrary precision when guided by appropriately structured prompts. Moreover, our framework provides theoretical justification for several empirically successful prompt engineering techniques, including the use of longer, structured prompts, filtering irrelevant information, enhancing prompt token diversity, and leveraging multi-agent interactions. By framing LLMs as adaptable agents rather than static models, our findings underscore their potential for autonomous reasoning and problem-solving, paving the way for more robust and theoretically grounded advancements in prompt engineering and AI agent design.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Counterfactuals for Image Regressors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Counterfactual explanations have been successfully applied to create human interpretable explanations for various black-box models. They are handy for tasks in the image domain, where the quality of the explanations benefits from recent advances in generative models. Although counterfactual explanations have been widely applied to classification models, their application to regression tasks remains underexplored. We present two methods to create counterfactual explanations for image regression tasks using diffusion-based generative models to address challenges in sparsity and quality: 1) one based on a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model that operates directly in pixel-space and 2) another based on a Diffusion Autoencoder operating in latent space. Both produce realistic, semantic, and smooth counterfactuals on CelebA-HQ and a synthetic data set, providing easily interpretable insights into the decision-making process of the regression model and reveal spurious correlations. We find that for regression counterfactuals, changes in features depend on the region of the predicted value. Large semantic changes are needed for significant changes in predicted values, making it harder to find sparse counterfactuals than with classifiers. Moreover, pixel space counterfactuals are more sparse while latent space counterfactuals are of higher quality and allow bigger semantic changes.</description>

      <title>Reliable algorithm selection for machine learning-guided design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Algorithms for machine learning-guided design, or design algorithms, use machine learning-based predictions to propose novel objects with desired property values. Given a new design task -- for example, to design novel proteins with high binding affinity to a therapeutic target -- one must choose a design algorithm and specify any hyperparameters and predictive and/or generative models involved. How can these decisions be made such that the resulting designs are successful? This paper proposes a method for design algorithm selection, which aims to select design algorithms that will produce a distribution of design labels satisfying a user-specified success criterion -- for example, that at least ten percent of designs' labels exceed a threshold. It does so by combining designs' predicted property values with held-out labeled data to reliably forecast characteristics of the label distributions produced by different design algorithms, building upon techniques from prediction-powered inference. The method is guaranteed with high probability to return design algorithms that yield successful label distributions (or the null set if none exist), if the density ratios between the design and labeled data distributions are known. We demonstrate the method's effectiveness in simulated protein and RNA design tasks, in settings with either known or estimated density ratios.</description>

      <title>Valid Conformal Prediction for Dynamic GNNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamic graphs provide a flexible data abstraction for modelling many sorts of real-world systems, such as transport, trade, and social networks. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are powerful tools allowing for different kinds of prediction and inference on these systems, but getting a handle on uncertainty, especially in dynamic settings, is a challenging problem. In this work we propose to use a dynamic graph representation known in the tensor literature as the unfolding, to achieve valid prediction sets via conformal prediction. This representation, a simple graph, can be input to any standard GNN and does not require any modification to existing GNN architectures or conformal prediction routines. One of our key contributions is a careful mathematical consideration of the different inference scenarios which can arise in a dynamic graph modelling context. For a range of practically relevant cases, we obtain valid prediction sets with almost no assumptions, even dispensing with exchangeability. In a more challenging scenario, which we call the semi-inductive regime, we achieve valid prediction under stronger assumptions, akin to stationarity. We provide real data examples demonstrating validity, showing improved accuracy over baselines, and sign-posting different failure modes which can occur when those assumptions are violated.</description>

      <title>The mathematics of adversarial attacks in AI -- Why deep learning is unstable despite the existence of stable neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.06098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.06098v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The unprecedented success of deep learning (DL) makes it unchallenged when it comes to classification problems. However, it is well established that the current DL methodology produces universally unstable neural networks (NNs). The instability problem has caused an enormous research effort -- with a vast literature on so-called adversarial attacks -- yet there has been no solution to the problem. Our paper addresses why there has been no solution to the problem, as we prove the following mathematical paradox: any training procedure based on training neural networks for classification problems with a fixed architecture will yield neural networks that are either inaccurate or unstable (if accurate) -- despite the provable existence of both accurate and stable neural networks for the same classification problems. The key is that the stable and accurate neural networks must have variable dimensions depending on the input, in particular, variable dimensions is a necessary condition for stability.
  Our result points towards the paradox that accurate and stable neural networks exist, however, modern algorithms do not compute them. This yields the question: if the existence of neural networks with desirable properties can be proven, can one also find algorithms that compute them? There are cases in mathematics where provable existence implies computability, but will this be the case for neural networks? The contrary is true, as we demonstrate how neural networks can provably exist as approximate minimisers to standard optimisation problems with standard cost functions, however, no randomised algorithm can compute them with probability better than 1/2.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2109.11926v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study distributionally robust optimization with Sinkhorn distance -- a variant of Wasserstein distance based on entropic regularization. We derive a convex programming dual reformulation for general nominal distributions, transport costs, and loss functions. To solve the dual reformulation, we develop a stochastic mirror descent algorithm with biased subgradient estimators and derive its computational complexity guarantees. Finally, we provide numerical examples using synthetic and real data to demonstrate its superior performance.</description>

      <title>Denoising Diffusion Variational Inference: Diffusion Models as Expressive Variational Posteriors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02739v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose denoising diffusion variational inference (DDVI), a black-box variational inference algorithm for latent variable models which relies on diffusion models as flexible approximate posteriors. Specifically, our method introduces an expressive class of diffusion-based variational posteriors that perform iterative refinement in latent space; we train these posteriors with a novel regularized evidence lower bound (ELBO) on the marginal likelihood inspired by the wake-sleep algorithm. Our method is easy to implement (it fits a regularized extension of the ELBO), is compatible with black-box variational inference, and outperforms alternative classes of approximate posteriors based on normalizing flows or adversarial networks. We find that DDVI improves inference and learning in deep latent variable models across common benchmarks as well as on a motivating task in biology -- inferring latent ancestry from human genomes -- where it outperforms strong baselines on the Thousand Genomes dataset.</description>

      <title>Screening for Diabetes Mellitus in the U.S. Population Using Neural Network Models and Complex Survey Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19752v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex survey designs are commonly employed in many medical cohorts. In such scenarios, developing case-specific predictive risk score models that reflect the unique characteristics of the study design is essential for minimizing selective biases in the statistical results. The objectives of this paper are to: (i) propose a general predictive framework for regression and classification using neural network (NN) modeling that incorporates survey weights into the estimation process; (ii) introduce an uncertainty quantification algorithm for model prediction tailored to data from complex survey designs; and (iii) apply this method to develop robust risk score models for assessing the risk of Diabetes Mellitus in the US population, utilizing data from the NHANES 2011-2014 cohort. The results indicate that models of varying complexity, each utilizing a different set of variables, demonstrate different discriminative power for predicting diabetes (with different economic cost), yet yield generalizable results at the population level. Although the focus is on diabetes, this NN predictive framework is adaptable for developing clinical models across a diverse range of diseases and medical cohorts. The software and data used in this paper are publicly available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Review and Prospect of Algebraic Research in Equivalent Framework between Statistical Mechanics and Machine Learning Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10234v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mathematical equivalence between statistical mechanics and machine learning theory has been known since the 20th century, and research based on this equivalence has provided novel methodologies in both theoretical physics and statistical learning theory. It is well known that algebraic approaches in statistical mechanics such as operator algebra enable us to analyze phase transition phenomena mathematically. In this paper, we review and prospect algebraic research in machine learning theory for theoretical physicists who are interested in artificial intelligence.
  If a learning machine has a hierarchical structure or latent variables, then the random Hamiltonian cannot be expressed by any quadratic perturbation because it has singularities. To study an equilibrium state defined by such a singular random Hamiltonian, algebraic approaches are necessary to derive the asymptotic form of the free energy and the generalization error.
  We also introduce the most recent advance: the theoretical foundation for the alignment of artificial intelligence is now being constructed based on algebraic learning theory.
  This paper is devoted to the memory of Professor Huzihiro Araki who is a pioneering founder of algebraic research in both statistical mechanics and quantum field theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03103v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider MaxCut-type semidefinite programs (SDP) which admit a low rank solution. To numerically leverage the low rank hypothesis, a standard algorithmic approach is the Burer-Monteiro factorization, which allows to significantly reduce the dimensionality of the problem at the cost of its convexity. We give a sharp condition on the conditioning of the Laplacian matrix associated with the SDP under which any second-order critical point of the non-convex problem is a global minimizer. By applying our theorem, we improve on recent results about the correctness of the Burer-Monteiro approach on $\mathbb{Z}_2$-synchronization problems and the Kuramoto model.</description>

      <title>Contractive Dynamical Imitation Policies for Efficient Out-of-Sample Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07544v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Imitation learning is a data-driven approach to learning policies from expert behavior, but it is prone to unreliable outcomes in out-of-sample (OOS) regions. While previous research relying on stable dynamical systems guarantees convergence to a desired state, it often overlooks transient behavior. We propose a framework for learning policies modeled by contractive dynamical systems, ensuring that all policy rollouts converge regardless of perturbations, and in turn, enable efficient OOS recovery. By leveraging recurrent equilibrium networks and coupling layers, the policy structure guarantees contractivity for any parameter choice, which facilitates unconstrained optimization. We also provide theoretical upper bounds for worst-case and expected loss to rigorously establish the reliability of our method in deployment. Empirically, we demonstrate substantial OOS performance improvements for simulated robotic manipulation and navigation tasks.</description>

      <title>Contextual Similarity Distillation: Ensemble Uncertainties with a Single Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11339v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Uncertainty quantification is a critical aspect of reinforcement learning and deep learning, with numerous applications ranging from efficient exploration and stable offline reinforcement learning to outlier detection in medical diagnostics. The scale of modern neural networks, however, complicates the use of many theoretically well-motivated approaches such as full Bayesian inference. Approximate methods like deep ensembles can provide reliable uncertainty estimates but still remain computationally expensive. In this work, we propose contextual similarity distillation, a novel approach that explicitly estimates the variance of an ensemble of deep neural networks with a single model, without ever learning or evaluating such an ensemble in the first place. Our method builds on the predictable learning dynamics of wide neural networks, governed by the neural tangent kernel, to derive an efficient approximation of the predictive variance of an infinite ensemble. Specifically, we reinterpret the computation of ensemble variance as a supervised regression problem with kernel similarities as regression targets. The resulting model can estimate predictive variance at inference time with a single forward pass, and can make use of unlabeled target-domain data or data augmentations to refine its uncertainty estimates. We empirically validate our method across a variety of out-of-distribution detection benchmarks and sparse-reward reinforcement learning environments. We find that our single-model method performs competitively and sometimes superior to ensemble-based baselines and serves as a reliable signal for efficient exploration. These results, we believe, position contextual similarity distillation as a principled and scalable alternative for uncertainty quantification in reinforcement learning and general deep learning.</description>

      <title>Statistical Inference for Weighted Sample Average Approximation in Contextual Stochastic Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12747v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contextual stochastic optimization provides a framework for decision-making under uncertainty incorporating observable contextual information through covariates. We analyze statistical inference for weighted sample average approximation (wSAA), a widely-used method for solving contextual stochastic optimization problems. We first establish central limit theorems for wSAA estimates of optimal values when problems can be solved exactly, characterizing how estimation uncertainty scales with covariate sample size. We then investigate practical scenarios with computational budget constraints, revealing a fundamental tradeoff between statistical accuracy and computational cost as sample sizes increase. Through central limit theorems for budget-constrained wSAA estimates, we precisely characterize this statistical-computational tradeoff. We also develop "over-optimizing" strategies for solving wSAA problems that ensure valid statistical inference. Extensive numerical experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets validate our theoretical findings.</description>
