      <title>AutoGenesisAgent: Self-Generating Multi-Agent Systems for Complex Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) and their integration into multi-agent systems has paved the way for sophisticated automation in various domains. This paper introduces AutoGenesisAgent, a multi-agent system that autonomously designs and deploys other multi-agent systems tailored for specific tasks. AutoGenesisAgent comprises several specialized agents including System Understanding, System Design, Agent Generator, and several others that collectively manage the lifecycle of creating functional multi-agent systems from initial concept to deployment. Each agent in AutoGenesisAgent has distinct responsibilities ranging from interpreting input prompts to optimizing system performance, culminating, in the deployment of a ready-to-use system. This proof-of-concept study discusses the design, implementation, and lessons learned from developing AutoGenesisAgent, highlighting its capability to generate and refine multi-agent systems autonomously, thereby reducing the need for extensive human oversight in the initial stages of system design. Keywords: multi-agent systems, large language models, system design automation, agent architecture, autonomous systems, software deployment</description>

      <title>A multi-agent model of hierarchical decision dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decision making can be difficult when there are many actors (or agents) who may be coordinating or competing to achieve their various ideas of the optimum outcome. Here I present a simple decision making model with an explicitly hierarchical binary-tree structure, and evaluate how this might cooperate to take actions that match its various evaluations of the uncertain state of the world. Key features of agent behaviour are (a) the separation of its decision making process into three distinct steps: observation, judgement, and action; and (b) the evolution of coordination by the sharing of judgements.</description>

      <title>Agentive Permissions in Multiagent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes to distinguish four forms of agentive permissions in multiagent settings. The main technical results are the complexity analysis of model checking, the semantic undefinability of modalities that capture these forms of permissions through each other, and a complete logical system capturing the interplay between these modalities.</description>

      <title>On the Road to Clarity: Exploring Explainable AI for World Models in a Driver Assistance System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Autonomous Driving (AD) transparency and safety are paramount, as mistakes are costly. However, neural networks used in AD systems are generally considered black boxes. As a countermeasure, we have methods of explainable AI (XAI), such as feature relevance estimation and dimensionality reduction. Coarse graining techniques can also help reduce dimensionality and find interpretable global patterns. A specific coarse graining method is Renormalization Groups from statistical physics. It has previously been applied to Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) to interpret unsupervised learning. We refine this technique by building a transparent backbone model for convolutional variational autoencoders (VAE) that allows mapping latent values to input features and has performance comparable to trained black box VAEs. Moreover, we propose a custom feature map visualization technique to analyze the internal convolutional layers in the VAE to explain internal causes of poor reconstruction that may lead to dangerous traffic scenarios in AD applications. In a second key contribution, we propose explanation and evaluation techniques for the internal dynamics and feature relevance of prediction networks. We test a long short-term memory (LSTM) network in the computer vision domain to evaluate the predictability and in future applications potentially safety of prediction models. We showcase our methods by analyzing a VAE-LSTM world model that predicts pedestrian perception in an urban traffic situation.</description>

      <title>Real-World Deployment of a Hierarchical Uncertainty-Aware Collaborative Multiagent Planning System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We would like to enable a collaborative multiagent team to navigate at long length scales and under uncertainty in real-world environments. In practice, planning complexity scales with the number of agents in the team, with the length scale of the environment, and with environmental uncertainty. Enabling tractable planning requires developing abstract models that can represent complex, high-quality plans. However, such models often abstract away information needed to generate directly-executable plans for real-world agents in real-world environments, as planning in such detail, especially in the presence of real-world uncertainty, would be computationally intractable. In this paper, we describe the deployment of a planning system that used a hierarchy of planners to execute collaborative multiagent navigation tasks in real-world, unknown environments. By developing a planning system that was robust to failures at every level of the planning hierarchy, we enabled the team to complete collaborative navigation tasks, even in the presence of imperfect planning abstractions and real-world uncertainty. We deployed our approach on a Clearpath Husky-Jackal team navigating in a structured outdoor environment, and demonstrated that the system enabled the agents to successfully execute collaborative plans.</description>

      <title>Decentralized State-Dependent Markov Chain Synthesis with an Application to Swarm Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.02303v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a decentralized state-dependent Markov chain synthesis (DSMC) algorithm for finite-state Markov chains. We present a state-dependent consensus protocol that achieves exponential convergence under mild technical conditions, without relying on any connectivity assumptions regarding the dynamic network topology. Utilizing the proposed consensus protocol, we develop the DSMC algorithm, updating the Markov matrix based on the current state while ensuring the convergence conditions of the consensus protocol. This result establishes the desired steady-state distribution for the resulting Markov chain, ensuring exponential convergence from all initial distributions while adhering to transition constraints and minimizing state transitions. The DSMC's performance is demonstrated through a probabilistic swarm guidance example, which interprets the spatial distribution of a swarm comprising a large number of mobile agents as a probability distribution and utilizes the Markov chain to compute transition probabilities between states. Simulation results demonstrate faster convergence for the DSMC based algorithm when compared to the previous Markov chain based swarm guidance algorithms.</description>

      <title>Collision Avoidance Verification of Multiagent Systems with Learned Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03314v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For many multiagent control problems, neural networks (NNs) have enabled promising new capabilities. However, many of these systems lack formal guarantees (e.g., collision avoidance, robustness), which prevents leveraging these advances in safety-critical settings. While there is recent work on formal verification of NN-controlled systems, most existing techniques cannot handle scenarios with more than one agent. To address this research gap, this paper presents a backward reachability-based approach for verifying the collision avoidance properties of Multi-Agent Neural Feedback Loops (MA-NFLs). Given the dynamics models and trained control policies of each agent, the proposed algorithm computes relative backprojection sets by (simultaneously) solving a series of Mixed Integer Linear Programs (MILPs) offline for each pair of agents. We account for state measurement uncertainties, making it well aligned with real-world scenarios. Using those results, the agents can quickly check for collision avoidance online by solving low-dimensional Linear Programs (LPs). We demonstrate the proposed algorithm can verify collision-free properties of a MA-NFL with agents trained to imitate a collision avoidance algorithm (Reciprocal Velocity Obstacles). We further demonstrate the computational scalability of the approach on systems with up to 10 agents.</description>

      <title>A Grassroots Architecture to Supplant Global Digital Platforms by a Global Digital Democracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13468v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an architectural alternative to global digital platforms termed grassroots, designed to serve the social, economic, civic, and political needs of local digital communities, as well as their federation. Grassroots platforms may offer local communities an alternative to global digital platforms while operating solely on the smartphones of their members, forsaking any global resources other than the network itself. Such communities may form digital economies without initial capital or external credit, exercise sovereign democratic governance, and federate, ultimately resulting in the grassroots formation of a global digital democracy.</description>
