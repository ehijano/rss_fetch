      <title>$\delta$-core subsampling, strong collapses and TDA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a subsampling method for topological data analysis based on strong collapses of simplicial complexes. Given a point cloud and a scale parameter $\delta$, we construct a subsampling that preserves both global and local topological features while significantly reducing computational complexity of persistent homology calculations. We illustrate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments on synthetic and real datasets, showing improved persistence approximations compared to other subsampling techniques.</description>

      <title>Any interior point of a finite interval on the real line can be interpreted as dual Fr\'echet means</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we show that any interior point of an open interval on the real line can be interpreted as a pair of dual Fr\'echet quasi-arithmetic means associated with dual metric distances. A Riemannian interpretation of the Euclidean line brings to light a novel concept of dual scales of means, grounded in convex duality and of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal partitions into four parts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The famous pancake theorem states that for every finite set $X$ in the plane, there exist two orthogonal lines that divide $X$ into four equal parts. We propose an algorithm whose running time is linear in the number of points in $X$ and prove that this complexity is optimal. We also consider generalizations of the pancake theorem and show that orthogonal hyperplanes can be found in polynomial time.</description>

      <title>Quadratic-Time Algorithm for the Maximum-Weight $(k, \ell)$-Sparse Subgraph Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The family of $(k, \ell)$-sparse graphs, introduced by Lorea, plays a central role in combinatorial optimization and has a wide range of applications, particularly in rigidity theory. A key algorithmic challenge is to compute a maximum-weight $(k, \ell)$-sparse subgraph of a given edge-weighted graph. Although prior approaches have long provided an $O(nm)$-time solution, a previously proposed $O(n^2 + m)$ method was based on an incorrect analysis, leaving open whether this bound is achievable.
  We answer this question affirmatively by presenting the first $O(n^2 + m)$-time algorithm for computing a maximum-weight $(k, \ell)$-sparse subgraph, which combines an efficient data structure with a refined analysis. This quadratic-time algorithm enables faster solutions to key problems in rigidity theory, including computing minimum-weight redundantly rigid and globally rigid subgraphs. Further applications include enumerating non-crossing minimally rigid frameworks and recognizing kinematic joints. Our implementation of the proposed algorithm is publicly available online.</description>

      <title>Estimating the persistent homology of $\mathbb{R}^n$-valued functions using function-geometric multifiltrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04162v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given an unknown $\mathbb{R}^n$-valued function $f$ on a metric space $X$, can we approximate the persistent homology of $f$ from a finite sampling of $X$ with known pairwise distances and function values? This question has been answered in the case $n=1$, assuming $f$ is Lipschitz continuous and $X$ is a sufficiently regular geodesic metric space, and using filtered geometric complexes with fixed scale parameter for the approximation. In this paper we answer the question for arbitrary $n$, under similar assumptions and using function-geometric multifiltrations. Our analysis offers a different view on these multifiltrations by focusing on their approximation properties rather than on their stability properties. We also leverage the multiparameter setting to provide insight into the influence of the scale parameter, whose choice is central to this type of approach. From a practical standpoint, we show that our approximation results are robust to input noise, and that function-geometric multifiltrations have good statistical convergence properties. We also provide an algorithm to compute our estimators, and we use its implementation to conduct extensive experiments, on both synthetic and real biological data, in order to validate our theoretical results and to assess the practicality of our approach.</description>
