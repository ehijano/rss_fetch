      <title>Emergence of spatiotemporal patterns in a fuel-driven coupled cooperative supramolecular system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chemically fueled supramolecular systems can exhibit complex, time-dependent behaviors reminiscent of living matter when maintained far from equilibrium by continuous energy or fuel consumption. Here, we introduce a minimal reaction-diffusion model that captures the essential dynamics of a cooperative supramolecular polymerization network driven by monomer activation and deactivation. We show that a balance between autocatalytic growth and inhibitory decay sustains a nonequilibrium steady state in the model that undergoes a Hopf bifurcation, giving rise to autonomous oscillations. When spatial transport is introduced through diffusion, the system displays rich spatiotemporal phenomena, such as traveling wavefronts and transient polygonal patterns. Our results demonstrate that the interplay between reaction kinetics and diffusion can spontaneously generate self-organized, life-like dynamics in synthetic supramolecular polymer systems. This theoretical framework not only bridges molecular self-assembly and active matter dynamics but also provides design principles for creating adaptive, oscillatory, and self-patterning materials powered by chemical fuels.</description>

      <title>Inverse Design of Tightly Woven Smart Fabrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a geometric framework for the inverse design of smart woven fabrics composed of non-uniformly shrinking threads. A sufficiently tight weaving structure imposes strong local criteria on the material deformation and reduces the local geometry to a single scalar degree of freedom. Control over this degree of freedom can be achieved through simple calibration for each specific material system, via either mechanical experiments or numerical simulations. This reduction allows us to inverse-design a woven smart fabric, that conforms to an arbitrary target geometry when actuated, by solving a nonlinear hyperbolic partial differential equation. We validate this approach by deriving the thread-level actuation required for specific target geometries. We present both exact analytic solutions for symmetric shapes and a numerical optimization method for arbitrary freeform surfaces. These results confirm the practicality of our framework in achieving programmable, complex three-dimensional shaping.</description>

      <title>Orientational ordering and correlations in a quasi-one-dimensional hard-dumbbell fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a quasi-one-dimensional fluid of hard dumbbells with continuous orientational degrees of freedom using an exact transfer-matrix formulation. The model allows for a complete analytical characterization of thermodynamic properties, orientational ordering, and correlation functions in terms of the spectral properties of an integral operator. We derive exact expressions for the equation of state, the orientational distribution function, and both partial and total radial distribution functions. Their asymptotic behavior is governed by the complex poles of the Laplace-transformed correlation functions, which determine the positional and orientational correlation lengths. As density increases, the system exhibits a continuous crossover from a weakly ordered regime with a unimodal orientational distribution to a strongly constrained regime characterized by bimodal orientational ordering. This crossover is accompanied by a nonmonotonic behavior of the pressure relative to the Tonks gas and by a qualitative change in the decay of correlation functions from oscillatory to monotonic. In the high-pressure limit, we show that orientational and positional fluctuations contribute equally to the pressure, leading to a universal ratio of twice the Tonks pressure. The theoretical predictions are supported by numerical solutions of the discretized transfer operator and by scaling arguments that elucidate the high-pressure behavior of ordering and correlation lengths.</description>

      <title>Reversible viscoelasticity and irreversible elastoplasticity in the power law creep and yielding of gels and fibre network materials under stress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study computationally the creep and yielding of athermal gels and fibre network materials under a constant imposed shear stress, within a minimal model of interconnected filaments with central forces in $d=2$ spatial dimensions. Each filament is assumed Hookean initially, then breaks irreversibly above a threshold strain. At early times after the imposition of a small stress, we find purely viscoelastic creep response associated with non-affine deformations within the material, with solid terminal behaviour for a network coordination $Z&gt;2d=4$ and initially floppy response for $Z&lt;4$. For a marginally connected network, $Z=4$, we find sustained power law creep with a strain rate $\dot\gamma\sim t^{-1/2}$ and strain $\gamma \sim t^{1/2}$ as a function of time $t$ after the imposition of the stress. This viscoelastic regime gives way at later times to irreversible elastoplastic creep arising from filament breakage, broadening the range of values of $Z$ and time over which power law creep occurs, compared to a network with filament breakage disallowed. This accumulating damage can weaken the network to such an extent that catastrophic material failure then occurs after a long delay, which we characterise. Finally, we consider the implications of viscoelastic versus elastoplastic deformation for the extent to which a material will recover its original shape if the load is removed after some interval of creep.</description>

      <title>Coarsening dynamics of fingerprint labyrinthine patterns: Machine learning assisted characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fingerprint labyrinthine patterns exhibit a level of structural complexity beyond simple stripe phases, combining local stripe order with a dense network of point-like defects. Unlike symmetry-breaking phases, where coarsening proceeds via diffusive defect annihilation, or conventional stripe phases, where curvature-driven motion of extended grain boundaries dominates, the coarsening of fingerprint labyrinths is governed primarily by localized junction and terminal defects. Using the Turing-Swift-Hohenberg equation, we study the nonequilibrium relaxation of fingerprint labyrinthine patterns following a quench. To go beyond conventional Fourier-based diagnostics, we employ a template-matching convolutional neural network (TM-CNN) to identify and track junctions and terminals directly in real space, enabling a quantitative characterization of defect statistics and spatial correlations. We show that, although these point-like defects drive coarsening, their motion is strongly constrained by the surrounding stripe geometry, leading to slow, nondiffusive dynamics that are qualitatively distinct from both conventional phase ordering and stripe coarsening. Together, these results establish defect-mediated dynamics as the central organizing principle of fingerprint labyrinthine coarsening and demonstrate the effectiveness of machine-learning-assisted approaches for complex pattern-forming systems.</description>

      <title>Supercoiling DNA with a free end</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we combine coarse-grained Brownian dynamics simulations and mean-field theory to study supercoiling dynamics, as well as the steady-state profiles of twist and writhe, in an open DNA polymer where one of the free ends is subjected to a constant torque. Even though the other end is free, and hence can spin and release torsional stress, we observe that the entire chain transitions between a swollen and a plectonemic phase as the torque increases beyond a critical threshold. In the plectonemic phase, we observe a non-linear twist profile in the steady state, resulting from the mutual interconversion between the injected twist and geometrical writhe, which distributes inhomogeneously along the chain. We also show that the non-equilibrium dynamics of twist accumulation is diffusive, and that writhe diffusion is negligible in this geometry, as plectonemes remain localised near the end that is being rotated. We discuss the feasibility of testing our results with single-molecule experiments.</description>

      <title>Two-Dimensional Active Brownian Particles Crossing a Parabolic Barrier: Transition-Path Times, Survival Probability, and First-Passage Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive an analytical expression for the propagator and the transition path time distribution of a two-dimensional active Brownian particle crossing a parabolic barrier with absorbing boundary conditions at both sides. By taking those of a passive Brownian particle as basis states and dealing with the activity as a perturbation, our solution is expressed in terms of the perturbed eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the associated Fokker-Planck equation once the latter is reduced by taking into account only the coordinate along the direction of the barrier and the self-propulsion angle. We show that transition path times are typically shortened by the self-propulsion of the particle. Our solution also allows us to obtain the survival probability and the first-passage times distribution, which display a strong dependence on the particle's activity, while the rotational diffusivity influences them to a minor extent.</description>

      <title>Interaction between cell membranes and protein inclusions in the large-deformation regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biological membranes are dynamic surfaces whose shape and function are critically influenced by protein inclusions (PIs). While membrane deformations induced by PIs have been extensively studied in the small-deformation regime, a variety of processes involves strong membrane deformations. We investigate the interaction between lipid membranes and PIs in the large deformation (LD) regime, with the finite-element method. We develop an approximate analytical solution that captures key features of the LD regime. We show that the force exerted by the membrane on a PI displays a non-monotonic behavior with respect to the PI vertical displacement. The qualitative features of this force appear to be independent of the protein geometry. For two interacting PIs, the membrane-mediated potential exhibits sub-power-law decay with inter-protein distance, reflecting the complex nature of the elastic medium. The interaction potential shows that conical PIs with identical and opposite orientations repel and attract, respectively, confirming the analogy between PI orientation and electric charge, in the LD regime. In the presence of membrane flows, we identify a characteristic velocity that separates two regimes in which bending rigidity and viscous effects dominate, respectively, implying the onset of flow-induced deformations above such velocity threshold. Overall, our results provide quantitative predictions for membrane-protein systems in biologically relevant scenarios involving LDs, with implications for protein sorting, clustering, and membrane trafficking.</description>

      <title>Response of fluorescent molecular rotors in ternary macromolecular mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a few decades, Fluorescent Molecular Rotors have been commonly employed as local probes of microviscosity in complex materials. However, without proper calibration, relating microviscosity to a physical parameter is unclear, which strongly limits their quantitative use in biological media for instance. In this study, the response of a molecular rotor in binary and ternary macromolecular aqueous solutions of polyethylene glycol (PEG) of different molecular weights is investigated in order to better rationalize the sensitivity of rotors to their cybotactic environment. More precisely, for the investigated composition range of ternary mixtures, it is shown that a linear mixing rule applies for fluorescence lifetime with the proportion of the two PEG, and with an increasing ratio of heavy PEG leading to larger lifetimes. These results allow to test more precisely the free volume theory, which has been proposed in the context of probing glass transition. Analysis show that while this theory semi-quantitatively captures the observation, its precise use raises some questions.</description>

Abstract: Driven suspensions, where energy is input at a particle scale, are a framework for understanding general principles of out-of-equilibrium organization. A large number of simple interacting units can give rise to non-trivial structure and hierarchy. Rotationally driven colloidal particles are a particularly nice model system for exploring this pattern formation, as the dominant interaction between the particles is hydrodynamic. Here, we use experiments and large-scale simulations to explore how strong confinement alters dynamics and emergent structure at the particle scale in these driven suspensions. Surprisingly, we find that large-scale (many times the particle size) density fluctuations emerge as a result of confinement, and that these density fluctuations sensitively depend on the degree of confinement. We extract a characteristic length scale for these fluctuations, demonstrating that the simulations quantitatively reproduce the experimental pattern. Moreover, we show that these density fluctuations are a result of the large-scale recirculating flow generated by the rotating particles inside a sealed chamber. This surprising result shows that even when system boundaries are far away, they can cause qualitative changes to mesoscale structure and ordering.</description>

      <title>Elasticity without a reference state: continuum mechanics of active tension nets</title>

Abstract: A constitutive relation between stress and strain relative to a reference state is the basic assumption of elasticity theory. However, in living matter, stress is governed by (motor molecule) activity rather than a constitutive law. What paradigm takes the place of elasticity in this setting? Here, we derive a continuum theory of active mechanics by taking the continuum limit of the Active Tension Network model of 2d epithelia. Instead of a reference state, we start from a prescribed active force configuration, encoded in a Riemannian "tension metric". Intuitively, one expects cells to adjust their positions to achieve force balance by rearranging local sources of active stress. More precisely, the cell positions define an embedding of the tension metric into 2d physical space, which determines the macroscopic physical stress. For free boundaries, tissue adopts a certain intrinsically defined shape, the force-balanced embedding with minimal internal stress. Boundary forces then deform this embedding. The resulting stress transformation yields an effective stress-strain relation. Key elements of elasticity hence emerge from a "stress-only" starting point, explaining how tissue shape can be adiabatically controlled by active stress during morphogenesis. Plastic behavior arises from topological cell rearrangement, which we represent by a continuous reparameterization of the tension metric, providing a principled continuum theory of emergent elasto-plastic flow. To express this physics, we use the mathematics of isothermal coordinates and quasi-conformal maps. An explicit coarse-graining study, described in a companion paper, substantiates the results of our continuum analysis. The present theory elucidates the unconventional mechanics of living tissues and may apply to 2d active and granular materials more generally.</description>
