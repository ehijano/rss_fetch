      <title>Fluid Antenna System-Enabled UAV Communications in the Finite Blocklength Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a comprehensive framework for the performance analysis of fluid antenna system (FAS)-enabled unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) relaying networks operating in the finite blocklength regime. Our contribution lies in establishing a rigorous methodology for characterizing system reliability under diverse propagation environments. Closed-form expressions for the block error rate (BLER) are derived by employing a tractable eigenvalue-based approximation of the spatially correlated UAV-to-user link, whose underlying independent diversity components are modeled as Nakagami-$m$ fading. This approach addresses both line-of-sight (LoS) dominant rural and probabilistic non-line-of-sight (NLoS) urban scenarios. Furthermore, a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) asymptotic analysis is developed, revealing the fundamental diversity order of the UAV-to-user link. Based on this, we further address the practical issue of energy efficiency. A realistic energy efficiency maximization problem is formulated, which explicitly accounts for the time and energy overhead inherent in the FAS port selection process, a factor often omitted in idealized models. An efficient hierarchical algorithm is then proposed to jointly optimize the key system parameters. Extensive numerical results validate the analysis and illustrate that while FASs can yield substantial power gains, the operational overhead introduces a non-trivial trade-off. This trade-off leads to an optimal number of ports and fundamentally different UAV deployment strategies in rural versus urban environments. This work provides both foundational analysis and practical design guidelines for FAS-enabled UAV communications.</description>

      <title>Spectrum-Aware IRS Configuration Techniques for Ultrawideband Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) have become the subject of many current research efforts, as the ongoing wireless spectrum crunch has made the need to open higher frequency bands a priority. IRS are one of the alternatives proposed to overcome the problem of line-of-sight blocking in very high frequency wireless scenarios. The current state-of-the-art shows the difficulty of implementing practical IRS designs able to redirect large signal bandwidths, prone to the so-called beam split (BS) dispersion effect. In this work, we propose two highly efficient configuration techniques, adapted to ultrawideband downlink scenarios, based on localized optimization over the IRS surface. Such techniques exploit the BS effect while taking into account for the shape of the transmitted signal spectrum. Simulations considering different geometrical setups and different signal spectra show how the proposed techniques are able to guarantee an increased signal power at the receiver with respect to classical narrowband-based solutions or techniques that perform a global optimization over the entire IRS surface.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let p&gt;3 be an odd prime and m be a positive integer. Little progress on the study of optimal p-ary cyclic codes with parameters [p^m-1,p^m-2m-2,4] has been made.In this paper, by weakening the necessary and sufficient conditions on cyclic codes to have codewords of Hamming weight 3 and analyzing the solutions of certain equations over finite fields, four classes of optimal p-ary cyclic codes deduced by p^m+1/2 with parameters [p^m-1,p^m-2m-2,4] are presented.Wherein three classes of optimal p-ary cyclic codes are infinite.Many classes of known optimal quinary cyclic codes with parameters [5^m-1,5^m-2m-2,4] are special cases of the codes constructed in this paper.</description>

      <title>Fluid Antenna-Enhanced Flexible Beamforming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluid antenna systems encompass a broad class of reconfigurable antenna technologies that offer substantial spatial diversity for various optimization objectives and communication tasks. Their capability to enhance spatial resolution within a fixed physical aperture makes fluid antennas particularly attractive for next-generation wireless deployments. In this work, we focus on the beamforming problem using a two-dimensional planar fluid antenna array. Since both narrow-beam and broad-beam patterns are essential in practical communication networks, enabling flexible beamforming through fluid antennas becomes an important and interesting research direction. We establish a unified and flexible framework that connects arbitrary beam-pattern synthesis with fluid-antenna port selection. The resulting formulation transforms beam-pattern reconstruction into a sparse regression problem, which is addressed using a tailored compressive sensing algorithm designed to operate efficiently with the fast Fourier transform (FFT). Furthermore, to ensure physically consistent phase modeling in the desired beam, we introduce an iterative FFT-based phase retrieval method. Owing to its structure, the proposed phase-refinement procedure exhibits low computational complexity and rapid convergence, requiring only one FFT and one inverse FFT per iteration. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed flexible beamforming framework. Compared with conventional fixed-array architectures, fluid antennas exhibit significantly improved beam-pattern reconstruction accuracy, highlighting their potential for high-resolution and adaptive beamforming in future wireless systems.</description>

      <title>Constructions of block MDS LDPC codes from punctured circulant matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low density parity check (LDPC) codes, initially discovered by Gallager, exhibit excellent performance in iterative decoding, approaching the Shannon limit. MDS array codes, with favorable algebraic structures, are codes suitable for decoding large burst errors. The Blaum-Roth (BR) code, an MDS array code similar to the Reed-Solomon (RS) code but has a parity-check matrix prone to $4$-cycles. Fossorier proposed constructing quasi-cyclic LDPC codes from circulant permutation matrices but are not MDS array codes. This paper aims to construct codes that possess both the block MDS property and have no $4$-cycles in the Tanner graph of their parity-check matrices, namely the so-called block MDS LDPC codes. Non-binary block MDS QC codes were first constructed by [Tauz {\it et al. }IEEE ITW, 2025] using circulant shift matrices. We first generate a family of block MDS codes over $\F_2$ from punctured circulant permutation matrices. Second, we construct a family of block MDS LDPC codes from circulant matrices with column weight $&gt; 1$ (CM$(t)$). Additionally, we present the Moore determinant formula for CM$(t)$s and a sufficient condition to avoid $4$-cycles in CM\((t)\)-QC LDPC codes' Tanner graphs for $t&gt; 1$. We also point out the non-existence of binary block MDS CPM-QC LDPC codes. Compared to the codes constructed in [Li {\it et al. }IEEE TIT, 2023] and [Xiao {\it et al. }IEEE TCOM, 2021], our block MDS LDPC codes show enhanced random-error-correction at a similar code length and rate. Meanwhile, these codes can effectively combat burst errors when considered as array codes. Both of our two types of constructions for block MDS LDPC codes are applicable to the scenario of the binary field.</description>

      <title>Maximum Entropy and Bayesian Conditioning Under Extended Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the conditions under which Bayesian conditioning aligns with Maximum Entropy. Specifically, I address cases in which newly learned information does not correspond to an event in the probability space defined on the sample space of outcomes. To facilitate Bayesian conditioning in such cases, one must therefore extend the probability space so that the new information becomes an event in this expanded space. Skyrms (1985) argues that Bayesian conditioning in an extended probability space on a product space of outcomes aligns precisely with the solution from Maximum Entropy. In contrast, Seidenfeld (1986) uses Friedman and Shimony's (1971) result to criticize Skyrms' approach as trivial, suggesting that alignment holds only under a degenerate probability model. Here, I argue that Friedman and Shimony's result must either (1) be a benign consequence of Skyrms' approach, or (2) pose a universal challenge to any method of extending spaces. Accepting (2) would imply that Bayesian conditioning is incapable of accommodating information beyond the probability space defined on the original outcome space.</description>

      <title>On the SER Performance of ZF and MMSE Receivers in Pilot-Aided Simultaneous Communication and Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a symbol error rate (SER) analysis is provided to evaluate the impact of localization inaccuracy on the communication performance under Zero-Forcing (ZF) and Minimum Mean-Square Error (MMSE) equalizers. Specifically, we adopt a pilot-aided simultaneous communication and localization (PASCAL) system, in which multiple drones actively transmit signals towards the base station (BS). Upon receiving the signal, the BS estimates the drones' location parameters to reconstruct the channel matrix, which is then utilized for ZF and MMSE equalization. As the channel matrix is characterized by the estimated parameters associated with the target's location and the matrix inversion involved in ZF and MMSE further complicates the analysis, obtaining a closed-form SER expression becomes intractable. Thus, a tightly approximated SER expression is respectively derived for ZF and MMSE by using a hybrid approximation method incorporating Neumann approximation and Taylor approximation. Our analysis reveals several important design insights: first, the average SER of drone $k$ for both ZF and MMSE can be affected by the localization errors from all drones including drone $k$; second, the average SER of ZF is unaffected by the estimation inaccuracy of range, whereas the average SER of MMSE is influenced by it; third, ZF and MMSE is the most susceptible to the influence of angle estimation errors compared to the other localization errors; fourth, ZF is highly sensitive to localization errors and may be even worse than maximal ratio combining (MRC) under some conditions of significant estimation errors. Numerical simulation results verify our findings and also validate the accuracy of the analysis across a wide range of system parameters.</description>

      <title>TransCoder: A Neural-Enhancement Framework for Channel Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable communication over noisy channels requires the design of specialized error-correcting codes (ECCs) tailored to specific system requirements. Recently, neural network-based decoders have emerged as promising tools for enhancing ECC reliability, yet their high computational complexity prevents their potential practical deployment. In this paper, we take a different approach and design a neural transmission scheme that employs the transformer architecture in order to improve the reliability of existing ECCs. We call this approach TransCoder, alluding both to its function and architecture. TransCoder operates as a code-adaptive neural module aimed at performance enhancement that can be implemented flexibly at either the transmitter, receiver, or both. The framework employs an iterative decoding procedure, where both noisy information from the channel and updates from the conventional ECC decoder are processed by a neural decoder block, utilizing a block attention mechanism for efficiency. Through extensive simulations with various conventional codes (LDPC, BCH, Polar, and Turbo) and across a wide range of channel conditions, we demonstrate that TransCoder significantly improves block error rate (BLER) performance while maintaining computational complexity comparable to traditional decoders. Notably, our approach is particularly effective for longer codes (block length &gt;64) and at lower code rates, scenarios in which existing neural decoders often struggle (despite their formidable computational complexity). The results establish TransCoder as a promising practical solution for reliable communication among resource-constrained wireless devices.</description>

      <title>Maximum Spectral Efficiency With Adaptive MQAM Transmissions Over Terrestrial Coherent FSO Links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent free-space optical (FSO) communication is recognized as a key enabler for ultra-high-capacity fronthaul and backhaul links in next-generation wireless networks. Spectrally efficient $M$-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (MQAM) formats are well-suited for these links. However, theoretical analyses of adaptive MQAM transmissions over terrestrial FSO channels remain limited. In this letter, we first derive the spectral efficiency limit of adaptive unconstrained MQAM over gamma-gamma turbulence with pointing error. We then show that adaptive transmissions using only six square MQAM constellations performs close to the theoretical limit (within $0.10$-$0.12$ bits/s/Hz) across a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios and channel conditions.</description>

      <title>On Information Theoretic Fairness With A Bounded Point-Wise Statistical Parity Constraint: An Information Geometric Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study an information-theoretic problem of designing a fair representation under a bounded point-wise statistical (demographic) parity constraint. More specifically, an agent uses some useful data (database) $X$ to solve a task $T$. Since both $X$ and $T$ are correlated with some latent sensitive attribute or secret $S$, the agent designs a representation $Y$ that satisfies a bounded point-wise statistical parity, that is, such that for all realizations of the representation $y\in\cal Y$, we have $\chi^2(P_{S|y};P_S)\leq \epsilon$. In contrast to our previous work, here we use the point-wise measure instead of a bounded mutual information, and we assume that the agent has no direct access to $S$ and $T$; hence, the Markov chains $S - X - Y$ and $T - X - Y$ hold. In this work, we design $Y$ that maximizes the mutual information $I(Y;T)$ about the task while satisfying a bounded compression rate constraint, that is, ensuring that $I(Y;X) \leq r$. Finally, $Y$ satisfies the point-wise bounded statistical parity constraint $\chi^2(P_{S|y};P_S)\leq \epsilon$. When $\epsilon$ is small, concepts from information geometry allow us to locally approximate the KL-divergence and mutual information. To design the representation $Y$, we utilize this approximation and show that the main complex fairness design problem can be rewritten as a quadratic optimization problem that has simple closed-form solution under certain constraints. For the cases where the closed-form solution is not obtained we obtain lower bounds with low computational complexity. Here, we provide simple fairness designs with low complexity which are based on finding the maximum singular value and singular vector of a matrix. Finally, in a numerical example we compare our obtained results with the optimal solution.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Channel Knowledge Map for Multi-User Hierarchical Beam Training Under Position Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Channel knowledge map (CKM) emerges as a promising framework to acquire location-specific channel information without consuming wireless resources, creating new horizons for advanced wireless network design and optimization. Despite its potential, the practical application of CKM in beam training faces several challenges. On one hand, the user's precise location is typically unavailable prior to beam training, which limits the utility of CKM since its effectiveness relies heavily on accurate input of position data. On the other hand, the intricate interplay among CKM, real-time observations, and training strategies has not been thoroughly studied, leading to suboptimal performance and difficulties in practical implementation. In this paper, we present a framework for CKM-aided beam training that addresses these limitations. For single-user scenario, we propose a reward-motivated beam-potential hierarchical strategy which integrates partial position information and CKM. This strategy models the user equipment (UE) position uncertainty and formulates the hierarchical searching process as a pruned binary search tree. An optimal hierarchical searching strategy with minimal overhead is derived by evaluating the weights and rewards of potential codewords. Furthermore, a low-complexity two-layer lookahead scheme is designed to balance overhead and computational demands. For multi-user scenario, we develop a correlation-driven position-pruning training scheme, where sidelobe gains from inter-user interference are exploited to provide additional side information for overhead reduction, allowing all users to be simultaneously assigned their respective supportive beams. Simulations validate the superior performances of proposed approaches in advancing 6G beam training.</description>

      <title>Decoding Trombetti-Zhou codes: a new syndrome-based decoding approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2019, Trombetti and Zhou introduced a new family of $\mathbb{F}_{q^n}$-linear Maximum Rank Distance (MRD) codes over $\mathbb{F}_{q^{2n}}$. For such codes we propose a new syndrome-based decoding algorithm. It is well known that a syndrome-based decoding approach relies heavily on a parity-check matrix of a linear code. Nonetheless, Trombetti-Zhou codes are not linear over the entire field $\mathbb{F}_{q^{2n}}$, but only over its subfield $\mathbb{F}_{q^{n}}$. Due to this lack of linearity, we introduce the notions of $\mathbb{F}_{q^{n}}$-generator matrix and $\mathbb{F}_{q^{n}}$-parity-check matrix for a generic $\mathbb{F}_{q^{n}}$-linear rank-metric code over $\mathbb{F}_{q^{rn}}$ in analogy with the roles that generator and parity-check matrices play in the context of linear codes. Accordingly, we present an $\mathbb{F}_{q^n}$-generator matrix and $\mathbb{F}_{q^n}$-parity-check matrix for Trombetti-Zhou codes as evaluation codes over an $\mathbb{F}_q$-basis of $\mathbb{F}_{q^{2n}}$. This relies on the choice of a particular basis called \emph{trace almost dual basis}. Subsequently, denoting by $d$ the minimum distance of the code, we show that if the rank weight $t$ of the error vector is strictly smaller than $\frac{d-1}{2}$, the syndrome-based decoding of Trombetti-Zhou codes can be converted to the decoding of Gabidulin codes of dimension one larger. On the other hand, when $t=\frac{d-1}{2}$, we reduce the decoding to determining the rank of a certain matrix. The complexity of the proposed decoding for Trombetti-Zhou codes is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Efficient Estimation of Sum-Parameters for Multi-Component Complex Exponential Signals with Theoretical Cramer-Rao Bound Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenging problem of parameter estimation for multicomponent complex exponential signals, commonly known as sums of cisoids. Traditional approaches that estimate individual component parameters face significant difficulties when the number of components is large, including permutation ambiguity, computational complexity from high-dimensional Fisher information matrix inversion, and model order selection issues. We introduce a novel framework based on low-dimensional sum-parameters that capture essential global characteristics of the signal ensemble. These parameters include the sum of amplitudes, the power-weighted frequency, and the phase-related sum. These quantities possess clear physical interpretations representing total signal strength, power-weighted average frequency, and composite phase information, while completely avoiding permutation ambiguities. We derive exact closed-form Cramer-Rao bounds for these sum-parameters under both deterministic and stochastic signal models. Our analysis reveals that the frequency sumparameter achieves statistical efficiency comparable to single-component estimators while automatically benefiting from power pooling across all signal components. The proposed Efficient Global Estimation Method (EGEM) demonstrates asymptotic efficiency across a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios, significantly outperforming established techniques such as Zoom-Interpolated FFT and Root-MUSIC in both long- and short-sample regimes. Extensive numerical simulations involving 2000 Monte-Carlo trials confirm that EGEM closely approaches the theoretical performance bounds even with relatively small sample sizes of 250 observations.</description>

      <title>Quantum Private Distributed Matrix Multiplication With Degree Tables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore how quantum resources can be used to increase the rate of private distributed matrix multiplication (PDMM). In PDMM, a user who has two high-dimensional matrices, $A$ and $B$, and lacks the computational capabilities to apply matrix multiplication locally, divides the matrices $A$ and $B$ into $K$ and $L$ sub-blocks, respectively. Then, the user sends them to $N$ servers to apply the required multiplication privately from any $T$ servers. The goal is to reduce the number of servers needed to perform the required matrix multiplication. In the quantum setting, we allow the servers to share an entangled state and respond over quantum channels. Upon receiving the qudits, the user applies measurements to obtain the required multiplication. There are two main regimes in the PDMM literature: The high-privacy regime and the low-privacy regime where $T$ is less than $K$ and $L$.
  First, in the high-privacy regime, the state-of-the-art classical code is called the gap additive secure polynomial (GASP) code. We define a feasibility requirement in the quantum setting for the GASP code such that the highest performance is achieved when it is satisfied. When it is not satisfied, we address two main concerns. The first is to find a relation between the minimum privacy requirement and the dimensions of the two matrices needed for the feasibility condition to be satisfied. Second, we develop a new family of codes that can work in the quantum setting.
  Second, since GASP does not work efficiently in the low-privacy regimes compared to cyclic-addition degree tables (CAT) and discretely optimized GASP (DOG), we show that the feasibility condition developed for GASP can be adopted for both CAT and DOG codes as well. In addition, we propose another set of codes that can be used in the low privacy regime in the quantum setting when the feasibility requirement is not satisfied.</description>

      <title>A Classification of Elements of Sequence Space $Seq(\mathbb{R})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sequence space of all real-valued sequences, denoted $Seq(\mathbb{R})$, is typically investigated through the lens of infinite-dimensional vector spaces, utilizing Banach space norms or Schauder bases. This work proposes a complementary, constructive classification based instead on the asymptotic limit profile encoded by the pair $(\liminf a_n, \limsup a_n)$. We demonstrate that this perspective naturally partitions $Seq(\mathbb{R})$ into seven mutually disjoint macroscale blocks, covering behaviors from finite convergence to bounded and unbounded oscillation. For each block, we provide explicit closed-form representative sequences and establish that every constituent class possesses the cardinality of the continuum. Furthermore, we investigate the structural relationships between these blocks at two distinct levels of granularity. At the macroscale, we employ injective mappings to define an idealized connectivity graph, while at the microscale, we introduce a connection relation governed by the Hadamard (pointwise) product. This dual analysis reveals a rich directed graph structure where the block of finite convergent sequences functions as a global attractor with no outgoing connections. Statistical comparisons between the idealized and realized adjacency matrices indicate that the pointwise product structure realizes approximately two-thirds of the theoretically possible macroscale relations. Ultimately, this partition-based framework endows the seemingly chaotic space $Seq(\mathbb{R})$ with a transparent, geometrically interpretable internal structure.</description>

Abstract: We present a computationally-efficient algorithm for time-of-arrival (ToA) estimation that is robust under multipath propagation and strong interference. Our algorithm leverages multiple receive antennas to combine adaptive spatial filtering with autodifferentiation in order to super-resolve the tap of the first-arriving path at low computational complexity and without requiring model-order estimation. We use simulations with ray-traced indoor propagation channels to demonstrate significant performance improvements over conventional correlation-based ToA estimation methods and subspace techniques such as JADE.</description>

      <title>The Causal Uncertainty Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explains why internal and external validity cannot be simultaneously maximised. It introduces "evidential states" to represent the information available for causal inference and shows that routine study operations (restriction, conditioning, and intervention) transform these states in ways that do not commute. Because each operation removes or reorganises information differently, changing their order yields evidential states that support different causal claims. This non-commutativity creates a structural trade-off: the steps that secure precise causal identification also eliminate the heterogeneity required for generalisation. Small model, observational and experimental examples illustrate how familiar failures of transportability arise from this order dependence. The result is a concise structural account of why increasing causal precision necessarily narrows the world to which findings apply.</description>

Abstract: Let ${\mathcal C}(\Omega)$ be the linear code arising from a projective system $\Omega$ of $\mathrm{PG}(V).$ Consider the point-line geometry $\Gamma=({\mathcal P},{\mathcal L})$ and a projective embedding $\varepsilon\colon \Gamma\rightarrow \mathrm{PG}(V)$ of $\Gamma.$ We show that the projective code obtained by taking as projective system $\Omega:=\varepsilon(\mathcal{P})$ is minimal if the graph induced on the set $\Gamma\setminus\varepsilon^{-1}(H)$ by the collinearity graph of $\Gamma$ is connected for any hyperplane $H$ of $\mathrm{PG}(V)$. As an application, Grassmann codes, Segre codes, polar Grassmann codes of orthogonal, symplectic, hermitian type and codes arising from the point-hyperplane geometry of a projective space are minimal codes.</description>

      <title>Two-Stage Distributionally Robust Optimization Framework for Secure Communications in Aerial-RIS Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This letter proposes a two-stage distributionally robust optimization (DRO) framework for secure deployment and beamforming in an aerial reconfigurable intelligent surface (A-RIS) assisted millimeter-wave system. To account for multi-timescale uncertainties arising from user mobility, imperfect channel state information (CSI), and hardware impairments, our approach decouples the long-term unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) placement from the per-slot beamforming design. By employing the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) as a distribution-free risk metric, a low-complexity algorithm is developed, which combines a surrogate model for efficient deployment with an alternating optimization (AO) scheme for robust real-time beamforming. Simulation results validate that the proposed DRO-CVaR framework significantly enhances the tail-end secrecy spectral efficiency and maintains a lower outage probability compared to benchmark schemes, especially under severe uncertainty conditions.</description>

      <title>Closing the Generalization Gap in Parameter-efficient Federated Edge Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated edge learning (FEEL) provides a promising foundation for edge artificial intelligence (AI) by enabling collaborative model training while preserving data privacy. However, limited and heterogeneous local datasets, as well as resource-constrained deployment, severely degrade both model generalization and resource utilization, leading to a compromised learning performance. Therefore, we propose a parameter-efficient FEEL framework that jointly leverages model pruning and client selection to tackle such challenges. First, we derive an information-theoretic generalization statement that characterizes the discrepancy between training and testing function losses and embed it into the convergence analysis. It reveals that a larger local generalization statement can undermine the global convergence. Then, we formulate a generalization-aware average squared gradient norm bound minimization problem, by jointly optimizing the pruning ratios, client selection, and communication-computation resources under energy and delay constraints. Despite its non-convexity, the resulting mixed-integer problem is efficiently solved via an alternating optimization algorithm. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed design achieves superior learning performance than state-of-the-art baselines, validating the effectiveness of coupling generalization-aware analysis with system-level optimization for efficient FEEL.</description>

      <title>EMF-Compliant Power Control in Cell-Free Massive MIMO: Model-Based and Data-Driven Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The impressive growth of wireless data networks has recently led to increased attention to the issue of electromagnetic pollution and the fulfillment of electromagnetic field (EMF) exposure limits. This paper tackles the problem of power control in user-centric cell-free massive multiple-input-multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) systems under EMF constraints. Specifically, the power allocation maximizing the minimum data rate across users is derived for both the uplink and the downlink. To solve such optimization problems, two approaches are proposed, i.e., model-based and data-driven. The proposed model-based solutions for the downlink utilize successive convex optimization and the log-sum-exp approximation for the minimum of a discrete set, whereas ordinary techniques are employed for the uplink. With regard to data-driven solutions, solutions based on both end-to-end architectures and deep unfolding techniques are explored. Extensive numerical results confirm that the proposed model-based solutions effectively fulfill the EMF constraints while ensuring very good performance; moreover, the results show that the proposed data-driven approaches can tightly approximate the performance of model-based solutions but with much lower computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Bounding User Contributions for User-Level Differentially Private Mean Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04749v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of releasing the sample mean of bounded samples in a dataset, privately, under user-level $\varepsilon$-differential privacy (DP). We aim to derive the optimal method of preprocessing data samples, within a canonical class of processing strategies, in terms of the error in estimation. Typical error analyses of such \emph{bounding} (or \emph{clipping}) strategies in the literature assume that the data samples are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), and sometimes also that all users contribute the same number of samples (data homogeneity) -- assumptions that do not accurately model real-world data distributions. Our main result in this work is a precise characterization of the preprocessing strategy that gives rise to the smallest \emph{worst-case} error over all datasets -- a \emph{distribution-independent} error metric -- while allowing for data heterogeneity. We also show via experimental studies that even for i.i.d. real-valued samples, our clipping strategy performs much better, in terms of \emph{average-case} error, than the widely used bounding strategy of Amin et al. (2019).</description>

      <title>On the Age of Information in Single-Server Queues with Aged Updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19648v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Age of Information (AoI) is a performance metric that quantifies the freshness of data in systems where timely updates are critical. Most state-of-the-art methods typically assume that packets enter the monitored system with zero age, neglecting situations, such as those prevalent in multi-hop networks or distributed sensing, where packets experience prior delays. In this paper, the AoI is investigated when packets have a non-zero initial age. We derive an expression for the average AoI in this setting, showing that it equals the standard AoI plus a correction term involving the correlation between packet age and inter-departure times. When these variables are independent, the expression simplifies to an additive correction equal to the mean initial age. In cases where the dependency structure is unknown, we also establish lower and upper bounds for the correction term. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach across various queueing scenarios, such as forwarding, tandem, and retrial queues. Additionally, we explore the accuracy of the derived bounds on a tandem composed of several queues, a model that has not yet been analytically solved from an age perspective.</description>

The derived bounds improve previous results in certain parameter regimes and match the bandwidth cost of the construction proposed by Maturana and Rashmi (2022 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory) for $r^F\le r^I\le k^F$, implying that our bounds are tight in this case.</description>

      <title>Unified Error Analysis for Synchronous and Asynchronous Two-User Random Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17718v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a two-user random access system in which each user independently selects a coding scheme from a finite set for every message, without sharing these choices with the other user or with the receiver. The receiver aims to decode only user 1 message but may also decode user 2 message when beneficial. In the synchronous setting, the receiver employs two parallel sub-decoders: one dedicated to decoding user 1 message and another that jointly decodes both users messages. Their outputs are synthesized to produce the final decoding or collision decision. For the asynchronous setting, we examine a time interval containing $L$ consecutive codewords from each user. The receiver deploys $2^{2L}$ parallel sub-decoders, each responsible for decoding a subset of the message-code index pairs. In both synchronous and asynchronous cases, every sub-decoder partitions the coding space into three disjoint regions: operation, margin, and collision, and outputs either decoded messages or a collision report according to the region in which the estimated code index vector lies. Error events are defined for each sub-decoder and for the overall receiver whenever the expected output is not produced. We derive achievable upper bounds on the generalized error performance, defined as a weighted sum of incorrect-decoding, collision, and miss-detection probabilities, for both synchronous and asynchronous scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the high-dimensional asymptotics of empirical risk minimization (ERM) in over-parametrized two-layer neural networks with quadratic activations trained on synthetic data. We derive sharp asymptotics for both training and test errors by mapping the $\ell_2$-regularized learning problem to a convex matrix sensing task with nuclear norm penalization. This reveals that capacity control in such networks emerges from a low-rank structure in the learned feature maps. Our results characterize the global minima of the loss and yield precise generalization thresholds, showing how the width of the target function governs learnability. This analysis bridges and extends ideas from spin-glass methods, matrix factorization, and convex optimization and emphasizes the deep link between low-rank matrix sensing and learning in quadratic neural networks.</description>

      <title>Finite-Time Minimax Bounds and an Optimal Lyapunov Policy in Queueing Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18278v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce an original minimax framework for finite-time performance analysis in queueing control and propose a surprisingly simple Lyapunov-based scheduling policy with superior finite-time performance. The framework quantitatively characterizes how the expected total queue length scales with key system parameters, including the capacity of the scheduling set and the variability of arrivals and departures across queues. To our knowledge, this provides the first firm foundation for evaluating and comparing scheduling policies in the finite-time regime, including nonstationary settings, and shows that the proposed policy can provably and empirically outperform classical MaxWeight in finite time. Within this framework, we establish three main sets of results. First, we derive minimax lower bounds on the expected total queue length for parallel-queue scheduling via a novel Brownian coupling argument. Second, we propose a new policy, LyapOpt, which minimizes the full quadratic Lyapunov drift-capturing both first- and second-order terms-and achieves optimal finite-time performance in heavy traffic while retaining classical stability guarantees. Third, we identify a key limitation of the classical MaxWeight policy, which optimizes only the first-order drift: its finite-time performance depends suboptimally on system parameters, leading to substantially larger backlogs in explicitly characterized settings. Together, these results delineate the scope and limitations of classical drift-based scheduling and motivate new queueing-control methods with rigorous finite-time guarantees.</description>
