      <title>Simulating super-Chandrasekhar white dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the last few decades, there has been considerable interest in the violation of the sacred "Chandrasekhar" mass limit of white dwarfs (WDs). Peculiar over-luminous type Ia supernovae (such as SNLS-03D3bb) lend observational support to the idea that these super-Chandrasekhar WDs exist. Our group, for more than a decade, has been actively working on the theoretical possibility of these objects through the presence of the star's magnetic field. The magnetic field greatly contributes to the existence of these massive WDs, both through classical and quantum effects. In this work, we explore super-Chandrasekhar WDs, formed via evolution from a main sequence star, as a result of the classical effects of the star's magnetic field. We obtain super-Chandrasekhar WDs and new mass limit(s), depending on the magnetic field geometry. We explore the full evolution and stability of these objects from the main sequence stage through the one-dimensional stellar evolution code STARS. In order to do so, we have appropriately modified the given codes by introducing magnetic effect and cooling. Our simulation confirms that massive WDs are possible in the presence of a magnetic field satisfying underlying stability.</description>

      <title>Combined Surface Flux Transport and Helioseismic Far-side Active Region Model (FARM)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maps of the magnetic field at the Sun's surface are commonly used as boundary conditions in space-weather modeling. However, continuous observations are only available from the Sun's Earth-facing side. One commonly used approach to mitigate the lack of far-side information is to apply a surface flux transport (SFT) model to model the evolution of the magnetic field as the Sun rotates. Helioseismology can image active regions on the far side using acoustic oscillations, and hence has the potential to improve the modeled surface magnetic field. In this study, we propose a novel approach for estimating magnetic fields of active regions on the Sun's far side based on seismic measurements, and then include them into a SFT model. To calibrate seismic signal to magnetic field, we apply our SFT model to line-of-sight magnetograms from SDO/HMI to obtain reference maps of global magnetic fields. The resulting maps are compared with seismic maps on the Sun's far side computed using helioseismic holography. The spatial structure of the magnetic field within an active region is reflected in the spatial structure of seismic phase shifts. We assign polarities to the unipolar magnetic-field concentrations based on Hale's law and require approximate flux balance between the two polarities. From 2010 to 2024, we modeled 859 active regions, with an average total unsigned flux of $7.84\cdot 10^{21}$ Mx and an average area of $4.48\cdot 10^{10}$ km$^{2}$. Approximately $4.2\%$ of the active regions were found to have an anti-Hale configuration, which we manually corrected. Comparisons between modeled open-field areas and EUV observations reveal a substantial improvement in agreement when far-side active regions are included. This proof of concept study demonstrates the potential of the ``combined surface flux transport and helioseismic Far-side Active Region Model'' (FARM) to improve space-weather modeling.</description>

      <title>What Can DKIST/DL-NIRSP Tell Us About Quiet-Sun Magnetism?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quiet-Sun regions cover most of the Sun's surface; its magnetic fields contribute significantly to the solar chromospheric and coronal heating. However, characterizing the magnetic fields of the quiet Sun is challenging due to their weak polarization signal. The 4-m \textit{Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope} (\textit{DKIST}) is expected to improve our understanding of the quiet-Sun magnetism. In this paper, we assess the diagnostic capability of the Diffraction-Limited Near Infrared Spectropolarimeter (DL-NIRSP) instrument on \textit{DKIST} on the energy transport processes in the quiet-Sun photosphere. To this end, we synthesize high-resolution, high-cadence Stokes profiles of the \ion{Fe}{1} 630~nm lines using a realistic magnetohydrodynamic simulation, degrade them to emulate the \textit{DKIST}/DL-NIRSP observations, and subsequently infer the vector magnetic and velocity fields. For the assessment, we first verify that a widely used flow-tracking algorithm, Differential Affine Velocity Estimator for Vector Magnetograms, works well for estimating the large-scale ($&gt; 200$ km) photospheric velocity fields with these high-resolution data. We then examine how the accuracy of inferred velocity depends on the temporal resolution. Finally, we investigate the reliability of the Poynting flux estimate and its dependence on the model assumptions. The results suggest that the unsigned Poynting flux, estimated with existing schemes, can account for about $71.4\%$ and $52.6\%$ of the reference ground truth at $\log \tau =0.0$ and $\log \tau = -1$. However, the net Poynting flux tends to be significantly underestimated. The error mainly arises from the underestimated contribution of the horizontal motion. We discuss the implications on \textit{DKIST} observations.</description>

      <title>KIC 4150611: A quadruply eclipsing heptuple star system with a g-mode period-spacing pattern Asteroseismic modelling of the g-mode period-spacing pattern</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we aim to estimate the stellar parameters of the primary (Aa) by performing asteroseismic analysis on its period-spacing pattern. We use the C-3PO neural network to perform asteroseismic modelling of the g-mode period-spacing pattern of Aa, discussing the interplay of this information with external constraints from spectroscopy ($T_{\rm eff}$ and $\log(g)$) and eclipse modelling ($R$). To estimate the level of uncertainty due to different frequency extraction and pattern identification processes, we consider four different variations on the period-spacing patterns. To better understand the correlations between and the uncertainty structure of our parameter estimates, we also employed a classical, parameter-based MCMC grid search on four different stellar grids. The best-fitting, externally constrained model to the period-spacing pattern arrives at estimates of the stellar properties for Aa of: $M=1.51 \pm 0.05 M_\odot$, $X_c =0.43 \pm 0.04$, $R=1.66 \pm 0.1 R_\odot$, $f_{\rm ov}=0.010$, $\Omega_c=1.58 \pm 0.01$ d$^{-1}$ with rigid rotation to within the measurement errors, $\log(T_{\rm eff})=3.856 \pm 0.008$ dex, $\log(g)=4.18 \pm 0.04$ dex, and $\log(L)=0.809 \pm 0.005$ dex, which agree well with previous measurements from eclipse modelling, spectroscopy, and the Gaia DR3 luminosity. We find that the near-core properties of the best-fitting asteroseismic models are consistent with external constraints from eclipse modelling and spectroscopy. Aa appears to be a typical example of a $\gamma$ Dor star, fitting well within existing populations. We find that Aa is quasi-rigidly rotating to within the uncertainties, and note that the asteroseismic age estimate for Aa (1100 $\pm$ 100 Myr) is considerably older than the young (35 Myr) age implied by previous isochrone fits to the B binary in the literature. Our MCMC parameter-based grid-search agrees well with our pattern-modelling approach.</description>

      <title>New pulsating stars detected in EA-type eclipsing binary systems based on TESS data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsating stars in eclipsing binaries are very important to understand stellar interior structures through astroseismology because their absolute parameters such as the masses and radii can be determined in high precision based on photometric and spectroscopic data. The high-precision and continuously time-series photometric data of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) provides an unprecedented opportunity to search for and study this kind of variable stars in the whole sky. About 1626 Algol type (EA-type) eclipsing binary systems were observed by TESS in the 1-45 sectors with 2-minutes short cadence. By analyzing those TESS data, we found 57 new pulsating stars in EA-type binary stars. The preliminary results show that those binary systems have orbital periods in the range from 0.4 to 27 days, while the periods of pulsating components are in the range from 0.02 to 5 days. It is detected that 43 targets follow the correlation between pulsation and orbital periods of oscillating eclipsing binaries of Algol type (oEA), which may indicate that they are typical oEA stars. The other 14 targets may be other types of variable stars in eclipsing binary systems. These objects are a very interesting source to investigate the binary structures and evolutions as well as to understand the influences of tidal forces and mass transfer on stellar pulsations.</description>

      <title>On the transition from Slow to Fast Wind as Observed in Composition Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The solar wind is typically categorized as fast and slow based on the measured speed ($v_\mathrm{sw}$). The separation between these two regimes is often set between 400 and 600 km/s without a rigorous definition. Observations of the solar wind's kinetic signatures, chemical makeup, charge state properties, and Alfv\'enicity suggest that such a two-state model may be insufficiently nuanced to capture the relationship between the solar wind and its solar sources. We test this two-state fast/slow solar wind paradigm with heavy ion abundances (X/H) and characterize how the transition between fast and slow wind states impacts heavy ion in the solar wind. We show that (1) the speed at which heavy ion abundances indicate a change between fast and slow solar wind as a function of speed is slower than the speed indicated by the helium abundance; (2) this speed is independent of heavy ion mass and charge state; (3) the abundance at which heavy ions indicate the transition between fast and slow wind is consistent with prior observations of fast wind abundances; (4) and there may be a mass or charge-state dependent fractionation process present in fast wind heavy ion abundances. We infer that (1) identifying slow solar wind as having a speed $v_\mathrm{sw} \lesssim$ 400 km/s may mix solar wind from polar and equatorial sources; (2) He may be impacted by the acceleration necessary for the solar wind to reach the asymptotic fast, non-transient values observed at 1 AU; and (3) heavy ions are fractionated in the fast wind by a yet-to-be-determined mechanism.</description>

      <title>Can we detect super-Chandrasekhar white dwarfs via continuous gravitational waves?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of massive white dwarfs (WDs) containing more than Chandrasekhar's maximum mass has been suggested via the detection of peculiar type Ia Supernovae. It had been crucial to directly detect those 'super' (more massive)-Chandrasekhar WDs to confirm their existence. The WD's small size and cold internal environment have been a great disadvantage for detecting them via electromagnetic surveys like GAIA and SDSS. Although many WDs are detected in optical observations, none of the super-Chandrasekhar WDs was observed directly. Mukhopadhyay and his group proposed a decade ago that one of the possibilities to explain the high mass of super-Chandrasekhar WD is to exercise the existence of a strong magnetic field in the WD interior. The group also recently proposed that a high magnetic field, in turn, can nontrivially deform the star from a spherical shape. In the presence of rotation and obliquity angle, such WDs can radiate continuous gravitational waves (CGW). This opens up the exciting possibility of detecting the super-Chandrasekhar WDs with the upcoming detector LISA. However, the gravitational wave (GW) amplitude will decay with time due to electromagnetic radiation and quadrupolar radiation. Altogether, those decay mechanisms will set a timescale for detecting WDs via CGW. Even with a timescale bound, we can expect to detect a few super-Chandrasekhar WDs with a couple of years of cumulative detection, leading to the direct detection of super-Chandrasekhar WDs.</description>

      <title>A study of particles acceleration, heating, power deposition, and the damping length of kinetic Alfv\'en waves in non-Maxwellian coronal plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The heating of the solar corona and solar wind, through suprathermal particles and kinetic Alfv\'en waves within the 0 - 10 $R_{\rm Sun}$ range, has been a subject of great interest for many decades. This study investigates the acceleration and heating of charged particles and the role of KAWs in the solar corona. We investigate how KAWs transport energy and accelerate/heat the charged particles, focusing on the behavior of perturbed EM fields, Poynting flux vectors, net power transfer, resonant particle speed, group speed, and the damping length of KAWs. The study examines how these elements are influenced by suprathermal particles \kappa and the electron-to-ion temperature $T_e/T_i$. We use kinetic plasma theory coupled with the Vlasov-Maxwell model to investigate the dynamics of KAWs and particles. We assume a collisionless, homogeneous, and low-beta electron-ion plasma in which Alfv\'en waves travel in the kinetic limits. The results show the perturbed EM fields are significantly influenced by $\kappa$ and $T_e/T_i$. We evaluate both the parallel and perpendicular Poynting fluxes and find that the parallel Poynting flux dissipates gradually for lower \kappa values. The perpendicular flux dissipates quickly over shorter distances. Power deposition in solar flux tubes is significantly influenced by \kappa and Te/Ti. We find that particles can heat the solar corona over long distances in the parallel direction and short distances in the perpendicular direction. The group velocity of KAWs increases for lower \kappa values, and the damping length is enhanced under lower \kappa, suggesting longer energy transport distances. These findings offer a comprehensive understanding of particle-wave interactions in the solar corona and wind, with potential applications for missions such as the Parker Solar Probe (PSP), and can also apply to other environments.</description>

      <title>Examining the brightness variability, accretion disk, and evolutionary stage of the binary OGLE-LMC-ECL-14413</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our study aims to elucidate both short-term and long-term variations in the light curve of the eclipsing system OGLE-LMC-ECL-14413, with a particular focus on the unusual reversals in eclipse depth. We aim to clarify the role of the accretion disk in these fluctuations, especially in long-cycle changes spanning hundreds of days. Additionally, we seek to determine the evolutionary stage of the system and gain insights into the internal structure of its stellar components. We analyzed photometric time series from the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) project in the I and V bands, and from the MAssive Compact Halo Objects project in the BM and RM bands, covering a period of 30.85 years. Using light curve data from 27 epochs, we constructed models of the accretion disk. An optimized simplex algorithm was employed to solve the inverse problem, deriving the best-fit parameters for the stars, orbit, and disk. We also utilized the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics software to assess the evolutionary stage of the binary system, investigating the progenitors and potential future developments. We found an orbital period of 38.15917(54) d and a long-term cycle of approximately 780 d. Temperature, mass, radius, and surface gravity values were determined for both stars. The photometric orbital cycle and the long-term cycle are consistent with a disk containing variable physical properties, including two shock regions. The disk encircles the more massive star and the system brightness variations align with the long-term cycle at orbital phase 0.25. Our mass transfer rate calculations correspond to these brightness changes. \texttt{MESA} simulations indicate weak magnetic fields in the donor star's subsurface, which are insufficient to influence mass transfer rates significantly.</description>

      <title>The dramatic transition of the extreme Red Supergiant WOH G64 to a Yellow Hypergiant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19329v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Red Supergiants (RSGs) are cool, evolved massive stars in their final evolutionary stage before exploding as a supernova. However, the evolution and fate of the most luminous RSGs is uncertain. Observational evidence for luminous warm, post-RSG objects and the lack of luminous RSGs as supernova progenitors suggest a blueward evolution. In this work, we analyze WOH G64, considered since the 1980s as the most extreme RSG in the Large Magellanic Cloud in terms of its size, luminosity, and mass-loss rate. Time-series photometry over the last 30 years reveals a sudden, yet smooth change from semi-regular to irregular variability in 2014. Multi-epoch optical spectroscopy confirms the transition, as WOH~G64 now exhibits properties of a B[e] star in the optical, and warm-star features in the near-infrared. We discovered that WOH G64 is a rare, massive symbiotic system formed by a RSG, which transitioned to a Yellow Hypergiant, and a B-star companion. The dramatic transition can be explained by: a) binary interactions partially stripping the envelope, b) the return of WOH G64 to a quiescent state after an outstanding eruption exceeding 30 years, and c) the expulsion of its outer layers due to a pre-SN superwind phase, indicating its imminent explosion. WOH~G64 offers a unique opportunity to witness stellar evolution in real-time, providing crucial clues for the final phases of massive stars and their resulting supernovae.</description>

      <title>CME propagation in the dynamically coupled space weather tool: COCONUT + EUHFORIA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to present the time-dependent coupling between the coronal model COolfluid COroNal UnsTructured (COCONUT) and the heliospheric forecasting tool EUHFORIA.
  We perform six COCONUT simulations where a flux rope is implemented at the solar surface using either the Titov-D\'emoulin CME model or the Regularized Biot-Savart Laws (RBSL) CME model. At regular intervals, the magnetic field, velocity, temperature, and density of the 2D surface $R_{b}=21.5~\;R_{\odot}$ are saved in boundary files. This series of coupling files is read in a modified version of EUHFORIA to update progressively its inner boundary. After presenting the early stage of the propagation in COCONUT, we examine how the disturbance of the solar corona created by the propagation of flux ropes is transmitted into EUHFORIA. In particular, we consider the thermodynamic and magnetic profiles at L1 and compare them with those obtained at the interface between the two models.
  We demonstrate that the properties of the heliospheric solar wind in EUHFORIA are consistent with those in COCONUT, acting as a direct extension of the coronal domain. Moreover, the disturbances initially created from the propagation of flux ropes in COCONUT continue evolving from the corona in the heliosphere to Earth with a smooth transition at the interface between the two simulations. Looking at the profile of magnetic field components at Earth and different distances from the Sun, we also find that the transient magnetic structures have a self-similar expansion in COCONUT and EUHFORIA. However, the amplitude of the profiles depends on the flux rope model used and its properties, thus emphasizing the important role of the initial properties in solar source regions for accurately predicting the impact of CMEs.</description>

      <title>Long term UBV RI photometric and spectral monitoring of nova KT Eri during 2009-2023</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a status report of our intensive and long-term UBV RI photometric monitoring of nova KT Eri since its outbust in 2009. The old-nova in quiescence is characterized by very high excitation conditions (HeII 4686 being constantly the strongest emission line in optical spectra) and a complex-pattern photometric variability of one mag amplitude in which multi-periodicities (from hours to years) are mixed with chaotic activity of similar amplitude. Mean color and brightness levels are the same for pre- and post- outburst quiescence.</description>

      <title>A New LISA-Detectable Type Ia Supernova Progenitor in the Southern Sky: SMSS J1138-5139</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the discovery and analysis of a nearby eclipsing ultra-compact accreting binary at coordinates 11:38:10.91 $-$51:39:49.15 (SMSS J1138$-$5139), the first well-constrained LISA-detectable Type Ia supernova progenitor. Our time series optical spectroscopy identifies its orbital period through radial velocity monitoring at $P_{\rm orb,RV}=27.69\pm0.03~{\rm min}$; twice the photometric period seen in 2-minute cadence data from TESS Sector 37. We model our optical spectroscopy together with new simultaneous multi-band time series photometry from Gemini to place constraints on the binary parameters. Our light curve modeling finds that SMSS J1138$-$5139 contains an $M_2=0.24~{\rm M_\odot}$ pre-white dwarf donor with a massive $M_1=0.99~{\rm M_\odot}$ white dwarf accretor at orbital inclination $i=88.7~{\rm deg}$. Based on our photometrically derived system parameters, we expect that gravitational wave radiation will drive SMSS J1138$-$5139 to a merger within $\tau=5.7\pm0.3~{\rm Myr}$ and result in a Type Ia supernova. Even without a direct merger event, the component masses of SMSS J1138$-$5139 and active hydrogen accretion suggest that eventual helium accretion will likely also trigger a Type Ia supernova explosion through the dynamically-driven double-degenerate double-detonation (D6) channel. We expect LISA to detect the gravitational wave emission from SMSS J1138$-$5139 with signal-to-noise $7-10$ after a 48-month mission.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Field Geometry and Anisotropic Scattering Effects on Solar Radio Burst Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fine structures of solar radio bursts reveal complex dynamics in the corona, yet the observed characteristics of these sub-second bursts are additionally complicated by radio wave scattering in the turbulent solar corona. We examine the impact of anisotropic turbulence in radio-wave propagation simulations with non-radial magnetic field structures in shaping the morphology, time-characteristics, and source position of fine structures. The apparent sources are found to move along the direction of the magnetic-field lines and not along the density gradient, whereas the major axis of the scattered source is perpendicular to the local magnetic field (the scattering anisotropy axis). Using a dipolar magnetic field structure of an active region, we reproduce observed radio fine structure source motion parallel to the solar limb associated with a coronal loop and provide a natural explanation for puzzling observations of solar radio burst position motions with LOFAR. Furthermore, the anisotropy aligned with a dipolar magnetic field causes the apparent source images to bifurcate into two distinct components, with characteristic sizes smaller than in unmagnetized media. The temporal broadening induced by scattering reduces the observed frequency drift rate of fine structures, depending on the contribution of scattering to the time profile. The findings underscore the role of magnetic field geometry and anisotropic scattering for the interpretation of solar radio bursts and highlight that anisotropic scattering produces more than a single source.</description>

      <title>Ice inventory towards the protostar Ced 110 IRS4 observed with the James Webb Space Telescope. Results from the ERS Ice Age program</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work focuses on the ice features toward the binary protostellar system Ced 110 IRS 4A and 4B, and observed with JWST as part of the Early Release Science Ice Age collaboration. We aim to explore the JWST observations of the binary protostellar system Ced~110~IRS4A and IRS4B to unveil and quantify the ice inventories toward these sources. We compare the ice abundances with those found for the same molecular cloud. The analysis is performed by fitting or comparing laboratory infrared spectra of ices to the observations. Spectral fits are carried out with the ENIIGMA fitting tool that searches for the best fit. For Ced~110~IRS4B, we detected the major ice species H$_2$O, CO, CO$_2$ and NH$_3$. All species are found in a mixture except for CO and CO$_2$, which have both mixed and pure ice components. In the case of Ced~110~IRS4A, we detected the same major species as in Ced~110~IRS4B, as well as the following minor species CH$_4$, SO$_2$, CH$_3$OH, OCN$^-$, NH$_4^+$ and HCOOH. Tentative detection of N$_2$O ice (7.75~$\mu$m), forsterite dust (11.2~$\mu$m) and CH$_3^+$ gas emission (7.18~$\mu$m) in the primary source are also presented. Compared with the two lines of sight toward background stars in the Chameleon I molecular cloud, the protostar has similar ice abundances, except in the case of the ions that are higher in IRS4A. The clearest differences are the absence of the 7.2 and 7.4~$\mu$m absorption features due to HCOO$^-$ and icy complex organic molecules in IRS4A and evidence of thermal processing in both IRS4A and IRS4B as probed by the CO$_2$ ice features. We conclude that the binary protostellar system Ced~110~IRS4A and IRS4B has a large inventory of icy species. The similar ice abundances in comparison to the starless regions in the same molecular cloud suggest that the chemical conditions of the protostar were set at earlier stages in the molecular cloud.</description>

      <title>A New Look at Disk Winds and External Photoevaporation in the $\sigma$-Orionis Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disk winds play a crucial role in the evolution of protoplanetary disks. Typical conditions for star and planet formation are in regions with intermediate or strong UV radiation fields produced by massive stars. The $\sigma$-Orionis cluster is the ideal site to study disk winds under these conditions; its outer parts can be used to study disk evolution, while its innermost regions to study the effect of external irradiation. For this, we analyze the $\rm [OI]\,\lambda$6300, $\rm [NII]\,\lambda$6583, and $\rm [SII]\,\lambda$6731,$\lambda$6716 lines using high-resolution MIKE spectra of 27 classical T Tauri stars and complemented by intermediate-resolution X-shooter data. We decompose the line profiles into multiple Gaussian components. We calculated luminosities, line ratios, and kinematic properties of these components. We found that the $\rm [OI]\,\lambda$6300 line luminosity and kinematic properties are similar to those found in low-mass star-forming regions (SFRs). The frequency of single-component $\rm [OI]\,\lambda$6300 line profiles reflects the expected evolutionary stage given the intermediate age of $\sigma$-Orionis. This points to internal processes contributing to the line emission. However, the highly irradiated disks do not follow the accretion - [OI] luminosity relation found in low-mass SFRs, and all exhibit single-component line profiles. Line ratios of highly ionized species of [NII] and [SII] show higher ratios than typical values found in low-mass SFRs. The innermost regions of $\sigma$-Orionis are clearly affected by external irradiation, evidenced by the lack of correlation in the accretion - [OI] luminosity relation. The broad line widths of close-in sources, however, indicate a contribution from internal processes, such as magnetohydrodynamical winds and/or internal photoevaporation. This suggests a coevolution of internal and external winds in $\sigma$-Orionis.</description>

      <title>Gravity's role in taming the Tayler instability in red giant cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stability of toroidal magnetic fields within the interior of stars remains a significant unresolved issue in contemporary astrophysics. In this study, we combine a nonlocal linear analysis with 3D direct numerical simulations to examine the instability of toroidal fields within nonrotating, stably stratified stellar interiors in spherical geometry. Both analyses start from an equilibrium solution derived from balancing the Lorentz force with an anisotropic component of the fluid pressure, which is unstable to the (nonaxisymmetric) Tayler instability, and account for the combined effects of gravity and thermal diffusion. The numerical simulations incorporate finite magnetic resistivity and fluid viscosity while reaching a regime of highly stable stratification that has never been explored before. The linear analysis, which is global in the radial direction, shows that gravity significantly reduces the growth rate of the instability and uncovers the importance of unstable modes with low radial wavenumbers operating at low latitudes. The simulations trace the entire evolution of the instability from the linear to the nonlinear phase and strongly corroborate the findings of the linear analysis. Our results reveal that in highly stratified stellar interiors, the newly configured magnetic fields remain unstable only on the thermal diffusion timescale. Combining the linear analysis results with stellar evolution models of low-mass stars, we find that the limiting toroidal field strength for Tayler instability in red giant cores decreases with the stellar evolution. The predicted field strengths align with the ones expected from recent asteroseismic observations, suggesting that the observed fields may be remnants of a Tayler instability during the transition from the main sequence to the giant phase.</description>

      <title>A gravitational wave detectable candidate Type Ia supernova progenitor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19916v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type Ia supernovae, critical for studying cosmic expansion, arise from thermonuclear explosions of white dwarfs, but their precise progenitor pathways remain unclear. Growing evidence supports the ``double-degenerate'' scenario, where two white dwarfs interact. The absence of other companion types capable of explaining the observed Ia rate, along with observations of hyper-velocity white dwarfs interpreted as surviving companions of such systems provide compelling evidence in favor of this scenario. Upcoming millihertz gravitational wave observatories like the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) are expected to detect thousands of double-degenerate systems, though the most compact known candidate Ia progenitors produce only marginally detectable gravitational wave signals. Here, we report observations of ATLAS J1138-5139, a binary white dwarf system with an orbital period of 28 minutes. Our analysis reveals a 1 solar mass carbon-oxygen white dwarf accreting from a helium-core white dwarf. Given its mass, the accreting carbon-oxygen white dwarf is poised to trigger a typical-luminosity Type Ia supernova within a few million years, or to evolve into a stably mass-transferring AM CVn system. ATLAS J1138-5139 provides a rare opportunity to calibrate binary evolution models by directly comparing observed orbital parameters and mass transfer rates closer to merger than any previously identified candidate Type Ia progenitor. Its compact orbit ensures detectability by LISA, demonstrating the potential of millihertz gravitational wave observatories to reveal a population of Type Ia progenitors on a Galactic scale, paving the way for multi-messenger studies offering insights into the origins of these cosmologically significant explosions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new scale decomposition method to investigate turbulence in wavenumber-frequency space. Using 3D magnetohydrodynamic turbulence simulations, we show that magnetic fluctuations with time scales longer than the nonlinear time exhibit an inverse cascade toward even smaller frequencies. Low frequency magnetic fluctuations support turbulence, acting as an energy reservoir that is converted into plasma kinetic energy, the latter cascading toward large wavenumbers and frequencies, where it is dissipated. Our results shed new light on the spatio-temporal properties of turbulence, potentially explaining the origin and role of low frequency turbulent fluctuations in the solar wind.</description>

      <title>Silicon Isotopic Composition of Mainstream Presolar SiC Grains Revisited: The Impact of Nuclear Reaction Rate Uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Presolar grains are stardust particles that condensed in the ejecta or in the outflows of dying stars and can today be extracted from meteorites. They recorded the nucleosynthetic fingerprint of their parent stars and thus serve as valuable probes of these astrophysical sites. The most common types of presolar silicon carbide grains (called mainstream SiC grains) condensed in the outflows of asymptotic giant branch stars. Their measured silicon isotopic abundances are not significantly influenced by nucleosynthesis within the parent star, but rather represents the pristine stellar composition. Silicon isotopes can thus be used as a proxy for galactic chemical evolution. However, the measured correlation of $^{29}$Si/$^{28}$Si versus $^{30}$Si/$^{28}$Si does not agree with any current chemical evolution model. Here, we use a Monte Carlo model to vary nuclear reaction rates within their theoretical or experimental uncertainties and process them through stellar nucleosynthesis and galactic chemical evolution models to study the variation of silicon isotope abundances based on these nuclear reaction rate uncertainties. We find that these uncertainties can indeed be responsible for the discrepancy between measurements and models and that the slope of the silicon isotope correlation line measured in mainstream SiC grains agrees with chemical evolution models within the nuclear reaction rate uncertainties. Our result highlights the importance of future precision reaction rate measurements for resolving the apparent data-model discrepancy.</description>

      <title>SIRIUS: Identifying Metal-poor Stars Enriched by a Single Supernova in a Star-by-star Cosmological Zoom-in Simulation of a Dwarf Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metal-poor stars enriched by a single supernova (mono-enriched stars) are direct proof (and provide valuable probes) of supernova nucleosynthesis. Photometric and spectroscopic observations have shown that metal-poor stars have a wide variety of chemical compositions; the star's chemical composition reflects the nucleosynthesis process(es) that occurred before the star's formation. While the identification of mono-enriched stars enables us to study the ejecta properties of a single supernova, the fraction of mono-enriched stars among metal-poor stars remains unknown. Here we identify mono-enriched stars in a star-by-star cosmological zoom-in simulation of a dwarf galaxy. We find that the fraction of mono-enriched stars is higher for lower metallicity, stars with [Fe/H] $&lt; -2.5$. The percentages of mono-enriched stars are 11% at [Fe/H] = $-$5.0 and 1% at [Fe/H] = $-$2.5, suggesting that most metal-poor stars are affected by multiple supernovae. We also find that mono-enriched stars tend to be located near the center of the simulated dwarf. Such regions will be explored in detail in upcoming surveys such as the Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS) on the Subaru telescope.</description>

      <title>A giant planet transiting a 3-Myr protostar with a misaligned disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astronomers have found more than a dozen planets transiting 10-40 million year old stars, but even younger transiting planets have remained elusive. A possible reason for the lack of such discoveries is that newly formed planets are not yet in a configuration that would be recognized as a transiting planet or cannot exhibit transits because our view is blocked by a protoplanetary disk. However, we now know that many outer disks are warped; provided the inner disk is depleted, transiting planets may thus be visible. Here we report the observations of the transiting planet IRAS 04125+2902 b orbiting a 3 Myr, 0.7 M$_\odot$, pre-main sequence star in the Taurus Molecular Cloud. IRAS 04125+2902 hosts a nearly face-on (i $\sim$ 30$^\circ$) transitional disk and a wide binary companion. The planet has a period of 8.83 days, a radius of 10.9 R$_\oplus$ (0.97R$_J$), and a 95%-confidence upper limit on its mass of 90M$_\oplus$ (0.3M$_J$) from radial velocity measurements, making it a possible precursor of the super-Earths and sub-Neptunes that are commonly found around main-sequence stars. The rotational broadening of the star and the orbit of the wide (4", 635 AU) companion are both consistent with edge-on orientations. Thus, all components of the system appear to be aligned except the outer disk; the origin of this misalignment is unclear. Given the rare set of circumstances required to detect a transiting planet at ages when the disk is still present, IRAS 04125+2902 b likely provides a unique window into sub-Neptunes immediately following formation.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Dissipative Forces in Celestial Motion Using the Method of Multiple Scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the influence of nonlinear dissipative forces, specifically Gravitational Friction (GF), on the precession of celestial bodies within the framework of general relativity. We derive a modified line element by introducing a density-dependent term to model interactions between planetary bodies and the low-density interplanetary medium, providing a covariant description of dissipative forces in planetary motion. The resulting metric modification leads to corrections in the perihelion precession of Mercury, also reproducing the classical relativistic predictions. Utilizing the method of multiple scales, we analyze perturbative effects induced by GF. Using this model, we successfully constrain the medium density near Mercury to approximately $\rho_0 \approx 1.12 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{kg/m}^3$. These findings offer a new approach for incorporating dissipative mechanisms into general relativity, with potential applications in other astrophysical systems.</description>

      <title>Stellar atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances of about 5 million stars from S-PLUS multi-band photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Spectroscopic surveys like APOGEE, GALAH, and LAMOST have significantly advanced our understanding of the Milky Way by providing extensive stellar parameters and chemical abundances. Complementing these, photometric surveys with narrow/medium-band filters, such as the Southern Photometric Local Universe Survey (S-PLUS), offer the potential to estimate stellar parameters and abundances for a much larger number of stars.
  Aims. This work develops methodologies to extract stellar atmospheric parameters and selected chemical abundances from S-PLUS photometric data, which spans ~3000 square degrees using seven narrowband and five broadband filters.
  Methods. Using 66 S-PLUS colors, we estimated parameters based on training samples from LAMOST, APOGEE, and GALAH, applying Cost-Sensitive Neural Networks (NN) and Random Forests (RF). We tested for spurious correlations by including abundances not covered by the S-PLUS filters and evaluated NN and RF performance, with NN consistently outperforming RF. Including Teff and log g as features improved accuracy by ~3%. We retained only parameters with a goodness-of-fit above 50%.
  Results. Our approach provides reliable estimates of fundamental parameters (Teff, log g, [Fe/H]) and abundance ratios such as [{\alpha}/Fe], [Al/Fe], [C/Fe], [Li/Fe], and [Mg/Fe] for ~5 million stars, with goodness-of-fit &gt;60%. Additional ratios like [Cu/Fe], [O/Fe], and [Si/Fe] were derived but are less accurate. Validation using star clusters, TESS, and J-PLUS data confirmed the robustness of our methodology.
  Conclusions. By leveraging S-PLUS photometry and machine learning, we present a cost-effective alternative to high-resolution spectroscopy for deriving stellar parameters and abundances, enabling insights into Milky Way stellar populations and supporting future classification efforts.</description>

      <title>SynthPop: A New Framework for Synthetic Milky Way Population Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present SynthPop, a new open source, modular population synthesis Galactic modeling software to simulate catalogs of Milky Way stars along any sightline outward from the Sun. Motivated by a lack flexibility in existing Galactic models, SynthPop is coded entirely in python, can be run standalone or as an imported module, and is configured by json files that allow different model components to be switched out as desired. We describe the modular code structure, how the population generation process runs, and how to use the code. We also present model validation testing and known inaccuracies, and present an example of the code use, comparing Gaia data and the Gaia Universe Model Snapshot to a SynthPop implementation. The code is available now via GitHub with ReadTheDocs documentation and can be installed via pip.</description>

      <title>Potential for life to exist and be detected on Earth-like planets orbiting white dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With recent observations confirming exoplanets orbiting white dwarfs, there is growing interest in exploring and quantifying the habitability of temperate rocky planets around white dwarfs. In this work, the limits of the habitable zone of an Earth-like planet around a white dwarf are computed based on the incident stellar flux, and these limits are utilized to assess the duration of habitability at a given orbital distance. For a typical $0.6 M_\odot$ white dwarf an Earth-like planet at $\sim 0.012$ AU could remain in the temporally evolving habitable zone, maintaining conditions to support life, for nearly 7 Gyr. In addition, additional constraints on habitability are studied for the first time by imposing the requirement of receiving sufficient photon fluxes for UV-mediated prebiotic chemistry and photosynthesis. We demonstrate that these thresholds are comfortably exceeded by planets in the habitable zone. The prospects for detecting atmospheric biosignatures are also evaluated, and shown to require integration times on the order of one hour or less for ongoing space observations with JWST.</description>

      <title>The spectra of a radiative reprocessing outflow model for fast blue optical transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The radiation reprocessing model, in which an optically-thick outflow absorbs the high-energy emission from a central source and re-emits in longer wavelengths, has been frequently invoked to explain some optically bright transients, such as fast blue optical transients (FBOTs) whose progenitor and explosion mechanism are still unknown. Previous studies on this model did not take into account the frequency dependence of the opacity. We study the radiative reprocessing and calculate the UV-optical-NIR band spectra from a spherical outflow composed of pure hydrogen gas, for a time-dependent outflowing mass rate. Electron scattering and frequency-dependent bound-free, free-free opacities are considered. The spectrum deviates from the blackbody at NIR and UV frequencies; in particular, it has $\nu L_{\nu} \propto \nu^{1.5}$ at NIR frequencies, because at these frequencies the absorption optical depth from the outflow's outer edge to the so-called photon trapping radius is large and is frequency dependent. We apply our model to the proto-type FBOT AT2018cow by {the spectra} to the observed SED. The best-fit mass loss rate suggests that the total outflow mass in AT2018cow is $M_{\rm out} \approx 5.7^{+0.4}_{-0.4} \, M_{\odot}$. If that equals the total mass lost during an explosion, and if the progenitor is a blue supergiant (with a pre-explosion mass of $\sim 20 \, M_{\odot}$), then it will suggest that the central compact remnant mass is at least $\approx \, \rm{14 \, M_{\odot}}$. This would imply that the central remnant is a black hole.</description>

      <title>Mapping the Milky Way with Gaia XP spectra I: Systematic flux corrections and atmospheric parameters for 68 million stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaia XP spectra for over two hundred million stars have great potential for mapping metallicity across the Milky Way. Several recent studies have analyzed this data set to derive parameters and characterize systematics in the fluxes. We aim to construct an alternative catalog of atmospheric parameters from Gaia XP spectra by fitting them with synthetic spectra based on model atmospheres, and provide corrections to the XP fluxes according to stellar colors, magnitudes, and extinction. We use GaiaXPy to obtain calibrated spectra and apply FERRE to match the corrected XP spectra with models and infer atmospheric parameters. We train a neural network using stars in APOGEE to predict flux corrections as a function of wavelength for each target. Based on the comparison with APOGEE parameters, we conclude that our estimated parameters have systematic errors and uncertainties in $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$, $\log g$, and [M/H] about $-38 \pm 167$ K, $0.05 \pm 0.40$ dex, and $-0.12 \pm 0.19$ dex, respectively, for stars in the range $4000 \le T_{\mathrm{eff}} \le 7000$ K. The corrected XP spectra show better agreement with both models and Hubble Space Telescope CALSPEC data. Our correction increases the precision of the relative spectrophotometry of the XP data from $3.2\% - 3.7\%$ to $1.2\% - 2.4\%$. Finally, we have built a catalog of atmospheric parameters for stars within $4000 \le T_{\mathrm{eff}} \le 7000$ K, comprising $68,394,431$ sources, along with a subset of $124,188$ stars with $\mathrm{[M/H]} \le -2.5$. Our results confirm that the Gaia XP flux calibrated spectra show systematic patterns as a function of wavelength that are tightly related to colors, magnitudes, and extinction. Our optimization algorithm can give us accurate atmospheric parameters of stars with a clear and direct link to models of stellar atmospheres, and can be used to efficiently search for extremely metal-poor stars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key to understand exoplanets is characterisation of their host stars. One of the most powerful tools to characterise stellar properties like effective temperature, surface gravity and metallicity, is spectroscopy based on observations of stellar atmospheres. This chapter describes the stellar parameters that can be derived from a spectrum with examples of well established methods and theoretical model atmospheres. Combined with photometry and parallax measurements, the outcome of the spectroscopic modelling can be used to derive stellar radii and masses.</description>

      <title>Deviations from the universal Initial Mass Function in binary star clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stellar mass distribution in star-forming regions, stellar clusters and associations, the Initial Mass Function (IMF), appears to be invariant across different star-forming environments, and is consistent with the IMF observed in the Galactic field. Deviations from the field, or standard, IMF, if genuine, would be considered strong evidence for a different set of physics at play during the formation of stars in the birth region in question. We analyse N-body simulations of the evolution of spatially and kinematically substructured star-forming regions to identify the formation of binary star clusters, where two (sub)clusters which form from the same Giant Molecular Cloud orbit a common centre of mass. We then compare the mass distributions of stars in each of the subclusters and compare them to the standard IMF, which we use to draw the stellar masses in the star-forming region from which the binary cluster(s) form. In each binary cluster that forms, the mass distributions of stars in one subcluster deviates from the standard IMF, and drastically so when we apply similar mass resolution limits as for the observed binary clusters. Therefore, if a binary subcluster is observed to have an unusual IMF, this may simply be the result of dynamical evolution, rather than different physical conditions for star formation in these systems.</description>

      <title>Can the central compact object in HESS J1731--347 be indeed the lightest neutron star observed?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exceptionally low mass of $0.77_{-0.17}^{+0.2} M_{\odot}$ for the central compact object (CCO) XMMU J173203.3 -- 344518 (XMMU J1732) in the supernova remnant (SNR) HESS J1731 -- 347 challenges standard neutron star (NS) formation models. The nearby post-AGB star IRAS 17287 -- 3443 ($\approx 0.6 M_\odot$), also within the SNR, enriches the scenario. To address this puzzle, we advance the possibility that the gravitational collapse of a rotating pre-SN iron core ($\approx 1.2 M_\odot$) could result in a low-mass NS. We show that angular momentum conservation during the collapse of an iron core rotating at $\approx 45\%$ of the Keplerian limit results in a mass loss of $\approx 0.3 M_\odot$, producing a stable newborn NS of $\approx 0.9 M_\odot$. Considering the possible spin-down, this indicates that the NS is now slowly rotating, thus fulfilling the observed mass-radius relation. Additionally, the NS's surface temperature ($\approx 2 \times 10^6$ K) aligns with canonical thermal evolution for its $\approx 4.5$ kyr age. We propose the pre -- SN star, likely an ultra-stripped core of $\approx 4.2 M_\odot$, formed a tidally locked binary with IRAS 17287 -- 3443, having a 1.43-day orbital period. The supernova led to a $\approx 3 M_\odot$ mass loss, imparting a kick velocity $\lesssim 670$ km s$^{-1}$, which disrupted the binary. This scenario explains the observed 0.3 pc offset between XMMU J1732 and IRAS 17287 -- 3443 and supports the possibility of CCOs forming in binaries, with rotation playing a key role in core-collapse, and the CCO XMMU J1732 being the lightest NS ever observed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.06609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an update to the in-flight radiometric calibration of the Hinode EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS), revising and extending our previous studies.
  We analyze full-spectral EIS observations of quiet Sun and active regions from 2007 until 2022.
  Using CHIANTI version 10, we adjust the EIS relative effective areas for a selection of dates with emission measure analyses of off-limb quiet Sun.
  We find generally good agreement (within typically +/- 15%) between measured and expected line intensities.
  We then consider selected intensity ratios for all the dates and apply an automatic fitting method to adjust the relative effective areas. To constrain the absolute values from 2010 and later we force agreement between EIS and Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) Atmospheric Imaging Assembly
  (AIA) 193 A observations. The resulting calibration, with an uncertainty of about +/- 20%, is then validated in various ways, including flare line ratios from Fe XXIV and Fe XVII, emission measure analyses of cool active region loops, and several density-dependent line ratios.</description>

      <title>3D Gap Opening in Non-Ideal MHD Protoplanetary Disks: Asymmetric Accretion, Meridional Vortices, and Observational Signatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18292v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent high-angular resolution ALMA observations have revealed rich information about protoplanetary disks, including ubiquitous substructures and three-dimensional gas kinematics at different emission layers. One interpretation of these observations is embedded planets. Previous 3-D planet-disk interaction studies are either based on viscous simulations, or non-ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations with simple prescribed magnetic diffusivities. This study investigates the dynamics of gap formation in 3-D non-ideal MHD disks using non-ideal MHD coefficients from the look-up table that is self-consistently calculated based on the thermo-chemical code. We find a concentration of the poloidal magnetic flux in the planet-opened gap (in agreement with previous work) and enhanced field-matter coupling due to gas depletion, which together enable efficient magnetic braking of the gap material, driving a fast accretion layer significantly displaced from the disk midplane. The fast accretion helps deplete the gap further and is expected to negatively impact the growth of planetary embryos. It also affects the corotation torque by shrinking the region of horseshoe orbits on the trailing side of the planet. Together with the magnetically driven disk wind, the fast accretion layer generates a large, persistent meridional vortex in the gap, which breaks the mirror symmetry of gas kinematics between the top and bottom disk surfaces. Finally, by studying the kinematics at the emission surfaces, we discuss the implications of planets in realistic non-ideal MHD disks on kinematics observations.</description>

Abstract: Star formation estimates based on the counting of YSOs is commonly applied to nearby star-forming regions in the Galaxy. With this method, the SFRs are measured using the counts of YSOs in a particular protostellar Class, a typical protostellar mass, and the lifetime associated with this Class. However, the assumptions underlying the validity of the method such as that of a constant star formation history (SFH) and whether the method is valid for all protostellar Classes has never been fully tested. In this work, we use Monte Carlo models to test the validity of the method. We build synthetic clusters in which stars form at times that are randomly drawn from a specified SFH. The latter is either constant or time-dependent with a burst like behavior. The masses of the protostars are randomly drawn from an IMF which can be either similar to that of the Milky Way field or be variable . For each star in every cluster, the lifetimes associated with the different protostellar classes are also randomly drawn from Gaussian distribution functions centered around their most likely value as suggested by the observations. We find that only the SFR derived using the Class 0 population can reproduce the true SFR at all epochs, and this is true irrespective of the shape of the SFH. For a constant SFH, the SFR derived using the more evolved populations of protostars (Classes I, F, II, and III) reproduce the real SFR only at later epochs which correspond to epochs at which their numbers have reached a steady state. For a time-dependent burst-like SFH, all SFR estimates based on the number counts of the evolved populations fail to reproduce the true SFR. We also show how the offsets between Class I and Class II based SFRs and the true SFR plotted as a function of the number ratios of Class I and Class II versus Class III YSOs can be used in order to constrain the SFH of observed molecular clouds.</description>

      <title>3D ISM structure challenges the Serkowski relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10317</link>

Abstract: The Serkowski relation is the cornerstone of studies of starlight polarization as a function of wavelength. Although empirical, its extensive use since its inception to describe polarization induced by interstellar dust has elevated the relation to the status of an indisputable "law", serving as the benchmark for validating interstellar dust grain models. We revisit the effects of the 3D structure of the interstellar medium (ISM) on the wavelength dependence of interstellar polarization. We use analytical models to show how the wavelength dependence of both the polarization fraction and direction is affected by the presence of multiple clouds along the line of sight (LOS), accounting for recent developments in dust distribution modelling and utilizing an expanded archive of stellar polarization measurements. We highlight concrete examples of stars whose polarization profiles are severely affected by LOS variations of the dust grain and magnetic field properties, and we provide a recipe to accurately fit multiple cloud Serkowski models to such cases. We present, for the first time, compelling observational evidence that the 3D structure of the magnetized ISM often results to the violation of the Serkowski relation. We show that 3D effects impact interstellar cloud parameters derived from Serkowski fits. In particular, the dust size distribution in single - cloud sightlines may differ from analyses that ignore 3D effects, with important implications for dust modelling in the Galaxy. Our results suggest that multiband stellar polarization measurements offer an independent probe of the LOS variations of the magnetic field, constituting a valuable new tool for the 3D cartography of the ISM. We caution that, unless 3D effects are explicitly accounted for, a poor fit to the Serkowski relation does not, by itself, constitute conclusive evidence that a star is intrinsically polarized.</description>

      <title>The James Webb Space Telescope Absolute Flux Calibration. II. Mid-Infrared Instrument Imaging and Coronagraphy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10443v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The absolute flux calibration of the Mid-Infrared Instrument Imaging and Coronagraphy is based on observations of multiple stars taken during the first 2.5 years of JWST operations. The observations were designed to ensure that the flux calibration is valid for a range of flux densities, different subarrays, and different types of stars. The flux calibration was measured by combining observed aperture photometry corrected to infinite aperture with predictions based on previous observations and models of stellar atmospheres. A subset of these observations were combined with model point-spread-functions to measure the corrections to infinite aperture. Variations in the calibration factor with time, flux density, background level, type of star, subarray, integration time, rate, and well depth were investigated, and the only significant variations were with time and subarray. Observations of the same star taken approximately every month revealed a modest time-dependent response loss seen mainly at the longest wavelengths. This loss is well characterized by a decaying exponential with a time constant of ~200 days. After correcting for the response loss, the band-dependent scatter around the corrected average (aka repeatability) was found to range from 0.1 to 1.2%. Signals in observations taken with different subarrays can be lower by up to 3.4% compared to FULL frame. After correcting for the time and subarray dependencies, the scatter in the calibration factors measured for individual stars ranges from 1 to 4% depending on the band. The formal uncertainties on the flux calibration averaged for all observations are 0.3 to 1.0%, with longer-wavelength bands generally having larger uncertainties.</description>

      <title>An accurate solar axions ray-tracing response of BabyIAXO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: BabyIAXO is the intermediate stage of the International Axion Observatory (IAXO) to be hosted at DESY. Its primary goal is the detection of solar axions following the axion helioscope technique. Axions are converted into photons in a large magnet that is pointing to the sun. The resulting X-rays are focused by appropriate X-ray optics and detected by sensitive low-background detectors placed at the focal spot. The aim of this article is to provide an accurate quantitative description of the different components (such as the magnet, optics, and X-ray detectors) involved in the detection of axions. Our efforts have focused on developing robust and integrated software tools to model these helioscope components, enabling future assessments of modifications or upgrades to any part of the IAXO axion helioscope and evaluating the potential impact on the experiment's sensitivity. In this manuscript, we demonstrate the application of these tools by presenting a precise signal calculation and response analysis of BabyIAXO's sensitivity to the axion-photon coupling. Though focusing on the Primakoff solar flux component, our virtual helioscope model can be used to test different production mechanisms, allowing for direct comparisons within a unified framework.</description>
