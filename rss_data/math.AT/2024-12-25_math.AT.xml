      <title>Combinatorial Regularity for Relatively Perfect Discrete Morse Gradient Vector Fields of ReLU Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One common function class in machine learning is the class of ReLU neural networks. ReLU neural networks induce a piecewise linear decomposition of their input space called the canonical polyhedral complex. It has previously been established that it is decidable whether a ReLU neural network is piecewise linear Morse. In order to expand computational tools for analyzing the topological properties of ReLU neural networks, and to harness the strengths of discrete Morse theory, we introduce a schematic for translating between a given piecewise linear Morse function (e.g. parameters of a ReLU neural network) on a canonical polyhedral complex and a compatible (``relatively perfect") discrete Morse function on the same complex. Our approach is constructive, producing an algorithm that can be used to determine if a given vertex in a canonical polyhedral complex corresponds to a piecewise linear Morse critical point. Furthermore we provide an algorithm for constructing a consistent discrete Morse pairing on cells in the canonical polyhedral complex which contain this vertex. We additionally provide some new realizability results with respect to sublevel set topology in the case of shallow ReLU neural networks.</description>

      <title>A chain-level model for Chas-Sullivan products in Morse homology with differential graded coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the framework of Morse theory with differential graded coefficients to study certain operations on the total space of a fibration. More particularly, we focus in this paper on a chain-level description of the Chas-Sullivan product on the homology of the free loop space of an oriented, closed and connected manifold. The idea of ''intersecting on the base'' and ''concatenating on the fiber'' are well-adapted to this framework. We also give a Morse theoretical description of other products that follow the same principle. For this purpose, we develop functorial properties with respect to the coefficient in terms of morphisms of A $\infty$ -modules and morphisms of fibrations. We also build a differential graded version of the K{\"u}nneth formula and of the Pontryagin-Thom construction.</description>

      <title>Shoving tubes through shapes gives a sufficient and efficient shape statistic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Persistent Homology Transform (PHT) was introduced in the field of Topological Data Analysis about 10 years ago, and has since been proven to be a very powerful descriptor of Euclidean shapes. The PHT consists of scanning a shape from all possible directions $v\in S^{n-1}$ and then computing the persistent homology of sublevel set filtrations of the respective height functions $h_v$; this results in a sufficient and continuous descriptor of Euclidean shapes. We introduce a generalisation of the PHT in which we consider arbitrary parameter spaces and sublevel sets with respect to any function. In particular, we study transforms, defined on the Grassmannian $\mathbb{A}\mathbb{G}(m,n)$ of affine subspaces of $\mathbb{R}^n$, that allow to scan a shape by probing it with all possible affine $m$-dimensional subspaces $P\subset \mathbb{R}^n$, for fixed dimension $m$, and by computing persistent homology of sublevel set filtrations of the function $\mathrm{dist}(\cdot, P)$ encoding the distance from the flat $P$. We call such transforms "distance-from-flat" PHTs. We show that these transforms are injective and continuous and that they provide computational advantages over the classical PHT. In particular, we show that it is enough to compute homology only in degrees up to $m-1$ to obtain injectivity; for $m=1$ this provides a very powerful and computationally advantageous tool for examining shapes, which in a previous work by a subset of the authors has proven to significantly outperform state-of-the-art neural networks for shape classification tasks.</description>

      <title>On the cohomology of varieties of chord diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the space of codimension two subalgebras in $C^\infty(S^1, {\mathbb R})$ defined by pairs of conditions $f(\varphi)=f(\psi)$, $\varphi \neq \psi \in S^1$, or by their limits. We compute the mod 2 cohomology ring of this space, and also the Stiefel--Whitney classes of the tautological vector bundle on it.</description>

      <title>Cyclic $BV_\infty$ algebra and Frobenius manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe the construction of Frobenius manifold out of a cyclic (commutative) $BV_\infty$ algebra $(A,\Delta)$ under the assumption of a Hodge-to-de Rham degeneration property and the existence of a compatible homotopy retract of $A$ onto its cohomology. We then apply it to Jacobi manifolds and Hermitian manifolds, generalizing known results in literature.</description>

      <title>Robust Equilibria in Generic Extensive form Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the 2-player, generic extensive-form case of the conjecture of Govindan and Wilson (1997a,b) and Hauk and Hurkens (2002) stating that an equilibrium component is essential in every equivalent game if and only if the index of the component is nonzero. This provides an index-theoretic characterization of the concept of hyperstable components of equilibria in generic extensive-form games, first formulated by Kohlberg and Mertens (1986). We also illustrate how to compute hyperstable equilibria in multiple economically relevant examples and show how the predictions of hyperstability compare with other solution concepts.</description>

      <title>Subsampling, aligning, and averaging to find circular coordinates in recurrent time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new algorithm for finding robust circular coordinates on data that is expected to exhibit recurrence, such as that which appears in neuronal recordings of C. elegans. Techniques exist to create circular coordinates on a simplicial complex from a dimension 1 cohomology class, and these can be applied to the Rips complex of a dataset when it has a prominent class in its dimension 1 cohomology. However, it is known this approach is extremely sensitive to uneven sampling density.
  Our algorithm comes with a new method to correct for uneven sampling density, adapting our prior work on averaging coordinates in manifold learning. We use rejection sampling to correct for inhomogeneous sampling and then apply Procrustes matching to align and average the subsamples. In addition to providing a more robust coordinate than other approaches, this subsampling and averaging approach has better efficiency.
  We validate our technique on both synthetic data sets and neuronal activity recordings. Our results reveal a topological model of neuronal trajectories for C. elegans that is constructed from loops in which different regions of the brain state space can be mapped to specific and interpretable macroscopic behaviors in the worm.</description>
