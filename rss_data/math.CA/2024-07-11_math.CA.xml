      <title>On a planar Pierce--Yung operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the operator \begin{equation*}
  \mathcal{C} f(x,y) := \sup_{v\in \mathbb{R}} \Big|\mathrm{p.v.} \int_{\mathbb{R}} f(x-t, y-t^2) e^{i v t^3} \frac{\mathrm{d} t}{t} \Big| \end{equation*} is bounded on $L^p(\mathbb{R}^2)$ for every $1 &lt; p &lt; \infty$. This gives an affirmative answer to a question of Pierce and Yung.</description>

      <title>Stability Analysis of Cantilever-like Structures with Applications to Soft Robotic Arms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The application of variational structure for analyzing problems in the physical sciences is widespread. Cantilever-like problems, where one end is subjected to a fixed value and the other end is free, have been less studied, especially in terms of their stability despite their abundance. In this article, we develop the stability conditions for these problems by examining the second variation of the energy functional using the generalized Jacobi condition, which includes computing conjugate points. These conjugate points are determined by solving a set of initial value problems from the resulting linearized equilibrium equations. We apply these conditions to investigate the nonlinear stability of intrinsically curved elastic cantilevers subject to a tip load. Kirchhoff rod theory is employed to model the elastic rod deformations. The role of intrinsic curvature in inducing complex nonlinear phenomena, such as snap-back instability, is particularly emphasized. This snap-back instability is demonstrated using various examples, highlighting its dependence on various system parameters. The presented examples illustrate the potential applications in the design of flexible soft robotic arms and mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Finite Markov chains and multiple orthogonal polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00182v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates stochastic finite matrices and the corresponding finite Markov chains constructed using recurrence matrices for general families of orthogonal polynomials and multiple orthogonal polynomials. The paper explores the spectral theory of transition matrices, utilizing both orthogonal and multiple orthogonal polynomials. Several properties are derived, including classes, periodicity, recurrence, stationary states, ergodicity, expected recurrence times, time-reversed chains, and reversibility. Furthermore, the paper uncovers factorization in terms of pure birth and pure death processes. The case study focuses on hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials, where all the computations can be carried out effectively. Particularly within the Askey scheme, all descendants under Hahn (excluding Bessel), such as Hahn, Jacobi, Meixner, Kravchuk, Laguerre, Charlier, and Hermite, present interesting examples of recurrent reversible birth and death finite Markov chains. Additionally, the paper considers multiple orthogonal polynomials, including multiple Hahn, Jacobi-Pi\~neiro, Laguerre of the first kind, and Meixner of the second kind, along with their hypergeometric representations and derives the corresponding recurrent finite Markov chains and time-reversed chains.</description>

      <title>Existence, Uniqueness and Asymptotic Dynamics of Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equations With Quasi-Periodic Initial Data: I. The Standard NLS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19583v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is the first part of a two-paper series studying nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with quasi-periodic initial data. In this paper, we consider the standard nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. Under the assumption that the Fourier coefficients of the initial data obey a power-law upper bound, we establish local existence of a solution that retains quasi-periodicity in space with a slightly weaker Fourier decay. Moreover, the solution is shown to be unique within this class of quasi-periodic functions. In addition, for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with small nonlinearity, within the time scale, as the small parameter of nonlinearity tends to zero, we prove that the nonlinear solution converges asymptotically to the linear solution with respect to both the sup-norm $\|\cdot\|_{L_x^\infty(\mathbb R)}$ and the Sobolev-norm $\|\cdot\|_{H^s_x(\mathbb R)}$.
  The proof proceeds via a consideration of an associated infinite system of coupled ordinary differential equations for the Fourier coefficients and a combinatorial analysis of the resulting tree expansion of the coefficients. For this purpose, we introduce a Feynman diagram for the Picard iteration and $\ast^{[\cdot]}$ to denote the complex conjugate label.</description>

      <title>On simultaneous rationality of two Ahmes series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17593v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Paul Erd\H{o}s asked how rapidly a sequence of positive integers $(n_k)$ can grow if both series $\sum_k 1/n_k$ and $\sum_k 1/(n_k-1)$ have rational sums. In this note we show that there exists an exponentially growing sequence $(n_k)$ with this property. Previous records had polynomial growth, even for easier variants of the problem, regarding the series $\sum_k 1/n_k$ and $\sum_k 1/(n_k-d)$ for any concrete nonzero integer $d$. Moreover, using the same ideas we negatively answer another irrationality question, posed by Paul Erd\H{o}s and Ronald Graham. Namely, there exists a bounded sequence of positive integers $(b_k)$ such that $\sum_k 1/(2^k+b_k)$ is a rational number.</description>

      <title>Infinite quantum signal processing for arbitrary Szeg\H{o} functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05634v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a complete solution to the problem of infinite quantum signal processing for the class of Szeg\H{o} functions, which are functions that satisfy a logarithmic integrability condition and include almost any function that allows for a quantum signal processing representation. We do so by introducing a new algorithm called the Riemann-Hilbert-Weiss algorithm, which can compute any individual phase factor independent of all other phase factors. Our algorithm is also the first provably stable numerical algorithm for computing phase factors of any arbitrary Szeg\H{o} function. The proof of stability involves solving a Riemann-Hilbert factorization problem in nonlinear Fourier analysis using elements of spectral theory.</description>
