      <title>Drone Carry-on Weight and Wind Flow Assessment via Micro-Doppler Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Remote monitoring of drones has become a global objective due to emerging applications in national security and managing aerial delivery traffic. Despite their relatively small size, drones can carry significant payloads, which require monitoring, especially in cases of unauthorized transportation of dangerous goods. A drone's flight dynamics heavily depend on outdoor wind conditions and the carry-on weight, which affect the tilt angle of a drone's body and the rotation velocity of the blades. A surveillance radar can capture both effects, provided a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio for the received echoes and an adjusted postprocessing detection algorithm. Here, we conduct a systematic study to demonstrate that micro-Doppler analysis enables the disentanglement of the impacts of wind and weight on a hovering drone. The physics behind the effect is related to the flight controller, as the way the drone counteracts weight and wind differs. When the payload is balanced, it imposes an additional load symmetrically on all four rotors, causing them to rotate faster, thereby generating a blade-related micro-Doppler shift at a higher frequency. However, the impact of the wind is different. The wind attempts to displace the drone, and to counteract this, the drone tilts to the side. As a result, the forward and rear rotors rotate at different velocities to maintain the tilt angle of the drone body relative to the airflow direction. This causes the splitting in the micro-Doppler spectra. By performing a set of experiments in a controlled environment, specifically, an anechoic chamber for electromagnetic isolation and a wind tunnel for imposing deterministic wind conditions, we demonstrate that both wind and payload details can be extracted using a simple deterministic algorithm based on branching in the micro-Doppler spectra.</description>

      <title>Silica meta-optics: When high-performance does not need a high-index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metasurfaces -- planar arrays of subwavelength nanostructures -- are typically realized with high-index dielectrics, while low-index platforms are often dismissed for their weaker contrast. Here, we identify and experimentally verify regimes where a low-index platform (SiO$_2$) surpasses a high-index counterpart (TiO$_2$). We demonstrate that a low index suppresses higher-order Bloch modes, enabling the design of efficient devices with relaxed feature sizes. Low-index metasurfaces also offer two intrinsic advantages: a broad, well-behaved chromatic response without the need for explicit dispersion engineering, and strong tolerance to fabrication errors. We validate these features experimentally with silica metagratings, metalenses, and structured-light phase plates at $\lambda=632\ nm$. The metagratings reach $\geq$50% absolute diffraction efficiency over a $200\ nm$ bandwidth, the metalenses deliver 75% absolute diffraction efficiency with diffraction-limited performance, and the vortex phase plates achieve 80% conversion efficiency at the design wavelength and 60% with $100\ nm$ wavelength detuning. These results delineate conditions where low-index metasurfaces outperform high-index designs, suggesting a route to scalable, broadband, fabrication error-resilient flat optics.</description>

      <title>Laser Patterning of Superhydrophobic transparent glass surfaces with anti-fogging and anti-icing applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work addresses the fabrication of transparent glass surfaces with superior water-repellence (i.e., superhydrophobicity), and related functional properties such as omniphobicity, anti-fogging and anti-icing responses. Surfaces have been processed by means of mild femtosecond laser patterning combined with the grafting of fluorinated tethered molecules. Controlling the laser scan and ablation conditions permits the fabrication of under-design grooves with cross and lineal morphologies and separations between 10 and 500 um. These patterns provide a high transparency and repellence to liquids and ice over large areas. The best performance is obtained for cross or parallel line patterned glass with microgrooves separated by 100 um and 15 um depth thanks to 5 laser scanning repetitions. These surfaces present a stable Cassie-Baxter wetting state and very low ice-adhesion strength while keeping up to 80 % of optical transmittance in the visible region. Anti-fouling tests, along with freezing and thawing cycles on these surfaces, have demonstrated a remarkable and durable self-cleaning response, even under environmentally stressful conditions. Water condensation experiments conducted under atmospheric conditions, as well as in an environmental electron scanning microscope, have revealed important issues related to the formation of supercooled water droplets. These experiments show that the patterned breakdown of surface properties effectively prevents extensive fogging and water accumulation. This feature is particularly crucial for outdoors and low temperature applications where the preservation of transparency is essential.</description>

      <title>Adapting Noise-Driven PUF and AI for Secure WBG ICS: A Proof-of-Concept Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wide-bandgap (WBG) technologies offer unprecedented improvements in power system efficiency, size, and performance, but also introduce unique sensor corruption and cybersecurity risks in industrial control systems (ICS), particularly due to high-frequency noise and sophisticated cyber-physical threats. This proof-of-concept (PoC) study demonstrates the adaptation of a noise-driven physically unclonable function (PUF) and machine learning (ML)-assisted anomaly detection framework to the demanding environment of WBG-based ICS sensor pathways. By extracting entropy from unavoidable WBG switching noise (up to 100 kHz) as a PUF source, and simultaneously using this noise as a real-time threat indicator, the proposed system unites hardware-level authentication and anomaly detection. Our approach integrates hybrid machine learning (ML) models with adaptive Bayesian filtering, providing robust and low-latency detection capabilities resilient to both natural electromagnetic interference (EMI) and active adversarial manipulation. Through detailed simulations of WBG modules under benign and attack scenarios--including EMI injection, signal tampering, and node impersonation--we achieve 95% detection accuracy and sub-millisecond processing latency. These results demonstrate the feasibility of physics-driven, dual-use noise exploitation as a scalable ICS defense primitive. Our findings lay the groundwork for next-generation security strategies that leverage inherent device characteristics, bridging hardware and artificial intelligence (AI) for enhanced protection of critical ICS infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Electric Field-Induced Kerr Rotation on Metallic Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use a combination of density functional theory calculations and optical modeling to establish that the electric field-induced Kerr rotation in metallic thin films has contributions from both non-equilibrium orbital moment accumulation (arising from the orbital Edelstein effect) and a heretofore overlooked surface Pockels effect. The Kerr rotation associated with orbital accumulation has been studied in previous works and is largely due to the dc electric field-induced change of the electron distribution function. In contrast, the surface Pockels effect is largely due to the dc field-induced change to the wave functions. Both of these contributions arise from the dual mirror symmetry breaking from the surface and from the dc applied field. Our calculations show that the resulting Kerr rotation is due to the dc electric field modification of the optical conductivity within a couple of nanometers from the surface, consistent with the dependence on the local mirror symmetry breaking at the surface. For thin films of Pt, our calculations show that the relative contributions of the orbital Edelstein and surface Pockels effects are comparable, and that they have different effects on Kerr rotation of $s$ and $p$ polarized light, $\theta_K^s$ and $\theta_K^p$. The orbital Edelstein effect yields similar values of $\theta_K^s$ and $\theta_K^p$, while the surface Pockels effect leads to opposing values of $\theta_K^s$ and $\theta_K^p$.</description>

      <title>Automated control strategy for setting and stabilization of photonic circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose the Wheatstone bridge configuration for enabling real-time and closed-loop stabilization and calibration of photonic devices integrated on chip. The measurement of the optical power propagating in a waveguide is achieved by leveraging the photo-thermal resistance variation of one of the resistors that comprise a bridge, which is either part of the waveguide or in close contact with the waveguide. The voltage generated by a monitor is applied through a processing unit to preceding actuators with a view to locking a system at the desired signal level. As all the "resistors" consisting of the Wheatstone bridge are placed on a single material platform in proximity to each other, the bridge is insensitive to temperature variations. Consequently, it functions exclusively as a monitor for the optical power propagating in a waveguide. Due to the high sensitivity of the monitor, automatic re-tuning of the Mach-Zehnder interferometer can be achieved with a recovery time defined by the material properties of the bridge "resistor". The material platform and arrangement can be implemented for both monitoring and activating the actuators, which makes the proposed system an attractive candidate for closed-loop control of optical devices. Furthermore, in contradistinction to the majority of monitors and photodetectors, which provide electrical current as an outcome of measuring an optical signal, the proposed circuit provides voltage, thereby eradicating the necessity to convert current to voltage at a later stage. This serves to firstly streamline the entire circuit and secondly contribute to a substantial diminution in the noise level in the circuit.</description>

      <title>Modelling Fluid--Structure Interaction in an Initially Elliptical Elastic-Walled tube: Improved Onset Criterion for Self-Excited Oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical description of the fluid--structure interaction observed within a Starling resistor. The typical setup consists of a pre-stretched finite length thin-walled elastic tube mounted between two rigid tubes. The collapsible section is enclosed within a pressure chamber and a viscous fluid is driven through the system by imposing an axial volume flux at the downstream end. Valid within a long-wavelength thin-walled regime, we use our own results to model the wall mechanics. These results arise from the solution of a generalised eigenvalue problem, and avoid the need to invoke the ad-hoc approximations made in previous studies. The wall mechanics are then coupled to the fluid mechanics using the Navier--Stokes equations, under the assumption that the oscillations in the tube wall are of small amplitude, long wavelength and high frequency. We derive problems governing the leading-order steady and oscillatory fluid-structure interaction. At leading order, the system permits normal-mode oscillations of constant frequency and amplitude, which are obtained in the form of series solutions. Higher-order corrections govern the slow growth or decay of the oscillations, however (as in previous work) these growth rates can be determined by analysing the system's global energy budget without needing to compute the higher-order terms explicitly. Our results permit the first formal analysis of the errors incurred by neglecting contributions from higher-order azimuthal modes, and enable the determination of improved criterion for the onset of self-excited oscillations in the tube wall.</description>

      <title>All-Altermagnetic Tunnel Junction of RuO2/NiF2/RuO2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23269v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emerging altermagnets offer a promising avenue for spintronics, yet their integration into magnetic tunnel junctions has been hindered by reliance on ferromagnetic electrodes (introducing stray fields) or limited functionality (non-tunable magnetoresistance without spin filtering). Here, we propose an all-altermagnetic tunnel junction (AAMTJ) paradigm composed exclusively of altermagnets-exemplified by experiment-feasible RuO2/NiF2/RuO2. Giant tunneling magnetoresistance of 11704%, and high spin-filtering of ~90% in both spin channels are achieved. This architecture unlocks tunable multistate magnetoresistance and spin filtering via magnetization control of electrode and barrier, stemming from their synergistic and antagonistic alignments of momentum-dependent altermagnetic spin-splitting. Our AAMTJ inherently exhibits low consumption and no stray field, with nonrelativistic spin splitting and zero magnetic moment, combining advantages of both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic tunnel junctions. This AAMTJ paradigm provides a realistically versatile platform to develop revolutionarily potential of altermagnets for reconfigurable magnetic memory devices.</description>

      <title>External quantum efficiency above 100% in photovoltaic cells due to the technique raising efficiencies for all kinds of solar cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A V-shaped module (VSM) photovoltaic technique, which breaks traditional concepts, has been proven by European and American scientists to enable power-conversion-efficiency to increase by 50% for thin-film solar cells. Furthermore, the VSM technique raises power-conversion-efficiency for all kinds of solar cells (J. Environ. Sci. Eng. A 12, 214 (2023). https://doi.org/10.17265/2162-5298/2023.06.002). Mysterious dark energy is thought to result in the surprising VSM effect. The VSM approach opens up new avenues to study photovoltaic physics. In this study, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of commercial polycrystalline silicon solar cells in the VSM was investigated, which exhibits a surprising phenomenon of EQE above 100%. In theory, non-infrared light incident into a solar cell can cause infrared emission. The VSM could trap the emitted infrared photons and lead to extra photoexcited carriers. The easy-to-reproduce VSM effect is thus explainable. The energy of emitted infrared photons is considered as the so-called dark energy. This study provides new clues and evidences to unravel the mystery of the surprising VSM effect. The VSM technique could also be used to develop photodetectors for infrared and ultraviolet light respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03378v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nanophotonics enables unprecedented control over light-matter interactions, yet conventional isotropic materials limit the spectral range and richness of mode responses in subwavelength structures. Anisotropic subwavelength particles -- ubiquitous in natural and engineered systems -- offer new degrees of freedom that couple geometry and material properties, unlocking previously inaccessible spectral regions. Here, we establish a universal quasistatic framework describing the eigenmodes and resonance conditions of uniaxial and biaxial nanoparticles. Closed-form solutions reveal axial-permittivity sum rules and a fundamental material-anisotropy-induced symmetry breaking, manifesting as resonance splitting and novel radiation patterns. Generalizing the theory to ellipsoids provides geometric tunability of the multispectral response, while analytic predictions of quality factors elucidate how anisotropy governs mode localization and energy loss. Full-wave simulations of h-BN and $\alpha$-MoO$_3$ nanoparticles confirm the theory and highlight its predictive power. This framework unifies the understanding of anisotropic nanostructures across optics, thermal transport, and magnetism, opening pathways to a new generation of photonic devices with tunable multispectral response and controlled emission patterns, including directional detectors and spectrally selective mid infrared sensors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.14257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electrical control of light in integrated photonics is central to a wide range of research and applications. It is conventionally achieved with thermo-optic tuning, but this suffers from high energy consumption and crosstalk. Nanoelectromechanical photonics could resolve these issues, but integrating this technology with conventional multilayer metal architectures is challenging, and conventional approaches do not allow crossings of electrical wires and photonic waveguides. Here, we use topology optimization to devise a single-layer electronic-photonic circuit crossing with up to 99.8 % optical transmission across a 20 nm electrical isolation trench. We focus our experiments on 100 nm trenches and measure an average transmission of 92.9 % over a 100 nm bandwidth, in excellent agreement with theory. We use these concepts to demonstrate a monolithic silicon nanoelectromechanical add-drop switch in which the flow of photons, electrons, and mechanical motions are fully integrated within the same layer. Our work addresses an important challenge in incorporating opto-electro-mechanical topologies into photonic integrated circuits and may lead to new functionalities in nano-opto-electro-mechanical systems, optomechanics, and integrated quantum photonics.</description>

      <title>$\Delta_T$ Noise in Mesoscopic Hybrid Junctions: Influence of Barrier Strength and Thermal Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10990v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum noise is a fundamental probe of quantum transport phenomena, offering insights into current correlations and wave-particle duality. A particularly intriguing form of such noise, $\Delta_T$ noise, emerges under a finite temperature difference in the absence of charge current at zero voltage bias. In this work, we investigate $\Delta_T$ noise in mesoscopic hybrid junctions incorporating insulating barriers, where the average charge current remains zero at zero bias. Using quantum shot noise measurements, we demonstrate that $\Delta_T$ noise in metal-insulator-superconductor (NIS) junctions is approximately $16$ times greater than in metal-insulator-metal (NIN) counterparts. Our analysis further reveals that $\Delta_T$ noise exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on barrier strength, rising to a peak before declining, while increasing monotonically with the applied temperature bias. These findings underscore the rich interplay between thermal gradients and barrier properties in determining quantum noise characteristics in hybrid mesoscopic systems.</description>

      <title>Memristive Nanowire Network for Energy Efficient Audio Classification: Pre-Processing-Free Reservoir Computing with Reduced Latency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19611</link>

Abstract: Efficient audio feature extraction is critical for low-latency, resource-constrained speech recognition. Conventional preprocessing techniques, such as Mel Spectrogram, Perceptual Linear Prediction (PLP), and Learnable Spectrogram, achieve high classification accuracy but require large feature sets and significant computation. The low-latency and power efficiency benefits of neuromorphic computing offer a strong potential for audio classification. Here, we introduce memristive nanowire networks as a neuromorphic hardware preprocessing layer for spoken-digit classification, a capability not previously demonstrated. Nanowire networks extract compact, informative features directly from raw audio, achieving a favorable trade-off between accuracy, dimensionality reduction from the original audio size (data compression) , and training time efficiency. Compared with state-of-the-art software techniques, nanowire features reach 98.95% accuracy with 66 times data compression (XGBoost) and 97.9% accuracy with 255 times compression (Random Forest) in sub-second training latency. Across multiple classifiers nanowire features consistently achieve more than 90% accuracy with more than 62.5 times compression, outperforming features extracted by conventional state-of-the-art techniques such as MFCC in efficiency without loss of performance. Moreover, nanowire features achieve 96.5% accuracy classifying multispeaker audios, outperforming all state-of-the-art feature accuracies while achieving the highest data compression and lowest training time. Nanowire network preprocessing also enhances linear separability of audio data, improving simple classifier performance and generalizing across speakers. These results demonstrate that memristive nanowire networks provide a novel, low-latency, and data-efficient feature extraction approach, enabling high-performance neuromorphic audio classification.</description>

      <title>Temperature Dependent Mechanical and Structural Properties of Uniaxially Strained Planar Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14709v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using molecular dynamics simulations in a planar graphene sheet, we investigate the temperature dependence of its mechanical behavior under uniaxial tensile stress applied either along the armchair or the zigzag direction. Stress-strain curves are calculated for different temperatures and the corresponding dependence of various elastic parameters, is discussed. Fracture stress and strain, as well as the Young modulus, decrease almost linearly with temperature, in accordance with previous investigations. An almost linear variation of the third-order elastic modulus with temperature is demonstrated, revealing opposite trends for uniaxial loadings along the armchair or the zigzag direction. The detailed dependence of the distributions of bond lengths and bond angles both on strain and temperature is presented for the first time, along with approximate analytical expressions. The latter describe accurately the numerically obtained distributions.</description>

      <title>Demonstration and Non-volatile Trimming of a Highly-Parallel, High-Capacity Silicon Microdisk Transmitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical interconnects are the most promising solution to address the data-movement bottleneck in data centers. Silicon microdisks, benefiting from their compact footprint, low energy consumption, and wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) capability, have emerged as an attractive and scalable platform for optical modulation. However, microdisk resonators inherently exhibit low fabrication error tolerance, limiting their practical deployment. Here, utilizing a CMOS photonics platform, we demonstrate 1.2 Tb/s of off-die bandwidth through a 64 microdisk modulator system. In addition, we develop an automated, close-looped, non-reversible, low-loss, and picometer-precision permanent wavelength tuning technique using laser trimming. The trimming technique reduces 33 % of the energy consumption needed to thermally tune the microdisk resonant wavelength. Using this technique, we achieve a fully passive, 5-channel dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM, 50 GHz spacing) transmitter. The integration of the high speed (1.2 Tb/s), low energy consumption (29 fJ/bit) and the permanent wavelength trimming lays a robust foundation for next-generation optical interconnect systems, poised to facilitate scaling of future AI and computing hardware.</description>

      <title>FDTRImageEnhancer: Combining Physics-Informed Deconvolution and Microstructure-Aware Deep Learning to Enhance Thermal Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16590v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present FDTRImageEnhancer, an open-source computational framework that improves thermal conductivity mapping from Frequency Domain ThermoReflectance (FDTR) phase data by integrating a physics-based Gaussian convolution abstraction with microstructure-aware deep learning. The Gaussian kernel models the spatial averaging effects of pump and probe beams, while k-means clustering of high-resolution structural images reduces the parameter space for inverse modeling. A physics-informed neural network jointly minimizes phase-data error and deviation from analytically recovered conductivity maps, enabling the detection of grain boundary thermal conductivity drops visually obscured in conventional FDTR inversions. Demonstrated on finite element-generated synthetic data, the framework recovers bulk values within less than 0.5% error and qualitatively resolves grain boundary effects despite limited image resolution. Full Python code and datasets are provided for reproducibility, with the methodology readily adaptable to other inverse thermal transport problems.</description>
