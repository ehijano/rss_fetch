      <title>Bacteria exploit torque-induced buckling instability for flagellar wrapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in microscopy techniques has uncovered unique aspects of flagella-driven motility in bacteria. A remarkable example is the discovery of flagellar wrapping, a phenomenon whereby a bacterium wraps its flagellum (or flagellar bundle) around its cell body and propels itself like a corkscrew, enabling locomotion in highly viscous or confined environments. For certain bacterial species, this flagellar-wrapping mode is crucial for establishing selective symbiotic relationships with their hosts. The transformation of a flagellum from an extended to a folded (wrapped) state is triggered by a buckling instability driven by the motor-generated torque that unwinds the helical filament. This study investigated this biologically inspired, novel buckling mechanism through a combination of macroscale physical experiments, numerical simulations, and scaling theory to reveal its underlying physical principles. Excellent quantitative agreement between experiments and numerical results showed that long-range hydrodynamic interactions (HIs) are essential for accurate quantitative descriptions of the geometrically nonlinear deformation of the helical filament during wrapping. By systematically analyzing extensive experimental and numerical data, we constructed a stability diagram that rationalized the stability boundary through an elastohydrodynamic scaling analysis. Leveraging the scaling nature of this study, we compared our physical results with available biological data and demonstrated that bacteria exploit motor-induced buckling instability to initiate their flagellar wrapping. Our findings indicate that this mechanically-driven process is essential to bacterial-wrapping motility and consequently, plays a critical role in symbiosis and infection.</description>

      <title>Wave characteristics and anisotropic homogenization theory of soft matters layered structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate in this work the wave characteristics and homogenization theory of soft matter layered structure in the limit of low-frequency P-wave. Using the method of potentials, we derive closed-form dispersion relationship and identify three distinct modes of the soft matter layered structure: quasistatic mode, resonance mode, and slip mode. These modes differ based on their equivalent interface conditions: a continuous interface for quasistatic mode, a spring-like interface for resonance mode, and a slip like interface for slip mode. Additionally, we propose a simplified model capturing P-wave wave characteristics in the S-wave high-frequency regime. Our findings unify wave-structure relationships across solid, liquid, and soft matter composites, offering a predictive framework for engineering metamaterials with programmable wave responses. This study offers new insight on the fundamental understanding of layered media and providing direct design principles for applications in acoustic cloaking, vibration damping, and biomedical imaging.</description>

      <title>Partial-Wetting Phenomena in Active Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Abundant interfacial phenomena in nature, such as water droplets on lotus leaves and water transport in plant vessels, originate from partial-wetting phenomena, which can be well described by Young's equation. It remains an intriguing question whether similar behaviors exist in active matter. In this letter, we present a clear demonstration of the partial-wetting phenomenon in a ternary laning system, which is a typical active system. A phase diagram is constructed in which the relative drift velocities of different components govern the transitions among drying, partial wetting, and complete wetting states. The mechanical balance on the contact lines of the partial-wetting phase described by Young's equation is verified. A theoretical picture is proposed to explain the analogy of partial wetting in the laning system to that in the equilibrium system.</description>

      <title>Fickian Yet non-Gaussian Diffusion in Complex Molecular Fluids via a non-local diffusion framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fickian yet non-Gaussian diffusion (FnGD) has gained popularity in the recent times owing to it's ubiquity in a variety of complex fluids. However, whether FnGD can be observed experimentally in molecular fuids is still obscure with very little study in real systems. In this letter, we show existence of FnGD in molecular fluids based on compelling evidence from incoherent quasielastic neutron scattering (IQENS). Using a cage-jump diffsion model, we show that while the approach to Fickianity is exponentially fast, the Gaussianity is restored at a much slower algebraic rate. We propose a non-local diffusion (NLD) model to describe a d-dimensional jump-diffusion in FnGD regime and show their universal applicability in such systems. This study establishes that cage-jump diffusion process inevitably lead to FnGD and provides the framework of NLD models to explore such diffusion phenomena in any arbitrary dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we show how a network inspired by a coarse-grained description of actomyosin cytoskeleton can learn - in a contrastive learning framework - from environmental perturbations if it is endowed with mechanosensitive proteins and motors. Our work is a proof of principle for how force-sensitive proteins and molecular motors can form the basis of a general strategy to learn in biological systems. Our work identifies a minimal biologically plausible learning mechanism and also explores its implications for commonly occuring phenomenolgy such as adaptation and homeostatis.</description>

      <title>Swap Monte Carlo for diatomic molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years the Swap Monte Carlo algorithm has led to remarkable progress in equilibrating supercooled model liquids at low temperatures. Applications have so far been limited to systems composed of spherical particles, however, whereas most real-world supercooled liquids are molecular. We here introduce a simple size-polydisperse molecular model that allows for efficient thermal equilibration \textit{in silico} with the Swap Monte Carlo method, resulting in an estimated speedup of $10^3-10^6$ at moderate polydispersity (5-10 %). Despite being polydisperse, the model exhibits little difference between the size-resolved orientational time-autocorrelation functions. Our results demonstrate the possibility of designing molecular models that can be simulated close to the calorimetric glass transition.</description>

      <title>Multifractional Brownian motion with telegraphic, stochastically varying exponent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The diversity of diffusive systems exhibiting long-range correlations characterized by a stochastically varying Hurst exponent calls for a generic multifractional model. We present a simple, analytically tractable model which fills the gap between mathematical formulations of multifractional Brownian motion and empirical studies. In our model, called telegraphic multifractional Brownian motion, the Hurst exponent is modelled by a smoothed telegraph process which results in a stationary beta distribution of exponents as observed in biological experiments. We also provide a methodology to identify our model in experimental data and present concrete examples from biology, climate and finance to demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.</description>

      <title>Path sampling challenges in large biomolecular systems: RETIS and REPPTIS for ABL-imatinib kinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting the kinetics of drug-protein interactions is crucial for understanding drug efficacy, particularly in personalized medicine, where protein mutations can significantly alter drug residence times. This study applies Replica Exchange Transition Interface Sampling (RETIS) and its Partial Path variant (REPPTIS) to investigate the dissociation kinetics of imatinib from Abelson nonreceptor tyrosine kinase (ABL) and mutants relevant to chronic myeloid leukemia therapy. These path-sampling methods offer a bias-free alternative to conventional approaches requiring qualitative predefined reaction coordinates. Nevertheless, the complex free-energy landscape of ABL-imatinib dissociation presents significant challenges. Multiple metastable states and orthogonal barriers lead to parallel unbinding pathways, complicating convergence in TIS-based methods. Despite employing computational efficiency strategies such as asynchronous replica exchange, full convergence remained elusive. This work provides a critical assessment of path sampling in high-dimensional biological systems, discussing the need for enhanced initialization strategies, advanced Monte Carlo path generation moves, and machine learning-derived reaction coordinates to improve kinetic predictions of drug dissociation with minimal prior knowledge.</description>

      <title>Ordering and association of patchy particles in narrow channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the formalism of Wertheim's first order thermodynamic perturbation theory can be generalised for the fluid of anisotropic sticky particles confined to a quasi-one-dimensional channel. Using the transfer matrix method, we prove that the theory is exact if the hard body interaction is additive, only the first neighbors interact and the particles can stick together only along the channel. We show that the most convenient treatment of association in narrow channels is to work in NPT ensemble, where all structural and thermodynamic quantities can be expressed as a function of pressure and fraction of sites unbonded.</description>

      <title>Bubble-assisted micromixing via thermally excited intrinsic air within microfluidic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The micromixing process in microfluidic devices is of central importance in quite a few applications, with microfluidic studies on carbon capture and environmental monitoring being two examples. High surface area to volume ratio in microscale flows outweighs the role of interfacial tension manipulation by means of introducing a secondary phase to the main flow in order to augment the typically diffusion-dominant mass transfer operation. In this paper, we introduce an easily integrable continuous flow micromixing scheme implemented on a simple Y-type microchannel based on thermally excited intrinsic air within microchannel. Thanks to the direct contact between the sputtered thin platinum microheater and the co-flowing streams, trapped air in the liquid and/or tiny crevices is employed to generate elongated bubbles with a millisecond lifespan, consuming less than 0.4 W of power and thereby enabling homogeneous mixing. The performance of the micromixer is characterized in terms of the mixing index (MI), and it is shown that immediately ahead of the microheater, the MI exceeds 95% for side-by-side flowing of water at different overall flowrates, namely 4, 10, and 20 uL/min. Interpreting the experimental results, supplemented by scaling arguments, we quantitatively describe the ephemeral role of emerging elongated bubbles in the micromixing process in which the Marangoni as well as Weber numbers are recognized as the characteristic local non-dimensional groups while the enhancing role of tiny daughter microbubbles on the micromixing downstream of the microchannel can be reflected in the Peclet and the Capillary numbers.</description>

      <title>Tracer dynamics in an interacting active bath: fluctuations and energy partition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of a massive tracer particle coupled to an interacting active bath, modeled as a harmonic chain of overdamped active particles analytically, with an aim to understand the impact of bath interactions and activity on the nonequilibrium fluctuations of the tracer. From the microscopic equations, we derive the tracer particle's effective Langevin equation, obtaining the dissipative and stochastic forces from the bath. We analyze the friction kernel, revealing power-law tails in the weak coupling limit and exponential decay in the strong coupling regime. Due to the interplay between bath interactions, probe-bath coupling, and activity, the mean squared displacement, velocity, and stationary velocity correlations exhibit different dynamical regimes, which we characterize analytically. Under harmonic confinement, we find that energy equipartition holds at low activity but breaks down at higher activity, with the kinetic energy exhibiting a non-monotonic dependence on the activity of the bath.</description>

      <title>Parsimonious inertial cavitation rheometry via bubble collapse time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.04227v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid and accurate characterization of soft, viscoelastic materials at high strain rates is of interest in biological and engineering applications. Examples include assessing the extent of tissue ablation during histotripsy procedures and developing injury criteria for the mitigation of blast injuries. The inertial microcavitation rheometry technique (IMR, Estrada et al., 2018) allows for the characterization of local viscoelastic properties at strain rates up to 1E8 per second. However, IMR now typically relies on bright-field videography of a sufficiently translucent sample at &gt;1 million frames per second and a simulation-dependent fit optimization process that can require hours of post-processing. Here, we present an improved IMR-style technique, called parsimonious inertial microcavitation rheometry (pIMR), that parsimoniously characterizes surrounding viscoelastic materials. The pIMR approach uses experimental advancements to estimate the time to first collapse of the laser-induced cavity within approximately 20 ns and a theoretical energy balance analysis that yields an approximate collapse time based on the material viscoelasticity parameters. The pIMR method closely matches the accuracy of the original IMR procedure while decreasing the computational cost from hours to seconds while potentially reducing reliance on ultra-high-speed videography. This technique can enable nearly real-time characterization of soft, viscoelastic hydrogels and biological materials with a numerical criterion assessing the correct choice of model. We illustrate the efficacy of the technique on batches of tens of experiments for both soft hydrogels and fluids.</description>

      <title>Effective single particle theory for active particles using local density fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02247v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterize the dynamic non-equilibrium steady state behavior of active particles using density fluctuations in the system. We analyze the effective local density around a particle in the steady state and numerically calculate its mean, variance and autocorrelation. Thus, using local density and its statistical properties as a temporally correlated stochastic variable, we develop an effective single-particle theoretical model and analytically derive an expression for the particle's diffusivity as a function of the global packing density in the system. Our theory accurately predicts the transport properties of an active particle, validated against numerical simulations. Unlike mean-field theory, which fails at high packing densities due to significant density fluctuations from dynamic cluster formation, our model remains effective across all densities. It also captures the well-known phase transition beyond a critical packing density. The key novelty of our model lies in the introduction of a stochastic local density field, which encapsulates the effect of steric interactions on an active particle and helps predict single-particle behavior in a collection, a feature often absent in standard active matter models. This approach could be useful in experimental setups where fluctuations in local density around a tagged particle are measurable.</description>

      <title>Quantum Delocalization Enables Water Dissociation on Ru(0001)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00484v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the long-standing question of whether water molecules dissociate on the Ru(0001) surface through nanosecond-scale path-integral molecular dynamics simulations on a sizable supercell. This is made possible through the development of an efficient and reliable machine-learning potential with near first-principles accuracy, overcoming the limitations of previous ab initio studies. We show that the quantum delocalization associated with nuclear quantum effects enables rapid and frequent proton transfers between water molecules, thereby facilitating the water dissociation on Ru(0001). This work provides the direct theoretical evidence of water dissociation on Ru(0001), resolving the enduring issue in surface sciences and offering crucial atomistic insights into water-metal interfaces.</description>
