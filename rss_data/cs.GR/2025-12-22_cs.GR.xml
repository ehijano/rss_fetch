      <description>arXiv:2512.17440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe four special families of ellipse-inscribed Poncelet triangles about the incircle which maintain certain triangle centers stationary and which also display interesting conservations.</description>

      <title>LiteGE: Lightweight Geodesic Embedding for Efficient Geodesics Computation and Non-Isometric Shape Correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computing geodesic distances on 3D surfaces is fundamental to many tasks in 3D vision and geometry processing, with deep connections to tasks such as shape correspondence. Recent learning-based methods achieve strong performance but rely on large 3D backbones, leading to high memory usage and latency, which limit their use in interactive or resource-constrained settings. We introduce LiteGE, a lightweight approach that constructs compact, category-aware shape descriptors by applying PCA to unsigned distance field (UDFs) samples at informative voxels. This descriptor is efficient to compute and removes the need for high-capacity networks. LiteGE remains robust on sparse point clouds, supporting inputs with as few as 300 points, where prior methods fail. Extensive experiments show that LiteGE reduces memory usage and inference time by up to 300$\times$ compared to existing neural approaches. In addition, by exploiting the intrinsic relationship between geodesic distance and shape correspondence, LiteGE enables fast and accurate shape matching. Our method achieves up to 1000$\times$ speedup over state-of-the-art mesh-based approaches while maintaining comparable accuracy on non-isometric shape pairs, including evaluations on point-cloud inputs.</description>

      <title>HOLODECK 2.0: Vision-Language-Guided 3D World Generation with Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05899v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 3D scene generation plays a crucial role in gaming, artistic creation, virtual reality, and many other domains. However, current 3D scene design still relies heavily on extensive manual effort from creators, and existing automated methods struggle to generate open-domain scenes or support flexible editing. To address those challenges, we introduce HOLODECK 2.0, an advanced vision-language-guided framework for 3D world generation with support for interactive scene editing based on human feedback. HOLODECK 2.0 can generate diverse and stylistically rich 3D scenes (e.g., realistic, cartoon, anime, and cyberpunk styles) that exhibit high semantic fidelity to fine-grained input descriptions, suitable for both indoor and open-domain environments. HOLODECK 2.0 leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to identify and parse the objects required in a scene and generates corresponding high-quality assets via state-of-the-art 3D generative models. Then, HOLODECK 2.0 iteratively applies spatial constraints derived from the VLMs to achieve semantically coherent and physically plausible layouts. Both human and model evaluations demonstrate that HOLODECK 2.0 effectively generates high-quality scenes closely aligned with detailed textual descriptions, consistently outperforming baselines across indoor and open-domain scenarios. Additionally, HOLODECK 2.0 provides editing capabilities that flexibly adapt to human feedback, supporting layout refinement and style-consistent object edits. Finally, we present a practical application of HOLODECK 2.0 in procedural game modeling to generate visually rich and immersive environments that can boost efficiency in game design.</description>
