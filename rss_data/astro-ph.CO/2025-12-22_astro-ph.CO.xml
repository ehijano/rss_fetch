      <title>Reviving sub-keV warm dark matter: a UVLF-based analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal warm dark matter (WDM) particles with $m_{\rm WDM} \leq 1~\mathrm{keV}$ are ruled out at more than $4\sigma$ by multiple observational probes, owing to the strong suppression of small-scale structure induced by early-time free-streaming. Recently, it was highlighted that a small admixture of $\sim1\%$ ($f_{\rm CDM} \sim\!0.01$) cold dark matter (CDM) endowed with a blue-tilted isocurvature spectrum could offset the WDM-induced suppression and relax the WDM mass bound by a factor of $\mathcal{O}(10)$. If viable, this ''warm + cold-isocurvature'' scenario would allow sub-keV WDM particles to constitute nearly the full dark matter abundance while potentially alleviating some small-scale tensions. In this work, we test this mechanism by constraining the WDM mass $m_{\rm WDM}$ while marginalizing over CDM isocurvature parameters. We combine ultraviolet luminosity function measurements from the \textit{Hubble Space Telescope} and \textit{James Webb Space Telescope} over redshift $4 \leq z \leq 11$ with CMB, BAO, and SNe data. For a pure WDM model, our joint analysis yields a lower bound $m_{\rm WDM} &gt; 1.8~\mathrm{keV}$ (95% credible intervals). When CDM isocurvature is introduced at $f_{\rm CDM} = 0.01$, the limit relaxes to $m_{\rm WDM} &gt; 0.27~\mathrm{keV}$ (95% credible intervals), reflecting a shallow degeneracy in which blue-tilted isocurvature fluctuations partially compensate for WDM suppression. These results provide new constraints on thermal WDM in the presence of CDM isocurvature fluctuations and quantify the extent to which such fluctuations can mask the small-scale signatures of light relics.</description>

      <title>The imprints of massive neutrinos on the 3-point correlation function of large-scale structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Free-streaming of cosmic neutrinos impacts the distribution and growth of cosmic structures on small scales, allowing constraints on the sum of neutrino masses $M_\nu$ from clustering studies. In this work, we investigate for the first time the possibility of disentangling massive neutrino cosmologies with the 3-point correlation function (3PCF). We measure the isotropic connected 3PCF $\zeta$ and the reduced 3PCF $Q$ of halo catalogues from the Quijote suite of N-body simulations, considering $M_\nu =0.0, 0.1, 0.2,$ and $0.4 \, \mathrm{eV}$ in different redshift bins. We develop a framework to quantify the detectability of massive neutrinos for different triangle configurations and shapes, and apply it to a case compatible with a Stage-IV spectroscopic survey. We also compare our results with the analysis of simulations without neutrinos, but with different $\sigma_8$ values, to test whether the 3PCF can break the well-known degeneracy between the two parameters. We find that, as a result of free-streaming, the largest signal is found for quasi-isosceles and squeezed triangles; this signal is increasing for decreasing redshifts. Among these configurations, elongated triangles, tracing the filamentary structure of the cosmic web, are the most affected by the impact of massive neutrinos, with a 3PCF signal increasing with $M_\nu$. A complementary source of signal comes from right-angled triangles in $Q$. Importantly, we find that the signatures of a $\sigma_8$ variation appear significantly different on elongated triangles in $\zeta$ and right-angled triangles in $Q$, suggesting that the 3PCF can be used to effectively break the $M_\nu - \sigma_8$ degeneracy. These results open the possibility to use the 3PCF as a powerful complementary tool to constrain neutrino masses in current and future spectroscopic surveys like DESI, Euclid, 4MOST, and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope.</description>

      <title>The contribution from small scales on two-point shear analysis: comparison between power spectrum and correlation function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17022v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A known problem in cosmic shear two-point statistics is the apparent inconsistency between analyses performed in harmonic space (power spectrum) and real space (angular correlation). This arises mainly from two factors: first, scale cuts in one space correspond to soft cuts in the other, as the relationship between the two spaces is mediated by Bessel functions. For the same reason, astrophysical effects that are compact in one space may not be in the other, which can lead to biased parameter estimates. In this paper, we argue that these two statistics are complementary: we expect a robust theory to provide consistent constraints regardless of the chosen scale cuts. We present the consequences of pushing our analysis to smaller scales in both spaces, accounting for different models of Intrinsic Alignment and Baryonic Feedback in HSC Y3 data: we find that the harmonic-space analysis is significantly less sensitive to the specific modeling of small-scale physics, with model-choice-driven biases in $S_8$ being 2-3 times smaller than in real space. We show that using a flexible, simulation-based emulator for baryonic feedback (BACCO) in combination with the TATT model for intrinsic alignments provides the most consistent cosmological constraints between the two spaces when pushing to the smallest scales. In contrast, the standard HMCode-2016 model results in a $\sim 1.1\sigma$ tension between the two statistics. While harmonic space appears more robust for cosmological inference given current model uncertainties, real-space analyses offer a clearer separation of baryonic effects and will play a crucial role in distinguishing between baryonic feedback models in upcoming surveys.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave oscillations in Multi-Proca dark energy models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational wave oscillations arise from the exchange of energy between the metric perturbations and additional tensor modes. This phenomenon can occur even when the extra degrees of freedom consist of a triplet of massive Abelian vector fields, as in Multi-Proca dark energy models. In this work, we study gravitational wave oscillations in this class of models minimally coupled to gravity with a general potential, allowing also for a kinetic coupling between the vector field and dark matter that can, in principle, enhance the modulation of gravitational wave amplitudes. After consistently solving the background dynamics, requiring the model parameters to reproduce a phase of late-time accelerated expansion, we assess the accuracy of commonly used analytical approximations and quantify the impact of gravitational wave amplitude modulation for current detectors (LIGO--Virgo) and future missions such as LISA. Although oscillations are present in these scenarios, we find that the effective mass scale (the mixing mass) governing the phenomenon is $m_g \sim \mu_A$, where $\mu_A$ is the (time-dependent) effective mass of the vector dark-energy field. Detectability of gravitational wave oscillations, however, requires $m_g \gg H_0$, which is in tension with the ultra-light masses typically needed to drive accelerated expansion $\mu_A \sim H_0 \sim 10^{-33}\,\mathrm{eV}$. Therefore, if gravitational wave oscillations were to be detected at the corresponding frequencies, they could not be attributed to these classes of dark-energy models.</description>

      <title>CLiENT: A new tool for emulating cosmological likelihoods using deep neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmological emulation of observables such as the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) spectra and matter power spectra have become increasingly common in recent years because of the potential for saving computation time in connection with cosmological parameter inference or model comparison. In this paper we present CLiENT (Cosmological Likelihood Emulator using Neural networks with TensorFlow), a new method which circumvents the computation of observables in favour of directly emulating the likelihood function for a data set given a model parameter vector. We find that the method is competitive with observable emulators in terms of the required number of function evaluations, but has the distinct advantage of producing a surrogate likelihood which is completely auto-differentiable. Using less than $2 \times 10^4$ function evaluations CLiENT typically achieves credible intervals within better than $0.1 \sigma$ of those obtained using the true likelihood and single-point emulator precision better than $\Delta \chi^2 \sim 0.5$ across relevant regions in parameter space.</description>

      <title>Evolving and interacting dark energy: photometric and spectroscopic synergy with DES Y3 and DESI DR2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Dark Scattering (DS) interacting dark energy scenario, characterised by pure momentum exchange between dark matter and dark energy, allowing for a time-dependent equation-of-state described by the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrisation. This class of models is weakly constrained by CMB observations and can exhibit distinctive late-time suppression of structure growth. We derive constraints on cosmological, DS, and CPL parameters using three two-point correlation functions from the Dark Energy Survey Year 3 data, combined with baryon acoustic oscillation measurements from DESI, Type Ia supernovae from DES Year 5, and CMB data from Planck. We find the dark-sector interaction parameter $A_\mathrm{ds}$ to be consistent with zero for all data combinations, and that CPL provides a statistically preferred fit over DS for the selected probes. From the full data combination we obtain $w_0=-0.76\pm0.06, \, w_a=-0.77^{+0.23}_{-0.20}$ for CPL, and $w_0=-0.79^{+0.05}_{-0.06}, \, w_a=-0.56^{+0.24}_{-0.15}, \, (A_\mathrm{ds}=9.8^{+2.8}_{-9.5}\,\mathrm{bn/GeV} )$ for DS. The inclusion of DES photometric information improves the Figure-of-Merit on $(w_0,w_a)$ by $\sim$20% for CPL and $\sim$50% for DS relative to DESI+SN+CMB alone. We find no evidence for an $S_8$ discrepancy in either model. These results provide the most stringent pre-Euclid constraints on DS from a combined photometric and spectroscopic analysis.</description>

      <title>Implicit Likelihood Inference of the Neutrino Mass Hierarchy from Cosmological Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we turn to the Learning the Universe Implicit Likelihood Inference (LtU-ILI) pipeline to perform a multi-round ILI of the neutrino mass hierarchy from cosmological data, including $TT$, $TE$, $EE$ power spectra of Planck 2018 and distance ratios of DESI DR2. More precisely, we first embed the CMB power spectra simulator $\mathtt{CLASS}$ into the LtU-ILI pipeline. And then, opting for Sequential Neural Likelihood Estimation (SNLE), we sequentially train neural networks using $2$ rounds of $5000$ simulations to target a ``black box'' likelihood of our forward model with one additional neutrino mass hierarchy parameter $\tilde{\Delta}$ and six base cosmological parameters. We find that $\tilde{\Delta}=0.12216^{+0.26193}_{-0.29243}~(68\%{\rm CL})$ which slightly prefers $\tilde{\Delta}&gt;0$, hence the normal hierarchy.</description>

      <title>Constraining primordial non-Gaussianity from DESI DR1 quasars and Planck PR4 CMB Lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first measurement of local-type primordial non-Gaussianity from the cross-correlation between $1.2$ million spectroscopically confirmed quasars from the first data release (DR1) of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and the Planck PR4 CMB lensing reconstructions. The analysis is performed in three tomographic redshift bins covering $0.8 &lt; z &lt; 3.5$, covering a sky fraction of $\sim 20\%$. We adopt a catalog-based pseudo-$C_\ell$ estimator and apply linear imaging weights validated on noiseless mocks. Compared to previous analyses using photometric quasar samples, our results benefit from the high purity of the DESI spectroscopic sample, the reduced noise of PR4 lensing, and the absence of excess large-scale power in the spectroscopic quasar auto-correlation. Fitting simultaneously for the non-Gaussianity parameter $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$ and the linear bias amplitude in each redshift bin, we obtain $f_{\mathrm{NL}} = 2^{+28}_{-34}$ for a response parameter $p=1.6$, and $f_{\mathrm{NL}} = 6^{+20}_{-24}$ for $p=1.0$. These results improve the constraints on $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$ by $\sim 35\%$ compared to the previous analysis based on the Legacy Imaging Survey DR9. Our results demonstrate the statistical power of DESI quasars for probing inflationary physics, and highlight the promise of future DESI data releases.</description>

      <title>ESO Expanding Horizon White Paper: Revealing the properties of matter at supranuclear densities with gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding dense matter under extreme conditions is one of the most fundamental puzzles in modern physics. Complex interactions give rise to emergent, collective phenomena. While nuclear experiments and Earth - based colliders provide valuable insights, much of the quantum chromodynamics phase diagram at high density and low temperature remains accessible only through astrophysical observations of neutron stars, neutron star mergers, and stellar collapse. Astronomical observations thus offer a direct window to the physics on subatomic scales with gravitational waves presenting an especially clean channel. Next-generation gravitational - wave observatories, such as the Einstein Telescope, would serve as unparalleled instruments to transform our understanding of neutron star matter. They will enable the detection of up to tens of thousands of binary neutron star and neutron star - black hole mergers per year, a dramatic increase over the few events accessible with current detectors. They will provide an unprecedented precision in probing cold, dense matter during the binary inspiral, exceeding by at least an order of magnitude what current facilities can achieve. Moreover, these observatories will allow us to explore uncharted regimes of dense matter at finite temperatures produced in a subset of neutron star mergers, areas that remain entirely inaccessible to current instruments. Together with multimessenger observations, these measurements will significantly deepen our knowledge of dense nuclear matter.</description>

Abstract: We study the cosmological gravitational particle production (CGPP) of spin-3/2 particles during and after cosmic inflation, and map the parameter space that can realize the observed dark matter density in stable spin-3/2 particles. Originally formulated by Rarita and Schwinger, the relativistic theory of a massive spin-3/2 field later found a home in supergravity as the superpartner of the graviton, and in nuclear physics as baryonic resonances and nuclear isotopes. We study a minimal model realization, namely a free massive spin-3/2 field minimally coupled to gravity, and adopt the name raritron for this field. We demonstrate that CGPP of raritrons crucially depends on the hierarchy between the raritron mass $m_{3/2}$ and the Hubble parameter at the end of inflation $H_e$, with high-mass and low-mass cases distinguished by the evolution of the sound speed $c_s$ of the longitudinal (helicity-1/2) mode, which is approximately unity at all times for heavy (relative to Hubble) raritrons and can become small or vanish for lighter raritrons, leading to a dramatic enhancement of production of high momentum particles in the latter case. Assuming the raritrons are stable, this leads to a wide parameter space to produce the observed dark matter density. Finally, we consider a time-dependent raritron mass, which can be chosen to remove the vanishing sound speed of the longitudinal mode, but which nonetheless enhances the production relative to the constant high-mass case, and in particular does not necessarily tame the high momentum tail of the spectrum. We perform our calculations using the Bogoliubov formalism and compare, when applicable, to the Boltzmann formalism.</description>

      <title>Deviations from Gaussian White Noise in Stochastic Inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic inflation is widely used as a framework to study scalar field perturbations on an inflationary spacetime in a classical manner. In Starobinsky's seminal work and most of the subsequent literature, stochastic inflation is driven by a white noise. This is a consequence of a number of assumptions about the background metric, the window function, and the initial state. Given that noise is the central object in this approach, it is worthwhile to investigate how the noise is modified upon relaxing some of these assumptions. We show that while deviation from an exact de Sitter background maintains the white character of the noise (only with a time-dependent amplitude), deviation from the Heaviside window function or the Bunch-Davies initial state can produce colored noise. We calculate the power spectrum and the memory of the noise for a toy model with a piecewise linear window function. We also show that, in order to produce a colored noise, the deviation from the Bunch-Davies vacuum should essentially be a sum of two-particle states. The resulting noise is non-stationary and we find its instantaneous power spectrum in a concrete example. Furthermore, while deviations from de Sitter background and sharp cutoff do not affect Gaussianity, changing the initial state yields a non-Gaussian noise.</description>

      <title>Uncovering the population of compact binary mergers and their formation pathways with gravitational waves through the Einstein Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ground-based gravitational-wave (GW) observatories have transformed our view of compact-object mergers, yet their reach still limits a comprehensive reconstruction of the processes that generate these systems. Only next-generation observatories, with order-of-magnitude improvements in sensitivity and access to lower frequencies, will be capable of radically extending this detection horizon. GW observations will make it possible to detect the complete population of binary black hole (BBH) mergers out to redshifts of $z \simeq 100$. This capability will deliver an unprecedented map of merger events across cosmic time and enable precise reconstruction of their mass and spin distributions, while for several thousand events the signal-to-noise ratio will surpass 100, enabling precision physics of BHs and neutron stars (NSs). The access to lower frequencies will also open the intermediate-mass window, detecting systems of order $\sim 10^3 M_\odot$, potentially in coordination with multi-band observations from LISA. At higher redshifts, where Population III stars have so far remained beyond reach - even for the James Webb Space Telescope - GW observations by next-generation detectors will routinely provide observations of BH mergers thought to originate from these primordial stellar populations. Such measurements are expected to play a central role in clarifying the early assembly of supermassive black holes. A single detection of a binary BH system at $z \gtrsim 30$, or of a compact object with sub-solar mass and no tidal deformability, would constitute strong evidence for the existence of primordial black holes. Such a discovery would have profound consequences for our understanding of dark matter and the early Universe. Ultimately, the GW observations will become revolutionary for identifying the physical channels responsible for compact binary formation.</description>

      <title>Ghost-free 2-form fields in cosmology: implications for gravitational parity violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the possibility of parity-violating, nonminimally coupled 2-form field theories that retain the same dynamical degrees of freedom as a massive 2-form and thus are ghost-free. Starting from the most general kinetic terms and dimension four couplings between the 2-form field and the curvature tensors, we find a two-parameter family of such theories. However, we also find that parity-violating terms involving the dual 2-form field can be absorbed into a field redefinition, leaving a theory with essentially the same structure as that obtained by Heisenberg and Trenkler (i.e., the parity-preserving coupling to the double dual Riemann tensor). After the field redefinition, the only place where parity-violating terms can appear is in the potential. We then consider a homogeneous and isotropic cosmological model with an isotropic configuration of a triplet of 2-form fields, and study tensor perturbations in this setup. There are three types of tensor perturbations, two of which are dynamical. We show that chiral gravitational waves can be generated in the presence of parity-violating terms in the potential.</description>

      <title>Quantum state of interacting primordial inhomogeneities: de-squeezing and decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how interactions affect the quantum state of scalar perturbations during inflation and the quantum correlations they may exhibit. Focusing on the case of scalar perturbations in single-field inflation, we model interactions using a Lindblad equation with a non-unitary contribution quadratic in the scalar perturbations, and of parametrisable amplitude and time dependence. We compute the quantum state of these interacting perturbations, which is fully described by its purity and squeezing parameters. First, we show that, in most of the parameter space, not only the purity but also the squeezing parameter is significantly reduced by interactions. Second, we show that this de-squeezing induced by the interactions, on top of the purity loss, causes a further suppression of quantum correlations. We thus emphasise that the quantum or classical character of the correlations exhibited by the perturbations cannot be correctly determined by computing the effect of interactions on the purity alone. Since the phenomenological framework adopted in this paper encompasses a wide class of possible interactions, our results provide general insights into the nature of decoherence processes in primordial fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Across the Universe: GW231123 as a magnified and diffracted black hole merger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: GW231123 appears as the most massive binary black hole (BBH) ever observed by the LIGO interferometers with total mass $190-265 M_\odot$. A high observed mass can be explained by the combination of cosmological redshift and gravitational magnification if the source is aligned with a gravitational lens, such as a galaxy. Small-scale objects such as stars and remnants diffract the signal, distorting the wavefront and providing additional lensing signatures. Here we present an analysis of GW231123 combining for the first time the effects of diffraction by a small-scale lens and gravitational magnification by an external potential, modelled as an embedded point-mass lens (PL), finding an intriguing case for the lensing hypothesis. Lensing is favoured by the data, with a false alarm probability of the observed Bayes factors bounded below $&lt;1\%$, or $\sim 2.6 \sigma$ confidence level. Including lensing lowers the total source mass of GW231123 to $100-180 M_\odot$, closer to BBHs reported so far, and also removes discrepancies between different waveform approximants and the need for high component spins. We reconstruct all source and lens properties, including the microlens mass $190-850 M_\odot$, its offset, the magnitude of the external gravitational potential and its orientation. The embedded PL analysis leads to a lighter microlens compared to the isolated PL. Within our assumptions, the reconstruction is complete up to an ambiguity between the distance and projected density (mass-sheet degeneracy). Assuming a single galaxy as the macroscopic lens allows us to infer the total amplification of the signal, placing the event at redshift $0.7-2$, and predict the probability $~55\%$ of forming an additional detectable image due to strong lensing by the macrolens. We discuss the implications of our findings on the source and nature of the microlens, including a possible dark matter origin.</description>

      <title>The MeerKLASS L-band On-the-Fly Continuum Survey: Data Release 1</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The MeerKAT Large Area Synoptic Survey (MeerKLASS) collaboration has acquired multiple passes of L-band (856-1712 MHz) scanning observations over a 268 deg$^2$ sky region. This scanning enables efficient, large-area sky surveys by continuously scanning the MeerKAT array back and forth at fixed elevation while recording data at 2 sec intervals, progressively covering the survey region as the Earth rotates. We employ a novel on-the-fly (OTF) interferometric imaging technique to construct continuum images and catalogs from 16 hours of scan data. These data products, constituting the first MeerKLASS L-band data release (DR1), consist of high-fidelity radio continuum images and a catalogue of 34,874 radio sources detected with a SNR$&gt;$9. The resulting Stokes I images achieve a median noise level of 33 $\mu$Jy\,beam$^{-1}$ and a median angular resolution of approximately $25.5''\times 7.8''$. Cross-comparisons with previous surveys confirm the consistency of our flux density scale within 5\% and astrometric precision within $1.5''$. Additionally, flux densities measured across the seven sub-bands enable in-band spectral-index estimates for the detected sources, providing insights into their physical properties and the broader source population. We compute the differential source counts, finding good agreement with existing measurements and validating our end-to-end processing. This data release demonstrates the effectiveness of scanning surveys when combined with OTF interferometric imaging. Commensal intensity mapping and interferometric imaging offers a dramatic enhancement of survey science per invested hour of observations and could therefore be an appealing option for next generation facilities like SKA-Mid.</description>

      <title>Baryogenesis and EDMs in the 2HDM+CS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform the first joint analysis of baryogenesis from initial Higgs charges (also called Higgsogenesis) and EDMs in a model with two Higgs doublets, a complex scalar and a Majorana fermion. In our proposed scenario, baryogenesis happens in three steps: (1) The decay of the scalar produces an asymmetry between the two Higgs doublets which is partly transferred to fermions via Standard Model processes. (2) This asymmetry is converted into a $B-L$ charge via interactions mediated by the Majorana fermion. (3) The weak sphaleron processes partially convert the resulting $B-L$ charge into a $B$ asymmetry. We perform a numerical analysis of baryogenesis and the EDM contributions and find that, due to resonant enhancement, baryogenesis is possible with singlet masses as low as $10^5$ GeV. We also find that for some parameters, the model can give large contributions to the electron and neutron EDM while also producing baryogenesis. The present scenario offers a new perspective on interpreting observational bounds in terms of cosmology: Because it relies on out-of-equilibrium decays, the questions of baryogenesis and $CP$ violation in the Higgs sector may be linked with EDM signals without the additional assumption of a first order electroweak phase transition.</description>

      <title>Boiling away asymmetries: low-scale phase transitions, gravitational waves and leptogenesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Leptogenesis is one of the most popular mechanisms to account for the observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe. A generic feature of leptogenesis is a large separation of scales between the epoch of baryon asymmetry production (sphaleron freeze-out at temperature $T \sim 130$ GeV) and the one where it affects the big bang nucleosynthesis processes (BBN at $T \sim 1$ MeV). Any entropy release between these two epochs would lead to a dilution of previously produced relics, such as the baryons. Motivated by the recent evidence of a stochastic gravitational waves background (SGWB) in the nHz frequency range, we consider the case of supercooled first-order phase transition and we study the impact of the induced entropy dilution on the leptogenesis parameter space. We employ the Type-I seesaw with 2 right-handed neutrinos as benchmark scenario, and demonstrate that the viable leptogenesis parameter space is significantly reduced. Interestingly, the values of dilution predicted by the SGWB best fit points in several first order phase transition scenarios would completely exclude the leptogenesis parameter space testable by future experiments, thus establishing a phenomenological interconnection between leptogenesis, SGWB, first order phase transition and neutrino mass generation. Our analysis can be generalised to different leptogenesis models and entropy dilution mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field spreading from stellar and galactic dynamos into the exterior</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exteriors of stellar and galactic dynamos are usually modeled as a current-free potential field. A more realistic description might be that of a force-free magnetic field. Here, we suggest that, in the absence of outflows, neither of those reflect the actual behavior when the magnetic field spreads diffusively into a more poorly conducting turbulent exterior outside dynamo. In particular, we show that the usual ordering of the dipole magnetic field being the most slowly decaying one is altered, and that the quadrupole can develop a toroidal component that decays even more slowly with radial distance. This behavior is best seen for spherical dynamo volumes and becomes more complicated for oblate ones. In either case, however, those fields are confined within a magnetosphere beyond which the field drops exponentially. The magnetosphere expands ballistically (i.e., linearly in time $t$) during the exponential growth phase of the dynamo, but diffusively proportional to $t^{1/2}$ during the saturated phase. We demonstrate that the Faraday displacement current, which plays a role in a vacuum, can safely be neglected in all cases. For quadrupolar configurations, the synchrotron emission from the magnetosphere is found to be constant along concentric rings. The total and the polarized radio emissions from the dipolar or the quadrupolar configurations display large scale radial trends that are potentially distinguishable with existing radio telescopes. The superposition of magnetic fields from galaxies in the outskirts of the voids between galaxy clusters can therefore not explain the void magnetization of the intergalactic medium, reinforcing the conventional expectation that those fields are of primordial origin.</description>

      <title>Revisited apparent horizon entropy and GSL in modified gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a universal and revisited formalism for the entropy of the apparent horizon in modified gravity to investigate the validity of the Generalized Second Law (GSL) of thermodynamics. This revisited horizon entropy is constructed directly from the modified Friedmann equations in a non-flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe. The resulting entropy relation contains, beside the standard Bekenstein-Hawking term, an additional integral contribution that encodes the effective energy density and pressure generated by deviations from general relativity. Using this universal entropy formula, a compact expression for the GSL is derived. This formalism is then applied to some viable $f(T)$ and $f(R)$ gravity models, in order to re-evaluate the validity of the GSL as a function of redshift. The analysis demonstrates that including the integral term in the revisited entropy can relatively improve the late-time validity of the GSL for some of these models while living others unchanged, thereby reinforcing the profound connection between thermodynamics and gravity.</description>

      <title>Trails of clouds in binary black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superradiant instabilities of rotating black holes can give rise to long-lived bosonic clouds, offering natural laboratories to probe ultralight particles across a wide range of parameter space. The presence of a companion can dramatically impact both the cloud's evolution and the binary's orbital dynamics, generating a trail of feedback effects that require detailed modelling. Using a worldline effective field theory approach, we develop a systematic framework for binaries on generic (eccentric and inclined) orbits, capturing both resonant and non-resonant transitions without relying solely on balance laws. We demonstrate the existence of ``co-rotating'' floating orbits that can deplete the cloud prior to entering the detector's band, triggering eccentricity growth towards a sequence of fixed points. Likewise, we show that ``counter-rotating'' orbits can also deplete the cloud, driving (unbounded) growth of eccentricity. Furthermore, we uncover novel features tied to orbital inclination. Depending on the mass ratio, equatorial orbits can become unstable, and fixed points may arise not only for aligned or anti-aligned configurations but, strikingly, also at intermediate inclinations. We derive flow equations governing spin-orbit misalignment and eccentricity and identify distinctive signatures that can reveal the presence of boson clouds in the binary's history, as well as key features of possible in-band transitions. These results refine and extend earlier work, yielding a more faithful description of the imprints of ultralight particles in gravitational-wave signals from binary black holes, signatures that are within reach of future detectors such as LISA, Cosmic Explorer, and the Einstein~Telescope.</description>

      <title>Novel Quantity for Probing Matter Perturbations Below the Fresnel Scale in Gravitational Lensing of Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing of gravitational waves provides a powerful probe of the mass density distribution in the universe. Wave optics effects, such as diffraction, make the lensing effect sensitive to the structure around the Fresnel scale, which depends on the gravitational wave frequency and is typically sub-Galactic for realistic observations. Contrary to this common lore, we show that wave optics can, in principle, probe matter perturbations even below the Fresnel scale. This is achieved by introducing a new quantity derived from the amplification factor, which characterizes the lensing effect, and analyzing its correlation function. Our results demonstrate that this quantity defines an effective Fresnel scale: a characteristic scale that can be arbitrarily small, even when observational frequencies are bounded. In practice, the effective Fresnel scale is constrained by the observation time $T$ and is suppressed by a factor of $1/\sqrt{fT}$ relative to the standard Fresnel scale at frequency $f$. Nevertheless, it remains significantly smaller than the conventional Fresnel scale for $fT \gg 1$; for instance, in one-year observations of mHz GWs, the effective Fresnel scale can be as small as 1 pc. This approach opens new avenues for probing the fine-scale structure of the universe and the nature of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Baryon Acoustic Oscillations in tomographic Angular Density and Redshift Fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15506v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we examine the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in 2D angular and redshift space $\{\theta, \Delta z\}$, with $\Delta z$ denoting the redshift difference between two given angular shells. We thus work in the context of tomographic analyses of the large scale structure (LSS) where data are sliced in different redshift shells and constraints on Cosmology are extracted from the auto and cross-angular spectra of two different probes, namely the standard galaxy angular density fluctuations (ADF, or 2D clustering), and the galaxy angular redshift fluctuations (ARF). For these two observables we study by first time how the BAO peak arises in the $\{\theta, \Delta z\}$ plane. Despite being a weak feature (particularly for $\Delta z \neq 0$), a Fisher forecast analysis shows that, a priori, most of the information on cosmological and galaxy bias parameters is carried by the BAO features in shell auto- and cross-angular power spectra. The same study shows that a joint probe analysis (ADF+ARF) increases the Fisher determinant associated to cosmological parameters such as $H_0$ or the Dark Energy Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parameters $\{w_0,w_a\}$ by at least an order of magnitude. We also study how the Fisher information on cosmological and galaxy bias-related parameters behaves under different redshift shell configurations: including cross-correlations to neighbour shells extending up to $(\Delta z)^{\rm tot}\sim 0.6$ ($(\Delta z)^{\rm tot}\sim 0.4$) for ADF (ARF) is required for Fisher information to converge. At the same time, configurations using narrow shell widths ($\sigma_z \leq 0.02$) preserve the cosmological information associated to peculiar velocities and typically yield Fisher determinants that are about two orders of magnitudes larger than for wider shell ($\sigma_z&gt;0.02$) configurations.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the phenomenologically emergent dark energy model: is non-zero equation of state of dark matter favored by DESI DR2?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nature of dark matter remains one of the most fundamental and unresolved questions in modern cosmology. In most cosmological models, dark matter is typically modeled as pressureless dust with an equation of state (EoS) parameter $w_{\rm dm} = 0$. However, there is no fundamental theoretical reason to exclude the possibility of a non-zero dark matter EoS parameter. In this work, we explore the possibility of a non-zero dark matter EoS within the phenomenologically emergent dark energy (PEDE) model, given its simplicity and proven ability to alleviate the Hubble tension. We perform observational constraints by using the latest baryon acoustic oscillation data from DESI DR2, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from Planck, and the type Ia supernova data from DESY5 and PantheonPlus. From our analysis, we observe that a negative dark matter EoS parameter is preferred in all scenarios. Specifically, the CMB+DESI+DESY5 data yields $w_{\mathrm{dm}} = -0.00093 \pm 0.00032$, deviating from zero at approximately the $3\sigma$ level. However, this deviation is likely driven by unidentified systematics or inconsistencies in the DESY5 data, with the deviation decreasing to $2\sigma$ when using PantheonPlus data. Meanwhile, a negative $w_{\rm dm}$ would increase the Hubble tension due to the positive degeneracy between $w_{\rm dm}$ and $H_0$. Furthermore, Bayesian evidence suggests that the $\Lambda$CDM model is strongly preferred over the PEDE+$w_{\rm dm}$ model. These analyses illustrate that it is not possible to both support a non-cold dark matter component within the PEDE model and alleviate the Hubble tension simultaneously.</description>

      <title>J-PAS: Forecasting constraints on Neutrino Masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03740v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The large-scale structure survey J-PAS is taking data since October 2023. In this work, we present a forecast based on the Fisher matrix method to establish its sensitivity to the sum of the neutrino masses. We adapt the Fisher Galaxy Survey Code (FARO) to account for the neutrino mass under various configurations applied to galaxy clustering measurements. This approach allows us to test the sensitivity of J-PAS to the neutrino mass across different tracers, with and without non-linear corrections, and under varying sky coverage. We perform our forecast for two cosmological models: $\Lambda CDM + \sum m_\nu$ and $w_0w_a CDM + \sum m_\nu$. We combine our J-PAS forecast with Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data from the Planck Collaboration and Type Ia supernova (SN) data from Pantheon Plus. Our analysis shows that, for a sky coverage of 8,500 square degrees, J-PAS galaxy clustering data alone will constrain the sum of the neutrino masses to an upper limit at 95% C.L of $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.32$ eV for the $\Lambda CDM + \sum m_\nu$ model, and $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.36$ eV for the $w_0w_a CDM + \sum m_\nu$ model. When combined with Planck data, the upper limit improves significantly. For J-PAS+Planck at 95% C.L, we find $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.061$ eV for the $\Lambda CDM + \sum m_\nu$ model, and for J-PAS+Planck+Pantheon Plus, we obtain $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.12$ eV for the $w_0w_a CDM + \sum m_\nu$ model. These results demonstrate that J-PAS clustering measurements can play a crucial role in addressing challenges in the neutrino sector, including potential tensions between cosmological and terrestrial measurements of the neutrino mass, as well as in determining the mass ordering.</description>

      <title>Carnegie Supernova Project: Fast-Declining Type Ia Supernovae as Cosmological Distance Indicators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07093v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, the suitability of fast-declining Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) as cosmological standard candles is examined utilizing a Hubble Flow sample of 43 of these objects observed by the Carnegie Supernova Project (CSP). We confirm previous suggestions that fast-declining SNe Ia offer a viable method for estimating distances to early-type galaxies when the color-stretch parameter, $s_{BV}$, is used as a measure of the light curve shape. As a test, we employ the Tripp method, which models the absolute magnitude at maximum as a function of light curve shape and color. We calibrate the sample using 12 distance moduli based on published Infrared Surface Brightness Fluctuations to derive a value of the Hubble constant that is in close agreement with the value obtained for the full sample of CSP SNe Ia using the same methodology. We also develop a new and simple method of estimating the distances of fast decliners based only on their colors at maximum (and not light curve shape) and find that it leads to similar results as with using the Tripp method. This "Color" technique is a powerful tool that is unique to fast-declining SNe Ia. We show that the colors of the fast decliners at maximum light are strongly affected by photospheric temperature differences and not solely due to dust extinction, and provide a physical rationale for this effect.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Dark Energy Meets Varying Electron Mass: Implications for Phantom Crossing and the Hubble Constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between varying electron mass ($m_e$) and dynamical dark energy by analysing the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization and its non-crossing variants, both with and without a varying-$m_e$ component. Our aim is to assess whether the preference for late-time dynamics and phantom divide line (PDL) crossing persists when early-time physics is introduced, and whether these combined models improve the alleviation of the Hubble tension compared to the varying-$m_e$ extension alone. Using the latest CMB, BAO, and supernova datasets, we derive updated constraints on $\Lambda$CDM, CPL, and their extensions, and examine their impact on $H_0$ and the preference for late-time dynamics. We find that $\Lambda$CDM+$m_e$ yields the largest upward shift in $H_0$, while replacing $\Lambda$ with the CPL parametrization or its non-crossing variants provides modest improvements in the overall fit. The data consistently favour dynamical dark energy and a phantom divide line crossing at scale factors $a_{\rm c}\simeq0.6-0.9$, and these preferences remain robust, though somewhat weaker ($\gtrsim2\sigma$), when the electron mass is also allowed to vary. Among the late-time models, CPL performs better than its non-crossing variants, further reinforcing the evidence for a genuine phantom divide crossing. The alleviation of the $H_0$ tension in the varying-$m_e$ case arises from late-time data breaking the strong $\Omega_m$-$m_e$ degeneracy in the CMB, while the additional degrees of freedom in CPL models allow the late-time dynamics to absorb this impact, thereby weakening the degeneracy breaking and further lowering $H_0$ through their ability to yield a decreasing dark energy contribution.</description>

      <title>Inflationary relics from an Ultra-Slow-Roll plateau</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) in inflationary scenarios featuring an ultra-slow-roll (USR) plateau, focusing on two coexisting production channels: PBHs originating from relic vacuum bubbles where the inflaton got trapped on the plateau, and PBHs arising from standard adiabatic density perturbations. From detailed numerical simulations we find that the bubbles are generically surrounded by type-II curvature fluctuations. Special attention is given to the distribution of initial conditions, including the relevant mean profiles and shape dispersion around them. For the adiabatic channel, we extend the logarithmic template formula $\zeta[\zeta_G]$, which maps the Gaussian curvature perturbation to the fully non-Gaussian one while incorporating mode evolution, and we compare this with numerical results obtained using the $\delta N$ formalism. While the template departs from numerical results near its logarithmic divergence, it still provides accurate threshold values for PBH formation in the parameter range relevant to our analysis. Finally, we compute the PBH mass functions for both channels. We find that the adiabatic channel dominates over the bubble-induced channel by a factor $\sim \mathcal{O}(10-10^{2})$, and that both contributions are largely dominated by the mean profiles.</description>

      <title>Forecasted Detection Limits on the (Dark) Matter Density in Supermassive Black Hole Binaries for LISA</title>

Abstract: Supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) are among the most powerful known sources of gravitational waves (GWs). Accordingly, these systems could dominate GW emission in the micro- and millihertz frequency range. Within this domain, SMBHs evolve rapidly and merge with each other. Dynamical friction from stars and gas at the centers of galaxies typically helps to bring together two SMBHs when they are at relatively far separations ($\approx$ kpc $-$ 100 pc), but becomes less efficient at smaller separations. However, dark matter (DM) spikes around SMBHs could enhance dynamical friction at close separations and, thus, shorten the evolution times. In this paper, we simulate the effects of DM spikes on GW signals in the micro- to millihertz frequency range and confirm that the GW signals from SMBHBs with DM spikes can be clearly distinguished from those without any additional matter. Making use of the projected sensitivity curve of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), we forecast upper limits for the (dark) matter density for given future SMBHB observations. We then compare these thresholds with the theoretical density profiles expected for self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) spikes.</description>

      <title>Towards model-independent identification of lensed gravitational waves using Kramers-Kronig relation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21320v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observations of microlensed gravitational waves (GWs) emanated by compact binary coalescences (CBCs) are essential for studying the mass density distribution in the universe, including black holes and dark matter halos. However, no confident detection of microlensed GWs have been reported to date. There are two important challenges in the identification of microlensed GWs. The first is that the source waveform and lens structure models are not known a-priori. The second is that certain classes of unlensed GWs could mimic microlensed GWs, resulting in undesirable false alarms. In this work, we propose to use the Kramers-Kronig relation for gravitational lensing systems. We argue that such systems are essentially linear response systems obeying causality, where KK relation must hold. The power of this method lies in the fact that microlensed GWs, regardless of the lens structure, must obey KK relation, while unlensed GW events are not in general expected to obey it. This, in principle, allows us to identify microlensed GWs while dismissing microlensing mimickers. We provide the first important steps towards a methodology that exploits KK relation, and test its usefulness under idealized conditions.</description>

Abstract: The local primordial density fluctuations caused by quantum vacuum fluctuations during inflation grow into stars and galaxies in the late universe and, if they are large enough, also produce primordial black holes. We study the formation of the primordial black holes in $k$-essence inflation models with a potential characterized by an inflection point. The background and perturbation equations are integrated numerically for two specific models. Using the critical collapse and peaks formalism, we calculate the abundance of primordial black holes today.</description>

      <title>Mass Proxy Quality of Massive Halo Properties in the IllustrisTNG and FLAMINGO Simulations: I. Hot Gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05176v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine scale and redshift dependence of mass-property relations (MPRs) for five hot gas properties of two large group- and cluster-scale halo samples realized by the IllustrisTNG, TNG-Cluster and FLAMINGO cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. For intrinsic properties of i) hot gas mass ($M_{\rm gas}$), ii) spectroscopic-like temperature ($T_{\rm sl}$), iii) soft-band X-ray luminosity ($L_{\rm X}$), and iv) X-ray ($Y_{\rm X}$) and v) Sunyaev-Zel'dovich ($Y_{\rm SZ}$) thermal energies, we use MPR parameters to infer mass proxy quality (MPQ) -- the implied scatter in total halo mass conditioned on a property -- for halos with $M_{\rm 500c} \geq 10^{13}{\, {\rm M}_\odot}$ at redshifts, $z \in \{0, 0.5, 1, 2\}$. We find: (1) in general, scaling relation slopes and covariance display moderate to strong dependence on halo mass, with redshift dependence secondary; (2) for halos with $M_{\rm 500c} &gt; 10^{14}{\, {\rm M}_\odot}$, scalings of $M_{\rm gas}$ and $Y_{\rm SZ}$ simplify toward self-similar slope and constant intrinsic scatter (5 and 10 per cent, respectively) nearly independent of scale, making both measures ideal for cluster finding and characterization to $z=2$; (3) halo mass-conditioned likelihoods of hot gas mass and thermal energy at fixed halo mass closely follow a log-normal form; (4) despite normalization differences ranging up to $0.4$ dex between the two simulations, higher order scaling features such as slopes and property covariance show much better agreement. Slopes show appreciable redshift dependence at the group scale, while redshift dependence of the scatter is exhibited by low-mass FLAMINGO halos only; (5) property correlations are largely consistent between the simulations, with values that mainly agree with existing empirical measurements. We close with a literature survey placing our MPR slopes and intrinsic scatter estimates into community context.</description>

      <title>On the computational feasibility of Bayesian end-to-end analysis of LiteBIRD simulations within Cosmoglobe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We assess the computational feasibility of end-to-end Bayesian analysis of the JAXA-led LiteBIRD experiment by analysing simulated time ordered data (TOD) for a subset of detectors through the Cosmoglobe and Commander3 framework. The data volume for the simulated TOD is 1.55 TB, or 470 GB after Huffman compression. From this we estimate a total data volume of 238 TB for the full three year mission, or 70 TB after Huffman compression. We further estimate the running time for one Gibbs sample, from TOD to cosmological parameters, to be approximately 3000 CPU hours. The current simulations are based on an ideal instrument model, only including correlated 1/f noise. Future work will consider realistic systematics with full end-to-end error propagation. We conclude that these requirements are well within capabilities of future high-performance computing systems.</description>

      <title>Return of the Lepton Number: Sterile Neutrino Dark Matter Production and the Revival of the Shi-Fuller Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18752v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore resonant production of sterile neutrino dark matter via the Shi-Fuller (SF) mechanism, revisiting its cosmological viability in light of recent results demonstrating that lepton-number asymmetries $L_\alpha \gtrsim 1$ at temperatures $T &gt; 20\rm\,MeV$ are consistent with big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN). Using a quasiclassical Boltzmann transport calculation of the dark matter production, we compute the nonthermal phase space distributions of sterile neutrinos across a broad range of particle mass $m_s$ and mixing angle $\sin^2{(2\theta)}$ parameter space. We then evolve the resulting distributions through linear structure formation using CLASS and fit the resulting matter power spectra to thermal warm dark matter (WDM) transfer functions, enabling a direct mapping between SF models and equivalent thermal WDM particle masses $m_{\mathrm{th}}$. This allows us to reinterpret existing structure formation limits and Lyman-$\alpha$ forest preferences in the context of SF production. We find that lepton asymmetries $L \gtrsim 0.5$ at high temperatures open significant viable parameter space in the $m_s \gtrsim 10\,\mathrm{keV}$ and $\sin^2 (2\theta) \lesssim 10^{-14}$ regime, compatible with both x-ray constraints from NuSTAR and INTEGRAL/SPI and recent Lyman-$\alpha$ inferences of $m_{\mathrm{th}} \approx 4.1\,\mathrm{keV}$. Following lepton number evolution below 20 MeV, we also specifically show that this lepton asymmetry parameter space is compatible with BBN and cosmic microwave background constraints. We present updated constraints, a refined $m_{\mathrm{th}}$ fitting function, and power-law approximations for $L$ across the parameter space. Our results motivate future x-ray observations targeting the $\sim\! 20\,\mathrm{keV}$ photon regime and testing of the $m_\mathrm{th} \gtrsim 10\,\mathrm{keV}$ WDM region.</description>

      <title>A Compact Story of Positivity in de Sitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08359v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent developments have yielded significant progress towards systematically understanding loop corrections to de Sitter (dS) correlators. In close analogy with physics in Anti-de Sitter (AdS), large logarithms can result from loops that can be interpreted as corrections to the dimensions of operators. In contrast with AdS, these dimensions are not manifestly real. This implies that the theoretical constraints on the associated correlators are less transparent, particularly in the presence of light scalars. In this paper, we revisit these issues by performing and comparing calculations using the spectral representation approach and the Soft de Sitter Effective Theory (SdSET). We review the general arguments that yield positivity constraints on dS correlators from both perspectives. Our particular focus will be on vertex operators for compact scalar fields, since this case introduces novel complications. We will explain how to resolve apparent disagreements between different techniques for calculating the anomalous dimensions for principal series fields coupled to these vertex operators. Along the way, we will offer new proofs of positivity of the anomalous dimensions, and explain why renormalization group flow associated with these anomalous dimensions in SdSET is the same as resumming bubble diagrams in the spectral representation.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves induced by matter isocurvature in general cosmologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02122v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The expansion history and content of the Universe between the end of inflation and the onset of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis is mostly unknown. In this paper, we study gravitational waves (GWs) induced by matter isocurvature fluctuations in a generic perfect fluid background as a novel probe of the physics of the very early Universe. We analytically compute the induced GW kernel and analyze the spectral GW energy density for a sharply peaked isocurvature power spectrum. We show that the spectral shape of the GW signal is sensitive to the equation of state parameter $w$ of the perfect fluid dominating the early Universe after inflation. We find that the GW amplitude is enhanced for a soft equation of state. Our framework can be applied to dark matter isocurvature and models leading to early matter-dominated eras, such as primordial black holes and cosmological solitons.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Structure Strikes Back: The Elimination of Vector-Mediated Nonstandard Interaction Models as a Mechanism for Sterile Neutrino Dark Matter Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05631v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit sterile-neutrino production enabled by nonstandard interactions (NSI) among active neutrinos mediated by new bosons. We focus on vector mediators, including neutrinophilic, gauged $L_\mu\!-\!L_\tau$, and $B\!-\!L$ realizations that modify in-medium dispersion and scattering, thereby altering the active-sterile conversion history. Building on a novel production framework with NSI thermal potentials and collision integrals, we compute nonthermal phase-space distributions across sterile neutrino mixing and NSI parameters and map each point to an equivalent thermal warm dark matter particle mass $m_\mathrm{th}$ via linear-theory transfer function fitting with cosmological structure-formation Boltzmann solver. This enables a direct reinterpretation of state-of-the-art structure-formation limits from Milky Way satellites, strong lensing, and the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. These limits, in conjunction with X-ray decay searches, as well as results from a wide variety of particle physics experiments allow for a more complete examination of these models. We find that these vector-mediated models are ruled out when the full combination of current constraints, listed above, are taken into account. NSI scalar-mediated models and models with low-reheating temperatures remain viable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23987v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate cosmological solutions for the modified gravity theory obtained from quantum relative entropy between the metric of spacetime and the metric induced by the geometry and matter fields. The vacuum equations admit inflationary solutions, hinting at an entropic origin for inflation. Equations also admit a regime of phantom like behavior. Assuming that the relation between slow roll parameters and CMB observables holds for entropic gravity, the theory predicts a viable spectrum.</description>

      <title>Chiral magnetic effect amplified baryogenesis at first-order phase transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16537v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we show that, in the background of the primordial magnetic field, the chiral magnetic effect effect can significantly amplify the chiral chemical potential sourced by the CP violation near the bubble walls during the first-order electroweak phase transition. This effect can lift the generated baryon asymmetry by several orders, and make it possible to explain the baryon asymmetry of the Universe with a CPV in the fermion sector far beyond the limitation of the electron dipole moment.</description>
