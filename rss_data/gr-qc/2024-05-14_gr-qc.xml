      <title>Schwarzschild black hole revisited: Before the complete collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the framework of general relativity, we explore the interior of the Schwarzschild black hole before complete collapse occurs, finding that the exterior is perfectly compatible with a source much more complex than a pointlike mass. We provide a set of inner geometries for singular and regular black holes that smoothly joint the Schwarzschild exterior at the horizon $r=h=2{\cal M}$, and which can therefore be regarded as suitable initial conditions for collapse. In particular, the regular solutions might be an alternative to the Schwarzschild black hole as the final stage of gravitational collapse, and thus useful to study the validity of general relativity in environments of high curvature.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic radial perturbations of relativistic stars: analytic solutions to an old problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new system of equations that fully characterizes adiabatic, radial perturbations of perfect fluid stars within the theory of general relativity. The properties of the system are discussed, and, provided that the equilibrium spacetime verifies some general regularity conditions, analytical solutions for the perturbation variables are found. As illustrative examples, the results are applied to study perturbations of selected classical exact spacetimes, and the first oscillation eigenfrequencies are computed. Exploiting the new formalism, we derive an upper bound for the maximum compactness of stable, perfect fluid stars, which is equation-of-state-agnostic and significantly smaller than the Buchdahl bound.</description>

      <title>Perturbations of Mimetic Curvaton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mimetic gravity theory is one of the interesting modified gravity theories, which aims to unify the matter component of our universe within the power of gravity. The mimetic-like theory can also be responsible for primordial perturbations production, e.g., when the mimetic field is set to be like a curvaton field, and the adiabatic perturbation can thus be generated from the isocurvature perturbation via usual curvaton mechanism [1]. In the original mimetic curvaton model, the parameter $\lambda$ was purely an algebraic multiplier, lack of any perturbed dynamics. In the current paper, we treat $\lambda$ as an auxiliary field, with its perturbation $\delta\lambda$ evolving alongside. We show that, with such a consideration, the adiabatic perturbation can still be generated from the curvaton mechanism, and becomes scale invariant with different field space configurations.</description>

      <title>Distinguish the EMRI and B-EMRI system by gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary stars are as frequency as single stars in the Universe, and at least 70\% of the massive stars located in our Galaxy belong to a binary system. For the first time we produce the gravitational waveforms for the extreme mass ratio inspiral systems (EMRIs) of binary stars moving around central supermassive black hole (SBH). We calculate the orbits of such systems via the Hamilton-Jacobi approach. To improve accuracy we adopt the quadrupole-octupole expression of gravitational wave (GW) and consider the contribution of radiation reaction. Compared to the waveforms of single star, double or multiple spikes emerge in the waveforms of binary stars. We calculate the mismatch of the EMRI waveforms of binary stars and those of single stars, and find the mismatch increases as the binary internal semi-latus rectum $\tilde{p}$ decreases. According to the distinguishable criterion of two signals, it's inferred that the two types of waveforms are distinguishable for small enough $\tilde{p}$. Further, we demonstrate that the most favourable position to distinguish the waveforms of EMRIs of single star from the waveforms of EMRIs of binary stars is that revolutions of the binary stars and the central SBH takes the same direction, i.e., the rotation axis of the binary is parallel to that of the central SBH.</description>

      <title>Does gravitational wave assist vacuum steering and Bell nonlocality?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study quantum steering and Bell nonlocality harvested by the local interaction of two Unruh-DeWitt detectors with the vacuum massless scalar field, both in the presence of gravitational waves and in Minkowski spacetime. It is shown that quantum steerability under the influence of gravitational waves can be greater than or less than quantum steerability in Minkowski spacetime, which means that the gravitational waves can amplify or degrade the harvested steering. In particular, a resonance effect occurs when the energy gap of the detector is tuned to the frequency of the gravitational wave. We also find that the harvesting-achievable separation range of vacuum steering can be expanded or reduced by the presence of gravitational waves, which depends on the energy gap, the gravitational wave frequency, and the duration of the gravitational wave action. It is interesting to note that two detector systems that satisfy the Bell inequality, regardless of the existence of gravitational waves, indicating that steering harvesting cannot be considered to be nonlocal.</description>

Abstract: The scattering problem of the gravitino wave in Schwarzschild spacetime is explored. We employ the perturbative method to calculate the differential scattering cross section in the long wavelength limit, and demonstrate that it satisfies the same rule of the spin dependance as those of the scalar, neutrino, electromagnetic waves.</description>

      <title>Structure growth in $f(Q)$ cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We take into account redshift-space distortion measurements to investigate the growth of cosmological large-scale structures within the framework of modified symmetric teleparallel $f(Q)$ gravity. After comparing the predictions of the $f(Q)$-gravity expansion history with OHD and SNIa datasets and constraining the pertinent cosmological parameters $\Omega_{m}$ and $H_0$, together with the exponent $n$ for $f(Q)$ power-law models, we derive the full system of equations governing linear cosmological perturbations to study matter fluctuations using the $1 + 3$ covariant formalism when applied to $f(Q)$ gravity. Thus, we resort to both the usual redshift-space distortion data $f\sigma_8$ and some recent separate measurements of the growth rate $f$ and the amplitude of matter fluctuations $\sigma_8$ from the VIPERS and SDSS collaborations to find the best-fit cosmological parameters $\Omega_m$, $\sigma_{8}$ and $n$. We also apply a collective analysis of such growth-structure data together with the aforementioned cosmic expansion measurements, to restrict these parameters through Monte Carlo Markov Chain simulations. determining the statistical significance for the best-fit parameter values through the AIC and BIC Bayesian selection criteria.</description>

      <title>New sources of ghost fields in $k$-essence theories for black-bounce solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present study, we generalize the possible ghost field configurations within the framework of $k$-essence theory to the Simpson-Visser metric area function $\Sigma^2=x^2+a^2$. Our analysis encompasses field configurations for the region-defined metric function $dA_\pm$ as well as the general solution that asymptotically behaves as Schwarzschild-de Sitter for $x\to-\infty$. Specifically, we investigate two scalar field configurations and define the associated potential for each one. Through rigorous calculations, we verify that all equations of motion are satisfied. Notably, our findings indicate that even when proposing new configurations of ghost scalar fields, the energy conditions remain unchanged. This result serves to validate the wormhole solutions obtained in previous studies.</description>

      <title>Complexity and Its Creation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Except for crystalline or random structures, an agreed definition of complexity for intermediate and hence interesting cases does not exist. We fill this gap with a notion of complexity that characterises shapes formed by any finite number of particles greater than or equal to the three needed to define triangle shapes. The resulting shape complexity is a simple scale-invariant quantity that measures the extent to which a collection of particles has a uniform or clustered distribution. As a positive-definite number with an absolute minimum realised on the most uniform distribution the particles can have, it not only characterises all physical structures from crystals to the most complex that can exist but also determines for them a measure that makes richly structured shapes more probable than bland ones. Strikingly, the criterion employed to define the shape complexity forces it to be the product of the two functions that define Newtonian universal gravitation. This suggests both the form and solutions the law of a universe of such particles should have and leads to a theory that not only determines the complexity and probability of any individual shape but also its creation from the maximally uniform shape. It does this moreover in a manner which makes it probable that the cosmological principle, according to which on a sufficiently large scale the universe should have the same appearance everywhere, holds. Our theory relies on universal group-theoretical principles that may allow generalisation to include all forces and general relativity.</description>

      <title>Extended Bose-Einstein condensate dark matter in $f(Q)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we attempt to explore the dark sector of the universe i.e. dark matter and dark energy, where the dark energy components are related to the modified $f(Q)$ Lagrangian, particularly a power law function $f(Q)= \gamma \left(\frac{Q}{Q_0}\right)^n$, while the dark matter component is described by the Extended Bose-Einstein Condensate (EBEC) equation of state for dark matter, specifically, $p = \alpha \rho + \beta \rho^2$. We find the corresponding Friedmann-like equations and the continuity equation for both dark components along with an interacting term, specifically $\mathcal{Q} = 3b^2H \rho$, which signifies the energy exchange between the dark sector of the universe. Further, we derive the analytical expression of the Hubble function, and then we find the best-fit values of free parameters utilizing the Bayesian analysis to estimate the posterior probability and the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling technique corresponding to CC+Pantheon+SH0ES samples. In addition, to examine the robustness of our MCMC analysis, we perform a statistical assessment using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). Further from the evolutionary profile of the deceleration parameter and the energy density, we obtain a transition from the decelerated epoch to the accelerated expansion phase, with the present deceleration parameter value as $q(z=0)=q_0=-0.56^{+0.04}_{-0.03}$ ($68 \%$ confidence limit), that is quite consistent with cosmological observations. In addition, we find the expected positive behavior of the effective energy density. Finally, by examining the sound speed parameter, we find that the assumed theoretical $f(Q)$ model is thermodynamically stable.</description>

      <title>Apparent and emergent dark matter around a Schwarzschild black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the two different dark matter frameworks that were studied recently: one that arises from the non-local effects of entanglement entropy as emergent gravity (characterized by the parameter $\xi(M)$, and zero-point scale length $l$), and one from dark energy viewed as a superconducting medium (characterized by $\eta(M)$, and screening length parameter $\lambda_{\rm G}$), two black hole solutions spherically surrounded with these dark matter models were derived. The effect of these two frameworks on SMBH was analyzed through the resulting deviations in the null regions and the black hole shadow. In addition, constraints to the parameters $\xi$ and $\eta$ (at $3\sigma$ level) were found using the available EHT data for Sgr. A* and M87*. These constraints allow one to deduce the effective mass $M$, which causes uncertainties in the measurement. On the other hand, if the effective mass is known, one can also deduce the constants associated with $\xi$, and $\eta$. The former framework also introduces an Appell function, a hypergeometric function of two variables that separately allows the analysis of macroscopic and (hypothetical) microscopic black holes. This first framework was found to decrease the radii of the null regions respective to the Schwarzschild counterpart. The shadow radius, however, behaves reversibly. The result of the numerical analysis for the latter framework revealed increased values for the photonsphere and shadow radii. Remarkably, the study also showed that for SMBHs, the amplifying effects of $\lambda_{\rm G}$ are stronger than the scale length $l$. Finally, results of constraints, as an example, for the upper bound in $\xi$ for M87* indicated that the effective mass causing the deviation was around $2.4\times 10^{20} M_{\odot}$ given that the observed Milgrom's constant is $5.4\times 10^{-10} \text{ m/s}^2$.</description>

      <title>Dynamical systems of modified Gauss-Bonnet gravity: cosmological implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive the field equations of modified Gauss-Bonnet gravity termed as $f(R,G)$ gravity for the non-flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) spacetime. We utilize the dynamical system approach to study the cosmic dynamics of two different class of $f(R,G)$ models composed of radiation and matter (cold dark matter and baryonic matter). The linear perturbations around the fixed points are studied to explore the corresponding stability of points. The cosmological implications are studied in $f(R,G)=f_0R^nG^{1-n}$ and $f(R,G)=f_0R^\alpha+f_1G^\beta$ models to identify the qualitative evolution of universe with the flat-FRW spacetime. The qualitative differences between the considered class of models are discussed in detail. The fixed points corresponding to the late-time accelerated and radiation phase of the universe will exist in the model but, the existence of fixed point corresponding to the matter dominated phase will depend on the functional form of $f(R,G)$. Furthermore, the autonomous systems are utilized to study the cosmographic parameters along with the statefinder diagnostic.</description>

      <title>The extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes: an exact charged scalar quasiresonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we present a novel exact scalar quasibound states solutions in the extremal Reissner-Norstr\"om black hole background. We start with the construction of the governing covariant relativistic scalar field equation, the Klein-Gordon equation in the extremal Reissner-Norstr\"om black hole background and applying the separation of variables anzat. The exact relativistic scalar wave's angular solution is found in terms of the spherical harmonics while the two independent radial wave solutions are, for the first time, exactly found and presented in terms of the double confluent Heun functions. The solutions are settled in the gravitational potential well and behave like an ingoing waves approaching black hole's horizon, vanishing when approaching infinity. The gravitationally bounded charged massive scalar fields are found to have quantized complex valued energy levels while imaginary energy levels are obtained for the charged massless scalar field, of both cases, indicating decaying states. Further investigation shows that the extreme Reissner-Nordst\"om black hole does not support scalar cloud. And with the help of the obtained exact radial solutions, the Hawking radiation of the extremal Reissner-Nordst\"om black hole is investigated and we find the zero temperature of the black hole's horizon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-known that gravitational waves (GWs) undergo no absorption or dissipation when traversing through a perfect fluid. However, in the presence of a viscous fluid, GWs transfer energy to the fluid medium. In this essay, we present a review of our recent series of results regarding the interaction between gravitational waves and surrounding matter. Additionally, we examine the impact of a viscous fluid shell on gravitational wave propagation, focusing particularly on GW damping and GW heating. Furthermore, we explore the significance of these effects in various astrophysical scenarios such as core-collapse Supernovae and primordial gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Stability of the Cosmological Dynamics of $O(D,D)$-complete Stringy Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The massless fields in the universal NS-NS sector of string theory form $O(D, D)$ multiplets of Double Field Theory, which is a theory that provides a T-duality covariant formulation of supergravity, leading to a stringy modification of General Relativity. In this framework, it is possible to write down the extensions of the Einstein field equations and the Friedmann equations in such a way that the coupling of gravitational and matter sectors is dictated by the $O(D, D)$ symmetry universally. In this paper, we obtain the autonomous form of the $O(D, D)$-complete Friedmann equations, find the critical points and perform their stability analysis. We also include the phase portraits of the system. Cosmologically interesting cases of scalar field, radiation, and matter are separately considered and compared with the Chameleon models in a similar setting. Accelerating phases and the conditions for their existence are also given for such cases.</description>

      <title>Primordial Gravitational Waves as Probe of Dark Matter in Interferometer Missions: Fisher Forecast and MCMC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose novel inflationary primordial gravitational wave (GW) spectral shapes at interferometer-based current and future GW missions to test dark matter (DM) production and baryogenesis via gravity-portal. We consider three right-handed neutrinos (RHNs), the lightest among them is DM candidate while the others participate in baryogenesis via leptogenesis. We find that future GW detectors BBO, DECIGO, ET, for instance, are able to probe DM mass for $5\times 10^6\, {\rm GeV}&lt;M_{\rm DM}&lt;1.6\times 10^7$ GeV with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) $&gt;10$, along with the observed amount of baryon asymmetry due to gravitational leptogenesis for heavy RHN mass $M_{\cal{N}}$ to be around $8\times 10^{12}$ GeV. Employing Fisher matrix forecast analysis, we identify the parameter space involving non-minimal coupling to gravity $\xi$, reheating temperature of the Universe $T_{\rm rh}$ and DM mass $M_{\rm DM}$ where the GW detector-sensitivities will be the maximum with the least error, along with SNR $&gt;10$. Finally, utilizing mock data for each GW detector, we perform MCMC analysis to find out the combined constraints on the various microphysics parameters. We also explore production of other cosmological relics such as QCD axion relic as DM candidate, produced via gravity-portal in early universe. We find that ET, for instance, can probe the decay constant of such DM candidates ($f_a$) as $10^9\,{\rm GeV}\lesssim f_a\lesssim 10^{14}\,{\rm GeV}$ for misalignment angle $\theta_i\in[0.1,\pi/\sqrt{3}]$ and $\xi=1$ with SNR $&gt;10$, whereas this range decreases with the increase of non-minimal coupling. Thus the upcoming GW missions will be able to test such non-thermal DM and baryogenesis scenarios involving very high energy scales, which is otherwise impossible to reach in particle physics experiments in laboratories.</description>

      <title>Scalar Field Dominated Cosmology with Woods-Saxon Like Potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark energy can be characterized by a canonical scalar field, known as quintessence. Quintessence allows for a dynamical equation of state $-1 \le \omega \le -\frac{1}{3}$. In this work, we consider a quintessence model with a specific potential of the Woods-Saxon form. The model is studied at late phase assuming flat cosmology, and the model parameters are constrained using Type Ia supernova data and Observational Hubble data. In particular we employ Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods for the Bayesian inference of these parameters. We obtain the value of the Hubble constant $H_0 = 68.10 \pm 0.74\,km s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}$ and the matter energy density parameter $\Omega_{m_0} = 0.31 \pm 0.01 $, which are consistent with the values obtained using base $\Lambda$CDM using the same dataset. Computation of the $\chi^2_{min}$, AIC and BIC reveal that this model is preffered according to AIC and $\chi^2_{min}$ criteria, while the $\Lambda$CDM is preferred according to BIC. We also show that this model can explain late-time accelerated expansion. Statefinder analysis reveals a Chaplygin gas behaviour in the past, in addition to the quintessence behaviour of the field.</description>

      <title>Black Hole-Neutron Star Binaries near Neutron Star Disruption Limit in the Mass Regime of Event GW230529</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In May 2023, the LIGO Livingston observatory detected the likely black hole-neutron star (BHNS) merger GW230529_181500. That event is expected to be the merger of a 2.5-4.5 $M_{\odot}$ primary with a secondary compact object of mass between 1.2-2.0 $M_{\odot}$. This makes it the first BHNS merger with a significant potential for the production of electromagnetic (EM) counterparts, and provides further evidence for compact objects existing within the suspected lower mass gap. To produce post-merger EM transients, the component of the black hole spin aligned with the orbital angular momentum must be sufficiently high, allowing the neutron star to be tidally disrupted. The disrupting BHNS binary may then eject a few percent of a solar mass of matter, leading to an observable kilonova driven by radioactive decays in ejecta, and/or a compact-binary GRB (cbGRB) resulting from the formation of an accretion disk and relativistic jet. Determining which mergers lead to disruption of the neutron star is necessary to predict the prevalence of EM signals from BHNS mergers, yet most BHNS simulations so far have been performed far from the minimum spin required for tidal disruption. Here, we use the Spectral Einstein Code (SpEC) to explore the behavior of BHNS mergers in a mass range consistent with GW230529_181500 close to that critical spin, and compare our results against the mass remnant model currently used by the LVK collaboration to predict the probability of tidal disruption. Our numerical results reveal the emergence of non-zero accretion disks even below the predicted NS disruption limit, of low mass but capable of powering cbGRBs. Our results also demonstrate that the remnant mass model underpredicts the disk mass for the DD2 EOS, while they are within expected modeling errors for SFHo. In all of our simulations, any kilonova signal would be dim and dominated by post-merger disk outflows.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Entropy, Phase Transition, and Island Rule for Reissner-Nordstr\"om-AdS Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study focuses on the examination of the island rule within the context of four-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\"om-AdS (4D RN-AdS) black hole, illuminating the intricate relationship between the entanglement entropy and phase transitions of black holes. The entanglement entropy of 4D RN-AdS black holes follow the anticipated linear growth pattern before ultimately declining to a constant value, in accordance with the well-established Page curve. The novelty of this study lies in the examination of the influence, previously unexplored, of the first-order phase transition on the shape and evolution of the Page curve in situations involving both eternal and evaporating black holes. Despite the morphological alterations of the curve induced by the transition, the inherent unitarity of the system persists. As the evaporation progresses, the Page curve displays diverse configurations, unveiling phenomena that are novel and defy traditional expectations, thereby enriching our comprehension of the thermodynamics of black holes interlinked with quantum information.</description>

      <title>Regularized-Renormalized-Resummed loop corrected power spectrum of non-singular bounce with Primordial Black Hole formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a complete and consistent exposition of the regularization, renormalization, and resummation procedures in the setup of having a contraction and then non-singular bounce followed by inflation with a sharp transition from slow-roll (SR) to ultra-slow roll (USR) phase for generating primordial black holes (PBHs). We consider following an effective field theory (EFT) approach and study the quantum loop corrections to the power spectrum from each phase. We demonstrate the complete removal of quadratic UV divergences after renormalization and softened logarithmic IR divergences after resummation and illustrate the scheme-independent nature of our renormalization approach. We further show that the addition of a contracting and bouncing phase allows us to successfully generate PBHs of solar-mass order, $M_{\rm PBH}\sim {\cal O}(M_{\odot})$, by achieving the minimum e-folds during inflation to be $\Delta N_{\rm Total}\sim {\cal O}(60)$ and in this process successfully evading the strict no-go theorem. We notice that varying the effective sound speed between $0.88\leq c_{s}\leq 1$, allows the peak spectrum amplitude to lie within $10^{-3}\leq A \leq 10^{-2}$, indicating that causality and unitarity remain protected in the theory. We analyse PBHs in the extremely small, $M_{\rm PBH}\sim {\cal O}(10^{-33}-10^{-27})M_{\odot}$, and the large, $M_{\rm PBH}\sim {\cal O}(10^{-6}-10^{-1})M_{\odot}$, mass limits and confront the PBH abundance results with the latest microlensing constraints. We also study the cosmological beta functions across all phases and find their interpretation consistent in the context of bouncing and inflationary scenarios while satisfying the pivot scale normalization requirement. Further, we estimate the spectral distortion effects and shed light on controlling PBH overproduction.</description>

      <title>General Relativistic magneto-hydrodynamical simulations of accretion flows through traversable wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first dynamical model of plasma accretion onto traversable wormholes by performing General Relativistic magneto-hydrodynamical (GRMHD) simulations of the flow on both sides of the wormhole. We evolve the ideal MHD equations on a wormhole spacetime described by the spherically symmetric Simpson--Visser metric. The disk is initialized on one side of the wormhole and accretes onto the throat driven by the magneto-rotational instability (MRI). We show that the inflowing plasma quickly settles in the throat and forms a hot, rotating cloud. The wormhole cloud acts as an engine in which gas coming from one side accumulates at the center, dissipates energy, and powers a mildly relativistic thermal wind toward the other side. Our novel predictions show that accreting wormholes behave very differently from black holes (BHs) in astrophysical environments. In particular, one mouth presents outflows without accretion signatures, contradicting the jet-disk symbiotic relation that holds for black holes.</description>

      <title>Hubble tension tomography: BAO vs SnIa distance tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the redshift dependence of the Hubble tension by comparing the luminosity distances obtained using an up-to-date BAO dataset (including the latest DESI data) calibrated with the CMB-inferred sound horizon, and the Pantheon+ SnIa distances calibrated with Cepheids. Using a redshift tomography method, we find: 1) The BAO-inferred distances are discrepant with the Pantheon+ SnIa distances across all redshift bins considered, with the discrepancy level varying with redshift. 2) The distance discrepancy is more pronounced at lower redshifts ($z \in [0.1,0.8]$) compared to higher redshifts ($z\in [0.8,2.3]$). The consistency of \lcdm best fit parameters obtained in high and low redshift bins of both BAO and SnIa samples is investigated and we confirm that the tension reduces at high redshifts. Also a mild tension between the redshift bins is identified at higher redshifts for both the BAO and Pantheon+ data with respect to the best fit value of $H_0$ in agreement with previous studies which find hints for an 'evolution' of $H_0$ in the context of $\Lambda$CDM. These results confirm that the low redshift BAO and SnIa distances can only become consistent through a re-evaluation of the distance calibration methods. An $H(z)$ expansion rate deformation alone is insufficient to resolve the tension. Our findings also hint at a possible deviation of the expansion rate from the Planck18/$\Lambda$CDM model at high redshifts $z\gtrsim 2$. We show that such a deformation is well described by a high redshift transition of $H(z)$ like the one expressed by $\Lambda_s$CDM even though this alone cannot fully resolve the Hubble tension due to its tension with intermediate/low $z$ BAO data.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Bell Tests with Decoherence Effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inflationary universe creates particle pairs, which are entangled in their momenta due to momentum conservation. Operators involving the momenta of the fluctuations can be rewritten into pseudo-spin operators, such as the Gour-Khanna-Mann-Revzen (GKMR) pseudo-spin. Making use of these pseudo-spin operators, cosmological Bell inequalities can be formulated. The violation of these Bell inequalities indicates the quantum nature of primordial fluctuations.
  In this work, we focus on primordial curvature perturbations. Since curvature perturbations arise from gravity, their action includes the Gibbons-Hawking-York boundary term. We clarify the role of the boundary term in selecting suitable initial conditions for linear perturbations.
  After that, we proceed to the interactions of cosmological perturbations, including the bulk and boundary interaction terms, which introduce decoherence effects. These decoherence effects change the expectation value of the Bell operator, and gradually restore the Bell inequality. We describe this process by a ``Bell test curve'', which offers a window for testing the quantum origin of cosmological perturbations. We also explore the possibility of extracting the information of the decoherence rate and the structure of primordial interactions from the Bell test curve.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a cosmological test of Cotton gravity, which describes gravity by cotton tensor. The model we consider allows for the same background evolution as the $\Lambda$CDM model. We derive the cosmological perturbation theory of the scalar mode at the linear level, where the difference from the $\Lambda$CDM model is characterized by the parameter $\beta$. We incorporate Cotton gravity with a neutrino model and perform a Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) analysis using data from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The analysis constrains parameter $\beta=-0.00008^{+0.00080}_{-0.00104}$ at the 1-$\sigma$ confidence level. We conclude that currently, there is no obvious deviation between Cotton gravity and the $\Lambda$CDM model in the linear cosmological perturbation level for observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Harada proposed a modified theory of gravity called Cotton gravity, and argued that it successfully explains the rotation curves of $84$ galaxies without the need of dark matter. In this work we use galaxy-galaxy lensing technique to test whether the modification effect of Cotton gravity can indeed be a viable substitute for dark matter. Using the spherically symmetric solution of Cotton gravity, we obtain the deflection angle via Gauss-Bonnet theorem and the weak lensing shear. We use five galaxy catalogs divided in 5 stellar mass bins from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 (SDSS DR7), each of which is further divided into blue star forming galaxy and red passive galaxy sub-catalogs. We find that Cotton gravity on its own has significant deviation from the measured galaxy-galaxy lensing signals, thus it cannot replace the role of dark matter. If we consider the combination of dark matter and Cotton gravity, the modification is tightly constrained. Our analysis also applies to other modified gravity theories whose an additional linear term appears in the Schwarzschild solution.</description>

Abstract: We recently introduced a particular nonlinear generalization of quantum mechanics which has the property that it is exactly solvable in terms of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian of the usual linear quantum mechanics problem. In this paper we suggest that the two components of the wave function represent the system described by the Hamiltonian H in two different asymptotic regions of spacetime and we show that the non-linear terms can be viewed as giving rise to gravitational effects.</description>

Abstract: Classical and quantum mechanical descriptions of motion are fundamentally different. The universality of free fall (UFF) is a distinguishing feature of the classical motion (which has been verified with astonishing precision), while quantum theory tell us only about probabilities and uncertainties thus breaking the UFF. There are strong reasons to believe that the classical description must emerge, under plausible hypothesis, from quantum mechanics. In this Essay we show that the UFF is an emergent phenomenon: the coarse-grained quantum distribution for high energy levels leads to the classical distribution as the lowest order plus quantum corrections. We estimate the size of these corrections on the E\"otv\"os parameter and discuss the physical implications.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamical topology with multiple defect curves for dyonic AdS black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dyonic black holes with quasitopological electromagnetism exhibit an intriguing phase diagram with two separated first-order coexistence curves. In this paper, we aim to uncover its influence on the black hole thermodynamical topology. At first, we investigate the phase transition and phase diagram of the dyonic black holes. Comparing with previous study that there is no black hole phase transition region for a middle pressure, we find this region can narrow or disappear by fine tuning the coupling parameter. Instead, two first-order phase transitions can be observed. Importantly, we uncover that such novel phase diagram shall lead to a multiple defect curve phenomenon in black hole topology where each dyonic black hole is treated as one defect in the thermodynamical parameter space. By examining the topology, it is shown that there could be one, three, or five black hole states for given pressure and temperature. For each case, the topological number is calculated. Our results show that the topological number always takes value of +1, keeping unchanged even when the multiple defect curves appear. Therefore, our study provides an important ingredient on understanding the black hole thermodynamical topology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fulling-Davies-Unruh effect contains great amount of theoretical importance in various branches of physics. Requirement of very high acceleration hinders its experimental evidence. We propose a novel model to capture this effect experimentally through measuring the Pancharatnam-Berry phase (PBP) of the accelerated quantum system. We find that allowing the qubit's motion along one of the parallel directions of two parallel mirrors and by keeping it in between them, PBP can be greatly enhanced. Our investigation shows that for the current measurable PBP ($\sim 10^{-6}$ rad), energy gap $\sim1$ GHz of the qubit, distance between two mirrors $L\sim150$ (or $300)\,m$ and detector's position $z_0 \sim3.3\,m$ the required acceleration of the qubit can be as low as $a\sim 10^9~ m/s^2$. This value is potentially very achievable within the current technology and thereby providing a very close to realistic model for experimentally verify the aforesaid quantum phenomenon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-evolution of the Universe as described by the Friedmann equation can be coupled to equations of motion of matter fields. Quantum effects may be incorporated to improve these classical equations of motion by the renormalization group (RG) running of their couplings. Since temporal and thermal evolutions are linked to each other, astrophysical and cosmological treatements based on zero-temperature RG methods require the extension to finite-temperatures. We propose and explore a modification of the usual finite-temperature RG approach by relating the temperature parameter to the running RG scale as $T \equiv k_T = \tau k$ (in natural units), where $k_T$ is acting as a running cutoff for thermal fluctuations and the momentum $k$ can be used for the quantum fluctuations. In this approach, the temperature of the expanding Universe is related to the dimensionless quantity $\tau$ (and not to $k_T$). We show that by this choice dimensionless RG flow equations have no explicit $k$-dependence, as it is convenient. We also discuss how this modified thermal RG is used to handle high-energy divergences of the RG running of the cosmological constant and to "solve the triviality" of the $\phi^4$ model by a thermal phase transition in terms of $\tau$ in $d=4$ Euclidean dimensions.</description>

Abstract: With the advent of future-generation interferometers a huge number of Gravitational Wave (GW) signals is expected to be measured without an electromagnetic counterpart. Although these signals do not allow a simultaneous measurement of the redshift and the luminosity distance, it is still possible to infer cosmological parameters. In this paper, we focus on the systematic biases that could arise from mismodeling the GW host probability when inferring the Hubble constant ($H_0$) with GW dark sirens jointly with galaxy catalogues. We discuss the case in which the GW host probability is a function of galaxies' luminosity and redshift as it has been predicted by state-of-the-art compact binary coalescences (CBCs) synthetic catalogues. We show that, in the limiting case in which the analysis is done with a complete galaxy catalog covering a footprint of $\sim 10~\rm {deg}^2$, mismatching the host probability in terms of galaxy's luminosity will introduce a bias on $H_0$. In this case, the magnitude of the bias will depend on the distribution of the Large-Scale Structure over the line-of-sight. Instead, in the limit of a complete wide-field of view galaxy catalog and GW events localized at O$({\rm Gpc})$ distance, mismatching the redshift dependence of the GW hosting probability is more likely to introduce a systematic bias.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.06006v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article aims at clarifying the situation about astrophysical sources that might be observed with haloscope experiments sensitive to gravitational waves in the 1-10 GHz band. The GrAHal setup is taken as a benchmark. We follow a very pedagogical path so that the full analysis can easily be used by the entire community who might not be familiar with the theoretical framework. Different relevant physical regimes are considered in details and some formulas encountered in the literature are revised. In particular, we carefully take into account the fast drift of the gravitational wave frequency and the relevant experimental timescales. We also relax the usual assumption that only the merging phase should be considered. The distances that can be probed and expected event rates are carefully evaluated, taking into account degeneracies between physical parameters. We show where experimental efforts should be focused to improve the sensitivity and we conclude that any detection in the near future is extremely unlikely.</description>

      <title>Angular spectrum of quantum fluctuations in causal structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.06563v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scaling arguments are used to constrain the angular spectrum of distortions on boundaries of macroscopic causal diamonds, produced by Planck-scale vacuum fluctuations of causally-coherent quantum gravity. The small-angle spectrum of displacement is derived from a form of scale invariance: the variance and fluctuation rate of distortions normal to the surface of a causal diamond of radius $R$ at transverse physical separation $c\tau\ll R$ should depend only on $\tau$, with a normalization set by the Planck time $t_P$, and should not depend on $R$. For measurements on scale $R$, the principle leads to universal scaling for variance on angular scale $\Theta$, $\langle\delta\tau^2\rangle_\Theta\simeq\tau\:\!t_p\sim\Theta R\:\!t_P/c$, and angular power spectrum $C_\ell\sim (R\:\!l_P)/\ell^3$ at $\ell\gg1$. This spectrum is consistent with a relational model of holographic noise based on causally coherent virtual null gravitational shocks, a general picture conjectured for all $\ell$. The high $\ell$ scaling is contrasted with that predicted in some other quantum models, which differ by one power of angular wavenumber $\ell$ and are shown to predict excessive blurring of images from distant sources.</description>

Abstract: We consider the Dirac equations in static spherically-symmetric space-times, and we present a type of spinor field whose structure allows the separation of elevation angle and radial coordinate in very general situations. We demonstrate that after such a separation of variables the Dirac equations reduce to two equations that can always be integrated, at least in principle. To prove that ours is a fully-working method, we find an explicit exact solution in the special case of the de Sitter universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.17847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-accuracy gravitational-wave modeling demands going beyond linear, first-order perturbation theory. Particularly motivated by the need for second-order perturbative models of extreme-mass-ratio inspirals and black hole ringdowns, we present practical spherical-harmonic decompositions of the Einstein equation, Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli equations, and Teukolsky equation at second perturbative order in a Schwarzschild background. Our formulations are covariant on the $t$--$r$ plane and on the two-sphere, and we express the field equations in terms of gauge-invariant metric perturbations. In a companion Mathematica package, PerturbationEquations, we provide these invariant formulas as well as the analogous formulas in terms of raw, gauge-dependent metric perturbations. Our decomposition of the second-order Einstein equation, when specialized to the Lorenz gauge, was a key ingredient in recent second-order self-force calculations [Phys. Rev. Lett. 124, 021101 (2020); ibid. 127, 151102 (2021); ibid. 130, 241402 (2023)].</description>

Abstract: We study the excitation of a one-electron quantum cyclotron by gravitational waves. The electron in such as a penning trap is prepared to be at the lowest Landau level, which has an infinite degeneracy parameterized by the size of the wave function. We find that the excitation rate from the ground state to the first excited state is enhanced by the size of the electron wave function: an electron with a larger wave function feels gravitational waves more. As a consequence, we derive a good sensitivity to gravitational waves at a macroscopic one-electron quantum cyclotron.</description>

Abstract: Recently, Cardoso et al. constructed an exact solution of Einstein's equations that describes a supermassive black hole immersed into a dark matter halo. In this work use a solution-generating technique, which is a direct generalization of some of the Ehlers-Harrison transformation in the Ehlers formalism in order to construct in an exact analytical form the charged version of the Cardoso et al. solution. We describe some of its physical properties and, finally, we also present its magnetized version.</description>

      <title>Eccentricity-induced systematic error on parametrized tests of general relativity: Hierarchical Bayesian inference applied to a binary black hole population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One approach to testing general relativity (GR) introduces free parameters in the post-Newtonian (PN) expansion of the gravitational-wave (GW) phase. If systematic errors on these testing GR (TGR) parameters exceed the statistical errors, this may signal a false violation of GR. Here, we consider systematic errors produced by unmodeled binary eccentricity. Since the eccentricity of GW events in ground-based detectors is expected to be small or negligible, the use of quasicircular waveform models for testing GR may be safe when analyzing a small number of events. However, as the catalog size of GW detections increases, more stringent bounds on GR deviations can be placed by combining information from multiple events. In that case, even small systematic biases may become significant. We apply the approach of hierarchical Bayesian inference to model the posterior probability distributions of the TGR parameters inferred from a population of eccentric binary black holes (BBHs). We assume each TGR parameter value varies across the BBH population according to a Gaussian distribution. We compute the posterior distributions for these Gaussian hyperparameters. This is done for LIGO and Cosmic Explorer (CE). We find that systematic biases from unmodeled eccentricity can signal false GR violations for both detectors when considering constraints set by a catalog of events. We also compute the projected bounds on the $10$ TGR parameters when eccentricity is included as a parameter in the waveform model. We find that the first four dimensionless TGR deformation parameters can be bounded at $90\%$ confidence to $\delta \hat{\varphi}_i \lesssim 10^{-2}$ for LIGO and $\lesssim 10^{-3}$ for CE [where $i=(0,1,2,3)$]. In comparison to the circular orbit case, the combined bounds on the TGR parameters worsen by a modest factor of $\lesssim 2$ when eccentricity is included in the waveform.</description>

Abstract: In this work we analyze the motion of charged particles in the background of the Kiselev geometry, which is considered here as an exact solution in the context of power-Maxwell electrodynamics. As it is well known, one can use either an electric ansatz or a magnetic one for the nonlinear electromagnetic field. We study the motion of an electrically charged particle for an electrically charged black hole and also for a magnetically charged black hole. In the second case the motion is restricted to Poincar\'e cones of various angles, as expected.</description>

Abstract: With the method of the background field expansion, we investigate the one-loop quantization of the Euclidean nonlocal $f(R)$ model in the de-Sitter universe. We obtain the ghost-free condition (GFC) based on the transformation from the Jordan frame to the Einstein frame and the classical stability condition (CSC) satisfied $f^{(0)}_{RR}-\phi_0F^{(0)}_{RR}&lt;0$. We present the on-shell and off-shell one-loop effective action and quantum stability condition (QSC) by utilizing the generalized zeta-function. We find that under the fulfillment of GFC, CSC and QSC are inconsistent.</description>

Abstract: Extreme-mass-ratio inspirals consist of binary systems of compact objects, with orders of magnitude differences in their masses, in the regime where the dynamics are driven by gravitational wave emission. The unique nature of extreme-mass-ratio inspirals facilitates the exploration of diverse and stimulating tests related to various aspects of black holes and General Relativity. These tests encompass investigations into the spacetime geometry, the dissipation of the binary system energy and angular momentum, and the impact of the intrinsic non-linear effects of the gravitational interaction. This review accounts for the manifold opportunities for testing General Relativity, ranging from examinations of black hole properties to cosmological and multimessenger tests.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16126v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores the cosmological constant problem and modified uncertainty principle within a unified framework inspired by a void-dominated scenario. In a recent paper~\cite{Yusofi:2022hgg}, voids were modeled as spherical bubbles of similar average sizes, and the surface energy on the voids' borders was calculated across various scales in a heuristic manner. We show that this results in a significant discrepancy of approximately $\mathcal{O}(+122)$ between the cosmological constant values from the minimum to the maximum radii of bubbles. Furthermore, when considering the generalized form of the uncertainty principle with both minimum and maximum lengths, i.e. $\Delta X \Delta P \geq \frac{\hbar}{2} \frac{1}{1- \beta \Delta P^2} \frac{1}{1- \alpha \Delta X^2}$, a similar order of discrepancy is observed between $\alpha_{\rm max}$ and $\alpha_{\rm min}$, indicating that $\alpha\propto\beta^{-1}\propto\Lambda\propto{\rm length}^{-2}~(m^{-2})$. As a primary outcome of this finding, we offer a novel uncertainty principle that incorporates a non-zero cosmological constant.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we offer the dynamical system analysis of the DBI (Dirac-Born-Infeld) scalar field in a modified $f(Q)$ gravity context. We have taken a polynomial form of modified gravity and used two different kinds of scalar potential, i.e., polynomial and exponential, and found a closed autonomous dynamical system of equations. We have analyzed the fixed points of such a system and commented on the conditions under which deceleration to late-time acceleration happens in this model. We have noted the similarity of the two models and have also shown that our result is indeed consistent with the previous work done on Einstein's gravity. We have also investigated the phenomenological implications of our models by plotting the EoS ($\omega$), Energy density ($\Omega$), and deceleration parameter ($q$) w.r.t. to e-fold time and comparing with the present value. Finally, we conclude the paper by observing how the dynamical system analysis differs in modified $f(Q)$ gravity, and we also provide some of the future scope of our work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15327v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a formalism to study linear perturbations of bimetric gravity on any spherically symmetric background, including dynamical spacetimes. The setup is based on the Gerlach-Sengupta formalism for general relativity. Each of the two background metrics is written as a warped product between a two-dimensional Lorentzian metric and the round metric of the two-sphere. The different perturbations are then decomposed in terms of tensor spherical harmonics, which makes the two polarity (axial and polar) sectors decouple. In addition, a covariant notation on the Lorentzian manifold is used so that all expressions are valid for any coordinates. In this theory, there are seven physical propagating degrees of freedom, which, as compared to the two degrees of freedom of general relativity, makes the dynamics much more intricate. In particular, we discuss the amount of gauge and physical degrees of freedom for different polarities and multipoles. Finally, as an interesting application, we analyze static nonbidiagonal backgrounds and derive the corresponding perturbative equations.</description>

      <title>Time Delay of Light in the Gravitational lensing of Supermassive Black Holes in Dark Matter Halos</title>

Abstract: The dark matter halo has non-negligible effects on the gravitational lensing of supermassive black hole in the galaxy center. Our work presents a study on the time-delay of light in gravitational lensing of black holes enclosed by dark matter halos. To provide a precise description on the distribution of dark matter in galaxies, we choose several famous phenomenological dark matter halo models in astrophysics, including the NFW, Beta, Burkert and Moore models, to carry out the present study. Through numerically calculating the time-delay of light in gravitational lensing, a comparative analysis of the dark matter effects within different halo models has been performed. Assuming typical length scales associated with the galactic gravitational lensing, numerical results indicate that the NFW, Beta, Burkert and Moore dark matter halos can significantly enhance the time delay of light in gravitational lenisng of central supermassive black holes. The enhancing effect becomes more pronounced with a small dark matter halo scale and an increasing dark matter halo mass.

Abstract: We study the evolution of Bianchi-I space-times within the framework of the Horndeski theory with $G_5=\text{const}/X$. The space-times are filled a global unidirectional electromagnetic field interacting with a scalar field. We consider the minimal interaction and the non-minimal interaction by the law $f^2(\phi)F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}$. The Horndeski theory allows anisotropy to grow over time, so the question arises of regulating the anisotropic level in this theory. Using the designer method, we build models in which the anisotropic level tends to a small value as the Universe expands. One of the results is a model with a anisotropic bounce.</description>

      <title>Influence of primary hair and plasma on intensity distribution of black hole shadows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16743v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the influence of primary hair ($l$) on the shadows of hairy Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes obtained through gravitational decoupling. In the context of hairy Schwarzschild black holes, $l$ either has no effect or consistently enlarges the photon sphere radius. Notably, even when it violates the strong energy condition, it can decrease the radius. For Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes, an additional matter field consistently expands the photon sphere radius, potentially reaching $3M$, akin to the pure Schwarzschild case. Remarkably, we demonstrate that black holes can exist even when overcharged ($Q^2 &gt; M^2$), casting shadows. Specific intensity calculations reveal $l$ consistently reduces it in both scenarios. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of pressureless plasma, finding $l$ exerts a stronger influence on visible size than plasma. These results can help in our understanding of theoretical models of black hole shadows and can be tested by comparison with the images obtained by EHT collaboration.</description>

      <title>Spherical orbits around Kerr-Newman and Ghosh black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17277v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We conduct a comprehensive study on spherical orbits around two types of black holes: Kerr-Newman black holes, which are charged, and Ghosh black holes, which are nonsingular. In this work, we consider both null and timelike cases of orbits. Utilizing the Mino formalism, all analytical solutions for the geodesics governing these orbits can be obtained. It turns out that all spherical photon orbits outside the black hole horizons are unstable. In the extremal cases of both models, we obtain the {\it photon boomerangs}. The existence of charge in the Kerr-Newman allows the orbits to transition between retrograde and prograde motions, and its increase tends to force the orbits to be more equatorial. On the other hand, the Ghosh black hole, characterized by a regular core and a lack of horizons in certain conditions, presents the possibility of observable stable spherical orbits in the so-called {\it no-horizon} condition. As the Ghosh parameter $k$ increases, trajectories tend to exhibit larger latitudinal oscillation amplitudes. We observe that as the Ghosh parameter $k$ increases the trajectories tend to have larger latitudinal oscillation amplitudes. Finally, we investigate the existence of {\it innermost stable spherical orbits} (ISSOs). Both black holes demonstrate the appearance of two branches of ISSO radii as a function of the Carter constant C. However, there are notable differences in their behavior: in the case of the Kerr-Newman black hole, the branches merge at a critical value, beyond which no ISSO exists, while for the Ghosh black hole, the transcendental nature of the metric function causes the branches to become complex at some finite distance.</description>

      <title>An emergent cosmological model from running Newton constant</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an emergent cosmological model rooted in the Asymptotically Safe antiscreening behavior of the Newton constant at Planckian energies. Distinguishing itself from prior approaches, our model encapsulates the variable nature of $G$ through a multiplicative coupling within the matter Lagrangian, characterized by a conserved energy-momentum tensor. The universe emerges from a quasi-de Sitter phase, transitioning to standard cosmological evolution post-Planck Era. Our analysis demonstrates the feasibility of constraining the transition scale to nearly classical cosmology using Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data and the potential to empirically probe the antiscreening trait of Newton's constant, as predicted by Asymptotic Safety.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05370v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational decoupling allows to obtain new solutions of general relativity. In this paper, we obtain new solutions of the Einstein field equations which describe non-singular black holes. We consider Hayward and Bardeen regular black holes as seed spacetimes and apply gravitational decoupling to obtain a new non-singular solution. We show that anisotropic energy-momentum tensor can spoil the regularity condition in the centre of a black hole. We solve the Einstein field equation and obtain new solutions that possess a de Sitter core and have Schwarzschild behaviour in infinity. We also analyse the thermodynamic properties of the obtained solutions.</description>

Abstract: Recently, Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) reported a signal at nanohertz frequencies consistent with a stochastic gravitational wave background. Here, I show that the Brownian motion of the Sun as a result of its random gravitational interactions with the cluster of thousands of unmodeled Main-belt asteroids of diameters &lt;80km, not included in the Solar system ephemeris, introduces correlated timing noise for pulsars with the magnitude and frequencies of the reported signal.</description>

      <title>Emergent spacetime from purely random structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.00963v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the fundamental question whether a random discrete structure with the minimal number of restrictions can converge to continuous metric space. We study the geometrical properties such as the dimensionality and the curvature emerging out of the connectivity properties of uniform random graphs. In addition we introduce a simple evolution mechanism for the graph by removing one edge per a fundamental quantum of time from an initially complete graph. We show an exponential growth of the radius of the graph, that ends up in a random structure with emergent average spatial dimension $D=3$ and zero curvature $K=0$, resembling a flat 3D manifold, that could describe the observed space in our universe and some of its geometrical properties. In addition, we introduce a generalized action for graphs based on physical quantities on different subgraph structures that helps to recover the well known properties of spacetime as described in general relativity, like time dilation due to gravity. Also, we show how various quantum mechanical concepts such as generalized uncertainty principles based on the statistical fluctuations can emerge from random discrete models. Moreover, our approach leads to a unification of space and matter-energy, for which we propose a mass-energy-space equivalence that leads to a way to transform between empty space and matter-energy via the cosmological constant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.06857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent observations indicate a $4.9\sigma$ tension between the CMB and quasar dipoles. This tension challenges the cosmological principle. We propose that if we live in a gigaparsec scale void, the CMB and quasar dipolar tension can be reconciled. This is because we are unlikely to live at the center of the void. And a 19% offset from the center will impact the quasars and CMB differently in their dipolar anisotropies. As we consider a large and thick void, our setup can also ease the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Holography and Localization of Information in Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.08753v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within the AdS/CFT correspondence, we identify a class of CFT operators which represent diff-invariant and approximately local observables in the gravitational dual. Provided that the bulk state breaks all asymptotic symmetries, we show that these operators commute to all orders in $1/N$ with asymptotic charges, thus resolving an apparent tension between locality in perturbative quantum gravity and the gravitational Gauss law. The interpretation of these observables is that they are not gravitationally dressed with respect to the boundary, but instead to features of the state. We also provide evidence that there are bulk observables whose commutator vanishes to all orders in $1/N$ with the entire algebra of single-trace operators defined in a space-like separated time-band. This implies that in a large $N$ holographic CFT, the algebra generated by single-trace operators in a short-enough time-band has a non-trivial commutant when acting on states which break the symmetries. It also implies that information deep in the interior of the bulk is invisible to single-trace correlators in the time-band and hence that it is possible to localize information in perturbative quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Isospin Equilibration in Neutron Star Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.06180v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the isospin equilibration properties of neutrinoless nuclear ($npe$) matter in the temperature and density range that is relevant to neutron star mergers. Our analysis incorporates neutrino-transparency corrections to the isospin (``beta'') equilibrium condition which become noticeable at $T\gtrsim 1\,$MeV. We find that the isospin relaxation rate rises rapidly as temperature rises, and at $T\approx 5\,$MeV it is comparable to the timescale of the density oscillations that occur immediately after the merger. This produces a resonant peak in the bulk viscosity at $T\approx 5\,$MeV, which causes density oscillations to be damped on the timescale of the merger. Our calculations suggest that isospin relaxation dynamics may also be relevant when neutrinos are treated more accurately via neutrino transport schemes.</description>

      <title>Probing wave-optics effects and low-mass dark matter halos with lensing of gravitational waves from massive black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06990v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will detect gravitational waves (GWs) emitted by massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) in the low-frequency ($\sim$mHz) band. Low-mass lenses, such as low-mass dark matter halos or subhalos, have sizes comparable to the wavelength of these GWs. Encounters with these lenses produce wave-optics (WO) effects that alter waveform phase and amplitude. Thus, a single event with observable WO effects can be used to probe the lens properties. In this paper, we first compute the probability of observing WO effects in a model-agnostic way. We perform information-matrix analyses over approximately 1000 MBHBs with total mass, mass ratio, and redshift spanning the ranges relevant to LISA. We then calculate lensing rates using three semi-analytical models of MBHB populations. In both cases, we use a waveform model that includes merger, ringdown, and higher-order modes. We use two lens population models: the theory-based Press-Schechter halo mass function and an observation-based model derived from Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We find that the probability of detecting WO effects can be as large as $\sim 3\%$, $\sim1.5\%$, and $\sim 1 \%$ at $1\sigma$, $3\sigma$, and $5\sigma$ confidence levels, respectively. The most optimistic MBHB population model yields $\sim 8$, $\sim 4$, and $\sim 3$ events with detectable WO effects at the same confidence levels, while the rates drop to $\sim 0.01$ in the more pessimistic scenarios. The most likely lens masses probed by LISA are in the range $(10^3, 10^8)\, M_{\odot}$, and the most probable redshifts are in the range $(0.3, 1.7)$. Therefore, LISA observations of WO effects can probe low-mass DM halos, complementing strong lensing and other observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13006v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study delves into the validity of quantum mechanical operators in the context of quantum gravity, recognizing the potential need for their generalization. A primary objective is to investigate the repercussions of these generalizations on the inherent non-locality within quantum mechanics, as exemplified by Bell's inequality. Additionally, the study scrutinizes the consequences of introducing a non-zero minimal length into the established framework of Bell's inequality. The findings contribute significantly to our theoretical comprehension of the intricate interplay between quantum mechanics and gravity. Moreover, this research explores the impact of quantum gravity on Bell's inequality and its practical applications within quantum technologies, notably in the realms of device-independent protocols, quantum key distribution, and quantum randomness generation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Thorne-\.{Z}ytkow object can be formed when a neutron star is absorbed by the envelope of its giant companion star, spirals toward the center of the giant star due to the drag from the surrounding envelope, and merges with the star's core. During in-spiral, dynamical friction is the main drag force acting on a neutron star inside the star envelope. However, dynamical friction is caused by the neutron star's gravitational interaction with its own gravitationally induced wake. Therefore, exactly the same gravitational drag force will act on a mirror neutron star, and if a significant part of the dark matter is in the form of mirror matter, then we expect the formation of Thorne-\.{Z}ytkow objects with a mirror neutron star inside. We explore the plausibility of the existence of such exotic Thorne-\.{Z}ytkow objects.</description>

Abstract: This work compares cosmological matching conditions used in approximating generic pre-inflationary phases of the universe. We show that the joining conditions for primordial scalar perturbations assumed by Contaldi et al. are inconsistent with the physically motivated Israel junction conditions, however; performing general relativistic matching with the aforementioned constraints results in unrealistic primordial power spectra. Eliminating the need for ambiguous matching, we look at an alternative semi-analytic model for producing the primordial power spectrum allowing for finite duration cosmological phase transitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16230v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate a model for quantum gravity based on the local Lorentz symmetry and general coordinate invariance. A key idea is the irreversible vierbein postulate that a tree-level action for the model at a certain energy scale does not contain an inverse vierbein. Under this postulate, only the spinor becomes a dynamical field, and no gravitational background field is introduced in the tree-level action. In this paper, after explaining the transformation rules of the local Lorentz and general-coordinate transformations in detail, a tree-level action is defined. We show that fermionic fluctuations can induce a nonvanishing gravitational background field.</description>

      <title>Setting the connection free in the Galilei and Carroll expansions of gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13924v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain a Palatini-type formulation for the Galilei and Carroll expansions of general relativity, where the connection is promoted to a variable. Known versions of these large and small speed of light expansions are derived from the Einstein-Hilbert action and involve dynamical Newton-Cartan or Carroll geometry, along with additional gauge fields at subleading orders. The corresponding Palatini actions that we obtain in this paper are derived from an appropriate expansion of the Einstein-Palatini action, and the connection variable reduces to the Galilei- or Carroll-adapted connection on shell. In particular, we present the Palatini form for the next-to-leading order Galilean action and recover the known equations of motion. We also compute the leading-order Palatini-type action for the Carrollian case and show that, while it depends on the connection variable, it reduces on shell to the known action of electric Carroll gravity, which only depends on extrinsic curvature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The six-derivative conformal scalar operator was originally found by Hamada in its critical dimension of spacetime, $d=6$. We generalize this construction to arbitrary dimensions $d$ by adding new terms cubic in gravitational curvatures and by changing its coefficients of expansion in various curvature terms. The consequences of global scale-invariance and of infinitesimal local conformal transformations are derived for the form of this generalized operator. The system of linear equations for coefficients is solved giving explicitly the conformal Hamada operator in any $d$. Some singularities in construction for dimensions $d=2$ and $d=4$ are noticed. We also prove a general theorem that a scalar conformal operator with $n$ derivatives in $d=n-2$ dimensions is impossible to construct. Finally, we compare our explicit construction with the one that uses conformal covariant derivatives and conformal curvature tensors. We present new results for operators built with different orders of conformal covariant derivatives.</description>

Both cases of an electric black hole and a magnetic one are considered. Finally, we are obtaining the solution to the Klein--Gordon equation in terms of Heun confluent functions and the corresponding energy spectrum. A special attention is given to the role of the dilaton parameter.</description>

Abstract: We determine the gravito-magnetic Love numbers of non-rotating black holes in all spacetime dimensions through a novel and direct derivation. The Ishibashi- Kodama master field and its associated field equation are avoided. The matching to the EFT variables is simple. This method allows us to correct the values in the literature. Moreover, we highlight a parity-based selection rule for nonlinear terms that include both electric-type and magnetic-type gravitational field tensors, enabling us to conclude that many of the nonlinear response coefficients in the Schwarzschild black hole effective action vanish.</description>

      <title>Observational Constraints on the Dark Energy with a Quadratic Equation of State</title>

Abstract: In this study, we introduce a novel late-time effective dark energy model characterized by a quadratic equation of state (EoS) and rigorously examine its observational constraints. Initially, we delve into the background dynamics of this model, tracing the evolution of fluctuations in linear order. Our approach involves substituting the conventional cosmological constant with a dynamically effective dark energy fluid. Leveraging a diverse array of observational datasets encompassing the Planck 2018 Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), Type Ia Supernovae (SNe), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), and a prior on the Hubble constant $H_0$ (R21), we constrain the model parameters. We establish the model's consistency by comparing the Hubble parameter as a function of redshift against observational Hubble data (OHD), benchmarking its performance against the Standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Additionally, our investigation delves into studies of the model's dynamical behavior by computing cosmological parameters such as the deceleration parameter, relative Hubble parameter, and the evolution of the Hubble rate. Furthermore, employing Bayesian analysis, we determine the Bayesian Evidence for our proposed model compared to the reference $\Lambda$CDM model. While our analysis unveils the favorable behavior of the model in various observational tests, the well-known cosmological tensions persist when the full dataset combination is explored.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes and curvature perturbations from false vacuum islands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06506v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, much attention has been focused on the false vacuum islands that are flooded by an expanding ocean of true-vacuum bubbles slightly later than most of the other parts of the world. These delayed decay regions will accumulate locally larger vacuum energy density by staying in the false vacuum longer than those already transited into the true vacuum. A false vacuum island with thus acquired density contrast of a super-horizon size will evolve locally from radiation dominance to vacuum dominance, creating a local baby Universe that can be regarded effectively as a local closed Universe. If such density contrasts of super-horizon sizes can ever grow large enough to exceed the threshold of gravitational collapse, primordial black holes will form similar to those collapsing curvature perturbations on super-horizon scales induced by small-scale enhancements during inflation. If not, such density contrasts can still induce curvature perturbations potentially observable today. In this paper, we revisit and elaborate on the generations of primordial black holes and curvature perturbations from delayed-decayed false vacuum islands during asynchronous first-order phase transitions with fitting formulas convenient for future model-independent studies.</description>
