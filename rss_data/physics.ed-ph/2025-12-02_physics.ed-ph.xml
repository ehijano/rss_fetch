      <title>High schoolers excel at Oxford quantum course using pictorial mathematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are at the dawn of the second quantum revolution, where our ability to create and control individual quantum systems is poised to drive transformative advancements in basic science, computation, and everyday life. However, quantum theory has long been conceived as notoriously hard to learn, creating a significant barrier to workforce development, informed decision-making by stakeholders and policymakers, and broader public understanding.
  This paper is concerned with Quantum Picturalism, a novel visual mathematical language for quantum physics. Originally developed over two decades ago to explore the foundational structure of quantum theory, this rigorous diagrammatic framework has since been adopted in both academia and industry as a powerful tool for quantum computing research and software development. Here, we demonstrate its potential as a transformative educational methodology.
  We report the findings from a pilot study involving 54 UK high school students, randomly selected from a pool of 734 volunteers across the UK. Despite the absence of advanced mathematical prerequisites, these students demonstrated a strong conceptual grasp of key quantum principles and operations. On an assessment comprising university graduate-level exam questions, participants achieved an 82% pass rate, with 48% obtaining a distinction-level grade.
  These results pave the way for making quantum more inclusive, lowering traditional cognitive and demographic barriers to quantum learning. This approach has the potential to broaden participation in the field and provide a promising new entry point for stakeholders, future experts, and the general public.</description>

      <title>Astro-Animation -- How Artists and Scientists Envision the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For several years, students at an art college, working with NASA astronomers, have produced animations inspired by research on black holes, dark matter and more. They can be whimsical or poetic but still constrained by scientific rigour. The animations are used for scientific outreach and are freely available. Our program received a positive assessment through an evaluation we undertook. We are now planning a mobile STEAM exhibition to engage teenagers from underrepresented communities who may not typically consider STE(A)M for their studies. "Science anxiety" has been reported to be a significant barrier to learning. Mixing animation with astronomy can stimulate interest in STEAM, making science engaging in an unconventional way. One component would be activities where participants create artistic responses to astronomy. We undertook a workshop at a local city-run school, specialising in the arts for ages 14-17, to brainstorm the art/science activities. There we gave short scientific presentations leading to art activities: a giant colouring wall with projected celestial phenomena, a stop-motion station, and colouring images of comet 67P to produce an animation. Surveys before and after the activities showed positive responses. The hand of the artist has long been an important concept in animation (Crafton 1991). In a film entitled "The Movements of the Universe", this concept is adapted to the hands of scientists. Combining animation, filmed interviews at NASA (including a Nobel prize winner), and the scientists' hands, bring unexpected feelings of dream and humour to the audience. In this paper we explore three different viewpoints of these activities from a scientist, an animator, and an animation student.</description>

      <title>A Hands-On Molecular Communication Testbed for Undergraduate Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01904v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a hands-on molecular communication (MC) testbed developed for the undergraduate Communication Engineering lab course at the Institute for Communications Technology (IfN), TU~Braunschweig. The goal of the experiment is to provide students with an intuitive and reproducible introduction to MC concepts using a low-cost and accessible fluidic setup. The system employs a background water flow into which three dye colors are injected and symbols are detected by a multi-wavelength photosensor. A zero-forcing--based estimator is used to separate the spectral components and reliably identify the transmitted colors. The experiment is designed to be completed independently by students within a single laboratory session and requires only basic prior knowledge from introductory communication engineering courses. A detailed script accompanies the experiment, guiding students through channel characterization, color detection, pseudoinverse computation, and simple data transmission using on-off keying. In pilot trials, students successfully reproduced the entire communication chain and achieved stable data rates of up to 0.5~bit/s over a 15~cm channel. The proposed testbed demonstrates that fundamental principles of MC can be taught effectively using a compact and inexpensive experimental setup. The experiment will be integrated into an undergraduate lab course.</description>

      <title>The Gauge Principle and Foundations of The Standard Model: A Pedagogical Introduction Through QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Standard Model of particle physics is built on the principle of local gauge symmetry. This work provides a pedagogical introduction for advanced undergraduates by using quantum electrodynamics (QED) as the simplest example of a gauge theory. Beginning with the Lagrangian formulation of classical mechanics, special relativity, and basic quantum mechanics, we develop classical field theory, reformulate electromagnetism in covariant form, introduce the Dirac equation for spin 1/2 particles, and finally arrive at the gauge principle. By showing how the requirement of local U(1) invariance leads naturally to the electromagnetic interaction, we illustrate the essential logic behind gauge theories and highlight the conceptual structure that underlies the Standard Model Lagrangian.</description>

      <title>Classical Reconstruction of the PMNS Matrix Using a Mechanical Neutrino Oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutrino oscillations arise from quantum interference between neutrino mass eigenstates and are governed by the PMNS matrix. Although this is an intrinsically quantum phenomenon, its mathematical structure is analogous to systems of coupled classical oscillators. In this work, a three--pendulum system connected by springs is constructed as a classical analog of three--flavor neutrino oscillations. Measurements of amplitude transfer, normal--mode structure, and beat frequencies are used to extract a mechanical mixing matrix, which is compared with the structure of the PMNS matrix under the assumption of zero CP violation. A scaling relation linking mechanical time evolution to the neutrino \(L/E\) behavior is derived, clarifying the scope and limitations of the analogy. The experiment demonstrates how abstract concepts of neutrino mixing can be visualized using simple and accessible classical systems, offering both pedagogical value and a qualitative understanding of flavor oscillation dynamics.</description>
