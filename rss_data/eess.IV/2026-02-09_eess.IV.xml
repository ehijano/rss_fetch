      <title>COSMOS: Coherent Supergaussian Modeling with Spatial Priors for Sparse-View 3D Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as a promising approach for 3D reconstruction, providing explicit, point-based representations and enabling high-quality real time rendering. However, when trained with sparse input views, 3DGS suffers from overfitting and structural degradation, leading to poor generalization on novel views. This limitation arises from its optimization relying solely on photometric loss without incorporating any 3D structure priors. To address this issue, we propose Coherent supergaussian Modeling with Spatial Priors (COSMOS). Inspired by the concept of superpoints from 3D segmentation, COSMOS introduces 3D structure priors by newly defining supergaussian groupings of Gaussians based on local geometric cues and appearance features. To this end, COSMOS applies inter group global self-attention across supergaussian groups and sparse local attention among individual Gaussians, enabling the integration of global and local spatial information. These structure-aware features are then used for predicting Gaussian attributes, facilitating more consistent 3D reconstructions. Furthermore, by leveraging supergaussian-based grouping, COSMOS enforces an intra-group positional regularization to maintain structural coherence and suppress floaters, thereby enhancing training stability under sparse-view conditions. Our experiments on Blender and DTU show that COSMOS surpasses state-of-the-art methods in sparse-view settings without any external depth supervision.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Resolution and Chroma Subsampling for Energy-Efficient Video Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional video encoders typically employ a fixed chroma subsampling format, such as YUV420, which may not optimally reflect variations in chroma detail across different types of content. This can lead to suboptimal chroma quality and inefficiencies in bitrate allocation. We propose an Adaptive Resolution-Chroma Subsampling (ARCS) framework that jointly optimizes spatial resolution and chroma subsampling to balance perceptual quality and decoding efficiency. ARCS selects an optimal (resolution, chroma format) pair for each bitrate by maximizing a composite quality-complexity objective, while enforcing monotonicity constraints to ensure smooth transitions between representations. Experimental results using x265 show that, compared to a fixed-format encoding (YUV444), on average, ARCS achieves a 13.48 % bitrate savings and a 62.18 % reduction in decoding time, which we use as a proxy for the decoding energy, to yield the same colorVideoVDP score. The proposed framework introduces chroma adaptivity as a new control dimension for energy-efficient video streaming.</description>

      <title>ALIEN: Analytic Latent Watermarking for Controllable Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Watermarking is a technical alternative to safeguarding intellectual property and reducing misuse. Existing methods focus on optimizing watermarked latent variables to balance watermark robustness and fidelity, as Latent diffusion models (LDMs) are considered a powerful tool for generative tasks. However, reliance on computationally intensive heuristic optimization for iterative signal refinement results in high training overhead and local optima entrapment.To address these issues, we propose an \underline{A}na\underline{l}ytical Watermark\underline{i}ng Framework for Controllabl\underline{e} Generatio\underline{n} (ALIEN). We develop the first analytical derivation of the time-dependent modulation coefficient that guides the diffusion of watermark residuals to achieve controllable watermark embedding pattern.Experimental results show that ALIEN-Q outperforms the state-of-the-art by 33.1\% across 5 quality metrics, and ALIEN-R demonstrates 14.0\% improved robustness against generative variant and stability threats compared to the state-of-the-art across 15 distinct conditions.

      <title>Content-Driven Frame-Level Bit Prediction for Rate Control in Versatile Video Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rate control allocates bits efficiently across frames to meet a target bitrate while maintaining quality. Conventional two-pass rate control (2pRC) in Versatile Video Coding (VVC) relies on analytical rate-QP models, which often fail to capture nonlinear spatial-temporal variations, causing quality instability and high complexity due to multiple trial encodes. This paper proposes a content-adaptive framework that predicts frame-level bit consumption using lightweight features from the Video Complexity Analyzer (VCA) and quantization parameters within a Random Forest regression. On ultra-high-definition sequences encoded with VVenC, the model achieves strong correlation with ground truth, yielding R2 values of 0.93, 0.88, and 0.77 for I-, P-, and B-frames, respectively. Integrated into a rate-control loop, it achieves comparable coding efficiency to 2pRC while reducing total encoding time by 33.3%. The results show that VCA-driven bit prediction provides a computationally efficient and accurate alternative to conventional rate-QP models.</description>

      <title>Zero-shot Multi-Contrast Brain MRI Registration by Intensity Randomizing T1-weighted MRI (LUMIR25)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we summarize the methods and results of our submission to the LUMIR25 challenge in Learn2Reg 2025, which achieved 1st place overall on the test set. Extended from LUMIR24, this year's task focuses on zero-shot registration under domain shifts (high-field MRI, pathological brains, and various MRI contrasts), while the training data comprise only in-domain T1-weighted brain MRI. We start with a meticulous analysis of LUMIR24 winners to identify the main contributors to good monomodal registration performance. To achieve good generalization with diverse contrasts from a model trained with T1-weighted MRI only, we employ three simple but effective strategies: (i) a multimodal loss based on the modality-independent neighborhood descriptor (MIND), (ii) intensity randomization for appearance augmentation, and (iii) lightweight instance-specific optimization (ISO) on feature encoders at inference time. On the validation set, our approach achieves reasonable T1-T2 registration accuracy while maintaining good deformation regularity.</description>

      <title>AS-Mamba: Asymmetric Self-Guided Mamba Decoupled Iterative Network for Metal Artifact Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal artifact significantly degrades Computed Tomography (CT) image quality, impeding accurate clinical diagnosis. However, existing deep learning approaches, such as CNN and Transformer, often fail to explicitly capture the directional geometric features of artifacts, leading to compromised structural restoration. To address these limitations, we propose the Asymmetric Self-Guided Mamba (AS-Mamba) for metal artifact reduction. Specifically, the linear propagation of metal-induced streak artifacts aligns well with the sequential modeling capability of State Space Models (SSMs). Consequently, the Mamba architecture is leveraged to explicitly capture and suppress these directional artifacts. Simultaneously, a frequency domain correction mechanism is incorporated to rectify the global amplitude spectrum, thereby mitigating intensity inhomogeneity caused by beam hardening. Furthermore, to bridge the distribution gap across diverse clinical scenarios, we introduce a self-guided contrastive regularization strategy. Extensive experiments on public andclinical dental CBCT datasets demonstrate that AS-Mamba achieves superior performance in suppressing directional streaks and preserving structural details, validating the effectiveness of integrating physical geometric priors into deep network design.</description>

      <title>Orientation-Robust Latent Motion Trajectory Learning for Annotation-free Cardiac Phase Detection in Fetal Echocardiography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fetal echocardiography is essential for detecting congenital heart disease (CHD), facilitating pregnancy management, optimized delivery planning, and timely postnatal interventions. Among standard imaging planes, the four-chamber (4CH) view provides comprehensive information for CHD diagnosis, where clinicians carefully inspect the end-diastolic (ED) and end-systolic (ES) phases to evaluate cardiac structure and motion. Automated detection of these cardiac phases is thus a critical component toward fully automated CHD analysis. Yet, in the absence of fetal electrocardiography (ECG), manual identification of ED and ES frames remains a labor-intensive bottleneck. We present ORBIT (Orientation-Robust Beat Inference from Trajectories), a self-supervised framework that identifies cardiac phases without manual annotations under various fetal heart orientation. ORBIT employs registration as self-supervision task and learns a latent motion trajectory of cardiac deformation, whose turning points capture transitions between cardiac relaxation and contraction, enabling accurate and orientation-robust localization of ED and ES frames across diverse fetal positions. Trained exclusively on normal fetal echocardiography videos, ORBIT achieves consistent performance on both normal (MAE = 1.9 frames for ED and 1.6 for ES) and CHD cases (MAE = 2.4 frames for ED and 2.1 for ES), outperforming existing annotation-free approaches constrained by fixed orientation assumptions. These results highlight the potential of ORBIT to facilitate robust cardiac phase detection directly from 4CH fetal echocardiography.</description>

      <title>Downscaling Neural Network for Coastal Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16553v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning the fine-scale details of a coastal ocean simulation from a coarse representation is a challenging task. For real-world applications, high-resolution simulations are necessary to advance understanding of many coastal processes, specifically, to predict flooding resulting from tsunamis and storm surges. We propose a Downscaling Neural Network for Coastal Simulation (DNNCS) for spatiotemporal enhancement to learn the high-resolution numerical solution. Given images of coastal simulations produced on low-resolution computational meshes using low polynomial order discontinuous Galerkin discretizations and a coarse temporal resolution, the proposed DNNCS learns to produce high-resolution free surface elevation and velocity visualizations in both time and space. To model the dynamic changes over time and space, we propose grid-aware spatiotemporal attention to project the temporal features to the spatial domain for non-local feature matching. The coordinate information is also utilized via positional encoding. For the final reconstruction, we use the spatiotemporal bilinear operation to interpolate the missing frames and then expand the feature maps to the frequency domain for residual mapping. Besides data-driven losses, the proposed physics-informed loss guarantees gradient consistency and momentum changes, leading to a 24% reduction in root-mean-square error compared to the model trained with only data-driven losses. To train the proposed model, we propose a coastal simulation dataset and use it for model optimization and evaluation. Our method shows superior downscaling quality and fast computation compared to the state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Mamba Goes HoME: Hierarchical Soft Mixture-of-Experts for 3D Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06363v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, artificial intelligence has significantly advanced medical image segmentation. Nonetheless, challenges remain, including efficient 3D medical image processing across diverse modalities and handling data variability. In this work, we introduce Hierarchical Soft Mixture-of-Experts (HoME), a two-level token-routing layer for efficient long-context modeling, specifically designed for 3D medical image segmentation. Built on the Mamba Selective State Space Model (SSM) backbone, HoME enhances sequential modeling through adaptive expert routing. In the first level, a Soft Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) layer partitions input sequences into local groups, routing tokens to specialized per-group experts for localized feature extraction. The second level aggregates these outputs through a global SMoE layer, enabling cross-group information fusion and global context refinement. This hierarchical design, combining local expert routing with global expert refinement, enhances generalizability and segmentation performance, surpassing state-of-the-art results across datasets from the three most widely used 3D medical imaging modalities and varying data qualities. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/gmum/MambaHoME.</description>

      <title>Mamba-FCS: Joint Spatio- Frequency Feature Fusion, Change-Guided Attention, and SeK Loss for Enhanced Semantic Change Detection in Remote Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08232v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semantic Change Detection (SCD) from remote sensing imagery requires models balancing extensive spatial context, computational efficiency, and sensitivity to class-imbalanced land-cover transitions. While Convolutional Neural Networks excel at local feature extraction but lack global context, Transformers provide global modeling at high computational costs. Recent Mamba architectures based on state-space models offer compelling solutions through linear complexity and efficient long-range modeling. In this study, we introduce Mamba-FCS, a SCD framework built upon Visual State Space Model backbone incorporating, a Joint Spatio-Frequency Fusion block incorporating log-amplitude frequency domain features to enhance edge clarity and suppress illumination artifacts, a Change-Guided Attention (CGA) module that explicitly links the naturally intertwined BCD and SCD tasks, and a Separated Kappa (SeK) loss tailored for class-imbalanced performance optimization. Extensive evaluation on SECOND and Landsat-SCD datasets shows that Mamba-FCS achieves state-of-the-art metrics, 88.62% Overall Accuracy, 65.78% F_scd, and 25.50% SeK on SECOND, 96.25% Overall Accuracy, 89.27% F_scd, and 60.26% SeK on Landsat-SCD. Ablation analyses confirm distinct contributions of each novel component, with qualitative assessments highlighting significant improvements in SCD. Our results underline the substantial potential of Mamba architectures, enhanced by proposed techniques, setting a new benchmark for effective and scalable semantic change detection in remote sensing applications. The complete source code, configuration files, and pre-trained models will be publicly available upon publication.</description>

      <title>Learning a distance measure from the information-estimation geometry of data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the Information-Estimation Metric (IEM), a novel form of distance function derived from an underlying continuous probability density over a domain of signals. The IEM is rooted in a fundamental relationship between information theory and estimation theory, which links the log-probability of a signal with the errors of an optimal denoiser, applied to noisy observations of the signal. In particular, the IEM between a pair of signals is obtained by comparing their denoising error vectors over a range of noise amplitudes. Geometrically, this amounts to comparing the score vector fields of the blurred density around the signals over a range of blur levels. We prove that the IEM is a valid global distance metric and derive a closed-form expression for its local second-order approximation, which yields a Riemannian metric. For Gaussian-distributed signals, the IEM coincides with the Mahalanobis distance. But for more complex distributions, it adapts, both locally and globally, to the geometry of the distribution. In practice, the IEM can be computed using a learned denoiser (analogous to generative diffusion models) and solving a one-dimensional integral. To demonstrate the value of our framework, we learn an IEM on the ImageNet database. Experiments show that this IEM is competitive with or outperforms state-of-the-art supervised image quality metrics in predicting human perceptual judgments.</description>

      <title>Robust Detection of Retinal Neovascularization in Widefield Optical Coherence Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retinal neovascularization (RNV) is a vision threatening development in diabetic retinopathy (DR). Vision loss associated with RNV is preventable with timely intervention, making RNV clinical screening and monitoring a priority. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) angiography (OCTA) provides high-resolution imaging and high-sensitivity detection of RNV lesions. With recent commercial devices introducing widefield OCTA imaging to the clinic, the technology stands to improve early detection of RNV pathology. However, to meet clinical requirements these imaging capabilities must be combined with effective RNV detection and quantification, but existing algorithms for OCTA images are optimized for conventional, i.e. narrow, fields of view. Here, we present a novel approach for RNV diagnosis and staging on widefield OCT/OCTA. Unlike conventional methods dependent on multi-layer retinal segmentation, our model reframes RNV identification as a direct binary localization task. Our fully automated approach was trained and validated on 589 widefield scans (17x17-mm to 26x21-mm) collected from multiple devices at multiple clinics. Our method achieved a device-dependent area under curve (AUC) ranging from 0.96 to 0.99 for RNV diagnosis, and mean intersection over union (IOU) ranging from 0.76 to 0.88 for segmentation. We also demonstrate our method's ability to monitor lesion growth longitudinally. Our results indicate that deep learning-based analysis for widefield OCTA images could offer a valuable means for improving RNV screening and management.</description>

Abstract: Foundation models for echocardiography often struggle to disentangle anatomical signal from the stochastic speckle and acquisition artifacts inherent to ultrasound. We present EchoJEPA, a foundation model trained on 18 million echocardiograms across 300K patients, representing the largest pretraining corpus for this modality to date. By leveraging a latent predictive objective, EchoJEPA learns robust anatomical representations that ignore speckle noise. We validate this using a novel multi-view probing framework with frozen backbones, where EchoJEPA outperforms leading baselines by approximately 20% in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) estimation and 17% in right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) estimation. The model also exhibits remarkable sample efficiency, reaching 79% view classification accuracy with only 1% of labeled data versus 42% for the best baseline trained on 100%. Crucially, EchoJEPA demonstrates superior generalization, degrading by only 2% under physics-informed acoustic perturbations compared to 17% for competitors. Most remarkably, its zero-shot performance on pediatric patients surpasses fully fine-tuned baselines, establishing latent prediction as a superior paradigm for robust, generalizable medical AI.</description>

Abstract: Subsurface delaminations in concrete bridge decks remain undetectable through conventional visual inspection, necessitating automated non-destructive evaluation methods. This work introduces a deep learning framework that integrates Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) and Infrared Thermography (IRT) through hierarchical attention mechanisms. Our architecture employs temporal self-attention to process GPR electromagnetic signals, spatial attention to analyze thermal imagery, and cross-modal attention with learnable embeddings to model inter-sensor correspondences. We integrate Monte Carlo dropout-based uncertainty quantification, decomposing prediction confidence into model uncertainty and data-driven uncertainty components. Testing across five real-world bridge datasets from the SDNET2021 benchmark reveals that our approach delivers substantial performance gains over single-sensor and concatenation-based baselines when applied to balanced or moderately imbalanced data distributions. Comprehensive ablation analysis confirms that cross-modal attention mechanisms contribute meaningful improvements beyond unimodal attention alone. Critically, we identify and characterize specific failure modes: under extreme class imbalance, attention-based architectures demonstrate susceptibility to majority class bias, indicating scenarios where simpler architectural choices may prove more robust. Our findings equip practitioners with empirically-grounded criteria for selecting appropriate fusion strategies based on dataset characteristics, rather than promoting universal architectural superiority.</description>
