      <title>Inverse Design of Unitary Transmission Matrices in Silicon Photonic Coupled Waveguide Arrays using a Neural Adjoint Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of low-loss reconfigurable integrated optical devices enables further research into technologies including photonic signal processing, analogue quantum computing, and optical neural networks. Here, we introduce digital patterning of coupled waveguide arrays as a platform capable of implementing unitary matrix operations. Determining the required device geometry for a specific optical output is computationally challenging and requires a robust and versatile inverse design protocol. In this work we present an approach using high speed neural network surrogate based gradient optimization, capable of predicting patterns of refractive index perturbations based on switching of the ultra-low loss chalcogenide phase change material, antimony tri-selinide ($\text{Sb}_{2}\text{Se}_{3}$). Results for a $3 \times 3$ silicon waveguide array are presented, demonstrating control of both amplitude and phase for each transmission matrix element. Network performance is studied using neural network optimization tools such as dataset augmentation and supplementation with random noise, resulting in an average fidelity of 0.94 for unitary matrix targets. Our results show that coupled waveguide arrays with perturbation patterns offer new routes for achieving programmable integrated photonics with a reduced footprint compared to conventional interferometer-mesh technology.</description>

      <title>Small field chaos in spin glasses: universal predictions from the ultrametric tree and comparison with numerical simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08503v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the chaotic behavior of the Gibbs state of spin-glasses under the application of an external magnetic field, in the crossover region where the field intensity scales proportional to $1/\sqrt{N}$, being $N$ the system size. We show that Replica Symmetry Breaking (RSB) theory provides universal predictions for chaotic behavior: they depend only on the zero-field overlap probability function $P(q)$ and are independent of other features of the system. Using solely $P(q)$ as input we can analytically predict quantitatively the statistics of the states in a small field. In the infinite volume limit, each spin-glass sample is characterized by an infinite number of states that have a tree-like structure. We generate the corresponding probability distribution through efficient sampling using a representation based on the Bolthausen-Sznitman coalescent. In this way, we can compute quantitatively properties in the presence of a magnetic field in the crossover region, the overlap probability distribution in the presence of a small field and the degree of decorrelation as the field is increased. To test our computations, we have simulated the Bethe lattice spin glass and the 4D Edwards-Anderson model, finding in both cases excellent agreement with the universal predictions.</description>

      <title>Furutsu-Novikov--like cross-correlation--response relations for systems driven by shot noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13508v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a dynamic system that is driven by an intensity-modulated Poisson process with intensity $\Lambda(t)=\lambda(t)+\varepsilon\nu(t)$. We derive an exact relation between the input-output cross-correlation in the spontaneous state ($\varepsilon=0$) and the linear response to the modulation ($\varepsilon&gt;0$). If $\varepsilon$ is sufficiently small, linear response theory captures the full response. The relation can be regarded as a variant of the Furutsu-Novikov theorem for the case of shot noise. As we show, the relation is still valid in the presence of additional independent noise. Furthermore, we derive an extension to Cox-process input, which provides an instance of colored shot noise. We discuss applications to particle detection and to neuroscience. Using the new relation, we obtain a fluctuation-response-relation for a leaky integrate-and-fire neuron. We also show how the new relation can be used in a remote control problem in a recurrent neural network. The relations are numerically tested for both stationary and non-stationary dynamics. Lastly, extensions to marked Poisson processes and to higher-order statistics are presented.</description>

      <title>Experimentally validated and empirically compared machine learning approach for predicting yield strength of additively manufactured multi-principal element alloys from Co-Cr-Fe-Mn-Ni system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05211v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditionally, yield strength prediction relies on detailed and resource-intensive microstructural characterization combined with empirical equations. However, quantifying microstructural feature length scales for novel processes like additive manufacturing, which involves inhomogeneous hierarchical features, poses a challenge. The lack of accurate material constants for broader composition ranges further limits empirical predictions. This study proposes an alternative machine learning (ML) approach for predicting the yield strength of additively manufactured (AM) multi-principal element alloys (MPEAs) from the Co-Cr-Fe-Mn-Ni system by correlating composition, printing parameters, and testing conditions. The best-performing ML model achieved an R2 of 0.84, comparable to that achieved using microstructural detail-driven empirical strengthening contributions. The validity of the ML approach was further confirmed by printing and testing two compositions (one novel and one from the dataset). This data-driven approach directly relates yield strength to initial printing parameters, highlighting their significance and individual effects, such as scan velocity's direct impact and laser power's inverse impact on yield strength. This demonstrates ML's potential to guide AM processes, reducing the need for iterative experiments and enabling rapid exploration of compositional and printing spaces to achieve desired properties.</description>

      <title>Emergent time scales of epistasis in protein evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09436v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a data-driven epistatic model of protein evolution, capable of generating evolutionary trajectories spanning very different time scales reaching from individual mutations to diverged homologs. Our in silico evolution encompasses random nucleotide mutations, insertions and deletions, and models selection using a fitness landscape, which is inferred via a generative probabilistic model for protein families. We show that the proposed framework accurately reproduces the sequence statistics of both short-time (experimental) and long-time (natural) protein evolution, suggesting applicability also to relatively data-poor intermediate evolutionary time scales, which are currently inaccessible to evolution experiments. Our model uncovers a highly collective nature of epistasis, gradually changing the fitness effect of mutations in a diverging sequence context, rather than acting via strong interactions between individual mutations. This collective nature triggers the emergence of a long evolutionary time scale, separating fast mutational processes inside a given sequence context, from the slow evolution of the context itself. The model quantitatively reproduces epistatic phenomena such as contingency and entrenchment, as well as the loss of predictability in protein evolution observed in deep mutational scanning experiments of distant homologs. It thereby deepens our understanding of the interplay between mutation and selection in shaping protein diversity and novel functions, allows one to statistically forecast evolution, and challenges the prevailing independent-site models of protein evolution, which are unable to capture the fundamental importance of epistasis.</description>

      <title>Local and energy-resolved topological invariants for Floquet systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08548v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Periodically driven systems offer a perfect breeding ground for out-of-equilibrium engineering of topological boundary states at zero energy ($0$-mode), as well as finite energy ($\pi$-mode), with the latter having no static analog. The Floquet operator and the effective Floquet Hamiltonian, which encapsulate the stroboscopic features of the driven system, capture both spectral and localization properties of the $0$- and $\pi$-modes but sometimes fail to provide complete topological characterization, especially when $0$- and $\pi$-modes coexist. In this work, we utilize the spectral localizer, a powerful local probe that can provide numerically efficient, spatially local, and energy-resolved topological characterization. In particular, we apply the spectral localizer to the effective Floquet Hamiltonian for driven one- and two-dimensional topological systems with no or limited symmetries and are able to assign topological invariants, or local markers, that characterize the $0$- and the $\pi$-boundary modes individually and unambiguously. Due to the spatial resolution, we also demonstrate that the extracted topological invariants are suitable for studying driven disordered systems and can even capture disorder-induced phase transitions.</description>
