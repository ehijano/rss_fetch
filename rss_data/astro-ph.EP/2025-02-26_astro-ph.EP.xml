      <title>Utilizing Machine Learning to Predict Host Stars and the Key Elemental Abundances of Small Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stars and their associated planets originate from the same cloud of gas and dust, making a star's elemental composition a valuable indicator for indirectly studying planetary compositions. While the connection between a star's iron (Fe) abundance and the presence of giant exoplanets is established (e.g. Gonzalez 1997; Fischer &amp; Valenti 2005), the relationship with small planets remains unclear. The elements Mg, Si, and Fe are important in forming small planets. Employing machine learning algorithms like XGBoost, trained on the abundances (e.g., the Hypatia Catalog, Hinkel et al. 2014) of known exoplanet-hosting stars (NASA Exoplanet Archive), allows us to determine significant "features" (abundances or molar ratios) that may indicate the presence of small planets. We test on three groups of exoplanets: (a) all small, R$_{P}$ $&lt;$ 3.5 $R_{\oplus}$, (b) sub-Neptunes, 2.0 $R_{\oplus}$ $&lt;$ R$_{P}$ $&lt;$ 3.5 $R_{\oplus}$, and (c) super-Earths, 1.0 $R_{\oplus}$ $&lt;$ R$_{P}$ $&lt;$ 2.0 $R_{\oplus}$ -- each subdivided into 7 ensembles to test different combinations of features. We created a list of stars with $\geq90\%$ probability of hosting small planets across all ensembles and experiments ("overlap stars"). We found abundance trends for stars hosting small planets, possibly indicating star-planet chemical interplay during formation. We also found that Na and V are key features regardless of planetary radii. We expect our results to underscore the importance of elements in exoplanet formation and machine learning's role in target selection for future NASA missions: e.g., the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (NGRST), Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) -- all of which are aimed at small planet detection.</description>

      <title>A Pluto-Charon Sonata V. Long-term Stability of the HST State Vector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze a new set of 275 n-body calculations designed to place limits on the masses of the small circumbinary satellites in the Pluto-Charon system. Together with calculations reported in previous papers, we repeat that a robust upper limit on the total mass of the four satellites is roughly $9.5 \times 10^{19}$ g. For satellite volumes derived from New Horizons, this mass limit implies a robust upper limit on the bulk densities of Nix and Hydra, $\lesssim 1.7$ g cm$^{-3}$, that are comparable to the bulk density of Charon. Additional calculations demonstrate that satellite systems with mass $\lesssim 8.25 \times 10^{19}$ g are robustly stable over the current age of the Sun. The bulk densities of Nix and Hydra in these lower mass systems are clearly smaller than the bulk density of Charon. These new n-body results enable accurate measurements of eccentricity and inclination for Nix, Kerberos, and Hydra that agree well with orbital elements derived from numerical calculations with new HST and New Horizons state vectors. With these new state vectors, Styx has a 37% larger eccentricity and an 85% smaller inclination, which makes it more prone to gravitational perturbations from Nix.</description>

      <title>The Super-Puff WASP-193b is On A Well-Aligned Orbit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The "super-puffs" are a population of planets that have masses comparable to that of Neptune but radii similar to Jupiter, leading to extremely low bulk densities ($\rho_p \lesssim 0.2\,\mathrm{g}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$) that are not easily explained by standard core accretion models. Interestingly, several of these super-puffs are found in orbits significantly misaligned with their host stars' spin axes, indicating past dynamical excitation that may be connected to their low densities. Here, we present new Magellan/PFS RV measurements of WASP-193, a late F star hosting one of the least dense transiting planets known to date ($M_p = 0.112^{+0.029}_{-0.034}\,M_J$, $R_p = 1.319^{+0.056}_{-0.048}\,R_J$, $\rho_p = 0.060\pm0.019\,\mathrm{g}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$). We refine the bulk properties of WASP-193 b and use interior structure models to determine that the planet can be explained if it consists of roughly equal amounts of metals and H/He, with a metal fraction of $Z = 0.42$. The planet is likely substantially re-inflated due to its host star's evolution, and expected to be actively undergoing mass loss. We also measure the projected stellar obliquity using the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect, finding that WASP-193 b is on an orbit well-aligned with the stellar equator, with $\lambda = 17^{+17}_{-16}$ degrees. WASP-193 b is the first Jupiter-sized super-puff on a relatively well-aligned orbit, suggesting a diversity of formation pathways for this population of planets.</description>

      <title>Peculiar Rainbows in Saturn's E Ring: Uncovering Luminous Bands Near Enceladus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18028v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report observations of stripe-like features in Enceladus' plumes captured simultaneously by Cassini's VIMS-IR and ISS NAC instruments during flyby E17, with similar patterns seen in VIMS-IR data from flyby E13 and E19. These parallel stripes, inclined at approximately 16$^{\circ}$ to the ecliptic and 43$^{\circ}$ to Saturn's ring plane, appear continuous across images when projected in the J2000 frame. A bright stripe, most visible at wavelengths around 5 $\mu$m, acts as the zeroth-order diffraction peak of a reflection grating with an estimated groove spacing of 0.12$-$2.60 mm, while adjacent stripes are attributed to higher-order diffraction peaks. We suggest that this light-dispersing phenomenon originates from an inclined periodic structure within Saturn's E ring. This structure, constrained between Saturn's G-ring and Rhea's orbit, likely consists of fresh ice particles supplied by Enceladus' plumes.</description>

      <title>Near-instantaneous Atmospheric Retrievals and Model Comparison with FASTER</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the era of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the dramatic improvement in the spectra of exoplanetary atmospheres demands a corresponding leap forward in our ability to analyze them: atmospheric retrievals need to be performed on thousands of spectra, applying to each large ensembles of models (that explore atmospheric chemistry, thermal profiles and cloud models) to identify the best one(s). In this limit, traditional Bayesian inference methods such as nested sampling become prohibitively expensive. We introduce FASTER (Fast Amortized Simulation-based Transiting Exoplanet Retrieval), a neural-network based method for performing atmospheric retrieval and Bayesian model comparison at a fraction of the computational cost of classical techniques. We demonstrate that the marginal posterior distributions of all parameters within a model as well as the posterior probabilities of the models we consider match those computed using nested sampling both on mock spectra, and for the real NIRSpec PRISM spectrum of WASP-39b. The true power of the FASTER framework comes from its amortized nature, which allows the trained networks to perform practically instantaneous Bayesian inference and model comparison over ensembles of spectra -- real or simulated -- at minimal additional computational cost. This offers valuable insight into the expected results of model comparison (e.g., distinguishing cloudy from cloud-free and isothermal from non-isothermal models), as well as their dependence on the underlying parameters, which is computationally unfeasible with nested sampling. This approach will constitute as large a leap in spectral analysis as the original retrieval methods based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo have proven to be.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric escape from exoplanets: recent observations and theoretical models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The review aims to give an overview of atmospheric escape processes from exoplanets. I briefly discuss the physics of various escape processes responsible for atmospheric escape across different types of exoplanets. Transmission spectroscopy is one of the major workhorses to observe the escaping atmosphere from exoplanets. I discuss recent observations that established the fact that atmospheric escape is very common in exoplanets, especially during the early phase of their evolution when stellar high-energy radiation (X-ray and extreme ultraviolet, hence XUV) is strong. There are many theoretical efforts/models to understand atmospheric escape processes. Stellar radiation is one of the major drivers of atmospheric escape, but other stellar environments (e.g., stellar flares, stellar winds, stellar coronal mass ejections, and stellar magnetic field) also have control over how the escape process will be affected for a given property of exoplanet, as the planetary properties (e.g., gravity, thermal energy, magnetic field) plays an important role for atmospheric escape. I discuss all governing factors for the atmospheric escape process and corresponding theoretical models in detail. I also discuss how atmospheric escape plays a crucial role in the overall atmospheric evolution of exoplanets and can lead us to understand some features in recently observed exoplanet demographics.</description>

      <title>OMEGA/Mars Express: A new martian atmospheric dust hunter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While dust is a key parameter of Mars climate, its behaviour from one year to the next can appear erratic. This variability is notably related to Global Dust Storms (GDS) which occur only certain years with different onset, duration and intensity. The interannual variabilities of the dust cycle may notably explain some characteristics of Recurring Slope Lineae (RSL), slope flows once thought to be caused by liquid water. Long-term monitoring of dust dynamics is thus required to better understand surface-atmosphere dust exchanges on Mars. Here we present a new method to detect atmospheric dust as a function of space and time in the OMEGA Near-InfraRed (NIR) dataset. This dataset covers more than three Martian years; it includes the 2007 GDS which seasonality differs from the preceding (2001) and later (2018) GDS. The method is based on the decrease of the atmospheric optical path caused by dust, that can be measured by OMEGA with the 2 $\mu$m CO$_2$ absorption band. This measure is converted to a 0.9 $\mu$m NIR dust optical depth using notably comparisons with Mars Exploration Rovers measurements. We derive dust optical depth maps and comment on the variability of the dust seasonal cycle before, during and after the 2007 GDS. We also compare OMEGA NIR optical depths to Thermal InfraRed (TIR) ones derived by other studies. We found a NIR/TIR dust extinction optical depth ratio of 1.8 on average, with some variations notably related to dust particle size. Finally, we show in the northern hemisphere that atmospheric dust and RSL activity is correlated. This may indicate that dust lifting or transport mechanisms working at regional scale also participate to local RSL activity.</description>

      <title>Homogeneous search for spot transits in Kepler and TESS photometry of K $-$ M-type main-sequence stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Late-type stars are known to host numerous exoplanets, and their photometric variability, primarily caused by rotational modulation, provides a unique opportunity to study starspots. As exoplanets transit in front of their host stars, they may occult darker, spotted regions on the stellar surfaces. The monitoring of starspots from planetary transits, known as transit mapping, offers a possibility to detect small dark regions on magnetically active, late-type stars. These spots may be so small that they would be undetectable to other methods used to reconstruct stellar magnetic activity. We describe a Bayesian analysis framework on the transit light curves of planets orbiting K- and M-type main-sequence stars in search for spot occultation event candidates. We present a systematic analysis of high-precision, high-cadence light curves from Kepler and TESS to detect and characterise starspots during exoplanetary transits. According to our tests, the set of criteria applied in the analysis is robust and not prone to false positives. Our sample comprises K- and M-dwarfs hosting transiting exoplanets observed by the Kepler or TESS space telescopes at a high cadence, totalling 99 planets meeting our selection criteria. After analysing 3273 transit light curves from 99 planets, we find 105 candidates for starspot occultation events by six planets. We report new spot occultation candidates for the K-dwarfs HD 189733 and TOI-1268. The identified dark regions have a lower limit for radii between 1.6 degrees and 29.5 degrees and contrasts up to 0.69. We estimate a spot detection frequency of 3.7% and 4.2% for K- and M-dwarfs by TESS, and 37.5% for K-dwarfs by Kepler.</description>

      <title>The Resonant Remains of Broken Chains from Major and Minor Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10206v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: TESS and Kepler have revealed that practically all close-in sub-Neptunes form in mean-motion resonant chains, most of which unravel on timescales of 100 Myr. Using N-body integrations, we study how planetary collisions from destabilized resonant chains produce the orbital period distribution observed among mature systems, focusing on the resonant fine structures remaining post-instability. In their natal chains, planets near first-order resonances have period ratios just wide of perfect commensurability, driven there by disk migration and eccentricity damping. Sufficiently large resonant libration amplitudes are needed to trigger instability. Ensuing collisions between planets ("major mergers") erode but do not eliminate resonant pairs; surviving pairs show up as narrow "peaks" just wide of commensurability in the histogram of neighboring-planet period ratios. Merger products exhibit a broad range of period ratios, filling the space between relatively closely-separated resonances such as the 5:4, 4:3, and 3:2, but failing to bridge the wider gap between the 3:2 and 2:1 -- a "trough" thus manifests just short of the 2:1 resonance, as observed. Major mergers generate debris which undergoes "minor mergers" with planets, in many cases further widening resonant pairs. With all this dynamical activity, free eccentricities of resonant pairs, and by extension the phases of their transit timing variations, are readily excited. Non-resonant planets, being merger products, are predicted to have higher masses than resonant planets, as observed. At the same time, a small fraction of mergers produce a high-mass tail in the resonant population, also observed.</description>

      <title>The Response of Planetary Atmospheres to the Impact of Icy Comets I: Tidally-Locked exo-Earths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11151v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Impacts by rocky and icy bodies are thought to have played a key role in shaping the composition of solar system objects, including the Earth's habitability. Hence, it is likely that they play a similar role in exoplanetary systems. We investigate how an icy cometary impact affects the atmospheric chemistry, climate, and composition of an Earth-like, tidally-locked, terrestrial exoplanet, a prime target in the search for a habitable exoplanet beyond our solar system. We couple a cometary impact model which includes thermal ablation and pressure driven breakup with the 3D Earth System Model WACCM6/CESM2, and use this model to investigate the effects of the water and thermal energy delivery associated with an $R=2.5$ km pure water ice cometary impact on an Earth-like atmosphere. We find that water is the primary driver of longer timescale changes to the atmospheric chemistry and composition by acting as a source of opacity, cloud ice, and atmospheric hydrogen/oxygen. The water opacity drives heating at $\sim5\times10^{-4}$ bar, and cooling below, due to a decreased flux reaching the surface. The increase in atmospheric hydrogen and oxygen also drives an increase in the abundance of hydrogen/oxygen rich molecules, with the exception of ozone, whose column density decreases by $\sim10\%$. These atmospheric changes are potentially observable for $\sim$ 1-2 years post-impact, particularly those associated with cloud ice scattering. They also persist, albeit at a much reduced level, to our quasi-steady-state, suggesting that sustained bombardment or multiple large impacts have the potential to shape the composition and habitability of terrestrial exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Survey of Orion Disks with ALMA (SODA) III: Disks in wide binary systems in L1641 and L1647</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aims. The goal of this work is to comprehensively characterize the impact of stellar multiplicity on Class II disks in the L1641 and L1647 regions of Orion A (~1-3 Myr), part of the Survey of Orion Disks with ALMA (SODA). We characterize the protostellar multiplicity using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), the ESO-VISTA, and Hubble Space telescopes. The resulting sample of 65 multiple systems represents the largest catalogue of wide binary systems to date (projected separation &gt;1000 AU), allowing a more robust statistical characterization of the evolution and properties of protoplanetary disks. Methods. The disk population was observed in continuum with ALMA at 225 GHz, with a median rms of 1.5 Mearth. Combining these data (resolution ~1.1arcsec ) with the ESO-VISTA near-infrared survey of the Orion A cloud (resolution ~0.7arcsec ), multiple systems are assembled and selected by an iterative inside-out search in projected separation (&gt;1000 AU). Results. We identify 61 binary systems, 3 triple systems, and one quadruple system. The separation range is between 1000 and 10^4 AU. The dust mass distributions inferred with the Kaplan-Meier estimator yield a median mass of 3.23+0.6-0.4 Mearth for primary disks and 3.88+0.3-0.3 Mearth for secondary disks.</description>

      <title>MARFA: an Effective Line-by-line Tool For Calculating Molecular Absorption in Planetary Atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03418v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present MARFA (Molecular atmospheric Absorption with Rapid and Flexible Analysis) -- an open-source line-by-line tool for calculating absorption coefficients and cross-sections in planetary atmospheres, particularly under conditions of uncertain spectroscopic data and missing continuum functions. MARFA employs an eleven-grid interpolation technique, enabling accurate and efficient computation of far-wing contributions for large line cut-offs. The tool supports flexible parameterization, including line shape functions, wing corrections, user-defined atmospheric profiles, thus, facilitating rapid sensitivity studies for sparse datasets. Spectra are calculated at a high-resolution of about 5E-4 cm-1, optimized for infrared and visible spectral regions where HITRAN-formatted line data is available, yet adaptable to other datasets with available line parameters. Output is represented either in a form of binary lookup tables files, directly compatible with radiative transfer codes or in a human-readable format for data analysis and distribution.
