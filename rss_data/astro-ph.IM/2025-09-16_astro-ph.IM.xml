      <title>CWT-LSTM Autoencoder: A Novel Approach for Gravitational Wave Detection in Synthetic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational wave detection requires sophisticated signal processing to identify weak astrophysical signals buried in instrumental noise. Traditional matched filtering approaches face computational challenges with diverse signal morphologies and non-stationary noise. This work presents a deep learning approach combining Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) preprocessing with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) autoencoder architecture for gravitational wave detection in synthetic data. The CWT provides optimal time-frequency decomposition capturing chirp evolution and transient characteristics essential for compact binary coalescence identification. The LSTM autoencoder learns compressed representations while maintaining sensitivity to subtle signal features distinguishing true astrophysical events from noise artifacts. We generate realistic synthetic datasets incorporating binary black hole merger signals with masses ranging from 10 to 80 solar masses, embedded in colored Gaussian noise representative of Advanced LIGO sensitivity. The trained model demonstrates strong performance metrics: 92.3 percent precision, 67.6 percent recall, and 80.6 percent AUC-ROC, with an average precision score of 0.780. These results exceed LIGO's stringent detection thresholds for confident gravitational wave identification. Compared to traditional approaches, the CWT-LSTM autoencoder shows superior ability to maintain low false alarm rates while preserving sensitivity to weak signals. The method's end-to-end learning eliminates hand-crafted features and template banks, offering a promising pathway toward more robust gravitational wave detection systems. The unsupervised nature enables discovery of signals with unknown morphologies, providing complementary "blind search" capability for detecting exotic astrophysical sources and novel physics beyond current theoretical models.</description>

      <title>Space Astrometry with Gaia: Advances in Understanding our Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaia is a satellite mission of the European Space Agency which is creating a catalogue of extremely accurate positions, distances and space motions of two billion stars in our Galaxy, along with more than one hundred thousand solar system asteroids, and several million distant quasars, all on the same extragalactic reference system. Complementary information on each object's multi-epoch photometry and spectra provides a vast and unprecedented data base of (model-dependent) fundamental physical quantities, such as each star's mass, age, and chemical composition. I outline the field's historical context, and explain the key principles involved in these space measurements. This is followed by a broad review of the many areas of solar system science, stellar structure and evolution, and topics in Galactic structure, evolution, and dynamics, that are being derived from these data.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Random-Phase Sampling Noise in the Cepheid Period-Luminosity Relation: A Cross-Filter Consistency Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Period-Luminosity (PL) relation is usually derived using time-averaged magnitudes, which require multiple-epoch observations to determine periods and adequately sample the light curves. Although single-epoch observations are more practical and require significantly less observational effort, they inherently introduce greater photometric scatter, leading to an increased dispersion in the derived Period-Luminosity relations. In this paper, we explore, in detail, a method that transforms single random-phase data to their mean-light values, using information obtained in other bands for the same Cepheid. This approach enables the accurate re-construction of mean-light PL relations for wavelengths observed with space-based facilities, for instance, where the number of epochs per star makes simple averaging or template fitting less than optimal, with the latter requiring very high-precision periods for predictive phasing. While applying this technique across multiple bands, from optical to mid-IR, we focus particularly on widely separated bands covering the mid-IR to the optical. We showcase this method using the J band (as being observed by JWST) as the random-phase component. Our results show that this correction reduces the scatter of the PL relation in the J band by a factor of approximately $0.7\times$, equivalent to increasing the number of random-phase observations by a factor of 10, needed to obtain the same increase in precision as delivered here.</description>

      <title>Joint Bayesian calibration and map-making for intensity mapping experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Line intensity maps have high dynamic range, and demand careful spectral and spatial calibration. We present a Bayesian framework for joint calibration and map-making using Gibbs sampling, which provides access to the full joint posterior of calibration and sky map parameters. Our data model incorporates instrumental noise based on the radiometer equation, capturing the coupling between noise level and system temperature without assuming a fixed noise amplitude. To enable unbiased and fast estimation of gain and system temperature, we develop an iterative generalised least squares (GLS) sampling method. Absolute flux calibration can be achieved either with external sources or internally using known signal injections, such as noise diodes. To handle stochastic gain variations, we introduce a $1/f$ noise model that avoids spurious periodic correlations in the time domain caused by the conventional assumption of diagonal DFT noise covariance. Furthermore, we implement this workflow in an efficient software package, using the Levinson algorithm and a polynomial emulator to reduce the computational complexity of noise parameter sampling, ensuring good scalability. Although demonstrated for auto-correlation measurements, the framework and techniques generalise to cross-correlation and interferometric data.</description>

      <title>Neural networks in the search for fast radio bursts with RATAN-600</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a technique to search for fast radio bursts in records obtained with broadband radiometers having few radio channels. The technique is applied to the RATAN-600 surveys carried out at its Western Sector since the year 2017. A 1D convolutional neural network for multichannel time series classification is developed based on the EfficientNet family of models. The procedure to generate synthetic FRB signals needed for the training dataset is described. We implement a two-stage cascade scheme to effectively suppress the rate of false positive detections. Evaluation of the trained model is provided based on the synthetic events and the giant pulse of the Crab Pulsar.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Impact of Lunar and Planetary Occultation on Experimental Global 21 cm Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The global 21 cm signal from the hyperfine transition of cosmic atomic hydrogen is theorised to track the state of the early Universe via the analysis of its absorption and emission with respect to the radio background. Detecting this signal has been a challenge for astronomers since it was first postulated due to the presence of strong galactic foregrounds obfuscating the transition. Forward modelling techniques that aim to simulate and then remove these foregrounds have been suggested as a workaround to this problem. This technique, however, requires a precise and accurate understanding of the foregrounds in question. As we move into the next major lunar standstill, the moon will be able to occult high power areas of the sky in ways that are unaccounted for by maps used to simulate these foregrounds, and thereby disrupt signal recovery. We show that in toy cases an occultation from the moon, or other proximate object, leading to a mismatch in our expected and actual foregrounds of 15 parts per million increases the error in signal recovery of up to 20\%. We show that this level of disruption can happen when the moon is found towards the centre of the galaxy and is amplified when this alignment happens at high directivity regions of the antenna beam, causing a disruption of up to 180 parts per million, leading to a signal recovery error of 115\%. This allows us to identify lunar alignment scenarios that should be actively avoided to preserve signal fidelity. We also demonstrate that a body with a smaller apparent size than the moon, such as Venus, is unlikely to cause any signal disruption due to occultation, giving a base map error of &lt;2 parts per million.</description>

      <title>Bayesian recalibration of flux scale factors in diffuse radio maps using low-resolution absolute radiometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Haslam 408 MHz all-sky map is widely used as a template to model the diffuse Galactic synchrotron emission at radio and microwave frequencies. Recent studies have suggested that there are large uncorrected flux scale errors in this map, however. We investigate the possibility of statistically recalibrating the Haslam map using absolutely-calibrated (but low angular resolution) radio experiments designed to measure the 21cm global signal at low frequencies. We construct a Gibbs sampling scheme to recover the full joint posterior distribution of $\sim 50,000$ parameters, representing the true sky brightness temperature field, as-yet uncorrected flux scale factors, and synchrotron power-law spectral indices. Using idealised full-sky simulated data, we perform a joint analysis of a $1^\circ$ resolution diffuse map at 408 MHz and multi-band 21cm global signal data with $30^\circ$ resolution under different assumptions about 1) noise levels in the maps, 2) sky coverage, and 3) synchrotron spectral index information. For our fiducial scenario in which the global signal experiment has a 50 mK noise rms per coarse pixel in each of 20 frequency bins between 50 -- 150 MHz, we find that the notional Haslam flux scale factors can be recovered in most (but not all) sub-regions of the sky to an accuracy of $\pm 2 \%$. In all cases we are able to rectify the sky map to within $\sim 5$ K of the true brightness temperature.</description>

      <title>Exploring Multi-view Symbolic Regression methods in physical sciences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Describing the world behavior through mathematical functions help scientists to achieve a better understanding of the inner mechanisms of different phenomena. Traditionally, this is done by deriving new equations from first principles and careful observations. A modern alternative is to automate part of this process with symbolic regression (SR). The SR algorithms search for a function that adequately fits the observed data while trying to enforce sparsity, in the hopes of generating an interpretable equation. A particularly interesting extension to these algorithms is the Multi-view Symbolic Regression (MvSR). It searches for a parametric function capable of describing multiple datasets generated by the same phenomena, which helps to mitigate the common problems of overfitting and data scarcity. Recently, multiple implementations added support to MvSR with small differences between them. In this paper, we test and compare MvSR as supported in Operon, PySR, phy-SO, and eggp, in different real-world datasets. We show that they all often achieve good accuracy while proposing solutions with only few free parameters. However, we find that certain features enable a more frequent generation of better models. We conclude by providing guidelines for future MvSR developments.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Recoil and Suppression of Super Massive Black Hole Seeds in the Early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of gravitational-wave (GW) recoil on the growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the early Universe. Forming ~10^9 Msun SMBHs by z ~ 6 is challenging and may require hierarchical mergers of smaller seed black holes. We extend a semi-analytic seed model (Sassano et al. 2021) by explicitly incorporating GW recoil physics. Our model includes: (1) recoil velocity formulae calibrated to numerical relativity for spinning, unequal-mass BH binaries (Campanelli et al. 2007; Lousto et al. 2012); (2) assignment of spin magnitudes and orientations based on seed type (Pop III remnant, stellar cluster, or direct-collapse); and (3) a retention probability scheme comparing the recoil speed to the host halo escape velocity. We find that including GW recoil reduces final SMBH masses by ~20-30% by z = 6 and creates a population of off-nuclear ("wandering") BHs amounting to a few percent of the total. Observable consequences include spatial offsets ~0.1 arcsec and line-of-sight velocity shifts ~10^2-10^3 km/s in a few percent of high-z quasars.

      <title>LEO-Vetter: Fully Automated Flux- and Pixel-Level Vetting of TESS Planet Candidates to Support Occurrence Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has identified several thousand planet candidates orbiting a wide variety of stars, and has provided an exciting opportunity for demographic studies. However, current TESS planet searches require significant manual inspection efforts to identify planets among the enormous number of detected transit-like signatures, which limits the scope of such searches. Demographic studies also require a detailed understanding of the relationship between observed and true exoplanet populations; a task for which current TESS planet catalogs are rendered unsuitable by the subjectivity of vetting by eye. We present LEO-Vetter, a publicly available and fully automated exoplanet vetting system designed after the Kepler Robovetter, which is capable of efficiently producing catalogs of promising planet candidates and making statistically robust TESS demographic studies possible. LEO-Vetter implements flux- and pixel-level tests against noise/systematic false positives and astrophysical false positives. The vetter achieves high completeness (91%) and high reliability against noise/systematic false alarms (97%) based on its performance on simulated data. We demonstrate the usefulness of the vetter by searching ~200,000 M dwarf light curves, and reducing ~20,000 transit-like detections down to 172 uniformly vetted planet candidates. LEO-Vetter facilitates analyses that would otherwise be impractical to perform on all possible signals due to time constraints or computational limitations. Users will be able to efficiently produce their own TESS planet catalog starting with transit-like detections, as well as have the framework needed to characterize their catalog's completeness and reliability for occurrence rates.</description>

      <title>Dust Attenuation of Lyman-Werner Feedback: Reassessing Early Super Massive Black Holes Seed Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of dust shielding on Lyman-Werner (LW) radiation fields and its implications for supermassive black hole (SMBH) seed formation at high redshift. Using an updated version of the GAMETE/QSOdust semi-analytical model, we implement a simple dust shielding prescription that accounts for the absorption of LW photons by dust grains. We find that even modest dust enrichment can significantly reduce the effective LW radiation field, allowing H2 cooling to persist in regions previously thought to be affected by LW feedback. This changes the conditions for seed formation, particularly for heavy seeds which require suppression of H2 cooling. Our results suggest that dust shielding extends the redshift range and volume where heavy seeds can form, and significantly alters the relative importance of different seed populations. We discuss the implications for the formation of high-redshift SMBHs and future observations.</description>

      <title>High-Precision Measurement of D($\gamma$, $n$)$p$ Photodisintegration Reaction and Implications for Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on a high-precision measurement of the D($\gamma$, $n$)$p$ photodisintegration reaction at the newly commissioned Shanghai Laser Electron Gamma Source (SLEGS), employing a quasi-monochromatic $\gamma$-ray beam from Laser Compton Scattering. The cross sections were determined over $E_\gamma$=2.327-7.089 MeV, achieving up to a factor of 2.2 improvement in precision near the neutron separation threshold. Combined with previous data in a global Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis using dibaryon effective field theory, we obtained the unprecedentedly precise $p$($n$, $\gamma$)D cross sections and thermonuclear rate, with a precision up to 3.8 times higher than previous evaluations. Implemented in a standard Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) framework, this new rate decreases uncertainty of the key cosmological parameter of baryon density $\Omega_b h^2$ by up to $\approx$16% relative to the LUNA result. A residual $\approx$1.2$\sigma$ tension between $\Omega_b h^2$ constrained from primordial D/H observations and CMB measurements persists, highlighting the need for improved $dd$ reaction rates and offering potential hints of new physics beyond the standard model of cosmology.</description>

      <title>Precise Measurement of the Absolute Sky Brightness at 60 to 350 MHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise measurement of the sky radio brightness below 1 GHz and estimation of any unaccounted-for extragalactic brightness is required to understand the Galactic cosmic ray electron spectrum, to constrain populations of nanojansky radio sources, and to constrain dark matter annihilation or decay. The foreground radio brightness must also be accurately accounted for when measuring the cosmic background radiation and departures from its Planck spectrum that trace astrophysical processes in the early Universe, cosmic dark ages, cosmic dawn and the epoch of reionisation. Here we report a new, precision measurement of the sky spectral brightness over radio frequencies from 60 MHz to 350 MHz. Our measurement motivates a significant correction to previous all-sky images made in this band and the Global Sky Model (GSM) that is constructed from these and other sky images made at radio wavelengths. We find that the GSM requires subtraction of an offset exceeding 100K below 100 MHz and scaling up by a factor of approximately 1.2 below 200 MHz rising to a factor of 1.5 at 350 MHz, thus significantly enhancing previous estimates of unaccounted excess in radio sky brightness. Our measurements were made with a new receiver architecture that dynamically self-calibrates for receiver noise and bandpass in situ, while connected to an antenna. We used a single, accurately modelled, wideband logperiodic antenna placed on a 40m diameter ground mesh. Our accurate measurement requires upward revision of sky brightness and motivates revisiting models for source populations and dark matter decay. Additionally, sky models scaled to our measurements serve as a stable reference in calibrating the absolute flux density scale for low-frequency radio telescopes. This will be important for calibration accuracy of the SKA-Low telescope, that will operate at the frequencies of our measurements.</description>

      <title>Can LIGO Detect Daylight Savings Time?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Yes, it can.
  Catalogs produced by networks of Gravitational-wave interferometers are subject to complicated selection effects, and the gold-standard remains direct measurements of the detection probability through large injection campaigns. I leverage public data products from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaborations' 3rd and 4th observing runs to show that there are non-trivial temporal variations within the detection probability that are well-described by a weekly cycle. There are clear differences between weekends and weekdays, between day and night (at the sites), and even between daylight-savings and standard time. I discuss possible causes for this behavior and implications.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Pierre Auger Observatory, dedicated to measuring ultra-high energy cosmic rays, has been promoting for more than two decades educational and scientific outreach activities to make its results known in an understandable language to diverse audiences. Among its most notable efforts, we can mention the creation of a visitor center at the Observatory site in Malarg\"ue, Argentina, the production of brochures, posters, videos, talks, and special actions with the community in the site of the Observatory and beyond. In addition to joint efforts, collaborators from participating countries carry out local efforts, some of them related to national initiatives in their respective regions, such as the International Cosmic Day, Masterclasses, exhibitions of artworks with the theme of astroparticles, the Night of the Stars, European Researchers' Night, summer schools and initiatives to improve the gender balance in the science community. In addition, there have been board games based on the dynamics of the observatory's work, online graphic viewers of the different events, talks, workshops, etc. In recent years, the Pierre Auger Outreach group has focused on presenting actions that directly impact the community in Malarg\"ue. However, this time, special emphasis will be placed on highlighting the outreach efforts of Pierre Auger collaborators in various countries.</description>

      <title>Letter of Intent: 100m Atom Interferometer Experiment at CERN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an O(100)m Atom Interferometer (AI) experiment to be installed against a wall of the PX46 access shaft to the LHC. This experiment would probe unexplored ranges of the possible couplings of bosonic ultralight dark matter (ULDM) to atomic constituents and undertake a pioneering search for gravitational waves (GWs) at frequencies intermediate between those to which existing and planned experiments are sensitive, among other fundamental physics studies. A conceptual feasibility study showed that this AI experiment could be isolated from the LHC by installing a shielding wall in the TX46 gallery, and surveyed issues related to the proximity of the LHC machine, finding no technical obstacles. A detailed technical implementation study has shown that the preparatory civil-engineering work, installation of bespoke radiation shielding, deployment of access-control systems and safety alarms, and installation of an elevator platform could be carried out during LS3, allowing installation and operation of the detector to proceed during Run 4 without impacting HL-LHC operation. These studies have established that PX46 is a uniquely promising location for an AI experiment. We foresee that, if the CERN management encourages this Letter of Intent, a significant fraction of the Terrestrial Very Long Baseline Atom Interferometer (TVLBAI) Proto-Collaboration may wish to contribute to such an AI experiment.</description>

      <title>Atacama Cosmology Telescope: Constraints on the Millimetre Flux of the Crab Pulsar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Millimeter-wave observations of pulsars, while crucial for understanding their emission mechanisms, remain scarce. We demonstrate that high-precision cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments like the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), though designed for cosmology, offer a unique capability for such time-domain science due to their high cadence and broad sky coverage in millimeter bands. While previous ACT searches have focused on transients lasting minutes or longer, we develop and validate analysis methods to search for periodic, millisecond-scale transients, a capability not typically associated with CMB experiments. We describe a phase-resolved mapmaking approach, which leverages the known periodicity of the signal to enhance sensitivity and offers advantages in diagnosing systematic errors. We also introduce a template-based fit to the raw data timestreams that independently validate our results. Applying these methods to estimate the millimeter flux of the Crab Pulsar (PSR B0531+21), we derive 95% confidence upper limits of 4.6 mJy, 4.4 mJy, and 20.7 mJy on the pulsar's period-averaged flux density at 96 GHz, 148 GHz, and 225 GHz, respectively. These constraints fill a gap in our knowledge of the Crab Pulsar's spectral energy distribution, suggesting that it does not significantly flatten or invert at millimeter wavelengths. This work demonstrates the potential for future searches of short-timescale astrophysical phenomena with the next-generation CMB experiments like the Simons Observatory.</description>

      <title>Radio Galaxy Zoo: Morphological classification by Fanaroff-Riley designation using self-supervised pre-training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we examine over 14,000 radio galaxies finely selected from Radio Galaxy Zoo (RGZ) project and provide classifications for approximately 5,900 FRIs and 8,100 FRIIs. We present an analysis of these predicted radio galaxy morphologies for the RGZ catalogue, classified using a pre-trained radio galaxy foundation model that has been fine-tuned to predict Fanaroff-Riley (FR) morphology. As seen in previous studies, our results show overlap between morphologically classified FRI and FRII luminosity-size distributions and we find that the model's confidence in its predictions is lowest in this overlap region, suggesting that source morphologies are more ambiguous. We identify the presence of low-luminosity FRII sources, the proportion of which, with respect to the total number of FRIIs, is consistent with previous studies. However, a comparison of the low-luminosity FRII sources found in this work with those identified by previous studies reveals differences that may indicate their selection is influenced by the choice of classification methodology. We investigate the impacts of both pre-training and fine-tuning data selection on model performance for the downstream classification task, and show that while different pre-training data choices affect model confidence they do not appear to cause systematic generalisation biases for the range of physical and observational characteristics considered in this work; however, we note that the same is not necessarily true for fine-tuning. As automated approaches to astronomical source identification and classification become increasingly prevalent, we highlight training data choices that can affect the model outputs and propagate into downstream analyses.</description>

      <title>Periodic Variations in Visible Light Brightness as Tracers of Fine Coronal Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quiescent or dynamic nature of fine scale ray-like features in the sun corona, observed in visible light, is still an open question. Here, we show that most of daily and hourly periodic variations in visible light brightness of the high corona (up to 15 Rs) are aligned to the tip of streamers and are consistent with the periodicity of plasma release from simulations of tearing-induced magnetic reconnection at the heliospheric current sheet. The areas in which we detect periodicities can be used as tracers of non-quiescent fine coronal rays. This also allows their distinction from coronal rays more likely to be real quiescent features or associated with smaller and/or faster unresolved brightness variations. In the low- and middle-corona (down to 1.4 Rs) similar brightness variations are observed along loop-like and cusp-like features marking boundaries of streamers which then connect to radial features in the high corona. This suggests the presence of additional mechanisms in the low- and middle-corona periodically releasing density structures in the solar wind. The periodicity distributions show a solar cycle modulation with shorter periods (smaller structures) during solar maximum. Periodicities are observed within streamers during solar minimum, but are visible at all latitudes, even extending radially from the poles, during solar maximum.</description>

      <title>YOLO-CIANNA: Galaxy detection with deep learning in radio data: II. Winning the SKA SDC2 using a generalized 3D-YOLO network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the scientific exploitation of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) approaches, there is a need for new advanced data analysis and visualization tools capable of processing large high-dimensional datasets. In this study, we aim to generalize the YOLO-CIANNA deep learning source detection and characterization method for 3D hyperspectral HI emission cubes. We present the adaptations we made to the regression-based detection formalism and the construction of an end-to-end 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) backbone. We then describe a processing pipeline for applying the method to simulated 3D HI cubes from the SKA Observatory Science Data Challenge 2 (SDC2) dataset. The YOLO-CIANNA method was originally developed and used by the MINERVA team that won the official SDC2 competition. Despite the public release of the full SDC2 dataset, no published result has yet surpassed MINERVA's top score. In this paper, we present an updated version of our method that improves our challenge score by 9.5%. The resulting catalog exhibits a high detection purity of 92.3%, best-in-class characterization accuracy, and contains 45% more confirmed sources than concurrent classical detection tools. The method is also computationally efficient, processing the full ~1TB SDC2 data cube in 30 min on a single GPU. These state-of-the-art results highlight the effectiveness of 3D CNN-based detectors for processing large hyperspectral data cubes and represent a promising step toward applying YOLO-CIANNA to observational data from SKA and its precursors.</description>

      <title>An Optomechanical Accelerometer Search for Ultralight Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use a cavity optomechanical accelerometer to perform a resonant search for ultralight dark matter at acoustic frequencies near 39 kHz (a particle mass of $0.16$ neV/$c^2$). The accelerometer is based on a Si$_3$N$_4$ membrane, cryogenically cooled to 4 K, with photothermal heating employed to scan the resonance frequency by $10^2$ detector linewidths. Leveraging shot-noise-limited displacement readout and radiation pressure feedback cooling, we realize an acceleration resolution of $\sim 10\;\text{n}g_0/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ over a bandwidth of $30$ Hz near the fundamental test mass resonance. We find no evidence of a dark matter signal and infer an upper bound on the coupling to normal matter that is several orders of magnitude above the stringent bounds set by equivalence principle experiments. We outline a path toward novel dark matter constraints in future experiments by exploiting arrays of mass-loaded optomechanical sensors at lower temperature probed with distributed squeezed light.</description>

      <title>Using the antenna impedance to estimate soil electrical parameters for the MIST global 21-cm experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19401v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radio experiments trying to detect the global $21$~cm signal from the early Universe are very sensitive to the electrical properties of their environment. For ground-based experiments with the antenna above the soil it is critical to characterize the effect from the soil on the sky observations. This characterization requires estimating the soil's electrical conductivity and relative permittivity in the same frequency range as the observations. Here we present our initial effort to estimate the conductivity and relative permittivity of the soil using the impedance of an antenna mounted at a distance above the surface. In this technique, the antenna used for soil characterization is the same as the antenna used for sky observations. To demonstrate the technique we use the antenna of the MIST global $21$~cm experiment. We measured the antenna impedance at three sites in the Greater Concepci\'on area, Chile. The measurements were done between $25$ and $125$~MHz, matching the range used by MIST for sky observations. The soil parameters were estimated by fitting the impedance measurements with electromagnetic simulations of the antenna and soil. In this initial effort the soil was modeled as homogeneous. The conductivity at the three sites was found to be between $0.007$ and $0.049$~Sm$^{-1}$, and the relative permittivity between $1.6$ and $12.7$. The percent precision of the estimates at $68\%$ probability is, with one exception, better (lower) than $33\%$. The best-fit simulations have a better than $10\%$ agreement with the measurements relative to the peak values of the resistance and reactance across our frequency range. For MIST, these results represent a successful proof of concept of the use of the antenna impedance for soil characterization, and are expected to significantly improve in future implementations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10038v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of observational capabilities in astronomy has led to an exponential growth in the volume of light curve (LC) data, creating both opportunities and challenges for time-domain astronomy. Traditional analytical methods often struggle to fully extract the scientific value of these large and complex datasets. Machine learning (ML) algorithms are increasingly used for LC analysis, enabling classification, prediction, pattern discovery and anomaly detection. However, research in this area remains fragmented, with no comprehensive synthesis of how ML methods address the specific challenges of LC data. Key difficulties include class imbalance, noisy or sparse measurements, effective feature extraction, and limited interpretability of models. This lack of a unified overview makes it difficult for researchers to identify suitable approaches or recognize unresolved problems that require methodological advances. To address this gap, this survey systematically reviews ML techniques applied to LC analysis, outlining their principles and applications in tasks such as exoplanet detection, variable star classification and supernova identification. By clarifying the current state of the field and highlighting open challenges, this work provides guidance for future research and supports the effective integration of ML into astronomical big data studies.</description>

      <title>High Dimensional Beam Inference II: Inference of a Perturbed HERA Beam from Simulated Visibility Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate beam modeling is important in many radio astronomy applications. In this paper, we focus on beam modeling for 21-cm intensity mapping experiments using radio interferometers, though the techniques also apply to single dish experiments with small modifications. In 21-cm intensity mapping, beam models are usually determined from highly detailed electromagnetic simulations of the receiver system. However, these simulations are expensive, and therefore have limited ability to describe practical imperfections in the beam pattern. We present a fully analytic Bayesian inference framework to infer a beam pattern from the interferometric visibilities assuming a particular sky model and that the beam pattern for all elements is identical, allowing one to capture deviations from the ideal beam for relatively low computational cost. We represent the beam using a sparse Fourier-Bessel basis on a projection of the hemisphere to the unit disc, but the framework applies to any linear basis expansion of the primary beam. We test the framework on simulated visibilities from an unpolarized sky, ignoring mutual coupling of array elements. We successfully recover the simulated, perturbed power beam when the sky model is perfect. Briefly exploring sky model inaccuracies, we find that beam inferences are sensitive to them, so we suggest jointly modeling uncertainties in the sky and beam in related inference tasks.</description>

Abstract: LiteBIRD, the Lite (Light) satellite for the study of $B$-mode polarization and Inflation from cosmic background Radiation Detection, is a space mission focused on primordial cosmology and fundamental physics. In this paper, we present the LiteBIRD Simulation Framework (LBS), a Python package designed for the implementation of pipelines that model the outputs of the data acquisition process from the three instruments on the LiteBIRD spacecraft: LFT (Low-Frequency Telescope), MFT (Mid-Frequency Telescope), and HFT (High-Frequency Telescope). LBS provides several modules to simulate the scanning strategy of the telescopes, the measurement of realistic polarized radiation coming from the sky (including the Cosmic Microwave Background itself, the Solar and Kinematic dipole, and the diffuse foregrounds emitted by the Galaxy), the generation of instrumental noise and the effect of systematic errors, like pointing wobbling, non-idealities in the Half-Wave Plate, et cetera. Additionally, we present the implementation of a simple but complete pipeline that showcases the main features of LBS. We also discuss how we ensured that LBS lets people develop pipelines whose results are accurate and reproducible. A full end-to-end pipeline has been developed using LBS to characterize the scientific performance of the LiteBIRD experiment. This pipeline and the results of the first simulation run are presented in Puglisi et al. (2025).</description>

      <title>The Optical and Mechanical Design of POEMMA Balloon with Radio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: POEMMA Balloon with Radio (PBR) is a NASA super-pressure balloon mission building toward the proposed Probe Of Extreme Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (POEMMA) dual satellite mission. In its planned 2027 launch, PBR will study Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays, Neutrinos, and High-Altitude Horizontal Airshowers from 33 km above the Earth. By operating at balloon altitudes, PBR will provide a novel vantage point to study air-shower physics while offering competitive instantaneous exposure to neutrinos from transient astrophysical phenomena. The payload's optical instrument is a 0.95 m$^2$ aperture hybrid Schmidt telescope with a 3.81 m$^2$ segmented mirror focusing light onto a Fluorescence Camera and a bi-focalized Cherenkov Camera. The payload will also feature a Radio Instrument consisting of two sinuous antennas based on the Payload for Ultrahigh Energy Observations (PUEO) low-frequency instrument. A combined gamma ray/x-ray detector and IR cloud camera round out the instrumentation package, meaning PBR will be the first multi-hybrid balloon-borne multi-messenger observatory flown. This extensive instrumentation must be combined into a radio quiet payload that satisfies the scientific needs and can operate in near vacuum at extreme temperatures, all while meeting NASA safety requirements and weighing no more than 3000 lbs (1361 kg). Accomplishing these tasks together will mark a significant step toward establishing technological readiness for the POEMMA satellite mission. We present an overview of PBR's mechanical and optical systems, additionally detailing our strategies to mitigate electromagnetic interference for the radio instrument and prepare for the harsh near-space environment.</description>

      <title>Incorporating Magnetic Field Characteristics into EUV-Based Automated Segmentation of Coronal Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coronal holes (CHs) are magnetically open regions that allow hot coronal plasma to escape from the Sun and form the high-speed solar wind. This wind can interact with Earth's magnetic field. For this reason, developing an accurate understanding of CH regions is vital for understanding space weather and its effects on Earth. The process of identifying CH regions typically relies on extreme ultraviolet (EUV) imagery, leveraging the fact that CHs appear dark at these wavelengths. Accurate identification of CHs in EUV, however, can be difficult due to a variety of factors, including stray light from nearby regions, limb brightening, and the presence of filaments (which also appear dark, but are not sources of solar wind). In order to overcome these issues, this work incorporates photospheric magnetic field data into a classical EUV-based segmentation algorithm based on the active contours without edges (ACWE) segmentation method. In this work magnetic field data are incorporated directly into the segmentation process, serving both as a method for removing non-CH regions in advance, and as a method to constrain evolution of the segmented CH boundary. This reduces the presence of filaments while allowing the segmentation to include CH regions that may be difficult to identify due to inconsistent intensities.</description>

      <title>QSHS: An Axion Dark Matter Resonant Search Apparatus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe a resonant cavity search apparatus for axion dark matter constructed by the Quantum Sensors for the Hidden Sector (QSHS) collaboration. The apparatus is configured to search for QCD axion dark matter, though also has the capability to detect axion-like particles (ALPs), dark photons, and some other forms of wave-like dark matter. Initially, a tuneable cylindrical oxygen-free copper cavity is read out using a low noise microwave amplifier feeding a heterodyne receiver. The cavity is housed in a dilution refrigerator and threaded by a solenoidal magnetic field, nominally 8T. The apparatus also houses a magnetic field shield for housing superconducting electronics, and several other fixed-frequency resonators for use in testing and commissioning various prototype quantum electronic devices sensitive at a range of axion masses in the range 2.0 to 40 micro-eV/c2. The apparatus as currently configured is intended as a test stand for electronics over the relatively wide frequency band attainable with the TM010 cavity mode used for axion searches. We present performance data for the resonator, dilution refrigerator, and magnet, and plans for the first science run.</description>

      <title>A pipeline for searching and fitting instrumental glitches in LISA data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19870v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Instrumental artefacts, such as glitches, can significantly compromise the scientific output of LISA. Our methodology employs advanced Bayesian techniques, including Reversible Jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo and parallel tempering to find and characterize glitches and astrophysical signals. The robustness of the pipeline is demonstrated through its ability to simultaneously handle diverse glitch morphologies and it is validated with a 'Spritz'-type data set from the LISA Data Challenge. Our approach enables accurate inference on Massive Black Hole Binaries, while simultaneously characterizing both instrumental artefacts and noise. These results present a significant development in strategies for differentiating between instrumental noise and astrophysical signals, which will ultimately improve the accuracy and reliability of source population analyses with LISA.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Inference of Gravity through Realistic 3D Modeling of Wide Binary Orbits: General Algorithm and a Pilot Study with HARPS Radial Velocities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11996v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When 3D relative displacement $\mathbf{r}$ and velocity $\mathbf{v}$ between the pair in a gravitationally-bound system are precisely measured, the six measured quantities at one phase can allow elliptical orbit solutions at a given gravitational parameter $G$. Due to degeneracies between orbital-geometric parameters and $G$, individual Bayesian inferences and their statistical consolidation are needed to infer $G$ as recently suggested by a Bayesian 3D modeling algorithm. Here I present a fully general Bayesian algorithm suitable for wide binaries with two (almost) exact sky-projected relative positions (as in the Gaia data release 3) and the other four sufficiently precise quantities. Wide binaries meeting the requirements of the general algorithm to allow for its full potential are rare at present, largely because the measurement uncertainty of the line-of-sight (radial) separation is usually larger than the true separation. As a pilot study, the algorithm is applied to 32 Gaia binaries for which precise HARPS radial velocities are available. The value of $\Gamma \equiv \log_{10}\sqrt{G/G_{\rm N}}$ (where $G_{\rm N}$ is Newton's constant) is $-0.002_{-0.018}^{+0.012}$ supporting Newton for a combination of 24 binaries with Newtonian acceleration $g_{\rm N}&gt;10^{-9}$m s$^{-2}$, while it is $\Gamma=0.063_{-0.047}^{+0.058}$ or $0.134_{-0.040}^{+0.050}$ for $7\text{ or }8$ binaries with $g_{\rm N}&lt;10^{-9}$m s$^{-2}$ (depending on one system) showing tension with Newton. The Newtonian ``outlier'' is at the boundary set by the Newtonian escape velocity, but can be consistent with modified gravity. The pilot study demonstrates the potential of the algorithm in measuring gravity at low acceleration with future samples of wide binaries.</description>

      <title>A fast machine learning tool to predict the composition of astronomical ices from infrared absorption spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current observations taken by James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) allow us to observe the absorption features of icy mantles that cover interstellar dust grains, which are mainly composed of $\mathrm{H_2O}$, $\mathrm{CO}$, and $\mathrm{CO_2}$, along with other minor species. Thanks to its sensitivity and spectral resolution, JWST has the potential to observe ice features towards hundreds of sources at different stages along the process of star formation. However, identifying the spectral features of the different species and quantifying the ice composition is not trivial and requires complex spectroscopic analysis. We present Automatic Ice Composition Estimator (AICE), a new tool based on artificial neural networks. Based on the infrared (IR) ice absorption spectrum between 2.5 and 10 microns, AICE predicts the ice fractional composition in terms of $\mathrm{H_2O}$, $\mathrm{CO}$, $\mathrm{CO_2}$, $\mathrm{CH_3OH}$, $\mathrm{NH_3}$, and $\mathrm{CH_4}$. To train the model, we used hundreds of laboratory experiments of ice mixtures from different databases, which were reprocessed with baseline subtraction and normalisation. Once trained, AICE takes less than one second on a conventional computer to predict the ice composition associated with the observed IR absorption spectrum, with typical errors of $\sim$3 $\%$ in the species fraction. We tested its performance on two spectra reported towards the NIR38 and J110621 background stars observed within the JWST Ice Age program, demonstrating a good agreement with previous estimations of the ice composition. The fast and accurate performance of AICE enables the systematic analysis of hundreds of different ice spectra with a modest time investment. In addition, this model can be enhanced and re-trained with more laboratory data, improving the precision of the predictions and expanding the list of predicted species.</description>
