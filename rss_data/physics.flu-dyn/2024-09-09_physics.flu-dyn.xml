      <title>Dissipative Collisions of Impinging Liquid Jets Having Uniform Velocity Profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dissipation of energy in the impingement zone from the collision of impinging, free, equal jets of liquids was investigated by comparison with studies on the energy dissipation from the collision of impinging, free, equal sheets of liquids. Loss of energy was studied in terms of the coefficient of restitution (COR) of the collision. With few exceptions, previous analytical studies have assumed that there is no loss of energy resulting from the collision of the jets (COR = 1), and for jets with uniform velocity profiles, the sheet velocity (velocity after the collision) is equal to the jet velocity (velocity before the collision). In this study, mass and momentum balances of impinging jets with uniform velocity profiles are revised to include the impact of non-equal velocities (COR &lt; 1). After development of the applicable theory, the COR for impinging jets is calculated from available data in the literature on jet and sheet velocities as well as the location of the stagnation point in the impingement zone. Simple empirical correlations were developed for 1) the COR of impinging jets as a function of impingement angle and 2) the relationship of the location of the stagnation point to the COR. A theoretical equation was also derived for the impact of dissipative collisions on the thickness distribution in the liquid sheet.</description>

      <title>Annular Newtonian Poiseuille flow with pressure-dependent wall slip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of pressure-dependent wall slip on the steady Newtonian annular Poiseuille flow employing Navier's slip law with a slip parameter that varies exponentially with pressure. The dimensionless governing equations and accompanying auxiliary conditions are solved analytically up to second order by implementing a regular perturbation scheme in terms of the small dimensionless pressure-dependence slip parameter. An explicit formula for the average pressure drop, required to maintain a constant volumetric flowrate, is also derived. This is suitably post-processed by applying a convergence acceleration technique to increase the accuracy of the original perturbation series. The effects of pressure-dependent wall slip are more pronounced when wall slip is weak. However, as the slip coefficient increases, these effects are moderated and eventually eliminated as the perfect slip case is approached. The results show that the average pressure drop remains practically constant until the Reynolds number becomes sufficiently large. It is worth noting that all phenomena associated with pressure-dependent wall slip are amplified as the annular gap is reduced.</description>

      <title>Localized performance of riblets with curved cross-sectional profiles in boundary layers past finite length bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Riblets are a well-known passive drag reduction technique with the potential for as much as 9% reduction in the frictional drag force in laboratory settings, and proven benefits for large scale aircraft. However, less information is available on the applicability of these textures for smaller air/waterborne vehicles where assumptions such as periodicity and/or asymptotic nature of the boundary layer no longer apply and the shape of the bodies of these vehicles can give rise to moderate levels of pressure drag. Here, we explore the effect of riblets on both sides of a finite-size foil consisting of a streamlined leading edge and a flat body. We use high resolution two-dimensional, two-component particle image velocimetry, with a double illumination and consecutive-overlapping imaging technique to capture the velocity field in both the boundary layer and the far field. We find the local velocity profiles and shear stress distribution, as well as the frictional and pressure components of the drag force and show the possibility of achieving reduction in both the fictional and pressure components of the drag force and record cumulative drag reduction as much as 6%. We present the intertwined relationship between the distribution of the spanwise-averaged shear stress distribution, the characteristics of the velocity profiles, and the pressure distribution around the body, and how the local distribution of these parameters work together or against each other in enhancing or diminishing the drag-reducing ability of the riblets for the entirety of the body of interest.</description>

      <title>Single-snapshot machine learning for turbulence super resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern machine-learning techniques are generally considered data-hungry. However, this may not be the case for turbulence as each of its snapshots can hold more information than a single data file in general machine-learning applications. This study asks the question of whether nonlinear machine-learning techniques can effectively extract physical insights even from as little as a single snapshot of a turbulent vortical flow. As an example, we consider machine-learning-based super-resolution analysis that reconstructs a high-resolution field from low-resolution data for two-dimensional decaying turbulence. We reveal that a carefully designed machine-learning model trained with flow tiles sampled from only a single snapshot can reconstruct vortical structures across a range of Reynolds numbers. Successful flow reconstruction indicates that nonlinear machine-learning techniques can leverage scale-invariance properties to learn turbulent flows. We further show that training data of turbulent flows can be cleverly collected from a single snapshot by considering characteristics of rotation and shear tensors. The present findings suggest that embedding prior knowledge in designing a model and collecting data is important for a range of data-driven analyses for turbulent flows. More broadly, this work hopes to stop machine-learning practitioners from being wasteful with turbulent flow data.</description>

      <title>Flamelet Connection to Turbulence Kinetic Energy Dissipation Rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An analysis takes the variable value for turbulence kinetic energy dissipation rate $\epsilon$ as it might appear from a turbulent combustion computation using either Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) or large-eddy simulation (LES) and relates it to both viscous dissipation rate and turbulence kinetic energy at the Kolmogorov scale. The imposed strain rate and vorticity on these smallest eddies are readily and uniquely determined from knowledge of that kinetic energy and viscous dissipation rate. Thus, a given value of $\epsilon$ at a specific time and location determines the two mechanical constraints (vorticity and strain rate) on the inflow to the flamelet. It is also shown how $\epsilon$ affects the sign of the Laplacian of pressure, which must be negative to allow the existence of the flamelet. Using several different flamelet models, with and without vorticity and with and without differential mass transport, different results for maximum flamelet temperature, integrated flamelet burning rate, and stoichiometric flamelet scalar dissipation rate are obtained. For a given $\epsilon$ value, flamelet models that do not consider vorticity and differential diffusion produce substantial errors in the information to be provided to the resolved or filtered scales in a turbulent combustion computation.</description>

      <title>Online learning of eddy-viscosity and backscattering closures for geophysical turbulence using ensemble Kalman inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Different approaches to using data-driven methods for subgrid-scale closure modeling have emerged recently. Most of these approaches are data-hungry, and lack interpretability and out-of-distribution generalizability. Here, we use {online} learning to address parametric uncertainty of well-known physics-based large-eddy simulation (LES) closures: the Smagorinsky (Smag) and Leith eddy-viscosity models (1 free parameter) and the Jansen-Held (JH) backscattering model (2 free parameters). For 8 cases of 2D geophysical turbulence, optimal parameters are estimated, using ensemble Kalman inversion (EKI), such that for each case, the LES' energy spectrum matches that of direct numerical simulation (DNS). Only a small training dataset is needed to calculate the DNS spectra (i.e., the approach is {data-efficient}). We find the optimized parameter(s) of each closure to be constant across broad flow regimes that differ in dominant length scales, eddy/jet structures, and dynamics, suggesting that these closures are {generalizable}. In a-posteriori tests based on the enstrophy spectra and probability density functions (PDFs) of vorticity, LES with optimized closures outperform the baselines (LES with standard Smag, dynamic Smag or Leith), particularly at the tails of the PDFs (extreme events). In a-priori tests, the optimized JH significantly outperforms the baselines and optimized Smag and Leith in terms of interscale enstrophy and energy transfers (still, optimized Smag noticeably outperforms standard Smag). The results show the promise of combining advances in physics-based modeling (e.g., JH) and data-driven modeling (e.g., {online} learning with EKI) to develop data-efficient frameworks for accurate, interpretable, and generalizable closures.</description>

      <title>Air jet impact craters on granular surfaces: a universal scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Craters form as the lander's exhaust interacts with the planetary surfaces. Understanding this phenomenon is imperative to ensure safe landings. We investigate crater morphology, where a turbulent air jet impinges on the granular surfaces. To reveal the fundamental aspect of this phenomenon, systematic experiments are performed with various air jet velocities, nozzle positions, and grain properties. The resultant crater morphology is characterized by an aspect ratio. We find a universal scaling law in which the aspect ratio is scaled by the dimensionless variable consisting of air velocity at the nozzle, speed of sound in air, nozzle diameter, nozzle tip distance from the surface, grain diameter, the density of grains, and density of air. The obtained scaling reveals the crossover of the length scales governing crater aspect ratio, providing a useful guideline for ensuring safe landings. Moreover, we report a novel drop shaped subsurface cratering phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Particle resuspension from complex multilayer deposits by laminar flows: statistical analysis and modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particle resuspension refers to the physical process by which solid particles deposited on a surface are, first, detached and, then, entrained away by the action of a fluid flow. In this study, we explore the dynamics of large and heavy spherical particles forming a complex sediment bed which is exposed to a laminar shear flow. For that purpose, we rely on fine-scale simulations based on a fully-resolved flow field around individual particles whose motion is explicitly tracked. Using statistical tools, we characterize several features: (a) the overall bed dynamics (e.g. the average particle velocity as a function of the elevation), (b) the evolution of the top surface of the sediment bed (e.g. distribution of the surface elevation or of the surface slope) and (c) the dynamics of individual particles as they detach from or re-attach to the sediment bed (including the frequency of these events, and the velocity difference / surface angle for each event). These results show that particles detach more frequently around the peaks in the top surface of the sediment bed and that, once detached, they undergo short hops as particles quickly sediment towards the sediment bed. A simple model based on the surface characteristics (including its slope and elevation) is proposed to reproduce the detachment ratio.</description>

      <title>Lattice Boltzmann Model for Transonic Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hydrodynamic limit of a discrete kinetic equation is intrinsically connected with the symmetry of the lattices used in construction of a discrete velocity model. On mixed lattices composed of standard lattices the sixth-order (and higher) moment is often not isotropic and thus they are insufficient to ensure correct imposition of the hydrodynamic moments. This makes the task of developing lattice Boltzmann model for transonic flows quite challenging. We address this by decoupling the physical space lattice from the velocity space lattice to construct a lattice Boltzmann model with very high isotropy. The model is entirely on-lattice like the isothermal models, achieves a Mach number of two with only $81$ discrete velocities, and admits a simple generalization of equilibrium distribution used in isothermal equilibrium. We also present a number of realistic benchmark problems to show that the lattice Boltzmann model with a limited number of velocities is not only feasible for transonic flow but is also quite simple and efficient like its subsonic counterpart.</description>

      <title>Inverse cascade in zonal flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zonal winds on Jovian planets play an important role in governing the cloud dynamics, transport of momentum, scalars, and weather patterns. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the evolution of the zonal flows and their sustainability. Based on studies in two-dimensional (2D) $\beta$ plane setups, zonal flow is believed to be forced at the intermediate scale via baroclinic instabilities, and the inverse cascade leads to the transfer of energy to large scales. However, whether such a process exists in three-dimensional (3D) deep convection systems remains an open and challenging question. To explore a possible answer, we perform Large Eddy Simulations at the geophysically interesting regime of $Ra=$$10^{12}$, $Ek=$$10^{-6}$,$10^{-7}$ and $10^{-8}$ in horizontally rotating Rayleigh-B\'enard convection setup and discover the existence of natural forcing through buoyancy and inverse cascade. The turbulent kinetic energy budget analysis and the spectral space assessment of the results corroborate the emanation of a strong mean flow from chaos.</description>

      <title>Reynolds stress decay modeling informed by anisotropically forced homogeneous turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Models for solving the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations are popular tools for predicting complex turbulent flows due to their computational affordability and ability to provide or estimate quantities of engineering interest. However, results depend on a proper treatment of unclosed terms, which require progress in the development and assessment of model forms. In this study, we consider the Reynolds stress transport equations as a framework for second-moment turbulence closure modeling. We specifically focus on the terms responsible for decay of the Reynolds stresses, which can be isolated and evaluated separately from other terms in a canonical setup of homogeneous turbulence. We show that by using anisotropic forcing of the momentum equation, we can access states of turbulence traditionally not probed in a triply-periodic domain. The resulting data span a wide range of anisotropic turbulent behavior in a more comprehensive manner than extant literature. We then consider a variety of model forms for which these data allow us to perform a robust selection of model coefficients and select an optimal model that extends to cubic terms when expressed in terms of the principal coordinate Reynolds stresses. Performance of the selected decay model is then examined relative to the simulation data and popular models from the literature, demonstrating the superior accuracy of the developed model and, in turn, the efficacy of this framework for model selection and tuning.</description>

      <title>Vortex structures under dimples and scars in turbulent free-surface flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulence beneath a free surface leaves characteristic long-lived signatures on the surface, such as upwelling 'boils', near-circular 'dimples' and elongated 'scars', easily identifiable by eye, e.g., in riverine flows. In this paper, we use Direct Numerical Simulations to explore the connection between these surface signatures and the underlying vortical structures. We investigate dimples, known to be imprints of surface-attached vortices, and scars, which have yet to be extensively studied, by analysing the conditional probabilities that a point beneath a signature is within a vortex core as well as the inclination angles of sub-signature vorticity. The analysis shows that the likelihood of vortex presence beneath a dimple decreases from the surface down through the viscous and blockage layers in a near-Gaussian manner, influenced by the dimple's size and the bulk turbulence. When expressed as a function of depth over the Taylor microscale $\lambda_T$, this probability is independent of Reynolds and Weber number. Conversely, the probability of finding a vortex beneath a scar increases sharply from the surface to a peak at the edge of the viscous layer, at a depth of approximately $\lambda_T/4$. Distributions of vortical orientation also show a clear pattern: a strong preference for vertical alignment below dimples and an equally strong preference for horizontal alignment below scars. Our findings suggest that scars can be defined as imprints of horizontal vortices approximately a quarter of the Taylor microscale beneath the surface, analogous to how dimples can be defined as imprints of surface-attached vertical vortex tubes.</description>

      <title>Casimir preserving numerical method for global multilayer geostrophic turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate long-term predictions of large-scale flow features on planets are crucial for understanding global atmospheric and oceanic systems, necessitating the development of numerical methods that can preserve essential physical structures over extended simulation periods without excessive computational costs. Recent advancements in the study of global single-layer barotropic models have led to novel numerical methods based on Lie-Poisson discretization that preserve energy, enstrophy and higher-order moments of potential vorticity. This work extends this approach to more complex stratified quasi-geostrophic (QG) systems on the sphere.
  In this work, we present a formulation of the multi-layer QG equations on the full globe. This allows for extending the Lie-Poisson discretization to multi-layer QG models, ensuring consistency with the underlying structure and enabling long-term simulations without additional regularization. The numerical method is benchmarked through simulations of forced geostrophic turbulence and the long-term behaviour of unforced multi-layered systems. These results demonstrate the structure-preserving properties and robustness of the proposed numerical method, paving the way for a better understanding of the role of high-order conserved quantities in large-scale geophysical flow dynamics.</description>

      <title>Slip Due to Kink Propagation at the Liquid-Solid Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Couette flow, the liquid atoms adjacent to a solid substrate may have a finite average tangential velocity relative to the substrate. This so-called slip has been frequently observed. However, the particular molecular-level mechanisms that give rise to liquid slip are poorly understood. It is often assumed that liquid slip occurs by surface diffusion whereby atoms independently move from one substrate equilibrium site to another. We show that under certain conditions, liquid slip is due not to singular independent molecular motion, but to localized nonlinear waves that propagate at speeds that are orders of magnitude greater than the slip velocity at the liquid-solid interface. Using non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations, we find the properties of these waves and the conditions under which they are to be expected as the main progenitors of slip. We also provide a theoretical guide to the properties of these nonlinear waves by using an augmented Frenkel-Kontorova model. The new understanding provided by our results may lead to enhanced capabilities of the liquid-solid interface, for heat transfer, mixing, and surface-mediated catalysis.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Discrete Exterior Calculus Discretization and Fourier Transform of the Incompressible Navier-Stokes Equations in 3D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The simulation of fluid flow problems, specifically incompressible flows governed by the Navier-Stokes equations (NSE), holds fundamental significance in a range of scientific and engineering applications. Traditional numerical methods employed for solving these equations on three-dimensional (3D) meshes are commonly known for their moderate conservation properties, high computational intensity and substantial resource demands. Relying on its ability to capture the intrinsic geometric and topological properties of simplicial meshes, discrete exterior calculus (DEC) provides a discrete analog to differential forms and enables the discretization of partial differential equations (PDEs) on meshes.We present a hybrid discretization approach for the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations based on DEC and Fourier transform (FT). An existing conservative primitive variable DEC discretization of incompressible Navier-Stokes equations over surface simplicial meshes developed by Jagad et al. [1] is considered in the planar dimension while the Fourier expansion is applied in the third dimension. The test cases of three-dimensional lid-driven cavity and viscous Taylor-Green three-dimensional vortex (TGV) flows show that the simulation results using this hybrid approach are comparable to literature.</description>

      <title>Critical latitude in global quasi-geostrophic flow on a rotating sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study geostrophic turbulence without external forcing or dissipation, using a Casimir-preserving numerical method. The research examines the formation of large zonal jets, common in geophysical flows, especially in giant gas planets. These jets form due to the east-west stretching of vortices, influenced by the gradient of the Coriolis parameter, leading to a critical latitude beyond which jets do not form.
  Using a global quasi-geostrophic model with a fully latitude-dependent Coriolis parameter, we investigate this critical latitude, which is theorized to depend only on the product of the Rossby number and the Lamb parameter. By simulating random flow fields, the critical latitude was identified through zonally averaged zonal velocity profiles.
  Results align with geostrophic theory, especially near typical Rossby and Lamb parameter values for Earth's atmosphere. However, in the regime of weak rotation (high Rossby numbers) and strong stratification (high Lamb values), no clear critical latitude emerges; instead, zonal jet amplitude and width decrease gradually towards the poles. This research paves the way for further study of jet dynamics under a fully latitude-dependent Coriolis parameter.</description>

      <title>Interaction between corner and bulk flows during drainage in granular porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Drainage in porous media can be broken down into two main mechanisms: a primary piston-like displacement of the interfaces through the bulk of pore bodies and throats, and a secondary slow flow through corners and films in the wake of the invasion front. In granular porous media, this secondary drainage mechanism unfolds in connected pathways of pendular structures, such as capillary bridges and liquid rings, formed between liquid clusters. To represent both mechanisms, we proposed a dynamic dual-network model for drainage, considering that a gas displaces a wetting liquid from quasi-2D granular porous media. For this model, dedicated analyses of the capillary bridge shapes and hydraulic conductivity were conducted so that the secondary drainage mechanism could be properly quantified at finite speeds. With the model, an investigation of the wetting-phase connectivity and flow during drainage was carried out, covering a broad range of flow conditions. Results indicate that the span of liquid-connected structures in the unsaturated region, as well as their ability to contribute to flow, varies significantly with Capillary and Bond numbers.</description>

      <title>Bag breakup of low viscosity drops in the presence of a continuous air jet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.06036v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work examines the breakup of a single drop of various low viscosity fluids as it deforms in the presence of continuous horizontal air jet. Such a fragmentation typically occurs after the bulk liquid has disintegrated upon exiting the atomizer and is in the form of an ensemble of drops which undergo further breakup. The drop deformation and its eventual disintegration is important in evaluating the efficacy of a particular industrial process, be it combustion in automobile engines or pesticide spraying in agricultural applications. The interplay between competing influences of surface tension and aerodynamic disruptive forces is represented by the Weber number, $We$, and Ohnesorge number, $Oh$, and used to describe the breakup morphology. The breakup pattern considered in our study corresponds to that of a bag attached to a toroidal ring which occurs from $12 &lt; We &lt; 16$. We aim to address several issues connected with this breakup process and their dependence on $We$ and $Oh$ which have been hitherto unexplored. The $We$ boundary at which breakup begins is theoretically determined and the expression obtained, $We = 12(1 + 2/3Oh^2)$, is found to match well with experimental data available in literature. An exponential growth in the radial extent of the deformed drop and the streamline dimension of the bag is predicted by a theoretical model and confirmed by experimental findings. These quantities are observed to strongly depend on $We$. However, their dependence on $Oh$ is weak.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic solutions for self-similar fault slip induced by fluid injection at constant rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13828v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the circular, self-similar expansion of frictional rupture due to fluid injected at a constant volumetric rate. Fluid injection occurs at a point on the fault and fluid migration occurs within a thin, relatively permeable layer containing and parallel to the fault plane. For the particular case when the Poisson ratio $\nu=0$, self-similarity of the fluid pressure profile implies that fault slip will also evolve in an axisymmetric, self-similar manner, reducing the three-dimensional problem for the spatiotemporal evolution of fault slip to a single self-similar dimension. The rupture radius grows as $\lambda \sqrt{4\alpha_{hy} t}$ , where $t$ is time since the start of injection, $\alpha_{hy}$ is the hydraulic diffusivity of the pore fluid pressure, and $\lambda$ is a prefactor determined by a single parameter, $T$, which depends on the pre-injection stress state and injection conditions. The prefactor has the range $0&lt;\lambda&lt;\infty$, where the lower and upper limits of $\lambda$ correspond to, respectively marginal pressurization of the fault and critically stressed conditions, in which the fault-resolved shear stress is close to the pre-injection fault strength. In both limits of $\lambda$, we derive solutions for the slip by perturbation expansion, to arbitrary order. In the marginally pressurized limit, the perturbation is regular and the series expansion is convergent. For the critically stressed limit, the perturbation is singular, the solution for slip contains a boundary layer and an outer solution, and the series expansion is divergent. In the critically stressed case, we perform a matched asymptotic expansion to provide a composite solution with uniform convergence over the entire rupture. The leading order of these solutions was recently used by S\'aez et al. [2022] to verify three-dimensional boundary-element solutions in the limit $\nu=0$.</description>

      <title>Gradient dynamics approach to reactive thin-film hydrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wetting and dewetting dynamics of simple and complex liquids is described by kinetic equations in gradient dynamics form that incorporates the various coupled dissipative processes in a fully thermodynamically consistent manner. After briefly reviewing this, we also review how chemical reactions can be captured by a related gradient dynamics description, assuming detailed balanced mass action type kinetics. Then, we bring both aspects together and discuss mesoscopic reactive thin-film hydrodynamics illustrated by two examples, namely, models for reactive wetting and reactive surfactants. These models can describe the approach to equilibrium but may also be employed to study out-of-equilibrium chemo-mechanical dynamics. In the latter case, one breaks the gradient dynamics form by chemostatting to obtain active systems. In this way, for reactive wetting we recover running drops that are driven by chemically sustained wettability gradients and for drops covered by autocatalytic reactive surfactants we find complex forms of self-propulsion and self-excited oscillations.</description>

      <title>A kinetic theory hypothesis on the equilibrated pressure behavior in a low Mach, high Reynolds number gas flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18914v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In our recent works, we proposed a theory of turbulence creation via the mean field effect of an intermolecular potential, which in part relies on the empirically observed "equilibrated" behavior of the pressure variable in a low Mach, high Reynolds number flow -- that is, while the density and temperature may exhibit considerable variations, the pressure is (nearly) constant. At the same time, conventional kinetic theory does not offer satisfactory explanation for such a behavior of the pressure variable, instead leading to an isentropic flow in the form of the usual compressible Euler or Navier-Stokes equations.
  In the current work, we introduce a novel correction term into the pair correlation function in the closure of the Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon hierarchy in the deterministic, Vlasov-type collision integral. This term adjusts the density of incident and recedent pairs of particles to the macroscopic compression or expansion rate of the gas. Remarkably, the novel term does not affect the mass and momentum transport equations, and manifests solely in the pressure transport equation. Moreover, its effect on the pressure dynamics matches the observed behavior -- that is, it tends to attenuate the acoustic waves and smooth out the pressure solution. We also find that the novel correction term fails to produce such an effect in a stochastic, Boltzmann-type collision integral. This suggests that simplifying potential interactions via instantaneous collisions may lead to the loss of observable macroscopic effects in solutions of the fluid mechanics equations.</description>

      <title>Bayesian calibration of bubble size dynamics applied to CO2 gas fermenters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To accelerate the scale-up of gaseous CO2 fermentation reactors, computational models need to predict gas-to-liquid mass transfer which requires capturing the bubble size dynamics, i.e. bubble breakup and coalescence. However, the applicability of existing models beyond air-water mixtures remains to be established. Here, an inverse modeling approach, accelerated with a neural network surrogate, calibrates the breakup and coalescence closure models, that are used in the Multiple-Size-Group (MUSIG) population balance modeling (PBM). The calibration is performed based on experimental results obtained in a CO2-air-water-coflowing bubble column reactor. Bayesian inference is used to account for noise in the experimental dataset and bias in the simulation results. To accurately capture gas holdup and interphase mass transfer, the results show that the breakage rate needs to be increased by one order of magnitude. The inferred model parameters are then used on a separate configuration and shown to also improve bubble size distribution predictions.</description>

      <title>Symbolic construction of the chemical Jacobian of quasi-steady state (QSS) chemistries for Exascale computing platforms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Quasi-Steady State Approximation (QSSA) can be an effective tool for reducing the size and stiffness of chemical mechanisms for implementation in computational reacting flow solvers. However, for many applications, stiffness remains, and the resulting model requires implicit methods for efficient time integration. In this paper, we outline an approach to formulating the QSSA reduction that is coupled with a strategy to generate C++ source code to evaluate the net species production rate, and the chemical Jacobian. The code-generation component employs a symbolic approach enabling a simple and effective strategy to analytically compute the chemical Jacobian. For computational tractability, the symbolic approach needs to be paired with common subexpression elimination which can negatively affect memory usage. Several solutions are outlined and successfully tested on a 3D multipulse ignition problem, thus allowing portable application across a chemical model sizes and GPU capabilities. The implementation of the proposed method is available at https://github.com/AMReX-Combustion/PelePhysics under an open-source license.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of bacterial rheotaxis in non-Newtonian fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13692v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bacteria often exhibit upstream swimming, which can cause the contamination of biomedical devices and the infection of organs including the urethra or lungs. This process, called rheotaxis, has been studied extensively in Newtonian fluids. However, most microorganisms thrive in non-Newtonian fluids that contain suspended polymers such as mucus and biofilms. Here, we investigate the rheotatic behavior of E. coli near walls in non-Newtonian fluids. Our experiments demonstrate that bacterial upstream swimming is enhanced by an order of magnitude in shear-thinning polymeric fluids relative to Newtonian fluids. This result is explained by direct numerical simulations, revealing a torque that promotes the alignment of bacteria against the flow. From this analysis, we develop a theoretical model that accurately describes experimental rheotatic data in both Newtonian and shear-thinning fluids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the link between the geometric environment of particles, the local deformations of the solvent, and the bulk effective viscosity in non-Brownian suspensions. First, we discuss the caging of particles by their neighbors,and especially the caging of small particles by large ones in bidisperse suspensions.We develop a model that attributes an effective volume to particles depending on their environment, and yields the local deformations and effective viscosity. We compare this model to data from the literature, as well as to our own experiments with suspensions of non-Brownian polystyrene beads. Using dissolved polymers and their coil-stretch transition as strain probes, we measure the local deformation of the liquid and the effect of caging thereon. We obtain a linear relationship between the amplified local strain rate and the particle volume fraction, in which the critical volume fraction $\phi_\mathrm{c}$ appears as an effective volume of the particles; this relationship is found valid up into the dense regime.</description>

Abstract: We present a relativistic Shakhov-type generalization of the Anderson-Witting relaxation time model for the Boltzmann collision integral to modify the ratio of momentum diffusivity to thermal diffusivity. This is achieved by modifying the path on which the single particle distribution function $f_{\mathbf{k}}$ approaches local equilibrium $f_{0\mathbf{k}}$ by constructing an intermediate Shakhov-type distribution $f_{\mathrm{S}\mathbf{k}}$ similar to the 14-moment approximation of Israel and Stewart. We illustrate the effectiveness of this model in case of the Bjorken expansion of an ideal gas of massive particles and the damping of longitudinal waves through an ultrarelativistic ideal gas.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04017v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present a relativistic Shakhov-type generalization of the Anderson-Witting relaxation time model for the Boltzmann collision integral. The extension is performed by modifying the path on which the distribution function $f_{\mathbf{k}}$ is taken towards local equilibrium $f_{0\mathbf{k}}$, by replacing $f_{\mathbf{k}} - f_{0\mathbf{k}}$ via $f_{\mathbf{k}} - f_{{\rm S}\mathbf{k}}$. The Shakhov-like distribution $f_{{\rm S} \mathbf{k}}$ is constructed using $f_{0\mathbf{k}}$ and the irreducible moments $\rho_r^{\mu_1 \cdots \mu_\ell}$ of $f_\mathbf{k}$ and reduces to $f_{0\mathbf{k}}$ in local equilibrium. Employing the method of moments, we derive systematic high-order Shakhov extensions that allow both the first- and the second-order transport coefficients to be controlled independently of each other. We illustrate the capabilities of the formalism by tweaking the shear-bulk coupling coefficient $\lambda_{\Pi \pi}$ in the frame of the Bjorken flow of massive particles, as well as the diffusion-shear transport coefficients $\ell_{V\pi}$, $\ell_{\pi V}$ in the frame of sound wave propagation in an ultrarelativistic gas. Finally, we illustrate the importance of second-order transport coefficients by comparison with the results of the stochastic BAMPS method in the context of the one-dimensional Riemann problem.</description>

      <title>Correlation times of velocity and kinetic helicity fluctuations in nonhelical hydrodynamic turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15860v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonhelical turbulence within a linear shear flow has demonstrated efficient amplification of large-scale magnetic fields in numerical simulations, but its precise mechanism remains elusive. The incoherent $\alpha$ mechanism proposes that a zero-mean fluctuating transport coefficient $\alpha$ (linked to kinetic helicity) in the shear flow is a candidate driver. Previous renovating-flow models have proposed that the correlation time of helicity fluctuations must be sufficiently extended to overcome turbulent magnetic diffusivity, yet only empirical validation of this concept has been obtained. In this study, we conduct direct numerical simulations of weakly compressible nonhelical hydrodynamic turbulence. We scrutinize the correlation times of velocity and kinetic helicity fluctuations in distinct flow configurations, including rotation, shearing, and Keplerian flows, as well as the shearing burgulence counterpart. Our findings indicate that rotation contributes to a prolonged correlation time of helicity compared to velocity, particularly notable in auto-correlations of both volume-averaged quantities and individual Fourier modes due to the formation of large-scale vortices. In contrast, moderate shear strength does not exhibit significant scale separation, with shear flows elongating vortices in the shear direction. Shearing burgulence, characterized by shorter helicity correlation times, appears less conducive to hosting the incoherent $\alpha$ effect. Notably, at modest shear rates, only Keplerian flows exhibit sufficiently coherent helicity fluctuations, in contrast to shearing flows. However, the relative strength of helicity fluctuations compared to turbulent diffusivity is significantly lower, raising doubts about the viability of the incoherent $\alpha$ effect as a potential dynamo driver in the subsonic flows examined in this study.</description>

Abstract: Capillary droplets form due to surface tension when two immiscible fluids are mixed. We describe the motion of gravity-driven capillary droplets flowing through narrow constrictions and obstacle arrays in both simulations and experiments. Our new capillary deformable particle model recapitulates the shape and velocity of single oil droplets in water as they pass through narrow constrictions in microfluidic chambers. Using this experimentally validated model, we simulate the flow and clogging of single capillary droplets in narrow channels and obstacle arrays and find several important results. First, the capillary droplet speed profile is nonmonotonic as the droplet exits the narrow orifice, and we can tune the droplet properties so that the speed overshoots the terminal speed far from the constriction. Second, in obstacle arrays, we find that extremely deformable droplets can wrap around obstacles, which leads to decreased average droplet speed in the continuous flow regime and increased probability for clogging in the regime where permanent clogs form. Third, the wrapping mechanism causes the clogging probability in obstacle arrays to become nonmonotonic with surface tension $\Gamma$. At large $\Gamma$, the droplets are nearly rigid and the clogging probability is large since the droplets can not squeeze through the gaps between obstacles. With decreasing $\Gamma$, the clogging probability decreases as the droplets become more deformable. However, in the small-$\Gamma$ limit the clogging probability increases, since the droplets are extremely deformable and cause clogs as they wrap around the obstacles. The results from these studies are important for developing a predictive understanding of capillary droplet flows through complex and confined geometries.</description>
