      <title>Effective Hyper-clutter Artifacts Suppression for Ultrafast Ultrasound Doppler Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: Hyper-clutter artifacts (HCA), arising from strong tissue reflections or physiological motion, present persistent challenges in ultrafast ultrasound Doppler imaging, often obscuring surrounding small vessel flow signals, especially in fascial regions such as the renal capsule. This study proposes U-profile-based decluttering (UPBD), a robust and computationally efficient method that exploits singular value decomposition (SVD)-derived spatial singular vectors to suppress HCA in ultrafast Doppler imaging. Methods: UPBD analyzes intensity profile of each pixel along the singular-order dimension of the SVD-derived left singular vectors U. A pixel-wise clutter-energy ratio is computed to derive a spatially adaptive declutter weighting map, which is applied to the SVD-filtered flow signals. Results: UPBD was evaluated on multiple in vivo datasets. Quantitative assessments based on contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and contrast-to-tissue ratio (CTR) demonstrated significant improvements over conventional SVD filtering. For example, UPBD enhanced CTR from 7.3 dB to 21.7 dB in contrast-free pig kidney, 17.8 dB to 42.1 dB in contrast-enhanced pig kidney, 8.2 dB to 32.8 dB in human kidney, and -4.9 dB to 3.7 dB in 3D human liver. Conclusion: The proposed UPBD method effectively suppresses HCA while preserving blood flow signals with minimal extra computational cost and no need for extensive parameter tuning. Significance: UPBD serves as a lightweight, easily integrated post-processing method that enhances HCA suppression, enabling broader application of SVD-based ultrafast Doppler imaging.</description>

      <title>PET Rapid Image Reconstruction Challenge (PETRIC)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Introduction: We describe the foundation of PETRIC, an image reconstruction challenge to minimise the computational runtime of related algorithms for Positron Emission Tomography (PET).
  Purpose: Although several similar challenges are well-established in the field of medical imaging, there have been no prior challenges for PET image reconstruction.
  Methods: Participants are provided with open-source software for implementation of their reconstruction algorithm(s). We define the objective function and reconstruct "gold standard" reference images, and provide metrics for quantifying algorithmic performance. We also received and curated phantom datasets (acquired with different scanners, radionuclides, and phantom types), which we further split into training and evaluation datasets. The automated computational framework of the challenge is released as open-source software.
  Results: Four teams with nine algorithms in total participated in the challenge. Their contributions made use of various tools from optimisation theory including preconditioning, stochastic gradients, and artificial intelligence. While most of the submitted approaches appear very similar in nature, their specific implementation lead to a range of algorithmic performance.
  Conclusion: As the first challenge for PET image reconstruction, PETRIC's solid foundations allow researchers to reuse its framework for evaluating new and existing image reconstruction methods on new or existing datasets. Variant versions of the challenge have and will continue to be launched in the future.</description>

      <title>The Biologically Effective Particle Number Ratio (BPNR): a new framework to quantify the therapeutic window in SFRT and other modalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatially Fractionated Radiation Therapy (SFRT) produces highly heterogeneous dose distributions, for which conventional metrics such as peak, valley, or average dose can yield ambiguous or inconsistent estimates of therapeutic window changes. These dose descriptors are not uniquely linked to biological outcome, complicating comparisons between modalities. We introduce the Biologically Effective Particle Number Ratio (BPNR), a model-independent and outcome-based framework that quantifies therapeutic window changes using directly measurable delivery quantities rather than spatial dose metrics. BPNR is defined as the ratio of total particle numbers (proportional to monitor units, MU) required to reach specified levels of tumor control probability (TCP) and normal tissue complication probability (NTCP). The relative BPNR (RBPNR) compares therapeutic windows across modalities and avoids ambiguities of spatial dose averaging by relying solely on biological endpoints. As an illustration, we apply the framework to preclinical proton minibeam radiotherapy (pMBRT) versus conventional proton therapy. The absence of normal tissue complications at the highest tested MU in the pMBRT arm yields an RBPNR &gt; 1.4, indicating a widened therapeutic window. The BPNR/RBPNR methodology provides a concise, experimentally grounded, and modality-agnostic way to quantify therapeutic window changes, with potential applications across SFRT, FLASH, high-LET radiation, and combination therapies.</description>

      <title>Design and Construction of a Dedicated Radiolucent 8-element Flexible Radiofrequency (RF) Torso Coil for the 1.0T Australian MRI-Linac System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging-guided linear accelerators (MRI-Linacs) are an emerging treatment technology that enable online soft-tissue visualisation and adaptive radiotherapy. The Australian 1.0 T MRI-Linac employs a fixed, inline beamline, with treatment angles achieved via patient couch rotation, and currently relies on a radiolucent whole-body radiofrequency (RF) coil. However, the large coil-patient separation limits signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and constrains the fast imaging required for real-time tumour tracking. Here, we show the design and validation of a dedicated, flexible 8-element receive-only RF torso array tailored to the geometry and beam access requirements of the Australian MRI-Linac. Electromagnetic simulations, bench measurements, and phantom imaging demonstrate approximately three-fold SNR improvement at the centre and eight-fold improvement at superficial regions compared with the whole-body coil. In vivo abdominal imaging confirms enhanced anatomical detail and sharper tissue boundaries, and the increased SNR enables parallel imaging with GRAPPA acceleration factors up to three without severe artefacts. Dosimetry measurements and dynamic beam-on noise analysis confirm that the coil array is effectively radiolucent, with dose differences below 1% and no measurable degradation in image noise. This work demonstrates a practical RF solution for accelerated, high-SNR imaging compatible with patient rotation and beam delivery on the Australian MRI-Linac.</description>

      <title>Optimization and application of ultra-high field preclinical high-resolution and 3D 1H-MRSI using compressed sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (1H-MRSI) at ultra-high field has seen an increase in usage in the preclinical field. Challenges related to long acquisition time and low concentration of brain metabolites in the rodent brain have led to the development and application of acceleration schemes for 3D-1H-MRSI, such the undersampling technique Compressed Sensing (CS). This present study aims to explore the CS tool in the context of preclinical in vivo application in order to achieve high-resolution MRSI acquisition in both 2D with an in-plane increase and 3D/multi-slice acquisition with through-plane. The parameters are explored to achieve the highest acceleration possible as a way to make 3D as time efficient as possible. Results of the parameter study showed that an acceleration factor (AF) of 4 was possible with the right sampling size of the core at the center of the k-space. With this specific set, higher matrix size resulting in sub 1 {\mu}L nominal voxel size was explored with 2D-FID-MRSI and 9 supplementary phase-encoding/slices were added to achieve 3D-FID-MRSI. The spectral quality and the metabolic maps were accurate enough in the comparison with the non-accelerated 2D-FID-MRSI, within the slice of interest. Issues related with the point spread function (PSF) were noted throughout the different usage of CS. Our work presents a robust and effective protocol to achieve 3D-1H-MRSI using CS in order to reach an acquisition time below the 30 minutes bar, with minimal technical limitations and high-quality acquisition.</description>

      <title>Hessian-free Ray-Born Inversion for Quantitative Ultrasound Tomography of Weakly Heterogeneous Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.00316v10 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a frequency-domain, Hessian-free ray-Born inversion method for quantitative ultrasound tomography, extending the author's previous Hessian-based approach. Both approaches model acoustic wave propagation using a ray-based approximation of the Green's function in smoothly varying heterogeneous media, and perform the inversion iteratively in the frequency domain, progressing from low to high frequencies. In the earlier method, each frequency subproblem was solved through iterative inversion of the Hessian matrix, a process that not only increased computational cost but also made the update steps more sensitive to noise. The present work addresses these limitations by diagonalizing the Hessian matrix through a specific weighting scheme, which enables a single-step inversion for each frequency subproblem. This reformulation reduces the computational expense by approximately an order of magnitude relative to the Hessian-based approach. The weighting scheme also functions as a smoothing regularizer that is intrinsically embedded within the forward operator, thereby balancing computational efficiency and spatial resolution while producing robust reconstructions less sensitive to noise. Furthermore, for approximating the geometrical portion of the amplitude, this study introduces a paraxial ray-tracing system, further enhancing computational efficiency and accuracy. The inversion approach proposed in the present study has enabled the first successful translation of acoustic inverse scattering methods to a clinical setting.</description>

      <title>GACELLE: GPU-accelerated tools for model parameter estimation and image reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantitative MRI (qMRI) offers tissue-specific biomarkers that can be tracked over time or compared across populations; however, its adoption in clinical research is hindered by significant computational demands of parameter estimation. Images acquired at high spatial resolution or requiring fitting multiple parameters often require lengthy processing time, constraining their use in routine pipelines and slowing methodological innovation and clinical translation.
  We present GACELLE, an open source, GPU-accelerated framework for high-throughput qMRI analysis. GACELLE provides a stochastic gradient descent optimiser and a stochastic sampler in MATLAB, enabling fast parameter mapping, improved estimation robustness via spatial regularisation, and uncertainty quantification. GACELLE prioritises accessibility: users only need to provide a forward signal model, while GACELLE's backend manages computational parallelisation, automatic parameter updates, and memory-batching. The stochastic solver performs fully vectorised Markov chain Monte Carlo with identical likelihood on CPU and GPU, ensuring reproducibility across hardware.
  Benchmarking demonstrates up to 451-fold acceleration for the stochastic gradient descent solver and 14,380-fold acceleration for stochastic sampling compared to CPU-based estimation, without compromising accuracy. We demonstrated GACELLE's versatility on three representative qMRI models and on an image reconstruction task. Across these applications, GACELLE improves parameter precision, enhances test-retest reproducibility, and reduces noise in quantitative maps.
  By combining speed, usability and flexibility, GACELLE provides a generalisable optimisation framework for medical image analysis. It lowers the computational barrier for qMRI, paving the way for reproducible biomarker development, large-scale imaging studies, and clinical translation.</description>

      <title>Autonomous labeling of surgical resection margins using a foundation model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assessing resection margins is central to pathological specimen evaluation and has profound implications for patient outcomes. Current practice employs physical inking, which is applied variably, and cautery artifacts can obscure the true margin on histological sections. We present a virtual inking network (VIN) that autonomously localizes the surgical cut surface on whole-slide images, reducing reliance on inks and standardizing margin-focused review. VIN uses a frozen foundation model as the feature extractor and a compact two-layer multilayer perceptron trained for patch-level classification of cautery-consistent features. The dataset comprised 120 hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) stained slides from 12 human tonsil tissue blocks, resulting in ~2 TB of uncompressed raw image data, where a board-certified pathologist provided boundary annotations. In blind testing with 20 slides from previously unseen blocks, VIN produced coherent margin overlays that qualitatively aligned with expert annotations across serial sections. Quantitatively, region-level accuracy was ~73.3% across the test set, with errors largely confined to limited areas that did not disrupt continuity of the whole-slide margin map. These results indicate that VIN captures cautery-related histomorphology and can provide a reproducible, ink-free margin delineation suitable for integration into routine digital pathology workflows and for downstream measurement of margin distances.</description>

      <title>Accelerating mesh-based Monte Carlo simulations using contemporary graphics ray-tracing hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Significance: Monte Carlo (MC) methods are the gold-standard for modeling light-tissue interactions due to their accuracy. Mesh-based MC (MMC) offers enhanced precision for complex tissue structures using tetrahedral mesh models. Despite significant speedups achieved on graphics processing units (GPUs), MMC performance remains hindered by the computational cost of frequent ray-boundary intersection tests.
  Aim: We propose a highly accelerated MMC algorithm, RT-MMC, that leverages the hardware-accelerated ray traversal and intersection capabilities of ray-tracing cores (RT-cores) on modern GPUs.
  Approach: Implemented using NVIDIA's OptiX platform, RT-MMC extends graphics ray-tracing pipelines towards volumetric ray-tracing in turbid media, eliminating the need for challenging tetrahedral mesh generation while delivering significant speed improvements through hardware acceleration. It also intrinsically supports wide-field sources without complex mesh retesselation.
  Results: RT-MMC demonstrates excellent agreement with traditional software-ray-tracing MMC algorithms while achieving 1.5x to 4.5x speedups across multiple GPU architectures. These performance gains significantly enhance the practicality of MMC for routine simulations.
  Conclusion: Migration from software- to hardware-based ray-tracing not only greatly simplifies MMC simulation workflows, but also results in significant speedups that are expected to increase further as ray-tracing hardware rapidly gains adoption. Adoption of graphics ray-tracing pipelines in quantitative MMC simulations enables leveraging of emerging hardware resources and benefits a wide range of biophotonics applications.</description>

      <title>Strategies to Minimize Out-of-Distribution Effects in Data-Driven MRS Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study systematically compared data-driven and model-based strategies for metabolite quantification in magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), focusing on resilience to out-of-distribution (OoD) effects and the balance between accuracy, robustness, and generalizability. A neural network designed for MRS quantification was trained using three distinct strategies: supervised regression, self-supervised learning, and test-time adaptation. These were compared against model-based fitting tools. Experiments combined large-scale simulated data, designed to probe metabolite concentration extrapolation and signal variability, with 1H single-voxel 7T in-vivo human brain spectra. In simulations, supervised learning achieved high accuracy for spectra similar to those in the training distribution, but showed marked degradation when extrapolated beyond the training distribution. Test-time adaptation proved more resilient to OoD effects, while self-supervised learning achieved intermediate performance. In-vivo experiments showed larger variance across the methods (data-driven and model-based) due to domain shift. Across all strategies, overlapping metabolites and baseline variability remained persistent challenges. While strong performance can be achieved by data-driven methods for MRS metabolite quantification, their reliability is contingent on careful consideration of the training distribution and potential OoD effects. When such conditions in the target distribution cannot be anticipated, test-time adaptation strategies ensure consistency between the quantification, the data, and the model, enabling reliable data-driven MRS pipelines.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Image Quality Improvement and Artefacts Correction in Accelerated MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: MR data are acquired in the frequency domain, known as k-space. Acquiring high-quality and high-resolution MR images can be time-consuming, posing a significant challenge when multiple sequences providing complementary contrast information are needed or when the patient is unable to remain in the scanner for an extended period of time. Reducing k-space measurements is a strategy to speed up acquisition, but often leads to reduced quality in reconstructed images. Additionally, in real-world MRI, both under-sampled and full-sampled images are prone to artefacts, and correcting these artefacts is crucial for maintaining diagnostic accuracy. Deep learning methods have been proposed to restore image quality from under-sampled data, while others focused on the correction of artefacts that result from the noise or motion. No approach has however been proposed so far that addresses both acceleration and artefacts correction, limiting the performance of these models when these degradation factors occur simultaneously. To address this gap, we present a method for recovering high-quality images from under-sampled data with simultaneously correction for noise and motion artefact called USArt (Under-Sampling and Artifact correction model). Customized for 2D brain anatomical images acquired with Cartesian sampling, USArt employs a dual sub-model approach. The results demonstrate remarkable increase of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast in the images restored. Various under-sampling strategies and degradation levels were explored, with the gradient under-sampling strategy yielding the best outcomes. We achieved up to 5x acceleration and simultaneously artefacts correction without significant degradation, showcasing the model's robustness in real-world settings.</description>

      <title>Dual-Input Dynamic Convolution for Positron Range Correction in PET Image Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00587v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Positron range (PR) blurring degrades positron emission tomography (PET) image resolution, particularly for high-energy emitters like gallium-68 (68 Ga). We introduce Dual-Input Dynamic Convolution (DDConv), a novel computationally efficient approach trained with voxel-specific PR point spread functions (PSFs) from Monte Carlo (MC) simulations and designed to be utilized within an iterative reconstruction algorithm to perform PR correction (PRC). By dynamically inferring local blurring kernels through a trained convolutional neural network (CNN), DDConv captures complex tissue interfaces more accurately than prior methods. Crucially, it also computes the transpose of the PR operator, ensuring consistency within iterative PET reconstruction. Comparisons with a state-of-the-art, tissue-dependent correction confirm the advantages of DDConv in recovering higher-resolution details in heterogeneous regions, including bone-soft tissue and lung-soft tissue boundaries. Experiments across digital phantoms and MC-simulated data show that DDConv offers near-MC accuracy and outperforms the state-of-the-art technique, namely spatially-variant and tissue-dependent (SVTD), especially in areas with complex material interfaces. Results from real phantom experiments further confirm DDConv's robustness and practical applicability: while both DDConv and SVTD performed similarly in homogeneous soft-tissue regions, DDConv provided more accurate activity recovery and sharper delineation at heterogeneous lung-soft tissue interfaces.</description>

Abstract: Transverse relaxation in MRI is modulated by magnetic field variations arising from tissue microstructure, offering a potential window into the underlying chemical composition and structural organization at the cellular scale. However, the transverse relaxation rate in white matter depends on both echo time and the orientation of axons relative to the external field. Such anisotropy complicates the interpretation of transverse relaxation in general and as a biomarker for neurodegenerative disease. Understanding this anisotropy is therefore crucial for accurately analyzing MRI signals. While previous modeling studies have investigated these effects, they often relied on simplified or idealized tissue geometries. In this study, we investigate magnetic field variance and intra-axonal transverse relaxation using realistic axonal microstructure extracted from 3D electron microscopy, incorporating myelinated axons with embedded spherical susceptibility sources. We derive how transverse relaxation depends on the angle between axons and the external magnetic field. Simulations show that the time-dependent power-law signature arising from white matter structural disorder is weak and may be difficult to detect at currently achievable noise levels, echo times, and field strengths. This is because the power-law curvature over a typical range of echo times deviates only slightly from a linear trend. Our findings highlight the influence of axonal geometry on intra-axonal transverse relaxation and suggest that accounting for both time and orientation dependence may facilitate the development of more precise neuroimaging biomarkers.</description>

      <title>PySERA: Open-Source Standardized Python Library for Automated, Scalable, and Reproducible Handcrafted and Deep Radiomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15963</link>

Abstract: Radiomics enables the extraction of quantitative biomarkers from medical images for precision modeling, but reproducibility and scalability remain limited due to heterogeneous software implementations and incomplete adherence to standards. Existing tools also lack unified support for deep learning based radiomics. To address these limitations, we introduce PySERA, an open source, Python native, standardized radiomics framework designed for automation, reproducibility, and seamless AI integration. PySERA reimplements the MATLAB based SERA platform within a modular, object oriented architecture and computes 557 features, including 487 Image Biomarker Standardization Initiative (IBSI) compliant features, 10 moment invariant descriptors, and 60 diagnostic features, together with deep learning radiomics embeddings from pretrained networks such as ResNet50, DenseNet121, and VGG16. The framework provides standardized preprocessing, including resampling, discretization, and normalization, multi format image input and output, adaptive memory management, and a parallel multicores extraction engine. PySERA integrates natively with major machine learning ecosystems including scikit learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow, MONAI and others. In IBSI benchmarks, PySERA achieved more than 94 percent reproducibility and outperformed PyRadiomics while closely matching MITK. Across eight public datasets, it achieved predictive accuracies ranging from 0.54 to 0.87, consistently exceeding PyRadiomics. PySERA unifies handcrafted and deep learning radiomics in a transparent, scalable, and extensible Python framework, establishing a robust foundation for reproducible, AI ready imaging research.</description>
