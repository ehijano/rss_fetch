      <title>Reviving networked multi-dimensional dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From gene regulatory networks to mutualistic networks, controlling a single node in the network topology can transform these complex dynamical systems from undesirable states to desirable ones. Corresponding methods have been well-studied in one-dimensional dynamical systems. However, many practical dynamical systems require description by multi-dimensional dynamical systems, such as the mutualistic symbiotic systems formed by flowering plants and pollinating insects. Existing one-dimensional methods cannot handle the cases of multi-dimensional dynamical systems. Based on this, we propose a method to control a single node to activate network connections in multi-dimensional dynamical systems. In such systems, the changes of each node are described by multiple nonlinear differential equations. All remaining nodes are stratified according to the shortest path to the controlled node, thereby reducing the dimensionality of the system. Such a large-scale dynamical system can ultimately be replaced by a very simple system. By analyzing the reduced-dimensional system, we can predict the extent of control needed to restore the system state. We apply this method to a wide range of fields, achieving activation of various real multidimensional complex dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Homological data on the periodic structure of self-maps on wedge sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the periodic points for continuous self-maps on the wedge sum of topological manifolds, exhibiting a particular combinatorial structure. We compute explicitly the Lefschetz numbers, the Dold coefficients and consider its set of algebraic periods. Moreover, we study the special case of maps on the wedge sum of tori, and show some of the homological obstructions present in defining these maps.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on a class of additive perturbations in dynamical systems. An equivalence statement for this construction is discovered, and consequently, a method of checking a notion of positive invariance with perturbation. The resulting conclusion is an equivalence between a more strict definition of positive invariance, based on a perturbation extension of the system and the Dubovitskij-Miljutin tangent cone.</description>

      <title>The Stability of Pointwise Hyperbolic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stability of the system is an important part of the research on differential dynamical systems. This paper considers a pointwise hyperbolic system defined on a connected open subset N of a compact smooth Riemannian manifold M. The hyperbolicity may weaken when approaching the boundary of the open set. By analogy with the stability of hyperbolic systems, this paper constructs the expansive property and the shadowing lemma on the pointwise pseudo orbits and thus obtains the stability of pointwise hyperbolic systems.</description>

      <title>Sharp iteration asymptotics for transfer operators induced by greedy $\beta$-expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider base-$\beta$ expansions of Parry's type, where $a_0 \geq a_1 \geq 1$ are integers and $a_0&lt;\beta &lt;a_0+1$ is the positive solution to $\beta^2 = a_0\beta + a_1$ (the golden ratio corresponds to $a_0=a_1=1$). The map $x\mapsto \beta x-\lfloor \beta x\rfloor$ induces a discrete dynamical system on the interval $[0,1)$ and we study its associated transfer (Perron-Frobenius) operator $\mathscr{P}$. Our main result can be roughly summarized as follows: we explicitly construct two bounded functions $u$ and $v$ with $\mathscr{P}u=u$ and $\mathscr{P}v=\beta^{-1} v$ such that for every sufficiently smooth $F$ which is supported in $[0,1]$ and satisfies $\int_0^1 F \; \mathrm{d} x=1$, we have $\mathscr{P}^kF= u +\beta^{-k}\big ( F(1)-F(0)\big )v +o(\beta^{-k})$ in $L^\infty$. This is also compared with the case of integer bases, where more refined asymptotic formulas are possible.</description>

      <title>Slicing the Torus and the thermodynamics of self-similar measures with overlaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orthogonal projections of the uniform measure on the Sierpinski triangle form a family of self similar measures with overlaps. The main result of this work is to make a connection between the dimension theory of these measures and the thermodynamic formalism of the doubling map restricted to rational slices of the torus. Of note is how we establish a correspondence between the varying translational parameter and varying rational slices. This gives a new direction from which to understand the dimension theory of projections of self similar measures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the finiteness of ergodic measures of maximal entropy for partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms where the center direction has a dominated decomposition into one dimensional bundle and there is a uniform lower bound for the absolute value of the Lyapunov exponents. As applications we prove finiteness for a class derived from Anosov partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms defined on $\mathbb{T}^4$ and that in a class of skew product over partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms there exists a $C^1$ open and $C^r$ dense set of diffeomorphisms with a finite number of ergodic measures of maximal entropy. We also study the upper semicontinuity of the number of measures of maximal entropy with respect to the diffeomorphism.</description>

      <title>Global stability of Wright-type equations with negative Schwarzian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simplicity of the $37/24$-global stability criterion announced by E.M. Wright in 1955 and rigorously proved by B. B\'{a}nhelyi et al in 2014 for the delayed logistic equation raised the question of its possible extension for other population models. In our study, we answer this question by extending the $37/24$-stability condition for the Wright-type equations with decreasing smooth nonlinearity $f$ which has a negative Schwarzian and satisfies the standard negative feedback and boundedness assumptions. The proof contains the construction and careful analysis of qualitative properties of certain bounding relations. To validate our conclusions, these relations are evaluated at finite sets of points; for this purpose, we systematically use interval analysis.</description>

      <title>A convex variational principle for the necessary conditions of classical optimal control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A scheme for generating a family of convex variational principles is developed, the Euler- Lagrange equations of each member of the family formally corresponding to the necessary conditions of optimal control of a given system of ordinary differential equations (ODE) in a well-defined sense. The scheme is applied to the Quadratic-Quadratic Regulator problem for which an explicit form of the functional is derived, and existence of minimizers of the variational principle is rigorously shown. It is shown that the Linear-Quadratic Regulator problem with time-dependent forcing can be solved within the formalism without requiring any nonlinear considerations, in contrast to the use of a Riccati system in the classical methodology.
  Our work demonstrates a pathway for solving nonlinear control problems via convex optimization.</description>

Abstract: The question of the distribution of shapes of unit lattices in number fields, pioneered by Margulis and Gromov, has lately attracted considerable interest, not least because of the lack of available results. Here we prove that the set of shapes of orders of totally real cubic fields is unbounded in the modular surface.</description>

      <title>Anderson localized states for the nonlinear Maryland model on $\mathbb{Z}^d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate Anderson localization for a nonlinear perturbation of the Maryland model $H=\varepsilon\Delta+\cot\pi(\theta+j\cdot\alpha)\delta_{j,j'}$ on $\mathbb{Z}^d$. Specifically, if $\varepsilon,\delta$ are sufficiently small, we construct a large number of time quasi-periodic and space exponentially decaying solutions (i.e., Anderson localized states) for the equation $i\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}=Hu+\delta|u|^{2p}u$ with a Diophantine $\alpha$. Our proof combines eigenvalue estimates of the Maryland model with the Craig-Wayne-Bourgain method, which originates from KAM theory for Hamiltonian PDEs.</description>

      <title>Attractors for Singular-Degenerate Porous Medium Type Equations Arising in Models for Biofilm Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the long-time behaviour of solutions of a class of singular-degenerate porous medium type equations in bounded Lipschitz domains with mixed Dirichlet-Neumann boundary conditions. The existence of global attractors is shown under very general assumptions. Assuming, in addition, that solutions are globally H\"older continuous and the reaction terms satisfy a suitable sign condition in the vicinity of the degeneracy, we also prove the existence of an exponential attractor, which, in turn, yields the finite fractal dimension of the global attractor. Moreover, we extend the results for scalar equations to systems where the degenerate equation is coupled to a semilinear reaction-diffusion equation. The study of such systems is motivated by models for biofilm growth.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A sequence of distinct closed surfaces in a hyperbolic 3-manifold M is asymptotically geodesic if their principal curvatures tend uniformly to zero. When M has finite volume, we show such sequences are always asymptotically dense in the 2-plane Grassmann bundle of M. When M has infinite volume and is geometrically finite, we show such sequences do not exist. As an application of the former, we obtain partial answers to the question of whether a negatively curved Riemannian 3-manifold that contains a sequence of asymptotically totally geodesic or totally umbilic surfaces must be hyperbolic. Finally, we give examples to show that if the dimension of M is greater than 3, the possible limiting behavior of asymptotically geodesic surfaces is less constrained than for totally geodesic surfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.07516v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a systematic approach to continuous substitutions on compact Hausdorff alphabets. Focussing on implications of irreducibility and primitivity, we highlight important features of the topological dynamics of their (generalised) subshifts. We then reframe questions from ergodic theory in terms of spectral properties of a corresponding substitution operator. This requires an extension of standard Perron--Frobenius theory to the setting of Banach lattices. As an application, we identify computable criteria that guarantee quasi-compactness of the substitution operator. This allows unique ergodicity to be verified for several classes of examples. For instance, it follows that every primitive and constant length substitution on an alphabet with an isolated point is uniquely ergodic, a result which fails when there are no isolated points.</description>

      <title>Exponential mixing of frame flows for convex cocompact locally symmetric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.14737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected center-free simple real algebraic group of rank one and $\Gamma &lt; G$ be a Zariski dense torsion-free convex cocompact subgroup. We prove that the frame flow on $\Gamma \backslash G$, i.e., the right translation action of a one-parameter subgroup $\{a_t\}_{t \in \mathbb R} &lt; G$ of semisimple elements, is exponentially mixing with respect to the Bowen-Margulis-Sullivan measure. The key step is proving suitable generalizations of the local non-integrability condition and the non-concentration property which are essential for Dolgopyat's method. This generalizes the work of Sarkar-Winter for $G = \operatorname{SO}(n, 1)^\circ$ and also strengthens the mixing result of Winter in the convex cocompact case.</description>

      <title>On a tropicalization of planar polynomial ODEs with finitely many structurally stable phase portraits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.18002v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, concepts from the emerging field of tropical geometry have been used to identify different scaling regimes in chemical reaction networks where dimension reduction may take place. In this paper, we try to formalize these ideas further in the context of planar polynomial ODEs. In particular, we develop a theory of a tropical dynamical system, based upon a differential inclusion, that has a set of discontinuities on a subset of the associated tropical curve. The development is inspired by an approach of Peter Szmolyan that uses the connection of tropical geometry with logarithmic paper. In this paper, we define a phaseportrait, a notion of equivalence and characterize structural stability. Furthermore, we demonstrate the results on several examples, including a(n) (generalized) autocatalator model. Our main result is that there are finitely many equivalence classes of structurally stable phase portraits and we enumerate these ($15$ in total) in the context of the generalized autocatalator model. We believe that the property of finitely many structurally stable phase portraits underlines the potential of the tropical approach, also in higher dimension, as a method to obtain and identify skeleton models in chemical reaction networks in extreme parameter regimes.</description>

      <title>Streams and Graphs of Dynamical Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12327v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While studying gradient dynamical systems (DSs), Morse introduced the idea of encoding the qualitative behavior of a DS into a graph. Smale later refined Morse's idea and extended it to Axiom-A diffeomorphisms on manifolds. In Smale's vision, nodes are indecomposable closed invariant subsets of the non-wandering set with a dense orbit and there is an edge from node N to node M if the unstable manifold of N intersects the stable manifold of M. Since then, the decomposition of the non-wandering set was studied in many other settings, while the edges component of Smale's construction has been often overlooked. In the same years, more sophisticated generalizations of the non-wandering set were elaborated first by Auslander in 60s, by Conley in 70s and later by Easton and other authors. In our language, each of these generalizations involves the introduction of a closed and transitive extension of the non-wandering relation, that is closed but not transitive. In the present article, we develop a theory that generalizes at the same time both these lines of research. We study the general properties of closed transitive relations ("streams") containing the space of orbits of a discrete- or continuous-time semi-flow and we argue that these relations play a central role in the qualitative study of DSs. All most studied concepts of recurrence currently in literature can be defined in terms of our streams. Finally, we show how to associate to each stream a graph encoding its qualitative properties.
  The current revision fixes some proof, adds some missing one and adds some example and clarification.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We developed several combinatorial notions about laminations some with clear implications for parameter space. We introduce a simplified class of laminations called finite dynamical laminations (FDL). In order to count FDL, we introduce sibling portraits, of which we provide a comprehensive counting theorem. We provide a characterization of which periodic polygons appear in invariant laminations. We introduce the pullback tree. The base of the pullback tree is a set of laminations, and we show that those laminations are proper and invariant and have a restriction on its critical leaves, so all laminations in the base of the pullback tree correspond to a polynomial. We define the generational FDL graph, and it provides a summary of the combinatorial information we provide about polynomial parameter space.</description>

      <title>Exponential mixing and essential spectral gaps for Anosov subgroups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a Zariski dense $\Theta$-Anosov subgroup of a connected semisimple real algebraic group for some nonempty subset of simple roots $\Theta$. In the Anosov setting, there is a natural compact metric space $\mathcal{X}$ equipped with a family of translation flows $\{a^{\mathsf{v}}_t\}_{t \in \mathbb R}$, parameterized by vectors $\mathsf{v}$ in the interior of the $\Theta$-limit cone $\mathcal{L}_\Theta$ of $\Gamma$, which are conjugate to reparametrizations of the Gromov geodesic flow. We prove that for all $\mathsf{v}$ outside an exceptional cone $\mathscr{E} \subset \operatorname{int}\mathcal{L}_\Theta$, which is a smooth image of the linear spans of the walls of the Weyl chamber, the translation flow is exponentially mixing with respect to the Bowen-Margulis-Sullivan measure associated to $\mathsf{v}$. Moreover, the exponential rate is uniform for a compact set of such vectors. We also obtain an essential spectral gap for the Selberg zeta function and a prime orbit theorem with a power saving error term. Our proof relies on Lie theoretic techniques to prove the crucial local non-integrability condition (LNIC) for the translation flows and thereby implement Dolgopyat's method in a uniform fashion. The exceptional cone $\mathscr{E}$ arises from the failure of LNIC for those vectors.</description>

Abstract: A discrete-time deterministic dynamical system is governed at every step by a predetermined law. However the dynamics can lead to many complexities in the phase space and in the domain of observables that makes it comparable to a stochastic process. This behavior is characterized by properties such as mixing and ergodicity. This article presents two different approximation schemes for such a dynamical system. Each scheme approximates the ergodicity of the deterministic dynamics using different principles. The first is a step-skew product system, in which a finite state Markov process drives a dynamics on Euclidean space. The second is a continuous-time skew-product system, in which a deterministic, mixing flow intermittently drives a deterministic flow through a topological space created by gluing cylinders. This system is called a perturbed pipe-flow. We show how these three representations are interchangeable. It is proved that the distribution induced on the space of paths by these three types of dynamics can be made arbitrarily close to each other. This indicates that it is impossible to decide whether a general timeseries is generated by a deterministic or stochastic process, and is of continuous or discrete time.</description>

      <title>Backtracking New Q-Newton's method for finding roots of meromorphic functions in 1 complex variable: Global convergence, and local stable/unstable curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we research more in depth properties of Backtracking New Q-Newton's method (recently designed by the third author), when used to find roots of meromorphic functions.
  If $f=P/Q$, where $P$ and $Q$ are polynomials in 1 complex variable z with $\deg (P)&gt;\deg (Q)$, we show the existence of an exceptional set $\mathcal{E}\subset\mathbf{C}$, which is contained in a countable union of real analytic curves in $\mathbf{R}^2=\mathbf{C}$, so that the following statements A and B hold. Here, $\{z_n\}$ is the sequence constructed by BNQN with an initial point $z_0$ which is not a pole of $f$.
  A) If $z_0\in\mathbf{C}\backslash\mathcal{E}$, then $\{z_n\}$ converges to a root of $f$.
  B) If $z_0\in \mathcal{E}$, then $\{z_n\}$ converges to a critical point - but not a root - of $f$.
  Experiments seem to indicate that in general, even when $f$ is a polynomial, the set $\mathcal{E}$ is not contained in a finite union of real analytic curves. We provide further results relevant to whether locally $\mathcal{E}$ is contained in a finite number of real analytic curves. A similar result holds for general meromorphic functions. Moreover, unlike previous work, here we do not require that the parameters of BNQN are random, or that the meromorphic function $f$ is generic.
  Based on the theoretical results, we explain (both rigorously and heuristically) of what observed in experiments with BNQN, in previous works by the authors. In particular, the dynamics of BNQN (an iterative method) seems to have some striking similarities to Newton's method (a continuous method) and the classical Poincar\'e-Bendixon theorem for differentiable real dynamical systems on the complex plane. This is the more interesting given that discrete versions of Newton's method (e.g. Relaxed Newton's method) does not behave this way.</description>

      <title>Finite type as fundamental objects even non-single-valued and non-continuous</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11675v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the shadowing property for general upper semicontinuous set-valued maps, inspired by Good and Meddaugh [11], we identify the fundamental objects underpinning the shadowing theory for such maps. Specifically, we explore the relationships among shifts of finite type, the simplest set-valued maps, and the shadowing property.
  Our main result establishes that if $X$ is a compact, totally disconnected Hausdorff space, and $F$ is an upper semicontinuous closed-valued map on $X$ with the set-valued shadowing property, the following hold:
  (1) If $F$ is expansive, the orbit system of $(X,F)$ is conjugate to a shift of finite type.
  (2) Without expansiveness, $(X,F)$ is conjugate to an inverse limit of a net of the simplest set-valued systems satisfying the Mittag-Leffler condition. Additionally, the orbit system of $(X,F)$ is conjugate to an inverse limit of a net of shifts of finite type, also satisfying the Mittag-Leffler condition
  As a consequence, if an upper semicontinuous set-valued map on a totally disconnected space has the set-valued shadowing property, its orbit system also exhibits the single-valued shadowing property.</description>

Abstract: We calculate explicit estimates for the dimension of trajectories satisfying a certain growth bound. We generalize the classic results of Kurzweil by considering nonlinear nonautonomous and uniformly compact dynamical systems on normed spaces over arbitrary fields. We furthermore refine the results in the case of delay equations, greatly simplifying the relevant growth bounds.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the ergodic closing lemma of Ma\~n\'e, we investigate the $C^\infty$ closing lemma in higher-dimensional Hamiltonian systems, with a focus on the statistical behavior of periodic orbits generated by $C^\infty$-small perturbations. We demonstrate that, under certain Floer-theoretic conditions, invariant or recurrent Lagrangian submanifolds can give rise to periodic orbits whose statistical properties are controllable. For instance, we show that for Hamiltonian systems preserving the zero section in $T^*\mathbb{T}^n$, $C^\infty$ generically, there exist periodic orbits converging to an invariant measure supported on the zero section.</description>

      <title>Self-simulable groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2104.05141v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We say that a finitely generated group $\Gamma$ is self-simulable if every effectively closed action of $\Gamma$ on a closed subset of $\{\texttt{0},\texttt{1}\}^{\mathbb{N}}$ is the topological factor of a $\Gamma$-subshift of finite type. We show that self-simulable groups exist, that any direct product of non-amenable finitely generated groups is self-simulable, that under technical conditions self-simulability is inherited from subgroups, and that the subclass of self-simulable groups is stable under commensurability and quasi-isometries of finitely presented groups.
  Some notable examples of self-simulable groups obtained are the direct product $F_k \times F_k$ of two free groups of rank $k \geq 2$, non-amenable finitely generated branch groups, the simple groups of Burger and Mozes, Thompson's $V$, the groups $\operatorname{GL}_n(\mathbb{Z})$, $\operatorname{SL}_n(\mathbb{Z})$, $\operatorname{Aut}(F_n)$ and $\operatorname{Out}(F_n)$ for $n \geq 5$; The braid groups $B_m$ for $m \geq 7$, and certain classes of RAAGs. We also show that Thompson's $F$ is self-simulable if and only if $F$ is non-amenable, thus giving a computability characterization of this well-known open problem. We also exhibit a few applications of self-simulability on the dynamics of these groups, notably, that every self-simulable group with decidable word problem admits a nonempty strongly aperiodic subshift of finite type.</description>

      <title>On small breathers of nonlinear Klein-Gordon equations via exponentially small homoclinic splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.14566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.14566v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Breathers are nontrivial time-periodic and spatially localized solutions of nonlinear dispersive partial differential equations (PDEs). Families of breathers have been found for certain integrable PDEs but are believed to be rare in non-integrable ones such as nonlinear Klein-Gordon equations. In this paper we show that small amplitude breathers of \emph{any} temporal frequency do not exist for semilinear Klein-Gordon equations with generic analytic odd nonlinearities.
  A breather with small amplitude exists only when its temporal frequency is close to be resonant with the linear Klein-Gordon dispersion relation. Our main result is that, for such frequencies, we rigorously identify the leading order term in the exponentially small (with respect to the small amplitude) obstruction to the existence of small breathers in terms of the so-called \emph{Stokes constant}, which depends on the nonlinearity analytically, but is independent of the frequency. This gives a rigorous justification of a formal asymptotic argument by Kruskal and Segur \cite{KS87} in the analysis of small breathers.
  We rely on the spatial dynamics approach where breathers can be seen as homoclinic orbits. The birth of such small homoclinics is analyzed via a singular perturbation setting where a Bogdanov-Takens type bifurcation is coupled to infinitely many rapidly oscillatory directions. The leading order term of the exponentially small splitting between the stable/unstable invariant manifolds is obtained through a careful analysis of the analytic continuation of their parameterizations. This requires the study of another limit equation in the complexified evolution variable, the so-called \emph{inner equation}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.06658v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We design nonlinear and adaptive linear model-predictive control (MPC) techniques to minimize operational costs of compressor-actuated dynamics in natural gas pipeline networks. We establish stability of the local linear system and derive rigorous bounds on error between the nonlinear and linear system solutions. These bounds are used to quantify conditions under which the linear MPC can substitute the nonlinear MPC without significant loss of predictive accuracy. Furthermore, we prove and numerically verify that the computational cost of the linear MPC is orders of magnitude lower than that of solving the baseline optimal control problem. Numerical simulations are performed on nontrivial networks to demonstrate that the proposed MPC can effectively adapt to varying load conditions while maintaining nearly 95% optimality.</description>

Abstract: With a mere usage of well-established properties of para-differential operators, the conjugacy equations in several model KAM problems are converted to para-homological equations solvable by standard fixed point argument. Such discovery greatly simplifies KAM proofs, renders the traditional KAM iteration steps unnecessary, and may suggest a systematic scheme of finding quasi-periodic solutions of realistic magnitude.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Calculus for the Theta Process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05523v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theta process is a stochastic process of number theoretical origin arising as a scaling limit of quadratic Weyl sums. It can be described in terms of the geodesic flow and an automorphic function on a homogeneous space. This process has several properties in common with Brownian motion such as its H\"older regularity, uncorrelated increments and quadratic variation. However, crucially, we show that the theta process is not a semimartingale, making It\^o calculus techniques inapplicable. Instead, we use the celebrated rough paths theory to develop the stochastic calculus for the theta process. We do so by constructing the iterated integrals - the ``rough path" - above the theta process. Rough paths theory takes a signal and its iterated integrals and produces a vast and robust theory of stochastic differential equations. In addition, the rough path we construct can be described in terms of higher rank theta sums, via equidistribution of horocycle lifts.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces heat semigroups of topological Markov chains and Cuntz-Krieger algebras by means of spectral noncommutative geometry. Using recent advances on the logarithmic Dirichlet Laplacian on Ahlfors regular metric-measure spaces, we construct spectral triples on Cuntz-Krieger algebras from singular integral operators. These spectral triples exhaust odd K-homology and for Cuntz algebras we can compute their heat operators explicitly as Riesz potential operators. We also describe their isometry group in terms of the automorphism group of the underlying directed graph and prove that the Voiculescu noncommutative topological entropy vanishes on isometries.</description>

Abstract: Examples of stochastic processes whose state space representations involve functions of an integral type structure $$I_{t}^{(a,b)}:=\int_{0}^{t}b(Y_{s})e^{-\int_{s}^{t}a(Y_{r})dr}ds, \quad t\ge 0$$ are studied under an ergodic semi-Markovian environment described by an $S$ valued jump type process $Y:=(Y_{s}:s\in\mathbb{R}^{+})$ that is ergodic with a limiting distribution $\pi\in\mathcal{P}(S)$. Under different assumptions on signs of $E_{\pi}a(\cdot):=\sum_{j\in S}\pi_{j}a(j)$ and tail properties of the sojourn times of $Y$ we obtain different long time limit results for $I^{(a,b)}_{}:=(I^{(a,b)}_{t}:t\ge 0).$ In all cases mixture type of laws emerge which are naturally represented through an affine stochastic recurrence equation (SRE) $X\stackrel{d}{=}AX+B,\,\, X\perp\!\!\!\perp (A, B)$. Examples include explicit long-time representations of pitchfork bifurcation, and regime-switching diffusions under semi-Markov modulated environments, etc.</description>

      <title>The impact of recovery rate heterogeneity in achieving herd immunity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13130</link>

Abstract: Herd immunity is a critical concept in epidemiology, describing a threshold at which a sufficient proportion of a population is immune, either through infection or vaccination, thereby preventing sustained transmission of a pathogen. In the classic Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model, which has been widely used to study infectious disease dynamics, the achievement of herd immunity depends on key parameters, including the transmission rate ($\beta$) and the recovery rate ($\gamma$), where $\gamma$ represents the inverse of the mean infectious period. While the transmission rate has received substantial attention, recent studies have underscored the significant role of $\gamma$ in determining the timing and sustainability of herd immunity. Additionally, it is becoming increasingly evident that assuming $\gamma$ as a constant parameter might oversimplify the dynamics, as variations in recovery times can reflect diverse biological, social, and healthcare-related factors.
  In this paper, we investigate how heterogeneity in the recovery rate affects herd immunity. We show empirically that the mean of the recovery rate is not a reliable metric for determining the achievement of herd immunity. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical result demonstrating that it is instead the mean recovery time, which is the mean of the inverse $1/\gamma$ of the recovery rate that is critical in deciding whether herd immunity is achievable within the SIR framework. A similar result is proved for the SEIR model. These insights have significant implications for public health interventions and theoretical modeling of epidemic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Multi-Frequency Oscillation Estimates Arising in Pointwise Ergodic Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12887v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish essentially optimal $L^2(\mathbb{R})$-estimates for variational variants of the maximal Fourier multiplier operators considered by Bourgain in his work on pointwise convergence of polynomial ergodic averages. We do so by addressing a simpler operator and then applying cheap interpolation methods. While elementary, these methods are strong enough to address the issue of pointwise convergence along fractional parts of real-variable polynomials in the regime $\frac{2d}{d+1} &lt; p \leq \infty$, namely the pointwise convergence of \[ \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n \leq N} T^{\lfloor P(n) \rfloor} f, \; \; \; f \in L^p(X,\mu), \ P \in \mathbb{R}[\cdot], \ \text{deg}(P) = d \] for any $\sigma$-finite measure space equipped with a measure-preserving transformation, $T:X \to X$.</description>
