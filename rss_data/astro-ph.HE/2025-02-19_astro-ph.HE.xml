      <title>A shocking outcome: Jet dynamics and polarimetric signatures of the multi-band flare in blazar OJ 248</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The connection between $\gamma$-ray flares and blazars is a topic of active research, with few sources exhibiting distinct enough such outbursts to be able to conclusively connect them to features in their jet morphology. Here we present an investigation of the sole $\gamma$-ray flare of the blazar OJ 248 thus far, in association with its jet structure, as revealed by very long baseline interferometry (VLBI). We find that throughout the course of the $\gamma$-ray flare, the fractional linear polarisation increases in the jet of OJ 248, and the VLBI electric vector position angles (EVPAs) turn perpendicular to the bulk jet flow. We interpret this behaviour as a moving shock, travelling through a recollimation shock and upscattering photons via the inverse Compton scattering process, producing a $\gamma$-ray flare; we discuss possible mechanisms. Our hypothesised shock-shock interaction scenario is a viable mechanism to induce such EVPA rotations in both optical and radio bands.</description>

      <title>ULX collimation by outflows in moderately magnetized neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform radiative magnetohydrodynamics simulations in general relativity (GRRMHD) of super-Eddington disk accretion onto neutron stars endowed with a magnetic dipole corresponding to surface strengths not exceeding 100 GigaGauss. Accretion is found to power strong outflows which collimate the emergent radiation of the accretion columns, leading to apparent radiative luminosities of $\sim 100$ Eddington, when the true luminosity is a few Eddington units. Surprisingly, the collimation cone/angle widens with increasing magnetic field. Thus, in our simulations the apparent luminosity of the neutron star is substantially larger for the weaker magnetic fields ($10^{10}\,$G) than for the stronger ones ($10^{11}\,$G). We conclude that a super-Eddington accreting neutron star with the dipole magnetic field $10^{10}\,$G is the most likely source of ultraluminous X-rays.</description>

      <title>The nature of an imaginary quasi-periodic oscillation in the soft-to-hard transition of MAXI J1820+070</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent study shows that if the power spectra (PS) of accreting compact objects consist of a combination of Lorentzian functions that are coherent in different energy bands but incoherent with each other, the same is true for the Real and Imaginary parts of the cross spectrum (CS). Using this idea, we discovered imaginary quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in NICER observations of the black hole candidate MAXI J1820+070. The imaginary QPOs appear as narrow features with a small Real and large Imaginary part in the CS but are not significantly detected in the PS when they overlap in frequency with other variability components. The coherence function drops and the phase lags increase abruptly at the frequency of the imaginary QPO. We show that the multi-Lorentzian model that fits the PS and CS of the source in two energy bands correctly reproduces the lags and the coherence, and that the narrow drop of the coherence is caused by the interaction of the imaginary QPO with other variability components. The imaginary QPO appears only in the decay of the outburst, during the transition from the high-soft to the low-hard state of MAXI J1820+070, and its frequency decreases from approximately 5 Hz to around 1 Hz as the source spectrum hardens. We also analysed the earlier observations of the transition, where no narrow features were seen, and we identified a QPO in the PS that appears to evolve into the imaginary QPO as the source hardens. As for the type-B and C QPOs in this source, the rms spectrum of the imaginary QPO increases with energy. The lags of the imaginary QPO are similar to those of the type-B and C QPOs above 2 keV but differ from the lags of those other QPOs below that energy. While the properties of this imaginary QPO resemble those of type-C QPOs, we cannot rule out that it is a new type of QPO.</description>

      <title>On the Feasibility of Deriving Pseudo-Redshifts of Gamma-ray Bursts from Two Phenomenological Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate knowledge of gamma-ray burst (GRB) redshifts is essential for studying their intrinsic properties and exploring their potential application in cosmology. Currently, only a small fraction of GRBs have independent redshift measurements, primarily due to the need of rapid follow-up optical/IR spectroscopic observations. For this reason, many have utilized phenomenological correlations to derive pseudo-redshifts of GRBs with no redshift measurement. In this work, we explore the feasibility of analytically deriving pseudo-redshifts directly from the Amati and Yonetoku relations. We simulate populations of GRBs that (i) fall perfectly on the phenomenological correlation track, and (ii) include intrinsic scatter matching observations. Our findings indicate that, in the case of the Amati relation , the mathematical formulation is ill-behaved so that it yields two solutions within a reasonable redshift range $z \in [0.1, 10] $. When realistic scatter is included, it may result in no solution, or the redshift error range is excessively large. In the case of the Yonetoku relation, while it can result in a unique solution in most cases, the large systematic errors of the redshift calls for attention, especially when attempting to use pseudo redshifts to study GRB population properties.</description>

      <title>Self-Similar Solutions for Geometrically Thin Accretion Disks with Magnetically Driven Winds: Application to Tidal Disruption Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analytically derive self-similar solutions for a time-dependent, one-dimensional, magnetically driven accretion disk wind model derived from the magnetohydrodynamic equations. The model assumes a geometrically thin, gas-pressure dominated accretion disk, and incorporates both magnetic braking and turbulent viscosity through an extended alpha-viscosity prescription in the vertical and radial directions, respectively. The $\alpha$ parameter for the vertical stress is assumed to vary with the disk aspect ratio. We confirm that our self-similar solutions without the wind matches with the classical solution of Cannizzo et al. (1990) that the mass accretion rate follows the power law of time $t^{-19/16}$, which has been used as a good indicator for the mass accretion rate of a tidal disruption event (TDE) disk. In contrast, in the presence of the wind, the mass accretion and loss rates decay more steeply than $t^{-19/16}$. We also confirm that the power-law indices of the mass accretion and loss rates are consistent with those obtained from the numerical simulations of Tamilan et al. (2024) at late times. In particular, we find that magnetic braking leads to a faster decay of the mass accretion rate, mass loss rate, and bolometric luminosity, and they asymptote to $t^{-5/2}$ in the strong poloidal magnetic field. This steep index can serve as evidence for magnetocentrifugally driven winds with a strong poloidal magnetic field in the context of TDEs.</description>

      <title>VLBI Imaging of Parsec-scale Radio Structures in Nearby Low-luminosity AGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the results of high-resolution 5 GHz Very Long Baseline Array and European VLBI Network observations of 36 nearby galaxies, an extension of the Legacy e-MERLIN Multi-band Imaging of Nearby Galaxies (LeMMINGs) survey. Our sample includes 21 low ionization nuclear emission regions (LINERs), 4 Seyferts, 3 absorption line galaxies (ALGs), and 8 HII galaxies. We achieved an unprecedented detection rate, successfully imaging 23 out of 36 sources with a detection threshold of $\sim$20 $\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$. The radio sizes are typically of $\leq$ 5 pc. Core identification was achieved in 16 sources, while 7 others were identified as core candidates. Radio luminosities of the sample range from 10$\rm ^{34}$ to 10$\rm ^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Our analysis reveals a predominance of compact core structures, with ten sources exhibiting a one-sided core jet morphology and NGC 2146 exhibiting a rare two-sided jet structure. The study advances our understanding of the compactness of radio sources at various scales, indicating a core-dominated nature in all but one galaxy NGC2655. We find moderate to strong correlations between radio luminosity, black hole mass, optical [O III] line luminosity, and hard X-ray luminosity, suggesting a common active galactic nucleus (AGN) core origin. These results provide new insights into the fundamental plane of black hole activity and support the role of the synchrotron process in Low-luminosity AGN (LLAGN) radio emission.</description>

      <title>Signature of Seyfert-like component in a blazar 3C 273 and its reflection-based explanation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of blazar 3C 273 obtained from simultaneous observations obtained using XMM-Newton and NuSTAR satellites during the period 2015-2019 in five epochs. When the spectra are modeled with a power-law, significant residuals arise below 2 keV and in the energy range of 30-78 keV in NuSTAR data. Residuals in the lower energy band represent soft X-ray excess while at higher energies it likely represents Compton reflection hump which might be a weak component arising from dense and cold material. The presence of a faint iron line is present in XMM-Newton observations. We interpret such features as attributed to the coronal emission plus those arising from reflection from an accretion disk. We model the SEDs with the single zone inverse Compton jet model based on Synchrotron Self Compton and External Compton phenomena. It is found that a one-zone synchrotron plus IC model explains quite well the SEDs but the jet component alone fails to fit the multiband X-ray emission for the low state of this object in 2018 and 2019 which arises due to spectral flattening at low energy X-rays, indicating that an additional Seyfert-like thermal component must be present at X-rays. This is further supported by a big blue bump present in the optical/ultraviolet band in all SEDs. Finally, we analyzed all the epochs using relxill model to incorporate relativistic reflection to model those residuals of soft excess and Compton hump in the X-ray bands.</description>

      <title>Reverse and forward shock afterglow emission from steep jets viewed off axis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the morphology of gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows viewed off-axis using a simplified analytical model. We consider steep jets, which are expected to be the most common type. These jets, characterized by steep lateral gradients in energy and Lorentz factor, produce highly beamed emission. The observed signal is dominated by their minimum visible angle at any given time. Consequently, the afterglow morphology depends on when this angle begins to decrease, revealing the inner regions of the jet. Depending on whether this decrease occurs before, at, or after the reverse shock crosses the ejecta, three distinct classes of light curves emerge. In the first scenario, the de-beamed emission can produce a rapidly rising signal even prior to the reverse shock crossing. This is expected in GRBs with long duration, low energy, dense circumburst media, or combinations thereof. In some cases, the ejecta shell can be considered as effectively thick in the inner regions and effectively thin in the outer regions. For forward shocks, the temporal slopes in both regimes are identical, which makes it hard to detect the transition. Reverse shocks, however, have distinct temporal slopes, allowing potential detection of the transition in light curves if their emission surpasses that of the forward shock. The characteristic synchrotron frequency of de-beamed emission evolves independently of jet structure for forward shocks but depends on the lateral energy and Lorentz factor gradients for the reverse shock, with slower evolution for steep energy and shallow Lorentz factor gradients.</description>

      <title>Exploring Axion-Like Particle from observation of FSRQ Ton 599 by Fermi-LAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High energy photons traveling through astrophysical magnetic fields have the potential to undergo oscillations with axion-like particles (ALPs), resulting in modifications to the observed photon spectrum. High energy $\gamma-$ray sources with significant magnetic field strengths provide an ideal setting to investigate this phenomenon. Ton 599, a flat spectrum radio quasar with a magnetic field strength on the order of Gauss in its emission region, presents a promising opportunity for studying ALP-photon oscillations. In this study, we analyze the effects of ALP-photon oscillations on the $\gamma$-ray spectrum of Ton 599 as observed by Fermi-LAT. Our investigation considers the potential influences of the broad-line region and dusty torus on the $\gamma-$ray spectrum of Ton 599. We set the constraints on the ALP parameters at the $95\%$ confidence level, and find that the constraints on \(g_{a\gamma}\) can reach approximately \(2 \times 10^{-12}~\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}\) for \(m_a \sim 10^{9}~\mathrm{eV}\).</description>

      <title>KM3-230213A: An Ultra-High Energy Neutrino from a Year-Long Astrophysical Transient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Km3NET collaboration has recently reported the detection of a neutrino event with energy in excess of 100 PeV. This detection is in 2.5-3$\sigma$ tension with the upper limit on the neutrino flux at this energy imposed by IceCube and the Pierre Auger Observatory, if the event is considered part of the diffuse all-sky neutrino flux. We explore an alternative possibility that the event originates from a flare of an isolated source. We show that the data of Km3NET, IceCube and the Pierre Auger Observatory are consistent with the possibility of a source flare of duration $T \lesssim 2$ yr with muon neutrino flux $F \approx 3\times 10^{-10}(1\mbox{ yr }/ T)$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. Constraints on the neutrino spectrum indicate that the protons responsible for the neutrino emission have a very hard spectrum in the $E_p\gtrsim 10^{19}$ eV energy range, or otherwise that the neutrinos are produced by photohadronic interactions with infrared photons. The all-sky rate of similar neutrino flaring sources is constrained to be $R\lesssim 0.4/$ yr.</description>

      <title>On testing in-vacuo dispersion with the most energetic neutrinos: KM3-230213A case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phenomenology of in-vacuo dispersion, an effect such that quantum properties of spacetime slow down particles proportionally to their energies, has been a very active research area since the advent of the Fermi telescope. One of the assumptions made in this 15-year effort is that the phenomenology of in-vacuo dispersion has a particle-energy sweet spot: the energy of the particle should be large enough to render the analysis immune to source-intrinsic confounding effects but still small enough to facilitate the identification of the source of the particle. We use the gigantic energy of KM3-230213A as an opportunity to challenge this expectation. For a neutrino of a few hundred PeVs a transient source could have been observed at lower energies several years earlier, even assuming that the characteristic scale of in-vacuo dispersion be close to the Planck scale. We report that GRB090401B is in excellent directional agreement with KM3-230213A, and we discuss a strategy of in-vacuo-dispersion analysis suitable for estimating the significance of KM3-230213A as a GRB090401B-neutrino candidate. We find significance at the level of a p-value of 0.01, not small enough to warrant any excitement, but small enough to establish the point that a handful of such coincidences would suffice to meaningfully test in-vacuo dispersion.</description>

      <title>Nonstatic Reissner-Nordstr$\phi$m metric in the perturbative $f(R)$ theory: Embedding in the background of the FLRW cosmology, uniqueness of solutions, the TOV equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article introduces a nonstatic Reissner-Nordstr$\phi$m metric, a metric that does not emit electromagnetic waves but can emit gravitational waves. We first use the GR theory to study a charged spherically symmetric gravitational source (CSSGS), the obtained results are further improved in comparison with the previous studies. In particular, this article considers that the field is not necessarily static. The metric tensors $ g_{\mu\nu} $ are considered both outside and inside the gravitational source (the results show that in the first case $ g_{\mu\nu} $ are time independent, in the latter case they are time dependent). The gravitational acceleration and the event horizon of a charged black hole are investigated. The results prove that the gravitational field is always attractive. We then use the perturbative $ f(R) $ theory to consider CSSGS. The obtained results not only correct the solution of Einstein's equation in magnitude (this will describe astronomical and cosmological quantities more accurately than Einstein's equation), but also reveal new effects. Outside the gravitational source, the metric tensors can depend on time, this makes it possible for a spherically symmetric gravitational source to emit gravitational waves (Einstein's equation cannot give this effect). However, a spherically symmetric field still does not emit electromagnetic waves. Next we present a new method for embedding the spherically symmetric metrics of a star (or a black hole) in the background of the FLRW cosmological. Finally, we discuss the uniqueness of the solutions of the f(R) theory. The perturbative TOV equation is also found.</description>

      <title>Chiral Symmetry in Dense Matter with Meson Condensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kaon condensation in hyperon-mixed matter [($Y$+$K$) phase], which may be realized in neutron stars, is discussed on the basis of chiral symmetry. With the use of the effective chiral Lagrangian for kaon--baryon and kaon--kaon interactions; coupled with the relativistic mean field theory and universal three-baryon repulsive interaction, we clarify the effects of the $s$-wave kaon--baryon scalar interaction simulated by the kaon--baryon sigma terms and vector interaction (Tomozawa--Weinberg term) on kaon properties in hyperon-mixed matter, the onset density of kaon condensation, and the equation of state with the ($Y$+$K$) phase. In particular, the quark condensates in the ($Y$+$K$) phase are obtained, and their relevance to chiral symmetry restoration is discussed.</description>

      <title>Systematic biases from the exclusion of higher harmonics in parameter estimation on LISA binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The remarkable sensitivity achieved by the planned Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will allow us to observe gravitational-wave signals from the mergers of massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the hundreds, or even thousands. At such high SNR, our ability to precisely infer the parameters of an MBHB from the detected signal will be limited by the accuracy of the waveform templates we use. In this paper, we explore the systematic biases that arise in parameter estimation if we use waveform templates that do not model radiation in higher-order multipoles. This is an important consideration for the large fraction of high-mass events expected to be observed with LISA. We examine how the biases change for MBHB events with different total masses, mass ratios, and inclination angles. We find that systematic biases due to insufficient mode content are severe for events with total redshifted mass $\gtrsim10^6\,M_\odot$. We then compare several methods of predicting such systematic biases without performing a full Bayesian parameter estimation. In particular, we show that through direct likelihood optimization it is possible to predict systematic biases with remarkable computational efficiency and accuracy. Finally, we devise a method to construct approximate waveforms including angular multipoles with $\ell\geq5$ to better understand how many additional modes (beyond the ones available in current approximants) might be required to perform unbiased parameter estimation on the MBHB signals detected by LISA.</description>

      <title>Searching For Superheavy Decaying Particles With Ultra-High-Energy Neutrino Observatories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If there exist unstable but long-lived relics of the early universe, their decays could produce detectable fluxes of gamma rays and neutrinos. In this paper, we point out that the decays of superheavy particles, $m_{\chi} \gtrsim 10^{10} \, \text{GeV}$,would produce an enhanced flux of ultra-high-energy neutrinos through the processes of muon and pion pair production in the resulting electromagnetic cascades. These processes transfer energy from electromagnetic decay products into neutrinos, relaxing the constraints that can be derived from gamma-ray observations, and increasing the sensitivity of high-energy neutrino telescopes to superheavy particle decays. Taking this into account, we derive new constraints on long-lived superheavy relics from the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, and from the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope. We find that IceCube-Gen2, and other next generation neutrino telescopes, will provide unprecedented sensitivity to the decays of superheavy dark matter particles and other long-lived relics.</description>

      <title>Lower bound on the radii of circular orbits in the extremal Kerr black-hole spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is often stated in the physics literature that maximally-spinning Kerr black-hole spacetimes are characterized by near-horizon co-rotating circular geodesics of radius $r_{\text{circular}}$ with the property $r_{\text{circular}}\to r^+_{\text{H}}$, where $r_{\text{H}}$ is the horizon radius of the extremal black hole. Based on the famous Thorne hoop conjecture, in the present compact paper we provide evidence for the existence of a non-trivial lower bound ${{r_{\text{circular}}-r_{\text{H}}}\over{r_{\text{H}}}}\gtrsim (\mu/M)^{1/2}$ on the radii of circular orbits in the extremal Kerr black-hole spacetime, where $\mu/M$ is the dimensionless mass ratio which characterizes the composed black-hole-orbiting-particle system.</description>

      <title>Improved constraints on the Faraday rotation towards eight fast radio bursts using dense grids of polarized radio galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present 2-4 GHz observations of polarized radio galaxies towards eight fast radio bursts (FRBs), producing grids of Faraday rotation measure (RM) sources with sky densities of 9-28 polarized sources per square degree. Using a Bayesian interpolation framework, we constrain Galactic RM fluctuations below ~ 1 degree squared angular scales around the FRB positions. Despite the positions of all eight FRBs far from the Galactic plane, we constrain previously unresolved small-scale Galactic RM structures around six of the eight FRBs. In two of these fields, we find potential changes in the sign of the Galactic RM that are not captured by previous, sparsely sampled RM grid observations. Our Galactic RM estimate towards the FRBs differs between a few rad m^-2 up to ~ 40 rad m^-2 from the all-sky Galactic RM map of Hutschenreuter et al. (2022). Extrapolating our results to the known population of polarized FRB sources, we may be incorrectly interpreting the host galaxy RM for ~ 30% of the FRB source population with current RM grid observations. Measuring small-scale Galactic RM variations is crucial for identifying FRBs in low density and weakly magnetized environments, which in turn could serve as potent probes of cosmic magnetism. This framework of reconstructing continuous Galactic RM structure from RM grid observations can be readily applied to FRBs that fall in the sky coverage of upcoming large-sky radio polarization surveys of radio galaxies, such as the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS) and the Polarization Sky Survey of the Universe's Magnetism (POSSUM).</description>

      <title>Can wormholes mirror the quasi-normal mode spectrum of Schwarzschild black holes?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wormholes are exotic compact objects characterized by the absence of essential singularities and horizons, acting as slender bridges linking two distinct regions of spacetime. Despite their theoretical significance, they remain however undetected, possibly due to their ability to closely mimic the observational properties of black holes. This study explores whether a static and spherically symmetric wormhole within General Relativity can reproduce the quasi-normal mode spectrum of a Schwarzschild black hole under scalar, electromagnetic, and axial gravitational perturbations, both individually and in combination. To address this, we reformulate the wormhole metric components using a near-throat parametrization. Our analysis concentrates on the fundamental mode and first overtone, estimated via the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin method. By employing a customized minimization strategy, we demonstrate that within a specific region of the parameter space, a wormhole can successfully replicate a subset of the black hole quasi-normal mode spectrum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supermassive binary black holes (SMBBHs) are the anticipated byproducts of galaxy mergers and play a pivotal role in shaping galaxy evolution, gravitational wave emissions, and accretion physics. Despite their theoretical prevalence, direct observational evidence for SMBBHs remains elusive, with only a handful of candidates identified to date. This paper explores optimal strategies and key environments for locating SMBBHs, focusing on observational signatures in the broad Balmer lines. We present a preliminary analysis on a flux-limited sample of sources belonging to an evolved spectral type along the quasar main sequence, and we discuss the spectroscopic clues indicative of binary activity and highlight the critical role of time-domain spectroscopic surveys in uncovering periodic variability linked to binary systems.</description>

      <title>Resonant axion-plasmon conversion in neutron star magnetospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Resonant axion-plasmon conversion in the magnetospheres of magnetars may substantially impact the landscape of dark-matter axion detection. This work explores how resonant axion-plasmon conversion, through a mechanism that is analogous to the Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein (NSW) effect in neutrinos, modify the expected radio signals from axion-photon conversions observed on Earth. Critically, the resonant conversion radius lies within the region expected for axion-photon conversion, introducing a nonradiative power loss that diminishes the anticipated photon flux. Our analysis demonstrates that this effect can reduce radio telescope sensitivities, shifting them into regions excluded by previous experiments. These findings compel a reassessment of experimental constraints derived from radio signatures of axion-photon conversions and highlight the necessity of accounting for plasmon effects in astrophysical axion searches. The presented corrections provide critical insights for refining the detection strategies of future telescope-based dark matter axion experiments.</description>

      <title>Simulating the Galactic population of axion clouds around stellar-origin black holes: Gravitational wave signals in the 10-100 kHz band</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03714v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultralight scalar fields can experience runaway `superradiant' amplification near spinning black holes, resulting in a macroscopic `axion cloud' which slowly dissipates via continuous monochromatic gravitational waves. For a particular range of boson masses, $\mathcal{O}(10^{-11}$ -- $10^{-10})$ eV, an axion cloud will radiate in the $10$ -- $100$ kHz band of the Levitated Sensor Detector (LSD). Using fiducial models of the mass, spin, and age distributions of stellar-origin black holes, we simulate the present-day Milky Way population of these hypothetical objects. As a first step towards assessing the LSD's sensitivity to the resultant ensemble of GW signals, we compute the corresponding signal-to-noise ratios which build up over a nominal integration time of $10^{7}$ s, assuming the projected sensitivity of the $1$-m LSD prototype currently under construction, as well as for future $10$-m and $100$-m concepts. For a $100$-m cryogenic instrument, hundreds of resolvable signals could be expected if the boson mass $\mu$ is around $3\times10^{-11}$ eV, and this number diminishes with increasing $\mu$ up to $\approx 5.5\times10^{-11}$ eV. The much larger population of unresolved sources will produce a confusion foreground which could be detectable by a $10$-m instrument if $\mu \in (3-4.5)\times10^{-11}$ eV, or by a $100$-m instrument if $\mu \in (3-6)\times10^{-11}$ eV.</description>

      <title>The 3D pulsar magnetosphere with machine learning: first results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: All numerical solutions of the pulsar magnetosphere over the past 25 years show closed-line regions that end a significant distance inside the light cylinder, and manifest thick strongly dissipative separatrix surfaces instead of thin current sheets, with a tip that has a distinct pointed Y shape instead of a T shape. We need to understand the origin of these results which were not predicted by our early theories of the pulsar magnetosphere.
  In order to gain new intuition on this problem, we set out to obtain the theoretical steady-state solution of the 3D ideal force-free magnetosphere with zero dissipation along the separatrix and equatorial current sheets. In order to achieve our goal, we needed to develop a novel numerical method.
  We solve two independent magnetospheric problems without current sheet discontinuities in the domains of open and closed field lines, and adjust the shape of their interface (the separatrix) to satisfy pressure balance between the two regions. The solution is obtained with meshless Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs).
  In this paper we present our first results for an inclined dipole rotator using the new methodology. We are able to zoom-in around the Y-point and inside the closed-line region with unprecedented detail, and we observe features that were never been discussed in previous numerical solutions. This is the first time the steady-state 3D problem is addressed directly, and not through a time-dependent simulation that eventually relaxes to a steady-state.
  We have trained a Neural Network that instantaneously yields the three components of the magnetic field and their spatial derivatives at any given point. Our results demonstrate the potential of the new method to generate the reference solution of the ideal pulsar magnetosphere.</description>

      <title>Bow Shock and Local Bubble Plasma Unveiled by the Scintillating Millisecond Pulsar J0437$-$4715</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ionized interstellar medium contains au-scale (and below) structures that scatter radio waves from pulsars, resulting in scintillation. Power spectral analysis of scintillation often shows parabolic arcs, with curvatures that encode the locations and kinematics of the pulsar, Earth, and interstellar plasma. Here we report the discovery of 25 distinct plasma structures in the direction of the brilliant millisecond pulsar, PSR J0437-4715, in observations obtained with the MeerKAT radio telescope. Four arcs reveal structures within 5000 au of the pulsar, from a series of shocks induced as the pulsar and its wind interact with the ambient interstellar medium. The measured radial distance and velocity of the main shock allows us to solve the shock geometry and space velocity of the pulsar in three dimensions, while the velocity of another structure unexpectedly indicates a back flow from the direction of the shock or pulsar-wind tail. The remaining 21 arcs represent a surprising abundance of structures sustained by turbulence within the Local Bubble -- a region of the interstellar medium thought to be depleted of gas by a series of supernova explosions about 14 Myr ago. The Local Bubble is cool enough in areas for sub-au density fluctuations to arise from turbulence.</description>

      <title>Probing cosmic chemical enrichment with next-generation gravitational-wave observatories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By observing binary black hole (BBH) mergers out to the edge of the Universe, next-generation (XG) ground-based gravitational-wave (GW) detectors like Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope will map the BBH merger rate across all of cosmic history. This merger rate traces the formation rate of their progenitor stars convolved with a delay time distribution. Given theoretically-motivated priors on the delay time distribution, we show how XG observations can measure the BBH progenitor formation rate, probing the star formation rate (SFR) up to $z &gt; 15$. However, the progenitor formation rate does not directly give a measurement of the SFR, but rather a combination of the SFR and its metallicity distribution as a function of redshift. Fortunately, the metallicity-dependence of BBH formation likely varies as a function of BBH mass and/or formation channel. We find that if different BBH subpopulations with distinct metallicity biases can be identified, comparing their rates as a function of redshift yields a simultaneous measurement of the SFR and its metallicity distribution. Given optimistic theoretical priors and one year of observation, this may provide a $\sim10\%$ measurement of the SFR at its peak and a 0.2 dex (0.7 dex) measurement of the median metallicity out to $z = 10$ ($z = 15$) at 90\% credibility, although the uncertainties scale with theoretical uncertainties on BBH delay times and formation efficiencies.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Rapid Polarization Angle Variation During the 2022 Outburst of XTE J1701-462</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The geometry of the Comptonization corona in neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries is still unclear. We conducted time-resolved polarimetric analysis of the archival observations of XTE J1701--462 obtained with the \textit{Imaging X-ray Polarimeter Explorer} during its 2022 outburst, and found that the polarization angle (PA) varied significantly with time when the source was in the normal branch (NB), with $67 \pm 8^{\circ}$ in the first epoch, $-34 \pm 8^{\circ}$ in the second, and $-58 \pm 8^{\circ}$ in the third, last epoch. Meanwhile, the polarization degree remained constant at around 2\%, above the minimum detectable polarization at the 99\% confidence level (MDP$_{99}$). The rapid PA variation causes depolarization in the time-averaged data, resulting in a nondetection as reported in the literature. The rapid (intra-day) PA variation may suggest that there is a fast transformation of the corona geometry, likely switching from a slab geometry with enhanced disk emission and reflection, to a more vertically extended spreading layer geometry.</description>

      <title>Signatures of the Shock Interaction as an Additional Power Source in the Nebular Spectra of SN 2023ixf</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Red supergiants may lose significant mass during the final 100-1000 years before core collapse, shaping their circumstellar environment. The supernova (SN) shockwave propagating through this environment forms a shock-swept dense shell that interacts with the surrounding circumstellar material (CSM), generating secondary shocks that energise the ejecta and may power the SN during the nebular phase. In the present work, we investigate the nebular spectrum of SN 2023ixf, observed one-year post-explosion (at +363 d) with the recently commissioned WEAVE instrument on the 4.2m William Herschel Telescope. This marks the first supernova spectrum captured with WEAVE. In this spectrum, H$\alpha$ exhibits a peculiar evolution, flanked by blueward and redward broad components centred at $\sim\pm 5650\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, features that have been observed in only a few SNe as early as one-year post-explosion. These features may indicate energy deposition from shock generated by the interaction of shock-swept dense shell with CSM expelled a few hundred years prior to the explosion. Comparisons of the +363 d spectrum with model spectra from the literature suggest a shock power of at least $\sim5 \times 10 ^{40}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$ at this epoch. Additionally, analysis of the [O I] doublet and other emission lines helped to constrain the oxygen mass ($\lesssim 0.07-0.30 M_\odot$), He-core mass ($\lesssim 3 M_\odot$), and zero-age main sequence mass ($\lesssim 12 M_\odot$) for SN~2023ixf. The comparison with other Type II SNe highlights SN 2023ixf's unique shock interaction signatures and evidence of dust formation, setting it apart in terms of evolution and dynamics.</description>

Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio transients of extragalactic origin, with diverse time-frequency patterns and emission properties that require explanation. With one possible exception, FRBs are detected only in the radio, so analyzing their dynamic spectra is therefore crucial to disentangling the physical processes governing their generation and propagation. Furthermore, comparing FRB morphologies provides insights into possible differences among their progenitors and environments. This study applies unsupervised learning and deep learning techniques to investigate FRB dynamic spectra, focusing on two approaches: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and a Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE) enhanced by an Information-Ordered Bottleneck (IOB) layer. PCA served as a computationally efficient baseline, capturing broad trends, identifying outliers, and providing valuable insights into large datasets. However, its linear nature limited its ability to reconstruct complex FRB structures. In contrast, the IOB-augmented CAE excelled at capturing intricate features, with high reconstruction accuracy and effective denoising at modest signal-to-noise ratios. The IOB layer's ability to prioritize relevant features enabled efficient data compression, preserving key morphological characteristics with minimal latent variables. When applied to real FRBs from CHIME, the IOB-CAE generalized effectively, revealing a latent space that highlighted the continuum of FRB morphologies and the potential for distinguishing intrinsic differences between burst types. This framework demonstrates that while FRBs may not naturally cluster into discrete groups, advanced representation learning techniques can uncover meaningful structures, offering new insights into the diversity and origins of these bursts.</description>

      <title>Constraining first-order phase transition inside neutron stars with application of Bayesian techniques on PSR J0437-4715 NICER data</title>

Abstract: Understanding the existence of exotic matter phases and phase transitions within the core of neutron stars is crucial to advancing our knowledge of cold-dense matter physics. Recent multi-messenger observations, including gravitational waves from neutron star mergers and precise X-ray data from NASA's Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) mission, have significantly constrained the neutron star equation of state (EOS). This study investigates the effects of phase transitions in neutron stars, focusing on NICER's latest observation of PSR J0437-4715. We employ Bayesian inference techniques to evaluate the presence of first-order phase transitions using a piecewise polytropic EOS model. Our analysis incorporates data from multiple NICER sources, to refine constraints on key phase transition parameters, including critical density and transition depth. We find that including data from PSR J0437-4715 improves the evidence of phase transitions and tightens the EOS constraints, especially at higher densities. However, Bayes factor analysis only indicates a slight preference for models without phase transitions and current observational precision is insufficient to draw definitive conclusions. In particular, this polytropic model identifies the critical phase transition mass of neutron stars as being close to 1.4 solar masses, which coincides with the approximate mass range of PSR J0437-4715. This work emphasizes the importance of precise measurements of PSR J0437-4715 for deepening our understanding of neutron star interiors and exploring potential new physics at extreme densities.</description>

      <title>Closed-form solutions of spinning, eccentric binary black holes at 1.5 post-Newtonian order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.01605v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The closed-form solution of the 1.5 post-Newtonian (PN) accurate binary black hole (BBH) Hamiltonian system has proven to be difficult to obtain for a long time since its introduction in 1966. Closed-form solutions of the PN BBH systems with arbitrary parameters (masses, spins, eccentricity) are required for modeling the gravitational waves (GWs) emitted by them. Accurate models of GWs are crucial for their detection by LIGO/Virgo and LISA. Only recently, two solution methods for solving the BBH dynamics were proposed in arXiv:1908.02927 (without using action-angle variables), and arXiv:2012.06586, arXiv:2110.15351 (action-angle based). This paper combines the ideas laid out in the above articles, fills the missing gaps and provides the two solutions which are fully 1.5PN accurate. We also present a public Mathematica package BBHpnToolkit which implements these two solutions and compares them with a fully numerical treatment. The level of agreement between these solutions provides a numerical verification for all the five actions constructed in arXiv:2012.06586, and arXiv:2110.15351. This paper hence serves as a stepping stone for pushing the action-angle-based solution to 2PN order via canonical perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Axion effects on gamma-ray spectral irregularities. II: Implications of EBL absorption</title>

Abstract: The extragalactic background light (EBL) plays a crucial role in the propagation of high-energy particles throughout the Universe. In this work, we explore the impact of the EBL absorption effect on photon to axionlike particle (ALP) conversions from the very-high-energy gamma-ray spectral irregularities. For our purpose, we select four BL Lac blazars: Markarian 501, 1ES 0229+200, PKS 0301-243, and PKS 0447-439 for analysis. Their redshifts range from approximately 0.03 to 0.34. We first discuss the EBL absorption effect on the gamma-ray spectral energy distributions (SEDs) using three common EBL spectral models: Finke-10, Franceschini-17, and Saldana-Lopez-21. Then we consider the photon-ALP conversions in astrophysical magnetic fields. The best-fit chi-square distributions of these EBL models under the ALP assumption in the ALP parameter $\{m_a, g_{a\gamma}\}$ plane are provided, showing similar distributions. For comparison, we define a new delta chi-square, $\chi_d^2$, to quantify the difference in chi-square values. The distributions of $\chi_d^2$ and the gamma-ray SEDs corresponding to the maximum delta chi-square, $\chi^2_{d, \rm max}$, are also presented for comparison. Our results indicate that the influence of these different EBL models is non-dominant at the low-redshift gamma-ray axionscope. In these cases, choosing the latest model, Saldana-Lopez-21, is sufficient. However, as the redshift of the sources increases, this influence becomes more significant.</description>

      <title>Triple Evolution Pathways to Black Hole Low-Mass X-ray Binaries: Insights from V404 Cygni</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15644v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A recent discovery shows that V404 Cygni, a prototypical black hole low-mass X-ray binary (BH-LMXB) is a hierarchical triple: the BH and donor star are orbited by a $1.2$ M$_{\odot}$ tertiary at a distance of at least $3500$ au. Motivated by this system, we evolve a grid of $\sim50,000$ triple star systems, spanning a broad range of initial orbits. Our calculations employ {\tt MESA} stellar evolution models, using {\tt POSYDON}, and self-consistently track the effects of eccentric Kozai-Lidov (EKL) oscillations, mass loss, tides, and BH natal kicks. In our simulations, the progenitors of V404 Cygni-like systems have initial outer separations of $1000 - 10000$ au and inner separations of $\sim100$ au, such that they avoid Roche lobe overflow most of the time. Later on, EKL oscillations drive the inner binary to high eccentricities until tides shrink the orbit and mass transfer begins. Notably, such systems only form in simulations with very weak black hole natal kicks ($\lesssim 5\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$) because stronger kicks unbind the tertiaries. Our simulations also predict a population of BH-LMXB triples that form via the classical common-envelope channel, when the BH progenitor does overflow its Roche lobe. The formation rate for this channel is also higher in triples than in isolated binaries because early EKL oscillations cause inner binaries with a wider range of initial separations to enter and survive a common envelope. Our calculations demonstrate that at least some stellar BHs form with extremely weak kicks, and that triple evolution is a significant formation channel for BH-LMXBs.</description>

      <title>Can tensor-scalar induced GWs dominate PTA observations ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observational constraints on small-scale primordial gravitational waves are considerably weaker than those on large scales. We focus on scenarios with significant primordial gravitational waves and curvature perturbations on small scales, studying the energy density spectrum of the second-order TSIGW. By leveraging current data from CMB, BAO, and PTA, combined with the SNR analysis of LISA, we can investigate how tensor-scalar induced gravitational waves affect observations on various scales, thus constraining the parameter space for primordial gravitational waves and curvature perturbations. The Bayes factor analysis suggests that TSIGW+PGW might be more likely to dominate current PTA observations compared to SMBHB.</description>

      <title>The Impact of $^{12}$C($\alpha, \gamma$)$^{16}$O Reaction on the Presupernova Evolution and Supernova Explodability of Massive Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11012v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Among the uncertainties of stellar evolution theory, we investigate how the $^{12}$C($\alpha, \gamma$)$^{16}$O reaction rate affects the evolution of massive stars for the initial masses of $M ({\rm ZAMS})=$ 13 - 40 M$_\odot$ and the solar metallicity. We show that the {\sl explodability} of these stars, i.e., which of a neutron star (NS) or a black hole (BH) is formed, is sensitive to the strength of convective shell burning of C and O, and thus the mass fractions of C ($X$(C)) and O in the shell. For the small $^{12}$C($\alpha, \gamma$)$^{16}$O reaction rate that yields larger $X$(C), $X$(C) is further enhanced by mixing of C from the overlying layer and then C shell burning is strengthened. The extra heating by C shell burning tends to prevent the contraction of outer layers and decrease the {\sl compactness parameter} at $M_r$ = 2.5 M$_\odot$. This effect leads to the formation of smaller mass cores of Si and Fe and steeper density and pressure gradients at the O burning shell in the presupernova models. If the pressure gradient there is steeper, the model is more likely to explode to form a NS rather than a BH. We describe the pressure gradient against $M_r$ with $V/U$ and the density drop with $1/U$, where $U$ and $V$ are non-dimensional variables to describe the stellar structure. We estimate the critical values of $V/U$ and $1/U$ at the O-burning shell above which the model is more likely to explode. We conclude that the smaller $^{12}$C($\alpha, \gamma$)$^{16}$O reaction rate makes the mass range of $M ({\rm ZAMS})$ that forms a NS larger.</description>
