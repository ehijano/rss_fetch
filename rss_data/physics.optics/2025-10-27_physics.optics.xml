      <title>Exact formulation of Huygens' principle in terms of generalized spatiotemporal-dipole secondary sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A "spatiotemporal dipole" wave source, as defined by D.A.B. Miller (1991), differs from an ordinary ("spatial") dipole source in that the inverted monopole is delayed relative to the uninverted monopole, the delay being equal to the propagation time from one monopole to the other. A "generalized" spatiotemporal dipole (GSTD), as defined here, is generalized in two ways: first, the delay may be smaller in absolute value (but not larger) than the propagation time, so that the radiated waves cancel at a certain angle from the axis of the dipole; second, one monopole may be attenuated relative to the other, so that the cancellation is exact at a finite distance - on a circle coaxial with the dipole.
  I show that the Kirchhoff integral theorem, for a single monopole primary source, gives the same wave function as a certain distribution of GSTD secondary sources on the surface of integration. In the GSTDs, the "generalized" delay allows the surface of integration to be general (not necessarily a primary wavefront), whereas the attenuation allows an exact match of the wave function even in the near field of the primary source. At each point on the surface of integration, the circle of cancellation of the GSTD secondary source passes through the primary source, which therefore receives no backward secondary waves, while the direction of specular reflection of the primary wave passes through the same circle, giving a geometrical-optical explanation of the suppression of backward secondary waves at any field point.</description>

      <title>Opto-Electronic Clock Regeneration -- A Tutorial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A tutorial on opto-electronic clock regeneration at very high bit rates beyond reach with purely electronic solutions is given. Emphasis is placed on sum frequency generation in a nonlinear material such as LiNbO3. We first provide a basic introduction to CR (clock recovery) and a PLL (phase-locked loop); two examples are considered, an input signal frequency step and a slow input signal frequency. Next we discuss opto-electronic clock recovery based on an OPLL (opto-electronic PLL). The OPLL contains a phase comparator consisting of a planar LiNbO3 waveguide, a lowpass filter, a VCO (voltage controlled oscillator) and a local oscillator laser. The error signal from the comparator determined by the difference in electrical phase between the signal and the VCO controls the VCO. The VCO has two outputs; one that modulates the local oscillator laser and another that triggers a decision circuit that samples the output from the OPLL. The VCO is continuously adjusted by the OPLL so that it will ensure sampling of the signal in the optimal moments.</description>

      <title>Electrical-control of third-order nonlinearity via Fano interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Programmable photonic computers necessitate the integration of electrically-tunable compact components into the photonic devices. In the state-of-the-art photonic quantum computers~(PQCs), phase-shift and displacement gates can be implemented in an electrically-programmable way. An efficient PQC, however, necessitates also the tuning of third or higher order nonlinearity for implementing continuous-variable~(CV) gates at a shorter sequence. Here, we demonstrate that such an optical component can be designed using Fano interference and Stark effect in a nonlinear nano-plasmonic system. We study the coupling of a broadband bright plasmon mode to a narrow linewidth quantum object(s), QO(s). We show that by shifting the level-spacing of the QO via Stark effect, one can continuously tune the third-order nonlinearity gate within a picosecond response time. We also present finite-difference time domain~(FDTD) simulations that take the retardation effects into account. In addition, we also show that enhancement due to Fano interference degrades if the QOs are positioned randomly as each QO introduces different phases. This reveals the importance of the spatial extent of the QO-ensemble to be employed in the experiments.</description>

      <title>Pty-Chi: A PyTorch-based modern ptychographic data analysis package</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ptychography has become an indispensable tool for high-resolution, non-destructive imaging using coherent light sources. The processing of ptychographic data critically depends on robust, efficient, and flexible computational reconstruction software. We introduce Pty-Chi, an open-source ptychographic reconstruction package built on PyTorch that unifies state-of-the-art analytical algorithms with automatic differentiation methods. Pty-Chi provides a comprehensive suite of reconstruction algorithms while supporting advanced experimental parameter corrections such as orthogonal probe relaxation and multislice modeling. Leveraging PyTorch as the computational backend ensures vendor-agnostic GPU acceleration, multi-device parallelization, and seamless access to modern optimizers. An object-oriented, modular design makes Pty-Chi highly extendable, enabling researchers to prototype new imaging models, integrate machine learning approaches, or build entirely new workflows on top of its core components. We demonstrate Pty-Chi's capabilities through challenging case studies that involve limited coherence, low overlap, and unstable illumination during scanning, which highlight its accuracy, versatility, and extensibility. With community-driven development and open contribution, Pty-Chi offers a modern, maintainable platform for advancing computational ptychography and for enabling innovative imaging algorithms at synchrotron facilities and beyond.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of femtosecond photon echo signals from an inhomogeneously broadened InAs quantum dot ensemble using chirped pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photon echo (PE) techniques offer a promising approach to optical quantum memory, yet their implementation in conventional platforms, such as rare-earth-ion-doped crystals, is hindered by limited bandwidths. Semiconductor quantum dot (QD) ensembles, featuring THz-scale inhomogeneous broadening and sub-picosecond dynamics, provide an attractive alternative for ultrafast applications. However, achieving coherent control across such broad spectral ranges remains challenging due to detuning and spatial field inhomogeneities, which reduce PE efficiency. In this work, we experimentally demonstrated adiabatic rapid passage (ARP)-enhanced PE in dense, self-assembled InAs QD ensembles exhibiting THz-scale inhomogeneous broadening and operating at telecom wavelengths, achieving a 3.2-fold increase in echo efficiency. Chirped control pulses designed to satisfy adiabatic conditions across the ensemble enable broadband rephasing. Numerical simulations based on a two-level model reproduce the key experimental observations, including the ARP-induced enhancement, thereby validating the underlying physical picture. These results establish ARP as a robust and scalable approach for coherent control in InAs QD ensembles, with potential applications for ultrafast and broadband optical communication in the THz spectral region.</description>

      <title>Centi-combs: Low-noise sub-GHz repetition-rate soliton frequency combs from crystalline resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate low-noise Kerr soliton frequency combs with repetition rates below 1~GHz in ultrahigh-Q crystalline magnesium fluoride resonators. Single soliton states with repetition rates of 0.90 GHz, 1.19 GHz, 1.59 GHz, 2.48 GHz, and 4.10 GHz are observed with continuous-wave laser excitation. The near-GHz soliton repetition frequency exhibits a single-sideband phase noise of -137 dBc/Hz at a 100 kHz offset, surpassing state-of-the-art microwave generators. These ``centi-combs'' bridge the gap between conventional mode-locked lasers and microresonator frequency combs, providing a new route towards real-time sampling, optical-to-microwave synchronization, and hybrid optical clock networks in a compact form. This work expands the operational range of Kerr soliton microcombs from the terahertz to the sub-gigahertz domain, opening new frontiers for frequency comb technologies.</description>

      <title>Turbulence Induced Photon Statistics with Classical Beam propagation in Free Space Optical Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the influence of optical turbulence on field statistics using a nonlinear reconstruction and quantum phase-space formalism. Turbulence-distorted intensity sequences were processed through a nonlinear P3-type partial differential equation to retrieve the embedded phase, thereby reconstructing the complete complex optical field. The recovered fields were subsequently projected onto a Gaussian local oscillator to generate quadrature ensembles, enabling Wigner function tomography via Radon inversion. Photon-number distributions were obtained from the overlap of the reconstructed Wigner functions with Fock-state kernels, allowing direct evaluation of statistical moments and the Fano factor. Comparative analysis across four experimental configurations, Set 1: uncorrected turbulence, Set 2: turbulence with a single PMMA slab, Set 3: turbulence with dual PMMA slabs, and Set 4: free-space reference revealed the modification of phase noise and photon statistics due to partial compensation. Notably, the evolution of the Fano factor traced the transition among Poissonian, super-Poissonian, and near-sub-Poissonian regimes, quantitatively capturing the degree of turbulence mitigation achieved by the PMMA elements. This framework establishes a quantitative link between turbulence-induced phase distortions and quantum statistical behavior of reconstructed optical fields.</description>

      <title>Optical Spin Effects Induced by Phase Conjugation at a Space-Time Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electromagnetic temporal boundaries, emerging when the constitutive parameters of a medium undergo abrupt temporal variations, have garnered significant interest for their role in facilitating unconventional wave phenomena and enabling sophisticated field manipulations. A key manifestation is temporal reflection in an unbounded spatial domain, where a sudden temporal discontinuity induces phase-conjugated backward waves alongside anomalous spin conversion. This study explores distinctive spin-conversion dynamics at a time-dependent spatial interface governed by Lorentz-type dispersion, in which the plasma frequency undergoes rapid modulation over time. The interaction of a circularly polarized wave with a space-time interface excites electromagnetic signals at the system's natural resonance, allowing precise control over polarization states. The scattered field stems from the combined influence of temporal and spatial boundaries, yielding a superposition of the original incident wave's polarization and its phase-conjugated counterpart.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulation of light structures in bulk ENZ media with Kerr nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A simplified mathematical model is suggested to describe the dynamics of a quasi-monochromatic optical wave in the bulk of an effectively isotropic metamaterial with averaged dielectrical permittivity near zero (ENZ medium), in the presence of a weak spatial nonuniformity, Kerr nonlinearity as well as linear gain due to external pumping. The model is a vector Ginzburg-Landau equation of the general kind, with the dominating curl-curl term in the dispersive operator, and it resembles the equation for electromagnetic waves in plasma [E. A. Kuznetsov, 1974]. In the case of purely real Kerr coefficients, a split-step Fourier method is appropriate for numerical simulations. It makes possible to observe various variants of nontrivial evolution of both central-symmetric and toroidal vector wave structures trapped by a quadratic potential well, as well as nonlinear interaction between the longitudinal and transverse waves in the case of their combination.</description>

      <title>Exciton and biexciton preparation via coherent swing-up excitation in a GaAs quantum dot embedded in micropillar cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent control of quantum emitters is essential for scalable quantum photonic technologies. The recently proposed swing-up of quantum emitter (SUPER) scheme enables the coherent preparation of excitons via off-resonant, red-detuned laser pulses, offering highly efficient single-photon generation. We present a systematic study of SUPER excitation applied to a single GaAs quantum dot in a low-Q micropillar cavity. After identifying optimal excitation conditions, we benchmark the SUPER scheme against above-band, p-shell, and two-photon biexciton excitation (TPE). Despite requiring higher excitation powers, SUPER achieves near-unity population inversion ($\sim$95 %) and high single-photon purity ($g^{(2)}=0.03$), comparable to TPE, while also yielding a shortened exciton decay time ($\sim$200 ps), indicative of direct, efficient exciton preparation. A polarization-resolved analysis reveals that, when both excitation and collection are aligned with the exciton dipole, SUPER results in a highly polarized single-photon emission exceeding resonant TPE saturation by a factor of 1.45. Under optimal excitation conditions, we also observe biexciton preparation via a distinct SUPER resonance, confirmed by unpolarized exciton emission, extended lifetime due to the biexciton-exciton cascade, and biexciton emission, constituting the first experimental demonstrations of biexciton preparation under SUPER. These findings are in good agreement with a proposed four-level theoretical model including the biexciton. We also report that, strikingly, a slight misalignment of laser polarization induces an additional SUPER resonance that selectively populates the orthogonal exciton state without altering the nominal excitation polarization. These findings establish the SUPER scheme as a versatile tool for state-selective exciton and biexciton control, with strong potential for quantum photonic applications.</description>

      <title>Chip-scale modulation-free laser stabilization using vacuum-gap micro-Fabry-P\'erot cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Narrow-linewidth lasers are vital for a broad range of scientific and technological applications, including atomic clocks and precision sensing. Achieving high frequency stability is often as critical as ensuring scalability, portability, and cost-effectiveness in the development of low noise laser systems. Conventional electro-optic stabilization techniques, such as Pound-Drever-Hall locking to ultra-high-finesse resonators held in a vacuum chamber, provide excellent performance but remain challenging to scale. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a cavity-coupled interferometric laser stabilization technique implemented on a silicon photonic chip and integrated with a compact, scalable micro-Fabry-P\'erot cavity. The vacuum-gap optical cavity operates in air, achieving a quality factor of approximately $2.0\times 10^9$ and a fractional frequency instability of $1.45\times 10^{-12}$ at one-second averaging time. Integration of the proposed technique with the compact cavity yields more than 38-fold reduction in the laser's integrated linewidth and nearly three orders of magnitude suppression of frequency noise at 10 Hz offset frequency. The hybrid-integration of the proposed photonic chip with the micro-Fabry-P\'erot cavity establishes a scalable and portable route toward chip-integrated ultra-stable lasers, paving the way for precision optical systems deployable beyond laboratory environments.</description>

      <title>Wide-field stroboscopic imaging of topologically protected phononic modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imaging spatial mode profiles is important for understanding the behavior of mechanical resonators. The recent development of phononic circuits has increased the demand for a fast imaging method based on principles of coherent detection. However, it becomes complicated to perform measurements on a large surface area. Here, we present a frequency-detuned collimated-beam interferometry measurement scheme with in-plane spatial resolution of about 6 um, which can provide information about the phase dynamics of the entire mechanical oscillation cycle on a time scale of a few seconds. We employ a stroboscopic pulse probing method to resolve high-frequency vibrational motion with a standard CMOS camera. We use this setup to image megahertz frequency resonant mode profiles present in a Valley-Hall topological triangular cavity, over an area of more than 20 mm2. We relate the obtained data to numerical simulations of the topological edge modes to reveal the relation between backscattering and the mode profile distribution. The presented protocol can become a staple for characterizing mesoscopic mechanical resonators.</description>

      <title>Picosecond Wireless Synchronization with Entangled Photons via Grid-Based Quantum Coverage in Indoor Optical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel entanglement-assisted synchronization framework for indoor optical wireless systems based on grid-based beam steering. A central transmitter equipped with a spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) source emits time-energy entangled photon pairs, directing user photons toward spatially defined grids based on estimated user positions, while retaining reference photons for timestamping. The room is partitioned into multiple beam-aligned regions, and photon reception probability is analytically modeled using local coordinate transformations and Gaussian beam optics. To address the inherent sparsity and randomness of photon detection, we develop a robust two-stage synchronization algorithm that performs sparse bit-pattern matching and timestamp averaging to estimate timing offsets. Monte Carlo simulations are then performed to evaluate the impact of synchronization duration, grid resolution, and photon-pair generation rate on synchronization accuracy. Results show that finer grid configurations and optimal photon-pair rates significantly reduce synchronization error, achieving sub-10 ps timing accuracy within 1 ms of synchronization time. The proposed approach enables scalable, high-precision quantum synchronization in wireless indoor environments, laying the groundwork for future joint quantum communication, sensing, and positioning systems.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic decoupling in the deep-strong coupling regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the deep-strong coupling (DSC) regime, the interaction between light and matter exceeds their bare frequencies, leading to an effective decoupling. Theoretical and experimental evidence for this behavior has relied solely on measurements of local observables at equilibrium. However, such a local approach is insufficient to accurately describe energy fluxes in critical and nonequilibrium phenomena. Here, we use a two-terminal quantum junction to derive a thermodynamically consistent global master equation. We demonstrate that the associated heat current, a key nonlocal observable in any quantum thermal machine, also approaches zero in this extreme coupling scenario, underscoring the role of virtual photons in the vacuum ground state. Our results indicate that the decoupling is a more general feature of the DSC regime, with implications for quantum thermotronics.</description>

      <title>The geometry and dynamics of annealed optimization in the coherent Ising machine with hidden and planted solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21109v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The coherent Ising machine (CIM) is a nonconventional hardware architecture for finding approximate solutions to large-scale combinatorial optimization problems. It operates by annealing a laser gain parameter to adiabatically deform a high-dimensional energy landscape over a set of soft spins, going from a simple convex landscape to the more complex optimization landscape of interest. We address how the evolving energy landscapes guides the optimization dynamics against problems with hidden planted solutions. We study the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin-glass with ferromagnetic couplings that favor a hidden configuration by combining the replica method, random matrix theory, the Kac-Rice method and dynamical mean field theory. We characterize energy, number, location, and Hessian eigenspectra of global minima, local minima, and critical points as the landscape evolves. We find that low energy global minima develop soft-modes which the optimization dynamics can exploit to descend the energy landscape. Even when these global minima are aligned to the hidden configuration, there can be exponentially many higher energy local minima that are all unaligned with the hidden solution. Nevertheless, the annealed optimization dynamics can evade this cloud of unaligned high energy local minima and descend near to aligned lower energy global minima. Eventually, as the landscape is further annealed, these global minima become rigid, terminating any further optimization gains from annealing. We further consider a second optimization problem, the Wishart planted ensemble, which contains a hidden planted solution in a landscape with tunable ruggedness. We describe CIM phase transitions between recoverability and non-recoverability of the hidden solution. Overall, we find intriguing relations between high-dimensional geometry and dynamics in analog machines for combinatorial optimization.</description>

      <title>Light scattering by random convex polyhedron in geometric optics approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on the convex hull construction algorithm, a new geometrical model of ice crystals is proposed to investigate the scattering properties of cirrus clouds particles. Light scattering matrices involving complete polarization information are calculated in geometric optics approximation for randomly oriented large crystals with random and given convex polyhedron shape. The proposed model construction method and computational scheme of light scattering matrix works for any convex polyhedron within the scope of geometrical optics. To illustrate the broad applicability of the proposed ice crystal model, scattering matrices for three ice crystal examples with different geometrical shapes are calculated under a unified computational framework. Diffraction and absorption are not considered in this work. The calculated results for the classical hexagonal column model show overall agreement with those reported by other authors. The crystal model and scattering matrix computational framework developed in this study are applicable to radiative transfer simulations and remote sensing data interpretation in terrestrial and planetary atmospheres.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.21260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) has emerged as a powerful tool for visualizing and analyzing cancer tissue samples, including patient-derived specimens, organoids, biopsies, and murine models. In this work, we highlight the current applications of deep tissue LSFM in oncology and illustrate its use across a variety of human cancer tissues, including - but not limited to - prostate and breast. Here, we discuss that the potential integration of advanced LSFM technologies into clinical workflows to enable high-throughput, three-dimensional imaging of intact cancer specimens. This approach holds significant potential to enhance diagnostic precision and provide novel insights into tumour architecture and morphology.</description>

      <title>Bayesian approach for spatial super-resolution of heterodyne wind lidars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21288v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wind speed measurements using heterodyne lidars are limited in spatial resolution because of the current signal processing methods. This limit is equal to c $\tau$ ( c is the speed of light and $\tau$ is the laser pulse duration) corresponding to the length of the atmosphere contributing to the wind speed measurement at one distance. To go beyond this limit, we use an inverse problem approach based on a model of the spectrogram (concatenation of periodograms of each range) and prior distributions on our unknowns: backscattering amplitude and wind speed at each range. We apply our inversion method to simulated and experimental spectrograms, demonstrating a gain in resolution by a factor of 2 to 2.5 depending on the signal-to-noise ratio.</description>

      <title>Universal Thickness-Dependent Absorption in Solids at the Nanoscale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Through systematic experimental and theoretical studies of layer-thickness-dependent absorption in semiconducting MoSe$_2$ and WS$_2$ across the visible to near-infrared spectral range, we demonstrate a universal absorption behavior in solids at nanoscale thicknesses. With increasing thickness, a non-monotonic evolution of absorption integrated over the measured spectral region is revealed which is accompanied by pronounced oscillatory features. This strongly deviates from the expected Beer-Lambert law. The observed behavior has origins in the electromagnetic interference effects taking place between the two surfaces of the thin crystals. The present work on 2D semiconductors is extendable to all kinds of solids such as conventional semiconductors (e.g. Si, GaAs, GaN, InP), (semi)metals (e.g. Al, Ag, Au, c-HOPG) and 2D magnetic materials (e.g. CrSBr and NiPS$_3$). Our results provide fundamental insights into light-matter interactions in solids at the nanoscale and are vital for optimally designing the new generation of absorption-based flexible optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>3D micro-printing: An enabling technique for arbitrary potential landscapes for photonic quantum-gases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.21444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photonic quantum gases explore the physics of open driven-dissipative quantum systems under ambient conditions and thus open access to thermodynamics and transport phenomena in quantum gases in the weakly interacting regime. Here we introduce the technology of 3D micro-printing to create potential landscapes for photonic quantum gases in dye-filled micro cavities, which surpass the current state of the art in terms of potential size and definition, potential depth, coupling strength, and number of coupled potentials by at least an order of magnitude. We realize as demonstration of the capabilities box potentials with rectangular side walls, anisotropic harmonic potentials, double-well potentials with dimensions on the scale of the wavelength of light as well as potential lattices with topological non-trivial properties. This approach paves the way for experimentally studying the physics of open quantum systems on lattices and might find applications in solving complex ground-state problems like the XY-model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19575v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coherence time of thermal photons in rubidium vapor cells with varying thicknesses, reveal that there is clear dependence of the photon correlation time on cell thickness. Standard theoretical models accurately predict the coherence time in centimeter-scale cells. In this study we demonstrated, that these models break down in micrometer and sub-micrometer regimes. Cell sizes ranging from mm-scale down to 200 nm did not adhere to prediction based on the standard models. In order to address this shortcoming, we develop an alternative approach better suited for estimating photonic coherence times in ultra-thin vapor cells. This work, highlights the need for a modified theoretical treatment of the coherence time in the nanoscale regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a general theory of radiative heat exchange between dipoles with time-modulated optical properties. This framework extends fluctuational electrodynamics beyond equilibrium by incorporating nonstationary correlations and memory effects induced by temporal modulation. Closed-form expressions for the heat currents in modulated many-body systems are obtained, together with a generalized Landauer-like formulation of the pairwise exchanges, where the transmission coefficient accounts for all inelastic frequency-conversion channels. Near-resonant modulation redistributes and amplifies thermal fluctuations across Floquet sidebands, acting as a parametric amplifier of thermal radiation and enabling active, frequency-selective control of nanoscale heat transfer.</description>

      <title>Apollo: Automated Routing-Informed Placement for Large-Scale Photonic Integrated Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18813v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As technology advances, photonic integrated circuits (PICs) are rapidly scaling in size and complexity, with modern designs integrating thousands of components. However, the analog custom layout nature of photonics, the curvy waveguide structures, and single-layer routing resources impose stringent physical constraints, such as minimum bend radii and waveguide crossing penalties, which make manual layout the de facto standard. This manual process takes weeks to complete and is error-prone, which is fundamentally unscalable for large-scale PIC systems. Existing automation solutions have adopted force-directed placement on small benchmarks with tens of components, with limited routability and scalability. To fill this fundamental gap in the electronic-photonic design automation (EPDA) toolchain, we present the first GPU-accelerated, routing-informed placement framework. It features an asymmetric bending-aware wirelength function with explicit modeling of waveguide routing congestion and crossings for routability maximization. Meanwhile, conditional projection is employed to gradually enforce a variety of user-defined layout constraints, including alignment, spacing, etc. This constrained optimization is accelerated and stabilized by a custom blockwise adaptive Nesterov-accelerated optimizer, ensuring stable and high-quality convergence. Compared to existing methods, our method can generate high-quality layouts for large-scale PICs with an average routing success rate of 94.79% across all benchmarks within minutes. By tightly coupling placement with physical-aware routing, our method establishes a new paradigm for automated PIC design, bringing intelligent, scalable layout synthesis to the forefront of next-generation EPDA. Our code is open-sourced at https://github.com/ScopeX-ASU/Apollo.</description>

      <title>LiDAR 2.0: Hierarchical Curvy Waveguide Detailed Routing for Large-Scale Photonic Integrated Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17239v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Driven by innovations in photonic computing and interconnects, photonic integrated circuit (PIC) designs advance and grow in complexity. Traditional manual physical design processes have become increasingly cumbersome. Available PIC layout tools are mostly schematic-driven, which has not alleviated the burden of manual waveguide planning and layout drawing. Previous research in PIC automated routing is largely adapted from electronic design, focusing on high-level planning and overlooking photonic-specific constraints such as curvy waveguides, bending, and port alignment. As a result, they fail to scale and cannot generate DRV-free layouts, highlighting the need for dedicated electronic-photonic design automation tools to streamline PIC physical design. In this work, we present LiDAR, the first automated PIC detailed router for large-scale designs. It features a grid-based, curvy-aware A* engine with adaptive crossing insertion, congestion-aware net ordering, and insertion-loss optimization. To enable routing in more compact and complex designs, we further extend our router to hierarchical routing as LiDAR 2.0. It introduces redundant-bend elimination, crossing space preservation, and routing order refinement for improved conflict resilience. We also develop and open-source a YAML-based PIC intermediate representation and diverse benchmarks, including TeMPO, GWOR, and Bennes, which feature hierarchical structures and high crossing densities. Evaluations across various benchmarks show that LiDAR 2.0 consistently produces DRV-free layouts, achieving up to 16% lower insertion loss and 7.69x speedup over prior methods on spacious cases, and 9% lower insertion loss with 6.95x speedup over LiDAR 1.0 on compact cases. Our codes are open-sourced at https://github.com/ScopeX-ASU/LiDAR.</description>
