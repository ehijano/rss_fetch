      <title>Deep Oscillatory Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel, brain-inspired deep neural network model known as the Deep Oscillatory Neural Network (DONN). Deep neural networks like the Recurrent Neural Networks indeed possess sequence processing capabilities but the internal states of the network are not designed to exhibit brain-like oscillatory activity. With this motivation, the DONN is designed to have oscillatory internal dynamics. Neurons of the DONN are either nonlinear neural oscillators or traditional neurons with sigmoidal or ReLU activation. The neural oscillator used in the model is the Hopf oscillator, with the dynamics described in the complex domain. Input can be presented to the neural oscillator in three possible modes. The sigmoid and ReLU neurons also use complex-valued extensions. All the weight stages are also complex-valued. Training follows the general principle of weight change by minimizing the output error and therefore has an overall resemblance to complex backpropagation. A generalization of DONN to convolutional networks known as the Oscillatory Convolutional Neural Network is also proposed. The two proposed oscillatory networks are applied to a variety of benchmark problems in signal and image/video processing. The performance of the proposed models is either comparable or superior to published results on the same data sets.</description>

      <title>GLHF: General Learned Evolutionary Algorithm Via Hyper Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pretrained Optimization Models (POMs) leverage knowledge gained from optimizing various tasks, providing efficient solutions for new optimization challenges through direct usage or fine-tuning. Despite the inefficiencies and limited generalization abilities observed in current POMs, our proposed model, the general pre-trained optimization model (GPOM), addresses these shortcomings. GPOM constructs a population-based pretrained Black-Box Optimization (BBO) model tailored for continuous optimization. Evaluation on the BBOB benchmark and two robot control tasks demonstrates that GPOM outperforms other pretrained BBO models significantly, especially for high-dimensional tasks. Its direct optimization performance exceeds that of state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms and POMs. Furthermore, GPOM exhibits robust generalization capabilities across diverse task distributions, dimensions, population sizes, and optimization horizons.</description>

      <title>Self-Replicating and Self-Employed Smart Contract on Ethereum Blockchain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blockchain is the underlying technology for cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. Blockchain is a robust distributed ledger that uses consensus algorithms to approve transactions in a decentralized manner, making malicious tampering extremely difficult. Ethereum, one of the blockchains, can be seen as an unstoppable computer which shared by users around the world that can run Turing-complete programs. In order to run any program on Ethereum, Ether (currency on Ethereum) is required. In other words, Ether can be seen as a kind of energy in the Ethereum world. We developed self-replicating and self-employed agents who earn the energy by themselves to replicate them, on the Ethereum blockchain. The agents can issued their token and gain Ether each time the tokens are sold. When a certain amount of Ether is accumulated, the agent replicates itself and leaves offspring. The goal of this project is to implement artificial agents that lives for itself, not as a tool for humans, in the open cyber space connected to the real world.</description>

      <title>Direct Training High-Performance Deep Spiking Neural Networks: A Review of Theories and Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer a promising energy-efficient alternative to artificial neural networks (ANNs), in virtue of their high biological plausibility, rich spatial-temporal dynamics, and event-driven computation. The direct training algorithms based on the surrogate gradient method provide sufficient flexibility to design novel SNN architectures and explore the spatial-temporal dynamics of SNNs. According to previous studies, the performance of models is highly dependent on their sizes. Recently, direct training deep SNNs have achieved great progress on both neuromorphic datasets and large-scale static datasets. Notably, transformer-based SNNs show comparable performance with their ANN counterparts. In this paper, we provide a new perspective to summarize the theories and methods for training deep SNNs with high performance in a systematic and comprehensive way, including theory fundamentals, spiking neuron models, advanced SNN models and residual architectures, software frameworks and neuromorphic hardware, applications, and future trends. The reviewed papers are collected at https://github.com/zhouchenlin2096/Awesome-Spiking-Neural-Networks</description>

      <title>Quality with Just Enough Diversity in Evolutionary Policy Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evolution Strategies (ES) are effective gradient-free optimization methods that can be competitive with gradient-based approaches for policy search. ES only rely on the total episodic scores of solutions in their population, from which they estimate fitness gradients for their update with no access to true gradient information. However this makes them sensitive to deceptive fitness landscapes, and they tend to only explore one way to solve a problem. Quality-Diversity methods such as MAP-Elites introduced additional information with behavior descriptors (BD) to return a population of diverse solutions, which helps exploration but leads to a large part of the evaluation budget not being focused on finding the best performing solution. Here we show that behavior information can also be leveraged to find the best policy by identifying promising search areas which can then be efficiently explored with ES. We introduce the framework of Quality with Just Enough Diversity (JEDi) which learns the relationship between behavior and fitness to focus evaluations on solutions that matter. When trying to reach higher fitness values, JEDi outperforms both QD and ES methods on hard exploration tasks like mazes and on complex control problems with large policies.</description>

      <title>Genetic Drift Regularization: on preventing Actor Injection from breaking Evolution Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evolutionary Algorithms (EA) have been successfully used for the optimization of neural networks for policy search, but they still remain sample inefficient and underperforming in some cases compared to gradient-based reinforcement learning (RL). Various methods combine the two approaches, many of them training a RL algorithm on data from EA evaluations and injecting the RL actor into the EA population. However, when using Evolution Strategies (ES) as the EA, the RL actor can drift genetically far from the the ES distribution and injection can cause a collapse of the ES performance. Here, we highlight the phenomenon of genetic drift where the actor genome and the ES population distribution progressively drift apart, leading to injection having a negative impact on the ES. We introduce Genetic Drift Regularization (GDR), a simple regularization method in the actor training loss that prevents the actor genome from drifting away from the ES. We show that GDR can improve ES convergence on problems where RL learns well, but also helps RL training on other tasks, , fixes the injection issues better than previous controlled injection methods.</description>

      <title>Concentration Tail-Bound Analysis of Coevolutionary and Bandit Learning Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Runtime analysis, as a branch of the theory of AI, studies how the number of iterations algorithms take before finding a solution (its runtime) depends on the design of the algorithm and the problem structure. Drift analysis is a state-of-the-art tool for estimating the runtime of randomised algorithms, such as evolutionary and bandit algorithms. Drift refers roughly to the expected progress towards the optimum per iteration. This paper considers the problem of deriving concentration tail-bounds on the runtime/regret of algorithms. It provides a novel drift theorem that gives precise exponential tail-bounds given positive, weak, zero and even negative drift. Previously, such exponential tail bounds were missing in the case of weak, zero, or negative drift. Our drift theorem can be used to prove a strong concentration of the runtime/regret of algorithms in AI. For example, we prove that the regret of the \rwab bandit algorithm is highly concentrated, while previous analyses only considered the expected regret. This means that the algorithm obtains the optimum within a given time frame with high probability, i.e. a form of algorithm reliability. Moreover, our theorem implies that the time needed by the co-evolutionary algorithm RLS-PD to obtain a Nash equilibrium in a \bilinear max-min-benchmark problem is highly concentrated. However, we also prove that the algorithm forgets the Nash equilibrium, and the time until this occurs is highly concentrated. This highlights a weakness in the RLS-PD which should be addressed by future work.</description>

Abstract: Forecasting, to estimate future events, is crucial for business and decision-making. This paper proposes QxEAI, a methodology that produces a probabilistic forecast that utilizes a quantum-like evolutionary algorithm based on training a quantum-like logic decision tree and a classical value tree on a small number of related time series. By using different cycles of the Dow Jones Index (yearly, monthly, weekly, daily), we demonstrate how our methodology produces accurate forecasts while requiring little to none manual work.</description>

      <title>Guidance Design for Escape Flight Vehicle Using Evolution Strategy Enhanced Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Guidance commands of flight vehicles are a series of data sets with fixed time intervals, thus guidance design constitutes a sequential decision problem and satisfies the basic conditions for using deep reinforcement learning (DRL). In this paper, we consider the scenario where the escape flight vehicle (EFV) generates guidance commands based on DRL and the pursuit flight vehicle (PFV) generates guidance commands based on the proportional navigation method. For the EFV, the objective of the guidance design entails progressively maximizing the residual velocity, subject to the constraint imposed by the given evasion distance. Thus an irregular dynamic max-min problem of extremely large-scale is formulated, where the time instant when the optimal solution can be attained is uncertain and the optimum solution depends on all the intermediate guidance commands generated before. For solving this problem, a two-step strategy is conceived. In the first step, we use the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm to generate the guidance commands of the EFV. The results obtained by PPO in the global search space are coarse, despite the fact that the reward function, the neural network parameters and the learning rate are designed elaborately. Therefore, in the second step, we propose to invoke the evolution strategy (ES) based algorithm, which uses the result of PPO as the initial value, to further improve the quality of the solution by searching in the local space. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed guidance design method based on the PPO algorithm is capable of achieving a residual velocity of 67.24 m/s, higher than the residual velocities achieved by the benchmark soft actor-critic and deep deterministic policy gradient algorithms. Furthermore, the proposed ES-enhanced PPO algorithm outperforms the PPO algorithm by 2.7\%, achieving a residual velocity of 69.04 m/s.</description>

      <title>Your Network May Need to Be Rewritten: Network Adversarial Based on High-Dimensional Function Graph Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the past, research on a single low dimensional activation function in networks has led to internal covariate shift and gradient deviation problems. A relatively small research area is how to use function combinations to provide property completion for a single activation function application. We propose a network adversarial method to address the aforementioned challenges. This is the first method to use different activation functions in a network. Based on the existing activation functions in the current network, an adversarial function with opposite derivative image properties is constructed, and the two are alternately used as activation functions for different network layers. For complex situations, we propose a method of high-dimensional function graph decomposition(HD-FGD), which divides it into different parts and then passes through a linear layer. After integrating the inverse of the partial derivatives of each decomposed term, we obtain its adversarial function by referring to the computational rules of the decomposition process. The use of network adversarial methods or the use of HD-FGD alone can effectively replace the traditional MLP+activation function mode. Through the above methods, we have achieved a substantial improvement over standard activation functions regarding both training efficiency and predictive accuracy. The article addresses the adversarial issues associated with several prevalent activation functions, presenting alternatives that can be seamlessly integrated into existing models without any adverse effects. We will release the code as open source after the conference review process is completed.</description>

      <title>Watermarking Neuromorphic Brains: Intellectual Property Protection in Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As spiking neural networks (SNNs) gain traction in deploying neuromorphic computing solutions, protecting their intellectual property (IP) has become crucial. Without adequate safeguards, proprietary SNN architectures are at risk of theft, replication, or misuse, which could lead to significant financial losses for the owners. While IP protection techniques have been extensively explored for artificial neural networks (ANNs), their applicability and effectiveness for the unique characteristics of SNNs remain largely unexplored. In this work, we pioneer an investigation into adapting two prominent watermarking approaches, namely, fingerprint-based and backdoor-based mechanisms to secure proprietary SNN architectures. We conduct thorough experiments to evaluate the impact on fidelity, resilience against overwrite threats, and resistance to compression attacks when applying these watermarking techniques to SNNs, drawing comparisons with their ANN counterparts. This study lays the groundwork for developing neuromorphic-aware IP protection strategies tailored to the distinctive dynamics of SNNs.</description>

      <title>A Significantly Better Class of Activation Functions Than ReLU Like Activation Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a significantly better class of activation functions than the almost universally used ReLU like and Sigmoidal class of activation functions. Two new activation functions referred to as the Cone and Parabolic-Cone that differ drastically from popular activation functions and significantly outperform these on the CIFAR-10 and Imagenette benchmmarks are proposed. The cone activation functions are positive only on a finite interval and are strictly negative except at the end-points of the interval, where they become zero. Thus the set of inputs that produce a positive output for a neuron with cone activation functions is a hyperstrip and not a half-space as is the usual case. Since a hyper strip is the region between two parallel hyper-planes, it allows neurons to more finely divide the input feature space into positive and negative classes than with infinitely wide half-spaces. In particular the XOR function can be learn by a single neuron with cone-like activation functions. Both the cone and parabolic-cone activation functions are shown to achieve higher accuracies with significantly fewer neurons on benchmarks. The results presented in this paper indicate that many nonlinear real-world datasets may be separated with fewer hyperstrips than half-spaces. The Cone and Parabolic-Cone activation functions have larger derivatives than ReLU and are shown to significantly speedup training.</description>

Abstract: We explored the mathematical foundations of Recurrent Neural Networks ($\mathtt{RNN}$s) and three fundamental procedures: temporal rescaling, discretisation and linearisation. These techniques provide essential tools for characterizing $\mathtt{RNN}$s behaviour, enabling insights into temporal dynamics, practical computational implementation, and linear approximations for analysis. We discuss the flexible order of application of these procedures, emphasizing their significance in modelling and analyzing $\mathtt{RNN}$s for neuroscience and machine learning applications. We explicitly describe here under what conditions these procedures can be interchangeable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.07169v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical identification is often done with spatial or temporal visual pattern recognition and localization. Temporal pattern recognition, depending on the technology, involves a trade-off between communication frequency, range and accurate tracking. We propose a solution with light-emitting beacons that improves this trade-off by exploiting fast event-based cameras and, for tracking, sparse neuromorphic optical flow computed with spiking neurons. The system is embedded in a simulated drone and evaluated in an asset monitoring use case. It is robust to relative movements and enables simultaneous communication with, and tracking of, multiple moving beacons. Finally, in a hardware lab prototype, we demonstrate for the first time beacon tracking performed simultaneously with state-of-the-art frequency communication in the kHz range.</description>

      <title>From Pixels to Titles: Video Game Identification by Screenshots using Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15963v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates video game identification through single screenshots, utilizing five convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures (MobileNet, DenseNet, EfficientNetB0, EfficientNetB2, and EfficientNetB3) across 22 home console systems, spanning from Atari 2600 to PlayStation 5, totalling 8,796 games and 170,881 screenshots. Confirming the hypothesis, CNNs autonomously extract image features, enabling the identification of game titles from screenshots without additional features. Using ImageNet pre-trained weights as initial weights, EfficientNetB3 achieves the highest average accuracy (74.51%), while DenseNet169 excels in 14 of the 22 systems. Employing alternative initial weights trained in an arcade screenshots dataset boosts accuracy for EfficientNetB2 and EfficientNetB3, with the latter reaching a peak accuracy of 76.36% and demonstrating reduced convergence epochs from 23.7 to 20.5 on average. Overall, the combination of optimal architecture and weights attains 77.67% accuracy, primarily led by EfficientNetB3 in 19 systems. These findings underscore the efficacy of CNNs in video game identification through screenshots.</description>

Abstract: With the mainstream integration of machine learning into security-sensitive domains such as healthcare and finance, concerns about data privacy have intensified. Conventional artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been found vulnerable to several attacks that can leak sensitive data. Particularly, model inversion (MI) attacks enable the reconstruction of data samples that have been used to train the model. Neuromorphic architectures have emerged as a paradigm shift in neural computing, enabling asynchronous and energy-efficient computation. However, little to no existing work has investigated the privacy of neuromorphic architectures against model inversion. Our study is motivated by the intuition that the non-differentiable aspect of spiking neural networks (SNNs) might result in inherent privacy-preserving properties, especially against gradient-based attacks. To investigate this hypothesis, we propose a thorough exploration of SNNs' privacy-preserving capabilities. Specifically, we develop novel inversion attack strategies that are comprehensively designed to target SNNs, offering a comparative analysis with their conventional ANN counterparts. Our experiments, conducted on diverse event-based and static datasets, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed attack strategies and therefore questions the assumption of inherent privacy-preserving in neuromorphic architectures.</description>
