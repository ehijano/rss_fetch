      <title>$K(Z,2)$ out of circular permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is a small addition to the note arXiv:1908.04029v2 [math.GT]. We briefly discuss $SC$, a simplicial homotopy model of $K(Z,2)$ constructed from circular permutations. In any dimension, the number of simplices in the model is finite. The complex $SC$ naturally manifests as a simplicial set representing "minimally" triangulated circle bundles over simplicial bases. On the other hand, the homotopy $|SC| \approx B(U(1)) \approx K(Z,2)$ appears to be a canonical fact from the foundations of crossed simplicial groups theory.</description>

      <title>Node-Level Topological Representation Learning on Point Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological Data Analysis (TDA) allows us to extract powerful topological and higher-order information on the global shape of a data set or point cloud. Tools like Persistent Homology or the Euler Transform give a single complex description of the global structure of the point cloud. However, common machine learning applications like classification require point-level information and features to be available. In this paper, we bridge this gap and propose a novel method to extract node-level topological features from complex point clouds using discrete variants of concepts from algebraic topology and differential geometry. We verify the effectiveness of these topological point features (TOPF) on both synthetic and real-world data and study their robustness under noise.</description>

      <title>Random Abstract Cell Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define a model for random (abstract) cell complexes (CCs), similiar to the well-known Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi model for graphs and its extensions for simplicial complexes. To build a random cell complex, we first draw from an Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graph, and consecutively augment the graph with cells for each dimension with a specified probability. As the number of possible cells increases combinatorially -- e.g., 2-cells can be represented as cycles, or permutations -- we derive an approximate sampling algorithm for this model limited to two-dimensional abstract cell complexes. Since there is a large variance in the number of simple cycles on graphs drawn from the same configuration of ER, we also provide an efficient method to approximate that number, which is of independent interest. Moreover, it enables us to specify the expected number of 2-cells of each boundary length we want to sample. We provide some initial analysis into the properties of random CCs drawn from this model. We further showcase practical applications for our random CCs as null models, and in the context of (random) liftings of graphs to cell complexes. Both the sampling and cycle count estimation algorithms are available in the package `py-raccoon` on the Python Packaging Index.</description>

      <title>A new quantum computational set-up for algebraic topology via simplicial sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11304v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a quantum computational framework for algebraic topology based on simplicial set theory is presented. This extends previous work, which was limited to simplicial complexes and aimed mostly to topological data analysis. The proposed set--up applies to any parafinite simplicial set and proceeds by associating with it a finite dimensional simplicial Hilbert space, whose simplicial operator structure is studied in some depth. It is shown in particular how the problem of determining the simplicial set's homology can be solved within the simplicial Hilbert framework. Further, the conditions under which simplicial set theoretic algorithms can be implemented in a quantum computational setting with finite resources are examined. Finally a quantum algorithmic scheme capable to compute the simplicial homology spaces and Betti numbers of a simplicial set combining a number of basic quantum algorithms is outlined.</description>

      <title>A rank decomposition for the topological classification of neural representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19710v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural networks can be thought of as applying a transformation to an input dataset. The way in which they change the topology of such a dataset often holds practical significance for many tasks, particularly those demanding non-homeomorphic mappings for optimal solutions, such as classification problems. In this work, we leverage the fact that neural networks are equivalent to continuous piecewise-affine maps, whose rank can be used to pinpoint regions in the input space that undergo non-homeomorphic transformations, leading to alterations in the topological structure of the input dataset. Our approach enables us to make use of the relative homology sequence, with which one can study the homology groups of the quotient of a manifold $\mathcal{M}$ and a subset $A$, assuming some minimal properties on these spaces.
  As a proof of principle, we empirically investigate the presence of low-rank (topology-changing) affine maps as a function of network width and mean weight. We show that in randomly initialized narrow networks, there will be regions in which the (co)homology groups of a data manifold can change. As the width increases, the homology groups of the input manifold become more likely to be preserved. We end this part of our work by constructing highly non-random wide networks that do not have this property and relating this non-random regime to Dale's principle, which is a defining characteristic of biological neural networks.
  Finally, we study simple feedforward networks trained on MNIST, as well as on toy classification and regression tasks, and show that networks manipulate the topology of data differently depending on the continuity of the task they are trained on.</description>
