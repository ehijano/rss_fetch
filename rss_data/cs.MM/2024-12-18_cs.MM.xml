      <title>Multimodal Classification and Out-of-distribution Detection for Multimodal Intent Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal intent understanding is a significant research area that requires effectively leveraging multiple modalities to analyze human language. Existing methods face two main challenges in this domain. Firstly, they have limitations in capturing nuanced and high-level semantics underlying complex in-distribution (ID) multimodal intents. Secondly, they exhibit poor generalization when confronted with unseen out-of-distribution (OOD) data in real-world scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a novel method for both ID classification and OOD detection (MIntOOD). We first introduce a weighted feature fusion network that models multimodal representations effectively. This network dynamically learns the importance of each modality, adapting to multimodal contexts. To develop discriminative representations that are conducive to both tasks, we synthesize pseudo-OOD data from convex combinations of ID data and engage in multimodal representation learning from both coarse-grained and fine-grained perspectives. The coarse-grained perspective focuses on distinguishing between ID and OOD binary classes, while the fine-grained perspective enhances the understanding of ID data by incorporating binary confidence scores. These scores help to gauge the difficulty of each sample, improving the classification of different ID classes. Additionally, the fine-grained perspective captures instance-level interactions between ID and OOD samples, promoting proximity among similar instances and separation from dissimilar ones. We establish baselines for three multimodal intent datasets and build an OOD benchmark. Extensive experiments on these datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves OOD detection performance with a 3-10% increase in AUROC scores while achieving new state-of-the-art results in ID classification.

      <title>Flight Patterns for Swarms of Drones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present flight patterns for a collision-free passage of swarms of drones through one or more openings. The narrow openings provide drones with access to an infrastructure component such as charging stations to charge their depleted batteries and hangars for storage. The flight patterns are a staging area (queues) that match the rate at which an infrastructure component and its openings process drones. They prevent collisions and may implement different policies that control the order in which drones pass through an opening. We illustrate the flight patterns with a 3D display that uses drones configured with light sources to illuminate shapes.</description>

      <title>DLF: Disentangled-Language-Focused Multimodal Sentiment Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) leverages heterogeneous modalities, such as language, vision, and audio, to enhance the understanding of human sentiment. While existing models often focus on extracting shared information across modalities or directly fusing heterogeneous modalities, such approaches can introduce redundancy and conflicts due to equal treatment of all modalities and the mutual transfer of information between modality pairs. To address these issues, we propose a Disentangled-Language-Focused (DLF) multimodal representation learning framework, which incorporates a feature disentanglement module to separate modality-shared and modality-specific information. To further reduce redundancy and enhance language-targeted features, four geometric measures are introduced to refine the disentanglement process. A Language-Focused Attractor (LFA) is further developed to strengthen language representation by leveraging complementary modality-specific information through a language-guided cross-attention mechanism. The framework also employs hierarchical predictions to improve overall accuracy. Extensive experiments on two popular MSA datasets, CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI, demonstrate the significant performance gains achieved by the proposed DLF framework. Comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the feature disentanglement module, language-focused attractor, and hierarchical predictions. Our code is available at https://github.com/pwang322/DLF.</description>

      <title>Efficient Object-centric Representation Learning with Pre-trained Geometric Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses key challenges in object-centric representation learning of video. While existing approaches struggle with complex scenes, we propose a novel weakly-supervised framework that emphasises geometric understanding and leverages pre-trained vision models to enhance object discovery. Our method introduces an efficient slot decoder specifically designed for object-centric learning, enabling effective representation of multi-object scenes without requiring explicit depth information. Results on synthetic video benchmarks with increasing complexity in terms of objects and their movement, object occlusion and camera motion demonstrate that our approach achieves comparable performance to supervised methods while maintaining computational efficiency. This advances the field towards more practical applications in complex real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>ASAP: Advancing Semantic Alignment Promotes Multi-Modal Manipulation Detecting and Grounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present ASAP, a new framework for detecting and grounding multi-modal media manipulation (DGM4).Upon thorough examination, we observe that accurate fine-grained cross-modal semantic alignment between the image and text is vital for accurately manipulation detection and grounding. While existing DGM4 methods pay rare attention to the cross-modal alignment, hampering the accuracy of manipulation detecting to step further. To remedy this issue, this work targets to advance the semantic alignment learning to promote this task. Particularly, we utilize the off-the-shelf Multimodal Large-Language Models (MLLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to construct paired image-text pairs, especially for the manipulated instances. Subsequently, a cross-modal alignment learning is performed to enhance the semantic alignment. Besides the explicit auxiliary clues, we further design a Manipulation-Guided Cross Attention (MGCA) to provide implicit guidance for augmenting the manipulation perceiving. With the grounding truth available during training, MGCA encourages the model to concentrate more on manipulated components while downplaying normal ones, enhancing the model's ability to capture manipulations. Extensive experiments are conducted on the DGM4 dataset, the results demonstrate that our model can surpass the comparison method with a clear margin.</description>

      <title>Implicit Location-Caption Alignment via Complementary Masking for Weakly-Supervised Dense Video Captioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weakly-Supervised Dense Video Captioning (WSDVC) aims to localize and describe all events of interest in a video without requiring annotations of event boundaries. This setting poses a great challenge in accurately locating the temporal location of event, as the relevant supervision is unavailable. Existing methods rely on explicit alignment constraints between event locations and captions, which involve complex event proposal procedures during both training and inference. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel implicit location-caption alignment paradigm by complementary masking, which simplifies the complex event proposal and localization process while maintaining effectiveness. Specifically, our model comprises two components: a dual-mode video captioning module and a mask generation module. The dual-mode video captioning module captures global event information and generates descriptive captions, while the mask generation module generates differentiable positive and negative masks for localizing the events. These masks enable the implicit alignment of event locations and captions by ensuring that captions generated from positively and negatively masked videos are complementary, thereby forming a complete video description. In this way, even under weak supervision, the event location and event caption can be aligned implicitly. Extensive experiments on the public datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing weakly-supervised methods and achieves competitive results compared to fully-supervised methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Flying Light Speck, FLS, is a miniature sized drone configured with light sources to illuminate 3D multimedia objects in a fixed volume, an FLS display. A swarm of FLSs may provide haptic interactions by exerting force back at a user's touch. This paper presents a conceptual model for the multimedia data to enable content-based queries. The model empowers users of an FLS display to annotate the illuminations by adding semantics to the data, extending a multimedia repository with information and knowledge. We present a core conceptual model and demonstrate its extensions for two diverse applications, authoring tools with entertainment and MRI scans with healthcare.</description>

      <title>JEN-1 Composer: A Unified Framework for High-Fidelity Multi-Track Music Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19180v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With rapid advances in generative artificial intelligence, the text-to-music synthesis task has emerged as a promising direction for music generation. Nevertheless, achieving precise control over multi-track generation remains an open challenge. While existing models excel in directly generating multi-track mix, their limitations become evident when it comes to composing individual tracks and integrating them in a controllable manner. This departure from the typical workflows of professional composers hinders the ability to refine details in specific tracks. To address this gap, we propose JEN-1 Composer, a unified framework designed to efficiently model marginal, conditional, and joint distributions over multi-track music using a single model. Building upon an audio latent diffusion model, JEN-1 Composer extends the versatility of multi-track music generation. We introduce a progressive curriculum training strategy, which gradually escalates the difficulty of training tasks while ensuring the model's generalization ability and facilitating smooth transitions between different scenarios. During inference, users can iteratively generate and select music tracks, thus incrementally composing entire musical pieces in accordance with the Human-AI co-composition workflow. Our approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in controllable and high-fidelity multi-track music synthesis, marking a significant advancement in interactive AI-assisted music creation. Our demo pages are available at www.jenmusic.ai/research.</description>

      <title>MMTrail: A Multimodal Trailer Video Dataset with Language and Music Descriptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20962v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Massive multi-modality datasets play a significant role in facilitating the success of large video-language models. However, current video-language datasets primarily provide text descriptions for visual frames, considering audio to be weakly related information. They usually overlook exploring the potential of inherent audio-visual correlation, leading to monotonous annotation within each modality instead of comprehensive and precise descriptions. Such ignorance results in the difficulty of multiple cross-modality studies. To fulfill this gap, we present MMTrail, a large-scale multi-modality video-language dataset incorporating more than 20M trailer clips with visual captions, and 2M high-quality clips with multimodal captions. Trailers preview full-length video works and integrate context, visual frames, and background music. In particular, the trailer has two main advantages: (1) the topics are diverse, and the content characters are of various types, e.g., film, news, and gaming. (2) the corresponding background music is custom-designed, making it more coherent with the visual context. Upon these insights, we propose a systemic captioning framework, achieving various modality annotations with more than 27.1k hours of trailer videos. Here, to ensure the caption retains music perspective while preserving the authority of visual context, we leverage the advanced LLM to merge all annotations adaptively. In this fashion, our MMtrail dataset potentially paves the path for fine-grained large multimodal-language model training. In experiments, we provide evaluation metrics and benchmark results on our dataset, demonstrating the high quality of our annotation and its effectiveness for model training.</description>

      <title>Less is More: A Simple yet Effective Token Reduction Method for Efficient Multi-modal LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10994v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has led to remarkable performances across various domains. However, this progress is accompanied by a substantial surge in the resource consumption of these models. We address this pressing issue by introducing a new approach, Token Reduction using CLIP Metric (TRIM), aimed at improving the efficiency of MLLMs without sacrificing their performance. Inspired by human attention patterns in Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks, TRIM presents a fresh perspective on the selection and reduction of image tokens. The TRIM method has been extensively tested across 12 datasets, and the results demonstrate a significant reduction in computational overhead while maintaining a consistent level of performance. This research marks a critical stride in efficient MLLM development, promoting greater accessibility and sustainability of high-performing models.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Class-aware Semantic Enhancement Network for Audio-Visual Video Parsing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11248v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Audio-Visual Video Parsing task aims to recognize and temporally localize all events occurring in either the audio or visual stream, or both. Capturing accurate event semantics for each audio/visual segment is vital. Prior works directly utilize the extracted holistic audio and visual features for intra- and cross-modal temporal interactions. However, each segment may contain multiple events, resulting in semantically mixed holistic features that can lead to semantic interference during intra- or cross-modal interactions: the event semantics of one segment may incorporate semantics of unrelated events from other segments. To address this issue, our method begins with a Class-Aware Feature Decoupling (CAFD) module, which explicitly decouples the semantically mixed features into distinct class-wise features, including multiple event-specific features and a dedicated background feature. The decoupled class-wise features enable our model to selectively aggregate useful semantics for each segment from clearly matched classes contained in other segments, preventing semantic interference from irrelevant classes. Specifically, we further design a Fine-Grained Semantic Enhancement module for encoding intra- and cross-modal relations. It comprises a Segment-wise Event Co-occurrence Modeling (SECM) block and a Local-Global Semantic Fusion (LGSF) block. The SECM exploits inter-class dependencies of concurrent events within the same timestamp with the aid of a new event co-occurrence loss. The LGSF further enhances the event semantics of each segment by incorporating relevant semantics from more informative global video features. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed modules and loss functions, resulting in a new state-of-the-art parsing performance.</description>

      <title>Multi-modal and Multi-scale Spatial Environment Understanding for Immersive Visual Text-to-Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11409v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Visual Text-to-Speech (VTTS) aims to take the environmental image as the prompt to synthesize the reverberant speech for the spoken content. The challenge of this task lies in understanding the spatial environment from the image. Many attempts have been made to extract global spatial visual information from the RGB space of an spatial image. However, local and depth image information are crucial for understanding the spatial environment, which previous works have ignored. To address the issues, we propose a novel multi-modal and multi-scale spatial environment understanding scheme to achieve immersive VTTS, termed M2SE-VTTS. The multi-modal aims to take both the RGB and Depth spaces of the spatial image to learn more comprehensive spatial information, and the multi-scale seeks to model the local and global spatial knowledge simultaneously. Specifically, we first split the RGB and Depth images into patches and adopt the Gemini-generated environment captions to guide the local spatial understanding. After that, the multi-modal and multi-scale features are integrated by the local-aware global spatial understanding. In this way, M2SE-VTTS effectively models the interactions between local and global spatial contexts in the multi-modal spatial environment. Objective and subjective evaluations suggest that our model outperforms the advanced baselines in environmental speech generation. The code and audio samples are available at: https://github.com/AI-S2-Lab/M2SE-VTTS.</description>
