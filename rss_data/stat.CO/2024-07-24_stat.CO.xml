      <title>A Randomized Exchange Algorithm for Optimal Design of Multi-Response Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the increasing prevalence of vector observations, computation of optimal experimental design for multi-response models has received limited attention. To address this problem within the framework of approximate designs, we introduce mREX, an algorithm that generalizes the randomized exchange algorithm REX (J Am Stat Assoc 115:529, 2020), originally specialized for single-response models. The mREX algorithm incorporates several improvements: a novel method for computing efficient sparse initial designs, an extension to all differentiable Kiefer's optimality criteria, and an efficient method for performing optimal exchanges of weights. For the most commonly used D-optimality criterion, we propose a technique for optimal weight exchanges based on the characteristic matrix polynomial. The mREX algorithm is applicable to linear, nonlinear, and generalized linear models, and scales well to large problems. It typically converges to optimal designs faster than available alternative methods, although it does not require advanced mathematical programming solvers. We demonstrate the application of mREX to bivariate dose-response Emax models for clinical trials, both without and with the inclusion of covariates.</description>

      <title>CASTRO -- Efficient constrained sampling method for material and chemical experimental design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exploration of multicomponent material composition space requires significant time and financial investments, necessitating efficient use of resources for statistically relevant compositions. This article introduces a novel methodology, implemented in the open-source CASTRO (ConstrAined Sequential laTin hypeRcube sampling methOd) software package, to overcome equality-mixture constraints and ensure comprehensive design space coverage. Our approach leverages Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) and LHS with multidimensional uniformity (LHSMDU) using a divide-and-conquer strategy to manage high-dimensional problems effectively. By incorporating previous experimental knowledge within a limited budget, our method strategically recommends a feasible number of experiments to explore the design space. We validate our methodology with two examples: a four-dimensional problem with near-uniform distributions and a nine-dimensional problem with additional mixture constraints, yielding specific component distributions. Our constrained sequential LHS or LHSMDU approach enables thorough design space exploration, proving robustness for experimental design. This research not only advances material science but also offers promising solutions for efficiency challenges in pharmaceuticals and chemicals. CASTRO and the case studies are available for free download on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Global Minima by Penalized Full-dimensional Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The full-dimensional (metric, Euclidean, least squares) multidimensional scaling stress loss function is combined with a quadratic external penalty function term. The trajectory of minimizers of stress for increasing values of the penalty parameter is then used to find (tentative) global minima for low-dimensional multidimensional scaling. This is illustrated with several one-dimensional and two-dimensional examples.</description>

      <title>Spatially-clustered spatial autoregressive models with application to agricultural market concentration in Europe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an extension of the spatially-clustered linear regression models, namely, the spatially-clustered spatial autoregression (SCSAR) model, to deal with spatial heterogeneity issues in clustering procedures. In particular, we extend classical spatial econometrics models, such as the spatial autoregressive model, the spatial error model, and the spatially-lagged model, by allowing the regression coefficients to be spatially varying according to a cluster-wise structure. Cluster memberships and regression coefficients are jointly estimated through a penalized maximum likelihood algorithm which encourages neighboring units to belong to the same spatial cluster with shared regression coefficients. Motivated by the increase of observed values of the Gini index for the agricultural production in Europe between 2010 and 2020, the proposed methodology is employed to assess the presence of local spatial spillovers on the market concentration index for the European regions in the last decade. Empirical findings support the hypothesis of fragmentation of the European agricultural market, as the regions can be well represented by a clustering structure partitioning the continent into three-groups, roughly approximated by a division among Western, North Central and Southeastern regions. Also, we detect heterogeneous local effects induced by the selected explanatory variables on the regional market concentration. In particular, we find that variables associated with social, territorial and economic relevance of the agricultural sector seem to act differently throughout the spatial dimension, across the clusters and with respect to the pooled model, and temporal dimension.</description>

      <title>Explicit convergence rates of underdamped Langevin dynamics under weighted and weak Poincar\'e--Lions inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the long-time convergence behavior of underdamped Langevin dynamics, when the spatial equilibrium satisfies a weighted Poincar\'e inequality, with a general velocity distribution, which allows for fat-tail or subexponential potential energies, and provide constructive and fully explicit estimates in $\mathrm{L}^2$-norm with $\mathrm{L}^\infty$ initial conditions. A key ingredient is a space-time weighted Poincar\'e--Lions inequality, which in turn implies a weak Poincar\'e--Lions inequality.</description>

      <title>Optimal experimental design: Formulations and computations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Questions of `how best to acquire data' are essential to modeling and prediction in the natural and social sciences, engineering applications, and beyond. Optimal experimental design (OED) formalizes these questions and creates computational methods to answer them. This article presents a systematic survey of modern OED, from its foundations in classical design theory to current research involving OED for complex models. We begin by reviewing criteria used to formulate an OED problem and thus to encode the goal of performing an experiment. We emphasize the flexibility of the Bayesian and decision-theoretic approach, which encompasses information-based criteria that are well-suited to nonlinear and non-Gaussian statistical models. We then discuss methods for estimating or bounding the values of these design criteria; this endeavor can be quite challenging due to strong nonlinearities, high parameter dimension, large per-sample costs, or settings where the model is implicit. A complementary set of computational issues involves optimization methods used to find a design; we discuss such methods in the discrete (combinatorial) setting of observation selection and in settings where an exact design can be continuously parameterized. Finally we present emerging methods for sequential OED that build non-myopic design policies, rather than explicit designs; these methods naturally adapt to the outcomes of past experiments in proposing new experiments, while seeking coordination among all experiments to be performed. Throughout, we highlight important open questions and challenges.</description>

      <title>Robust Bayesian Model Averaging for Linear Regression Models With Heavy-Tailed Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, our goal is to develop a method for Bayesian model averaging in linear regression models to accommodate heavier tailed error distributions than the normal distribution. Motivated by the use of the Huber loss function in presence of outliers, Park and Casella (2008) proposed the concept of the Bayesian Huberized lasso, which has been recently developed and implemented by Kawakami and Hashimoto (2023), with hyperbolic errors. Because the Huberized lasso cannot enforce regression coefficients to be exactly zero, we propose a fully Bayesian variable selection approach with spike and slab priors, that can address sparsity more effectively. Furthermore, while the hyperbolic distribution has heavier tails than a normal distribution, its tails are less heavy in comparison to a Cauchy distribution.Thus, we propose a regression model, with an error distribution that encompasses both hyperbolic and Student-t distributions. Our model aims to capture the benefit of using Huber loss, but it can also adapt to heavier tails, and unknown levels of sparsity, as necessitated by the data. We develop an efficient Gibbs sampler with Metropolis Hastings steps for posterior computation. Through simulation studies, and analyses of the benchmark Boston housing dataset and NBA player salaries in the 2022-2023 season, we show that our method is competitive with various state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Mixture of segmentation for heterogeneous functional data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.10712v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider functional data with heterogeneity in time and in population. We propose a mixture model with segmentation of time to represent this heterogeneity while keeping the functional structure. Maximum likelihood estimator is considered, proved to be identifiable and consistent. In practice, an EM algorithm is used, combined with dynamic programming for the maximization step, to approximate the maximum likelihood estimator. The method is illustrated on a simulated dataset, and used on a real dataset of electricity consumption.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Factor Analysis with Dependent Gaussian Processes for High-Dimensional Gene Expression Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02781v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing availability of high-dimensional, longitudinal measures of gene expression can facilitate understanding of biological mechanisms, as required for precision medicine. Biological knowledge suggests that it may be best to describe complex diseases at the level of underlying pathways, which may interact with one another. We propose a Bayesian approach that allows for characterising such correlation among different pathways through Dependent Gaussian Processes (DGP) and mapping the observed high-dimensional gene expression trajectories into unobserved low-dimensional pathway expression trajectories via Bayesian Sparse Factor Analysis. Our proposal is the first attempt to relax the classical assumption of independent factors for longitudinal data and has demonstrated a superior performance in recovering the shape of pathway expression trajectories, revealing the relationships between genes and pathways, and predicting gene expressions (closer point estimates and narrower predictive intervals), as demonstrated through simulations and real data analysis. To fit the model, we propose a Monte Carlo Expectation Maximization (MCEM) scheme that can be implemented conveniently by combining a standard Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler and an R package GPFDA (Konzen and others, 2021), which returns the maximum likelihood estimates of DGP hyperparameters. The modular structure of MCEM makes it generalizable to other complex models involving the DGP model component. Our R package DGP4LCF that implements the proposed approach is available on CRAN.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Machine Learning for TabPFN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10923v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recently developed Prior-Data Fitted Networks (PFNs) have shown very promising results for applications in low-data regimes. The TabPFN model, a special case of PFNs for tabular data, is able to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a variety of classification tasks while producing posterior predictive distributions in mere seconds by in-context learning without the need for learning parameters or hyperparameter tuning. This makes TabPFN a very attractive option for a wide range of domain applications. However, a major drawback of the method is its lack of interpretability. Therefore, we propose several adaptations of popular interpretability methods that we specifically design for TabPFN. By taking advantage of the unique properties of the model, our adaptations allow for more efficient computations than existing implementations. In particular, we show how in-context learning facilitates the estimation of Shapley values by avoiding approximate retraining and enables the use of Leave-One-Covariate-Out (LOCO) even when working with large-scale Transformers. In addition, we demonstrate how data valuation methods can be used to address scalability challenges of TabPFN. Our proposed methods are implemented in a package tabpfn_iml and made available at https://github.com/david-rundel/tabpfn_iml.</description>
