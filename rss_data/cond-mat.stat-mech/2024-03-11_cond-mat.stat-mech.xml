      <title>Dynamic fluctuation-dissipation theory for Generalized Langevin Equations: constructive constraints, stability and realizability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the initial-value formulation, a dynamic theory for systems evolving according to a Generalized Langevin Equation is developed, providing more restrictive conditions on the existence of equilibrium behavior and its fluctuation-dissipation implications. For systems fulfilling the property of local realizability,
  that for all the practical purposes corresponds to the postulate of the existence of a Markovian embedding, physical constraints, expressed in the form of dissipative stability and stochastic realizability are derived. If these two properties are met, Kubo theory is constructively recovered, while if one of these conditions is violated a thermodynamic equilibrium behavior does not exist (and this occurs also for `` well-behaved dissipative systems'' according to the classical Kubo theory), with significant implications in the linear response theory.</description>

      <title>On the ergodicity breaking in well-behaved Generalized Langevin Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phenomenon of ergodicity breaking of stochastic dynamics governed by Generalized Langevin Equations (GLE) in the presence of well-behaved exponentially decaying dissipative memory kernels, recently investigated by many authors (Phys. Rev. E {\bf 83} 062102 2011; Phys. Rev. E {\bf 98} 062140 2018; Eur. Phys. J. B {\bf 93} 184 2020),
  finds, in the dynamic theory of GLE, its simple and natural explanation, related to the concept of dissipative stability. It is shown that the occurrence of ergodicity breakdown for well-behaved dissipative kernels falls, in general, ouside the region of stochastic realizability, and therefore it cannot be observed in physical systems.</description>

      <title>Playing nonlocal games across a topological phase transition on a quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many-body quantum games provide a natural perspective on phases of matter in quantum hardware, crisply relating the quantum correlations inherent in phases of matter to the securing of quantum advantage at a device-oriented task. In this paper we introduce a family of multiplayer quantum games for which topologically ordered phases of matter are a resource yielding quantum advantage. Unlike previous examples, quantum advantage persists away from the exactly solvable point and is robust to arbitrary local perturbations, irrespective of system size. We demonstrate this robustness experimentally on Quantinuum's H1-1 quantum computer by playing the game with a continuous family of randomly deformed toric code states that can be created with constant-depth circuits leveraging mid-circuit measurements and unitary feedback. We are thus able to tune through a topological phase transition - witnessed by the loss of robust quantum advantage - on currently available quantum hardware. This behavior is contrasted with an analogous family of deformed GHZ states, for which arbitrarily weak local perturbations destroy quantum advantage in the thermodynamic limit. Finally, we discuss a topological interpretation of the game, which leads to a natural generalization involving an arbitrary number of players.</description>

      <title>Stability of quasicrystalline ultracold fermions to dipolar interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasiperiodic potentials can be used to interpolate between localization and delocalization in one dimension. However, little is known about the stability of quasicrystalline phases to long-range interactions. In this work, we study repulsive ultracold dipolar fermions in a quasiperiodic optical lattice to characterize the behavior of interacting quasicrystals. We simulate the full time evolution of the typical experimental protocols used to probe quasicrystalline order and localization properties. We extract experimentally measurable dynamical observables and correlation functions to characterize the three phases observed in the noninteracting setting: localized, intermediate, and extended. We then study the stability of such phases to repulsive dipolar interactions. We find that dipolar interactions can completely alter the shape of the phase diagram by stabilizing the intermediate phase, mostly at the expense of the extended phase. Moreover, in the strongly interacting regime, a resonance-like behavior characterized by density oscillations appears. Remarkably, strong dipolar repulsions can also localize particles even in the absence of quasiperiodicity if the primary lattice is sufficiently deep. Our work shows that dipolar interactions in a quasiperiodic potential can give rise to a complex, tuneable coexistence of localized and extended quantum states.</description>

      <title>Hardware-efficient ansatz without barren plateaus in any depth</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variational quantum circuits have recently gained much interest due to their relevance in real-world applications, such as combinatorial optimizations, quantum simulations, and modeling a probability distribution. Despite their huge potential, the practical usefulness of those circuits beyond tens of qubits is largely questioned. One of the major problems is the so-called barren plateaus phenomenon. Quantum circuits with a random structure often have a flat cost-function landscape and thus cannot be trained efficiently. In this paper, we propose two novel parameter conditions in which the hardware-efficient ansatz (HEA) is free from barren plateaus for arbitrary circuit depths. In the first condition, the HEA approximates to a time-evolution operator generated by a local Hamiltonian. Utilizing a recent result by [Park and Killoran, Quantum 8, 1239 (2024)], we prove a constant lower bound of gradient magnitudes in any depth both for local and global observables. On the other hand, the HEA is within the many-body localized (MBL) phase in the second parameter condition. We argue that the HEA in this phase has a large gradient component for a local observable using a phenomenological model for the MBL system. By initializing the parameters of the HEA using these conditions, we show that our findings offer better overall performance in solving many-body Hamiltonians. Our results indicate that barren plateaus are not an issue when initial parameters are smartly chosen, and other factors, such as local minima or the expressivity of the circuit, are more crucial.</description>

      <title>Phase Transitions in Ising models: the Semi-infinite with decaying field and the Random Field Long-range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this thesis, we present results on phase transition for two models: the semi-infinite Ising model with a decaying field, and the long-range Ising model with a random field. We study the semi-infinite Ising model with an external field $h_i = \lambda |i_d|^{-\delta}$, $\lambda$ is the wall influence, and $\delta&gt;0$. This external field decays as it gets further away from the wall. We are able to show that when $\delta&gt;1$ and $\beta &gt; \beta_c(d)$, there exists a critical value $0&lt; \lambda_c:=\lambda_c(\delta,\beta)$ such that, for $\lambda&lt;\lambda_c$ there is phase transition and for $\lambda&gt;\lambda_c$ we have uniqueness of the Gibbs state. In addition, when $\delta&lt;1$ we have only one Gibbs state for any positive $\beta$ and $\lambda$. For the model with a random field, we extend the recent argument by Ding and Zhuang from nearest-neighbor to long-range interactions and prove the phase transition in the class of ferromagnetic random field Ising models. Our proof combines a generalization of Fr\"ohlich-Spencer contours to the multidimensional setting proposed by Affonso, Bissacot, Endo and Handa, with the coarse-graining procedure introduced by Fisher, Fr\"ohlich, and Spencer. Our result shows that the Ding-Zhuang strategy is also useful for interactions $J_{xy}=|x-y|^{- \alpha}$ when $\alpha &gt; d$ in dimension $d\geq 3$ if we have a suitable system of contours, yielding an alternative proof that does not use the Renormalization Group Method (RGM), since Bricmont and Kupiainen claimed that the RGM should also work on this generality. We can consider i.i.d. random fields with Gaussian or Bernoulli distributions.</description>

      <title>Morphological evolution of disk galaxies and their concentration, asymmetry and clumpiness (CAS) properties in simulations across Toomre's $Q$ parameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the morphological and structural evolutions of disk galaxies in simulations for a wide range of Toomre's $Q$ parameter. In addition to the inspection of conventional bar modes, we compute the concentration, asymmetry and clumpiness (CAS) parameters to enlarge the understanding of the galaxy evolution. These parameters are widely employed to analyze the light distribution of the observed galaxies, but the adaptation to numerical simulations is not much considered. While the bar formation takes place in a considerable range of $Q$ around $1$, barred galaxies originating from $Q&gt;1$ and $Q&lt;1$ disks yield the CAS values that differ significantly. Disks starting with $Q&lt;1$ develop clumps due to local gravitational instabilities along with the bar and these clumps play a central role in enhancing the CAS values. That process is absent in $Q&gt;1$ counterparts in which the evolution is dominated by linearly unstable two-armed modes that lead to lower CAS values. Likewise, unbarred galaxies that are obtainable from disks with $Q$ far below and far above $1$ exhibit greatly different CAS magnitudes. It turns out that the CAS parameters can serve as indicators of the initial kinematical state and the evolution history of a disk of any morphology. In addition, we find an alternative mechanism of the formation of the lopsided barred galaxy when $Q\lesssim 1$. Bars that evolve in the midst of the clumps can spontaneously become lopsided at the end.</description>

      <title>Quantum Many-body Scar Models in One Dimensional Spin Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The phenomenon of quantum many-body scars has received widespread attention both in theoretical and experimental physics in recent years due to its unique physical properties. In this paper, based on the $su(2)$ algebraic relations, we propose a general method for constructing scar models by combining simple modules.This allows us to investigate many-body scar phenomena in high-spin systems. We numerically verify the thermalization and non-integrability of this model and demonstrate the dynamical properties of the scar states. We also provide a theoretical analysis of the properties of these scar states. For spin-$1$ case, we find that our 1D chain model reduces to the famous PXP model[C. J. Turner et al. Phys. Rev. B 98, 155134(2018)] under special parameter condition. In addition, due to the continuous tunability of the parameters, our model also enables us to investigate the transitions of QMBS from non-integrable to integrable system.</description>

      <title>Impurity in a zero-temperature three-dimensional Fermi gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider an impurity in a sea of zero-temperature fermions uniformly distributed throughout the space. The impurity scatters on fermions. On average, the momentum of impurity decreases with time as $t^{-1/(d+1)}$ in $d$ dimensions, and the momentum distribution acquires a scaling form in the long time limit. We solve the Lorentz-Boltzmann equation for the scaled momentum distribution of the impurity in three dimensions. The solution is a combination of confluent hypergeometric functions. In two spatial dimensions, the Lorentz-Boltzmann equation is analytically intractable, so we merely extract a few exact predictions about asymptotic behaviors when the scaled momentum of the impurity is small or large.</description>

      <title>Generic ETH: Eigenstate Thermalization beyond the Microcanonical</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH) has played a key role in recent advances in the high energy and condensed matter communities. It explains how an isolated quantum system in a far-from-equilibrium initial state can evolve to a state that is indistinguishable from thermal equilibrium, with observables relaxing to almost time-independent results that can be described using traditional statistical mechanics ensembles. In this work we probe the limits of ETH, pushing it outside its prototypical applications in several directions. We design a qutrit lattice system with conserved quasilocal charge, in which we verify a form of generalized eigenstate thermalization. We also observe signatures of thermalization in states well outside microcanonical windows of both charge and energy, which we dub `generic ETH.'</description>

      <title>Quantum-critical properties of the one- and two-dimensional random transverse-field Ising model from large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the ferromagnetic transverse-field Ising model with quenched disorder at $T = 0$ in one and two dimensions by means of stochastic series expansion quantum Monte Carlo simulations using a rigorous zero-temperature scheme. Using a sample-replication method and averaged Binder ratios, we determine the critical shift and width exponents $\nu_\mathrm{s}$ and $\nu_\mathrm{w}$ as well as unbiased critical points by finite-size scaling. Further, scaling of the disorder-averaged magnetisation at the critical point is used to determine the order-parameter critical exponent $\beta$ and the critical exponent $\nu_{\mathrm{av}}$ of the average correlation length. The dynamic scaling in the Griffiths phase is investigated by measuring the local susceptibility in the disordered phase and the dynamic exponent $z'$ is extracted. By applying various finite-size scaling protocols, we provide an extensive and comprehensive comparison between the different approaches on equal footing. The emphasis on effective zero-temperature simulations resolves several inconsistencies in existing literature.</description>

      <title>Chemical Reactions regulated by Phase-Separated Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase-separated liquid condensates can spatially organize and thereby regulate chemical processes. However, the physicochemical mechanisms underlying such regulation remain elusive as the intramolecular interactions responsible for phase separation give rise to a coupling between diffusion and chemical reactions at non-dilute conditions. Here, we derive a theoretical framework that decouples the phase separation of scaffold molecules from the reaction kinetics of diluted clients. As a result, phase volume and client partitioning coefficients become control parameters, which enables us to dissect the impact of phase-separated condensates on chemical reactions. We apply this framework to two chemical processes and show how condensates affect the yield of reversible chemical reactions and the initial rate of a simple assembly process. In both cases, we find an optimal condensate volume at which the respective chemical reaction property is maximal. Our work can be applied to experimentally quantify how condensed phases alter chemical processes in systems biology and unravel the mechanisms of how biomolecular condensates regulate biochemistry in living cells.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ecosystems are among the most interesting and well-studied examples of self-organized complex systems. Community ecology, the study of how species interact with each other and the environment, has a rich tradition. Over the last few years, there has been a growing theoretical and experimental interest in these problems from the physics and quantitative biology communities. Here, we give an overview of community ecology, highlighting the deep connections between ecology and statistical physics. We start by introducing the two classes of mathematical models that have served as the workhorses of community ecology: Consumer Resource Models (CRM) and the generalized Lotka-Volterra models (GLV). We place a special emphasis on graphical methods and general principles. We then review recent works showing a deep and surprising connection between ecological dynamics and constrained optimization. We then shift our focus by analyzing these same models in "high-dimensions" (i.e. in the limit where the number of species and resources in the ecosystem becomes large) and discuss how such complex ecosystems can be analyzed using methods from the statistical physics of disordered systems such as the cavity method and Random Matrix Theory.</description>

      <title>Continuous Gated First-Passage Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.09164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gated first-passage processes, where completion depends on both hitting a target and satisfying additional constraints, are prevalent across various fields. Despite their significance, analytical solutions to basic problems remain unknown, e.g. the detection time of a diffusing particle by a gated interval, disk, or sphere. In this paper, we elucidate the challenges posed by continuous gated first-passage processes and present a renewal framework to overcome them. This framework offers a unified approach for a wide range of problems, including those with single-point, half-line, and interval targets. The latter have so far evaded exact solutions. Our analysis reveals that solutions to gated problems can be obtained directly from the ungated dynamics. This, in turn, reveals universal properties and asymptotic behaviors, shedding light on cryptic intermediate-time regimes and refining the notion of high-crypticity for continuous-space gated processes. Moreover, we extend our formalism to higher dimensions, showcasing its versatility and applicability. Overall, this work provides valuable insights into the dynamics of continuous gated first-passage processes and offers analytical tools for studying them across diverse domains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.04443v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cellular Potts models are broadly applied across developmental biology and cancer research. We overcome limitations of the traditional approach, which reinterprets a modified Metropolis sampling as ad hoc dynamics, by introducing a physical timescale through Poissonian kinetics and by applying principles of stochastic thermodynamics to separate thermal and relaxation effects from athermal noise and nonconservative forces. Our method accurately describes cell-sorting dynamics in mouse-embryo development and identifies the distinct contributions of nonequilibrium processes, e.g. cell growth and active fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Integrating local energetics into Maxwell-Calladine constraint counting to design mechanical metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.07419v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Maxwell-Calladine index theorem plays a central role in our current understanding of the mechanical rigidity of discrete materials. By considering the geometric constraints each material component imposes on a set of underlying degrees of freedom, the theorem relates the emergence of rigidity to constraint counting arguments. However, the Maxwell-Calladine paradigm is significantly limited -- its exclusive reliance on the geometric relationships between constraints and degrees of freedom completely neglects the actual energetic costs of deforming individual components. To address this limitation, we derive a generalization of the Maxwell-Calladine index theorem based on susceptibilities that naturally incorporate local energetic properties such as stiffness and prestress. Using this extended framework, we investigate how local energetics modify the classical constraint counting picture to capture the relationship between deformations and external forces. We then combine this formalism with group representation theory to design mechanical metamaterials where differences in symmetry between local energy costs and structural geometry are exploited to control responses to external forces.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic diffusive fluctuations for generalized hard rods dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.13037v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the fluctuations in equilibrium for a dynamics of rods with random length. This includes the classical hard rod elastic collisions, when rod lengths are constant and equal to a positive value. We prove that in the diffusive space-time scaling, an initial fluctuation of density of particles of velocity $v$, after recentering on its Euler evolution, evolve randomly shifted by a Brownian motion of variance $\mathcal D(v)$.</description>

      <title>Remarks on effects of projective phase on eigenstate thermalization hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11425v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The existence of $p$-form symmetry in $(d+1)$-dimensional quantum field is known to always lead to the breakdown of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) for certain $(d-p)$-dimensional operators other than symmetry operators under some assumptions. The assumptions include the mixing of symmetry sectors within a given energy shell, which is rather challenging to verify because it requires information on the eigenstates in the middle of the spectrum. We reconsider this assumption from the viewpoint of projective representations to avoid this difficulty. In the case of $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetries, we can circumvent the difficulty by considering $\mathbb{Z}_N\times\mathbb{Z}_N$-symmetric theories with nontrivial projective phases, and perturbing the Hamiltonian while preserving one of the $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetries of our interest. We also perform numerical analyses for $(1+1)$-dimensional spin chains and the $(2+1)$-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal Structural Effects of Water on DNA Homology Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03213v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mechanism behind mutual recognition of homologous DNA sequences prior to genetic recombination is one of the remaining puzzles in molecular biology. Leading models of homology recognition, based on classical electrostatics, neglect the short-range nonlocal screening effects arising from structured water around DNA, and hence may only provide insight for relatively large separations between interacting DNAs. We elucidate the role of the effects of the nonlocal dielectric response of water on DNA-DNA interaction and show that these can dramatically enhance the driving force for recognition.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium Green's function approach to low-energy fission dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04255v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The concept of a compound nucleus was proposed by Bohr in 1936 to explain narrow resonances in neutron scattering off a nucleus. While a compound nucleus has been understood in terms of statistical mechanics, its description based on a many-body Hamiltonian has yet to be developed. Here we present a microscopic modeling of a compound nucleus starting from a nucleonic degree of freedom. We focus in particular on a decay of a heavy compound nucleus, that is, fission and radiative capture. To this end, we develop an approach based on a non-equilibrium Green's function, which is combined with a configuration interaction (CI) approach based on a constrained density-functional theory (DFT). We apply this approach to a barrier-top fission of $^{236}$U, restricting the model space to seniority zero configurations of neutrons and protons. Our calculation with a Skyrme energy functional yields the fission-to-capture branching ratio of around 0.07. While this value is still reasonable, the calculation underestimates the branching ratio by about a factor of 40 as compared to the empirical value, indicating a necessity of seniority non-zero configurations in the model space. We also find that the distribution of the fission probability approximately follows the chi-squared distribution with the number of degrees of freedom of the order of 1, which is consistent with the experimental finding.</description>
