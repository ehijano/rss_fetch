      <title>Radiative corrections to proton-proton fusion in pionless EFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the leading radiative correction to proton-proton fusion using the pionless effective field theory framework at leading order. We derive the relevant matrix elements and evaluate them using the method of regions. We benchmark the accuracy of our approximations by carrying out numerical computations of the full expressions. We show that the first order radiative corrections due to the exchange of a Coulomb photon between positron and proton-proton systems map onto the Sirlin function and the $\mathcal{O}(\alpha)$ contribution from the Fermi function. We furthermore find that the nuclear structure dependent radiative correction omitted in the previous analysis by Kurylov {\it et al} gives an up to 0.2~\% correction to the pp fusion S-factor with its size ultimately depending on a two-nucleon counterterm that renormalizes the axial two-body current $L_{1A}$.</description>

      <title>Chiral dynamics in soft triaxial nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chirality in soft triaxial nuclei is investigated for the first time with the time-dependent and tilted axis cranking covariant density functional theories on a three-dimensional space lattice in a microscopic and self-consistent way. Taking the puzzling chiral nucleus $^{106}$Ag as an example, the experimental energies of the observed nearly degenerate bands are well reproduced without any free parameters beyond the well-defined density functional. A novel chiral mode in soft triaxial nuclei is newly revealed from the microscopic dynamics of the total angular momentum. This opens a new research area for the study of chirality, particularly in relation to soft nuclear shapes.</description>

      <title>Contact operators in renormalization of attractive singular potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss renormalization of chiral nuclear forces in the 3P0 channel of N N scattering at next- to-next-to leading order (N2LO) if the one-pion exchange is treated nonperturbatively at leading order. The matrix elements of the subleading contact potentials become nearly dependent of each other for the so-called exceptional ultraviolet momentum cutoff, making it difficult to determine the strengths of those contact potentials from the empirical phase shifts, as reported in Ref. [1]. We argue that this issue can be resolved by adjusting the strategy by which the low-energy constants are deduced from the data, thus making those exceptional cutoffs amenable to chiral effective field theory.</description>

      <title>Neutron star calculations with the phenomenological three-nucleon force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we have studied the effect of three-nucleon interaction on the neutron stars structure. In our calculations, we have considered the neutron star matter as a beta-stable nuclear matter. We have put the results concerning the TBF effect in perspective against two-body results and other calculations of three-nucleon interactions, using the Urbana v14 potential and the parabolic approximation of the nuclear-matter energy for approximating the problem of asymmetric nuclear matter. As such, solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation, we have estimated bulk properties of neutron stars and investigated how the present calculations would agree with the expected dynamical-stability condition.</description>

      <title>Calibrating global behaviour of equation of state by combining nuclear and astrophysics inputs in a machine learning approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We implemented symbolic regression techniques to identify suitable analytical functions that map various properties of neutron stars (NSs), obtained by solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations, to a few key parameters of the equation of state (EoS). These symbolic regression models (SRMs) are then employed to perform Bayesian inference with a comprehensive dataset from nuclear physics experiments and astrophysical observations. The posterior distributions of EoS parameters obtained from Bayesian inference using SRMs closely match those obtained directly from the solutions of TOV equations. Our SRM-based approach is approximately 100 times faster, enabling efficient Bayesian analyses across different combinations of data to explore their sensitivity to various EoS parameters within a reasonably short time.</description>

      <title>A unitary coupled-channel three-body amplitude with pions and kaons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-body dynamics above threshold is required for the reliable extraction of many amplitudes and resonances from experiment and lattice QCD. The S-matrix principle of unitarity can be used to construct dynamical coupled-channel approaches in which three particles scatter off each other, re-arranging two-body subsystems by particle exchange. This paper reports the development of a three-body coupled-channel, amplitude including pions and kaons. The unequal-mass amplitude contains two-body S- and P-wave subsystems ("isobars") of all isospins, $I=0,\,1/2,\,1,\, 3/2, \, 2$, and it also allows for transitions within a given isobar. The $f_0(500)\, ("\sigma"),\,f_0(980),\,\rho(700), K_0^*(700)\,("\kappa")$, and $K^*(892)$ resonances are included, apart from repulsive isobars. Different methods to evaluate the amplitude for physical momenta are discussed. Production amplitudes for $a_1$ quantum numbers are shown as a proof of principle for the numerical implementation.</description>

      <title>Towards an Interpretation of the First Measurements of Energy Correlators in the Quark-Gluon Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Energy correlators have recently been proposed as a class of jet substructure observables that directly link experimental measurements of the asymptotic energy flux with the field theoretic description of the underlying microscopic dynamics. This link holds particular promise in heavy-ion physics, where both experimental measurements and theoretical interpretations are inherently complex. With recent measurements of energy correlators in proton-proton collisions, the first measurement of these observables on inclusive jets in heavy-ion collisions underscores the importance of a theoretical understanding of their behavior in this complex environment. In this manuscript, we extend our previous calculations to account for several effects necessary for a qualitative understanding of the behavior of energy correlators on inclusive jets in heavy-ion collisions. Through a semi-analytic approach implemented in a hydrodynamically expanding quark-gluon plasma (QGP), we account for medium-induced radiation with leading broadening effects, selection biases arising from energy loss, and a description of the confinement transition. Our results represent a crucial first step towards interpreting the measurements of energy correlators on inclusive jets in heavy-ion collisions, which marks a significant milestone in connecting heavy-ion experiment and fundamental quantum field theory, in the quest to disentangle the microscopic dynamics of the QGP.</description>

      <title>Selected Configuration Interaction for Resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electronic resonances are metastable states that can decay by electron loss. They are ubiquitous across various fields of science, such as chemistry, physics, and biology. However, current theoretical and computational models for resonances cannot yet rival the level of accuracy achieved by bound-state methodologies. Here, we generalize selected configuration interaction (SCI) to treat resonances using the complex absorbing potential (CAP) technique. By modifying the selection procedure and the extrapolation protocol of standard SCI, the resulting CAP-SCI method yields resonance positions and widths of full configuration interaction quality. Initial results for the shape resonances of \ce{N2-} and \ce{CO-} reveal the important effect of high-order correlation, which shifts the values obtained with CAP-augmented equation-of-motion coupled-cluster with singles and doubles by more than \SI{0.1}{\eV}. The present CAP-SCI approach represents a cornerstone in the development of highly-accurate methodologies for resonances.</description>

      <title>Weakening of $N=28$ shell gap and the nature of $0_2^+$ states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The work reports a novel application of the interacting boson model in light-mass region around $^{48}$Ca, that takes into account intruder states and configuration mixing. The model is shown to provide a reasonable description of the observed low-lying yrast and yrare states of the $N=28$ even-even isotones from Si to Fe, and even-even Ca isotopes. The nature of $0_2^+$ states is addressed in terms of the competition between spherical and deformed intruder configurations, and the rigidity of the $N=28$ shell gap is tested. The $0_2^+$ isomer in $^{44}$S is shown to arise from a weak mixing between the two configurations. The unresolved low-lying spectra in $^{46}$Ar is also approached using the core-excitations across $N=28$ shell. The SU(3) structure in $^{42}$Si is supported by the present calculation. The nearly spherical nature of $^{50}$Ti, $^{52}$Cr, $^{54}$Fe and $^{42,44,46}$Ca isotopes is found, while the core excitations are found to be essential for the description of yrare states. Shell model calculation is also performed for comparison.</description>

      <title>Examination of STAR fixed-target data on directed flow at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 3 and 4.5 GeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02787v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present results of simulations of directed flow of various hadrons in Au+Au collisions at collision energies of $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 3 and 4.5 GeV. Simulations are performed within the model three-fluid dynamics (3FD) and the event simulator based on it (THESEUS). The results are compared with recent STAR data. The directed flows of various particles provide information on dynamics in various parts and at various stages of the colliding system depending on the particle. However, the information on the equation of state is not always directly accessible because of strong influence of the afterburner stage or insufficient equilibration of the matter. It is found that the crossover scenario gives the best overall description of the data. This crossover EoS is soft in the hadronic phase. The transition into QGP in Au+Au collisions occurs at collision energies between 3 and 4.5 GeV, at baryon densities $n_B \geq 4 n_0$ and temperatures $\approx 150$ MeV. In-medium effects in the directed flow of (anti)kaons are discussed.</description>

      <title>Do not forget the electrons: Extending moderately-sized nuclear networks for multidimensional hydrodynamic codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03743v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present here an extended nuclear network, with 90 species, designed for being coupled with hydrodynamic simulations, which includes neutrons, protons, electrons, positrons, and the corresponding neutrino and anti-neutrino emission. This network is also coupled with temperature, making it extremely robust and, together with its size, unique of its kind. The inclusion of electron captures on free protons makes the network very appropriate for multidimensional studies of Type Ia supernova explosions, especially when the exploding object is a massive white dwarf.
  The results obtained with the proposed medium-sized network compare fairly well, to a few percent, with those computed with the extended network WinNet (&gt; 2000 isotopes) in scenarios reproducing the gross physical conditions of current Type Ia supernova explosion models. In those cases where the carbon and oxygen fuel ignites at high density, the high-temperature plateau typical of the nuclear statistical equilibrium regime is well defined and stable, allowing large integration time steps. We show that the inclusion of electron captures on free protons substantially improves the estimation of the electron fraction of the mixture. Therefore, the pressure is better determined than in networks where electron captures are excluded, which will ultimately lead to more reliable hydrodynamic models. Explosive combustion of helium at low density, occurring near the surface layer of a white dwarf, is also better described with the proposed network, which gives nuclear energy generation rates much closer to WinNet than typical reduced alpha networks.</description>

      <title>Energy momentum tensor on and off the light cone: exposition with scalar Yukawa theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06896v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the gravitational form factors $A_i$, $D_i$ and $\bar c_i$ of the scalar Yukawa theory using both the light-cone and covariant perturbation theory at the one-loop level. The light-cone formalism provides a potential approach to access these form factors beyond the perturbative regime. However, unlike the covariant formulation, the Poincar\'e symmetry on the light cone is not manifest. In this work, we use perturbation theory as a benchmark to extract the gravitational form factors from the light-front energy-momentum tensor. By comparing results on and off the light cone, we identify $T^{++}, T^{+a}, T^{+-}, T^{12}$ as the "good currents" that are properly renormalized and can be used to extract the gravitational form factors.</description>
