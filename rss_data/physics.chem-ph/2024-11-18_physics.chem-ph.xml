      <title>Estimating Fluid-solid Interfacial Free Energies for Wettabilities: A Review of Molecular Simulation Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluid-solid interfacial free energy (IFE) is a fundamental parameter influencing wetting behaviors, which play a crucial role across a broad range of industrial applications. Obtaining reliable data for fluid-solid IFE remains challenging with experimental and semi-empirical methods, and the applicability of first-principle theoretical methods is constrained by a lack of accessible computational tools. In recent years, a variety of molecular simulation methods have been developed for determining the fluid-solid IFE. This review provides a comprehensive summary and critical evaluation of these techniques. The developments, fundamental principles, and implementations of various simulation methods are presented from mechanical routes, such as the contact angle approach, the technique using Bakker's equation, and the Wilhelmy simulation method, as well as thermodynamic routes, including the cleaving wall method, the Frenkel-Ladd technique, and the test-volume/area methods. These approaches can be applied to compute various fluid-solid interfacial properties, including IFE, relative IFE, surface stress, and superficial tension, although these properties are often used without differentiation in the literature. Additionally, selected applications of these methods are reviewed to provide insight into the behavior of fluid-solid interfacial energies in diverse systems. We also illustrate two interpretations of the fluid-solid IFE based on the theory of Navascues and Berry and Bakker's equation. It is shown that the simulation methods developed from these two interpretations are identical. This review advocates for the broader adoption of molecular simulation methods in estimating fluid-solid IFE, which is essential for advancing our understanding of wetting behaviors in various chemical systems.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Interpolation: A generative approach to molecular thermodynamics and kinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using normalizing flows and reweighting, Boltzmann Generators enable equilibrium sampling from a Boltzmann distribution, defined by an energy function and thermodynamic state. In this work, we introduce Thermodynamic Interpolation (TI), which allows for generating sampling statistics in a temperature-controllable way. We introduce TI flavors that work directly in the ambient configurational space, mapping between different thermodynamic states or through a latent, normally distributed reference state. Our ambient-space approach allows for the specification of arbitrary target temperatures, ensuring generalizability within the temperature range of the training set and demonstrating the potential for extrapolation beyond it. We validate the effectiveness of TI on model systems that exhibit metastability and non-trivial temperature dependencies. Finally, we demonstrate how to combine TI-based sampling to estimate free energy differences through various free energy perturbation methods and provide corresponding approximated kinetic rates estimated through generator extended dynamic mode decomposition (gEDMD).</description>

      <title>Self-learning path integral hybrid Monte Carlo with mixed ab initio and machine learning potentials for modeling nuclear quantum effects in water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The introduction of machine learned potentials (MLPs) has greatly expanded the space available for studying Nuclear Quantum Effects computationally with ab initio path integral (PI) accuracy, with the MLPs' promise of an accuracy comparable to that of ab initio at a fraction of the cost. One of the challenges in development of MLPs is the need for a large and diverse training set calculated by ab initio methods. This data set should ideally cover the entire phase space, while not searching this space using ab initio methods, as this would be counterproductive and generally intractable with respect to computational time.In this paper, we present the self-learning PI hybrid Monte Carlo Method using a mixed ab initio and ML potential (SL-PIHMC-MIX), where the mixed potential allows for the study of larger systems and the extension of the original SL-HMC method [Nagai et al., Phys. Rev. B 102, 041124 (2020)] to PI methods and larger systems. While the MLPs generated by this method can be directly applied to run long-time ML-PIMD simulations, we demonstrate that using PIHMC-MIX with the trained MLPs allows for an exact reproduction of the structure obtained from ab initio PIMD. Specifically, we find that the PIHMC-MIX simulations require only 5,000 evaluations of the 32-bead structure, compared to the 100,000 evaluations needed for the ab initio PIMD result.</description>

      <title>Linear Response pCCD-Based Methods: LR-pCCD and LR-pCCD+S Approaches for the Efficient and Reliable Modeling of Excited state Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we derive working equations for the Linear Response pair Coupled Cluster Doubles (LR-pCCD) ansatz and its extension to singles (S), LR-pCCD+S. These methods allow us to compute electronic excitation energies and transition dipole moments based on a pCCD reference function. We benchmark the LR-pCCD+S model against the {linear response} coupled-cluster singles and doubles method for modeling electronic spectra (excitation energies and transition dipole moments) of the BH, \ce{H2O}, \ce{H2CO}, and furan molecules. We also analyze the effect of orbital optimization within pCCD on the resulting LR-pCCD+S transition dipole moments {and oscillator strengths} and perform a statistical error analysis. We show that the LR-pCCD+S method can correctly reproduce the transition dipole moments features, thus representing a reliable and cost-effective alternative to standard, more expensive electronic structure methods for modeling electronic spectra of simple molecules. Specifically, the proposed models require only mean-field-like computational cost, while excited-state properties may approach the CCSD level of accuracy. Moreover, we demonstrate the capability of our model to simulate electronic transitions with non-negligible contributions of double excitations and the electronic spectra of polyenes of various chain lengths, for which standard electronic structure methods perform purely.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed neural networks need a physicist to be accurate: the case of mass and heat transport in Fischer-Tropsch catalyst particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as an influential technology, merging the swift and automated capabilities of machine learning with the precision and dependability of simulations grounded in theoretical physics. PINNs are often employed to solve algebraic or differential equations to replace some or even all steps of multi-stage computational workflows, leading to their significant speed-up. However, wide adoption of PINNs is still hindered by reliability issues, particularly at extreme ends of the input parameter ranges. In this study, we demonstrate this in the context of a system of coupled non-linear differential reaction-diffusion and heat transfer equations related to Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, which are solved by a finite-difference method with a PINN used in evaluating their source terms. It is shown that the testing strategies traditionally used to assess the accuracy of neural networks as function approximators can overlook the peculiarities which ultimately cause instabilities of the finite-difference solver. We propose a domain knowledge-based modifications to the PINN architecture ensuring its correct asymptotic behavior. When combined with an improved numerical scheme employed as an initial guess generator, the proposed modifications are shown to recover the overall stability of the simulations, while preserving the speed-up brought by PINN as the workflow component. We discuss the possible applications of the proposed hybrid transport equation solver in context of chemical reactors simulations.</description>

      <title>Dissociative photoionization of EUV lithography photoresist models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dissociative photoionization of \textit{tert}-butyl methyl methacrylate, a monomer unit found in many ESCAP resists, was investigated in a gas phase photoelectron photoion coincidence experiment employing extreme ultraviolet (EUV) synchrotron radiation at 13.5 nm. It was found that the interaction of EUV photons with the molecules leads almost exclusively to dissociation. However, the ionization can also directly deprotect the ester function, thus inducing the solubility switch wanted in a resist film. These results serve as a building block to reconstruct the full picture of the mechanism in widely used chemically amplified resist thin films, provide a knob to tailor more performant resist materials, and will aid interpreting advanced ultrafast time-resolved experiments.</description>

      <title>A facile route to synthesize cubic gauche polymeric nitrogen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, the long-sought cg-N with N-N single bond has been synthesized for the first time by a thermal-driven-only chemical route at ambient conditions. The successful synthesis of cg-N was achieved by first creating a solution of azides, which was then pretreated under vacuum conditions. Following the pretreatment, the resultant concentrated azide was heated at temperatures ranging from 260{\deg}C to 330{\deg}C for a reaction time of 3 hours, ultimately leading to the formation of cg-N. The emergent intense Raman peak characterized of cg-N provides solid evidence that the double bonded nitrogen-nitrogen transforms into a single bond form, which agrees well with cg-N structure. To date, this is the only work achieving the quantity of cg-N synthesized at ambient conditions by a facile route that can be further developed for the scalable synthesis and applications of polymerized nitrogen-based materials as high energy density materials.</description>

      <title>Scalable molecular simulation of electrolyte solutions with quantum chemical accuracy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12535v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electrolyte solutions play critical role in a vast range of important applications, yet an accurate and scalable method of predicting their properties without fitting to experiment has remained out of reach, despite over a century of effort. Here, we combine state-of-the-art density functional theory and equivariant neural network potentials to demonstrate this capability, reproducing key structural, thermodynamic, and kinetic properties. We show that neural network potentials (NNPs) can be recursively trained on a subset of their own output to enable coarse-grained/continuum-solvent molecular simulations that can access much longer timescales than possible with all atom simulations. We observe the surprising formation of Li cation dimers along with identical anion-anion pairing of chloride and bromide anions. Finally, we reproduce simulate the crystal phase and infinite dilution pairing free energies despite being trained only on moderate concentration solutions. This approach should be scaled to build a greatly expanded database of electrolyte solution properties than currently exists.</description>

      <title>Implementation of time-dependent Hartree-Fock in real space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01522v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) is one of the fundamental post-Hartree-Fock (HF) methods to describe excited states. In its Tamm-Dancoff form, equivalent to Configuration Interaction Singles, it is still widely used and particularly applicable to big molecules where more accurate methods may be unfeasibly expensive. However, it is rarely implemented in real space, mostly because of the expensive nature of the exact-exchange potential in real space. Compared to widely used Gaussian-type orbitals (GTO) basis sets, real space often offers easier implementation of equations and more systematic convergence of Rydberg states, as well as favorable scaling, effective domain parallelization, flexible boundary conditions, and ability to treat model systems. We implemented TDHF in the Octopus real-space code as a step toward linear-response hybrid time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT), other post-HF methods, and ensemble density-functional theory methods involving exact exchange. Calculation of HF's non-local exact exchange is very expensive in real space. We overcome this limitation with Octopus' implementation of Adaptively Compressed Exchange (ACE), and find the appropriate mixing scheme and starting point to complete the ground-state calculation in a practical amount of time, and thus enable TDHF. We compared our results to those from GTOs on a set of small molecules and confirmed close agreement of results, though with larger deviations than in the case of semi-local TDDFT. We find that convergence of TDHF demands a finer real-space grid than semi-local TDDFT. We also present the subtleties in benchmarking a real-space calculation against GTOs, relating to Rydberg and vacuum states.</description>

      <title>Theory of Molecular Emission Power Spectra. III. Non-Hermitian Interactions in Multichromophoric Systems Coupled with Polaritons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14569v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on our previous study [S. Wang $\textit{et al}$. J. Chem. Phys. $\textbf{153}$, 184102 (2020)], we generalize the theory of molecular emission power spectra (EPS) from one molecule to multichromophoric systems in the framework of macroscopic quantum electrodynamics. This generalized theory is applicable to ensembles of molecules, providing a comprehensive description of the molecular spontaneous emission spectrum in arbitrary inhomogeneous, dispersive, and absorbing media. In the far-field region, the analytical formula of EPS can be expressed as the product of a lineshape function (LF) and an electromagnetic environment factor (EEF). To demonstrate the polaritonic effect on multichromophoric systems, we simulate the LF and EEF for one to three molecules weakly coupled to surface plasmon polaritons above a silver surface. Our analytical expressions show that the peak broadening originates from not only the spontaneous emission rates but also the imaginary part of resonant dipole-dipole interactions (non-Hermitian interactions), which is associated with the superradiance of molecular aggregates, indicating that the superradiance rate can be controlled through an intermolecular distance and the design of dielectric environments. This study presents an alternative approach to directly analyze the hybrid-state dynamics of multichromophoric systems coupled with polaritons.</description>

      <title>Realistic ab initio predictions of excimer behavior under collective light-matter strong coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Experiments show that light-matter strong coupling affects chemical properties, though the underlying mechanism remains unclear. We present an ab initio quantum electrodynamics coupled cluster method for the collective strong coupling regime. The model accurately describes electronic and electron-photon correlation within a molecular subsystem, while a simplified description of the collective polaritonic excitations allows for realistic microscopic light-matter couplings. We illustrate the model by investigating the potential energy surfaces of the argon dimer. This provides a prototype for excimers, and we analyze the ground and excited state vibrational levels. In the collective regime (small light-matter coupling, large number of molecules), the ground state potential energy surface and the first vibrational levels of the excited state are not changed significantly. However, collective strong coupling produces an abrupt transition in the vibrational landscape of the excimer, causing higher levels to behave similarly to ground state vibrations. Beyond a critical collective coupling strength, the excimer formation is thus inhibited.</description>

      <title>Atomic evolution of hydrogen intercalation wave dynamics in palladium nanocrystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02416v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solute-intercalation-induced phase separation creates spatial heterogeneities in host materials, a phenomenon ubiquitous in batteries, hydrogen storage, and other energy devices. Despite many efforts, probing intercalation processes at the atomic scale has been a significant challenge. We study hydrogen (de)intercalation in palladium nanocrystals as a model system and achieve atomic-resolution imaging of hydrogen intercalation wave dynamics by utilizing liquid-phase transmission electron microscopy. Our observations reveal that intercalation wave mechanisms, instead of shrinking-core mechanisms, prevail at ambient temperature for palladium nanocubes ranging from ~60 nm down to ~10 nm. We uncover the atomic evolution of hydrogen intercalation wave transitioning from non-planar and inclined boundaries to those closely aligned with {100} planes. Our kinetic Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate the observed intercalation wave dynamics correspond to sorption pathways minimizing the lattice mismatch strain at the phase boundary. Unveiling the atomic intercalation pathways holds profound implications for engineering intercalation-mediated devices and advancements in energy sciences.</description>

      <title>A Review of Large Language Models and Autonomous Agents in Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01603v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools in chemistry, significantly impacting molecule design, property prediction, and synthesis optimization. This review highlights LLM capabilities in these domains and their potential to accelerate scientific discovery through automation. We also review LLM-based autonomous agents: LLMs with a broader set of tools to interact with their surrounding environment. These agents perform diverse tasks such as paper scraping, interfacing with automated laboratories, and synthesis planning. As agents are an emerging topic, we extend the scope of our review of agents beyond chemistry and discuss across any scientific domains. This review covers the recent history, current capabilities, and design of LLMs and autonomous agents, addressing specific challenges, opportunities, and future directions in chemistry. Key challenges include data quality and integration, model interpretability, and the need for standard benchmarks, while future directions point towards more sophisticated multi-modal agents and enhanced collaboration between agents and experimental methods. Due to the quick pace of this field, a repository has been built to keep track of the latest studies: https://github.com/ur-whitelab/LLMs-in-science.</description>
