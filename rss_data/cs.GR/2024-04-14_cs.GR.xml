      <title>AdaContour: Adaptive Contour Descriptor with Hierarchical Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing angle-based contour descriptors suffer from lossy representation for non-starconvex shapes. By and large, this is the result of the shape being registered with a single global inner center and a set of radii corresponding to a polar coordinate parameterization. In this paper, we propose AdaContour, an adaptive contour descriptor that uses multiple local representations to desirably characterize complex shapes. After hierarchically encoding object shapes in a training set and constructing a contour matrix of all subdivided regions, we compute a robust low-rank robust subspace and approximate each local contour by linearly combining the shared basis vectors to represent an object. Experiments show that AdaContour is able to represent shapes more accurately and robustly than other descriptors while retaining effectiveness. We validate AdaContour by integrating it into off-the-shelf detectors to enable instance segmentation which demonstrates faithful performance. The code is available at https://github.com/tding1/AdaContour.</description>

      <title>GPN: Generative Point-based NeRF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scanning real-life scenes with modern registration devices typically gives incomplete point cloud representations, primarily due to the limitations of partial scanning, 3D occlusions, and dynamic light conditions. Recent works on processing incomplete point clouds have always focused on point cloud completion. However, these approaches do not ensure consistency between the completed point cloud and the captured images regarding color and geometry. We propose using Generative Point-based NeRF (GPN) to reconstruct and repair a partial cloud by fully utilizing the scanning images and the corresponding reconstructed cloud. The repaired point cloud can achieve multi-view consistency with the captured images at high spatial resolution. For the finetunes of a single scene, we optimize the global latent condition by incorporating an Auto-Decoder architecture while retaining multi-view consistency. As a result, the generated point clouds are smooth, plausible, and geometrically consistent with the partial scanning images. Extensive experiments on ShapeNet demonstrate that our works achieve competitive performances to the other state-of-the-art point cloud-based neural scene rendering and editing performances.</description>

      <title>View-Consistent 3D Editing with Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11868v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advent of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has revolutionized 3D editing, offering efficient, high-fidelity rendering and enabling precise local manipulations. Currently, diffusion-based 2D editing models are harnessed to modify multi-view rendered images, which then guide the editing of 3DGS models. However, this approach faces a critical issue of multi-view inconsistency, where the guidance images exhibit significant discrepancies across views, leading to mode collapse and visual artifacts of 3DGS. To this end, we introduce View-consistent Editing (VcEdit), a novel framework that seamlessly incorporates 3DGS into image editing processes, ensuring multi-view consistency in edited guidance images and effectively mitigating mode collapse issues. VcEdit employs two innovative consistency modules: the Cross-attention Consistency Module and the Editing Consistency Module, both designed to reduce inconsistencies in edited images. By incorporating these consistency modules into an iterative pattern, VcEdit proficiently resolves the issue of multi-view inconsistency, facilitating high-quality 3DGS editing across a diverse range of scenes.</description>

      <title>Universal Humanoid Motion Representations for Physics-Based Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a universal motion representation that encompasses a comprehensive range of motor skills for physics-based humanoid control. Due to the high dimensionality of humanoids and the inherent difficulties in reinforcement learning, prior methods have focused on learning skill embeddings for a narrow range of movement styles (e.g. locomotion, game characters) from specialized motion datasets. This limited scope hampers their applicability in complex tasks. We close this gap by significantly increasing the coverage of our motion representation space. To achieve this, we first learn a motion imitator that can imitate all of human motion from a large, unstructured motion dataset. We then create our motion representation by distilling skills directly from the imitator. This is achieved by using an encoder-decoder structure with a variational information bottleneck. Additionally, we jointly learn a prior conditioned on proprioception (humanoid's own pose and velocities) to improve model expressiveness and sampling efficiency for downstream tasks. By sampling from the prior, we can generate long, stable, and diverse human motions. Using this latent space for hierarchical RL, we show that our policies solve tasks using human-like behavior. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our motion representation by solving generative tasks (e.g. strike, terrain traversal) and motion tracking using VR controllers.</description>

      <title>WonderJourney: Going from Anywhere to Everywhere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03884v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce WonderJourney, a modularized framework for perpetual 3D scene generation. Unlike prior work on view generation that focuses on a single type of scenes, we start at any user-provided location (by a text description or an image) and generate a journey through a long sequence of diverse yet coherently connected 3D scenes. We leverage an LLM to generate textual descriptions of the scenes in this journey, a text-driven point cloud generation pipeline to make a compelling and coherent sequence of 3D scenes, and a large VLM to verify the generated scenes. We show compelling, diverse visual results across various scene types and styles, forming imaginary "wonderjourneys". Project website: https://kovenyu.com/WonderJourney/</description>

      <title>SC-GS: Sparse-Controlled Gaussian Splatting for Editable Dynamic Scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14937v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Novel view synthesis for dynamic scenes is still a challenging problem in computer vision and graphics. Recently, Gaussian splatting has emerged as a robust technique to represent static scenes and enable high-quality and real-time novel view synthesis. Building upon this technique, we propose a new representation that explicitly decomposes the motion and appearance of dynamic scenes into sparse control points and dense Gaussians, respectively. Our key idea is to use sparse control points, significantly fewer in number than the Gaussians, to learn compact 6 DoF transformation bases, which can be locally interpolated through learned interpolation weights to yield the motion field of 3D Gaussians. We employ a deformation MLP to predict time-varying 6 DoF transformations for each control point, which reduces learning complexities, enhances learning abilities, and facilitates obtaining temporal and spatial coherent motion patterns. Then, we jointly learn the 3D Gaussians, the canonical space locations of control points, and the deformation MLP to reconstruct the appearance, geometry, and dynamics of 3D scenes. During learning, the location and number of control points are adaptively adjusted to accommodate varying motion complexities in different regions, and an ARAP loss following the principle of as rigid as possible is developed to enforce spatial continuity and local rigidity of learned motions. Finally, thanks to the explicit sparse motion representation and its decomposition from appearance, our method can enable user-controlled motion editing while retaining high-fidelity appearances. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing approaches on novel view synthesis with a high rendering speed and enables novel appearance-preserved motion editing applications.
