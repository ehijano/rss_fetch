      <title>Guided Masked Self-Distillation Modeling for Distributed Multimedia Sensor Event Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations with distributed sensors are essential in analyzing a series of human and machine activities (referred to as 'events' in this paper) in complex and extensive real-world environments. This is because the information obtained from a single sensor is often missing or fragmented in such an environment; observations from multiple locations and modalities should be integrated to analyze events comprehensively. However, a learning method has yet to be established to extract joint representations that effectively combine such distributed observations. Therefore, we propose Guided Masked sELf-Distillation modeling (Guided-MELD) for inter-sensor relationship modeling. The basic idea of Guided-MELD is to learn to supplement the information from the masked sensor with information from other sensors needed to detect the event. Guided-MELD is expected to enable the system to effectively distill the fragmented or redundant target event information obtained by the sensors without being overly dependent on any specific sensors. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in novel tasks of distributed multimedia sensor event analysis, we recorded two new datasets that fit the problem setting: MM-Store and MM-Office. These datasets consist of human activities in a convenience store and an office, recorded using distributed cameras and microphones. Experimental results on these datasets show that the proposed Guided-MELD improves event tagging and detection performance and outperforms conventional inter-sensor relationship modeling methods. Furthermore, the proposed method performed robustly even when sensors were reduced.</description>

      <title>Calibration &amp; Reconstruction: Deep Integrated Language for Referring Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Referring image segmentation aims to segment an object referred to by natural language expression from an image. The primary challenge lies in the efficient propagation of fine-grained semantic information from textual features to visual features. Many recent works utilize a Transformer to address this challenge. However, conventional transformer decoders can distort linguistic information with deeper layers, leading to suboptimal results. In this paper, we introduce CRFormer, a model that iteratively calibrates multi-modal features in the transformer decoder. We start by generating language queries using vision features, emphasizing different aspects of the input language. Then, we propose a novel Calibration Decoder (CDec) wherein the multi-modal features can iteratively calibrated by the input language features. In the Calibration Decoder, we use the output of each decoder layer and the original language features to generate new queries for continuous calibration, which gradually updates the language features. Based on CDec, we introduce a Language Reconstruction Module and a reconstruction loss. This module leverages queries from the final layer of the decoder to reconstruct the input language and compute the reconstruction loss. This can further prevent the language information from being lost or distorted. Our experiments consistently show the superior performance of our approach across RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and G-Ref datasets compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Safe-CLIP: Removing NSFW Concepts from Vision-and-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16254v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large-scale vision-and-language models, such as CLIP, are typically trained on web-scale data, which can introduce inappropriate content and lead to the development of unsafe and biased behavior. This, in turn, hampers their applicability in sensitive and trustworthy contexts and could raise significant concerns in their adoption. Our research introduces a novel approach to enhancing the safety of vision-and-language models by diminishing their sensitivity to NSFW (not safe for work) inputs. In particular, our methodology seeks to sever "toxic" linguistic and visual concepts, unlearning the linkage between unsafe linguistic or visual items and unsafe regions of the embedding space. We show how this can be done by fine-tuning a CLIP model on synthetic data obtained from a large language model trained to convert between safe and unsafe sentences, and a text-to-image generator. We conduct extensive experiments on the resulting embedding space for cross-modal retrieval, text-to-image, and image-to-text generation, where we show that our model can be remarkably employed with pre-trained generative models. Our source code and trained models are available at: https://github.com/aimagelab/safe-clip.</description>
