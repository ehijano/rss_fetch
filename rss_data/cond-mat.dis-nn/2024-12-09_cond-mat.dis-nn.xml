      <title>Dirac-Equation Signal Processing: Physics Boosts Topological Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological signals are variables or features associated with both nodes and edges of a network. Recently, in the context of Topological Machine Learning, great attention has been devoted to signal processing of such topological signals. Most of the previous topological signal processing algorithms treat node and edge signals separately and work under the hypothesis that the true signal is smooth and/or well approximated by a harmonic eigenvector of the Hodge-Laplacian, which may be violated in practice. Here we propose Dirac-equation signal processing, a framework for efficiently reconstructing true signals on nodes and edges, also if they are not smooth or harmonic, by processing them jointly. The proposed physics-inspired algorithm is based on the spectral properties of the topological Dirac operator. It leverages the mathematical structure of the topological Dirac equation to boost the performance of the signal processing algorithm. We discuss how the relativistic dispersion relation obeyed by the topological Dirac equation can be used to assess the quality of the signal reconstruction. Finally, we demonstrate the improved performance of the algorithm with respect to previous algorithms. Specifically, we show that Dirac-equation signal processing can also be used efficiently if the true signal is a non-trivial linear combination of more than one eigenstate of the Dirac equation, as it generally occurs for real signals.</description>

      <title>Thermal vestiges of avalanches in the driven random field Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.16268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the non-equilibrium behavior of the $3d$ random field Ising model at finite temperature, as an external field is increased through its coercive field. We show by numerical simulations that the phenomenology of avalanches -- which are sharply defined only at zero temperature -- also persists over a significant range of finite temperatures. We analyse the main differences between the thermal and zero-temperature systems, including an excess of small avalanches in the thermal case, whose behaviour is consistent with activated dynamical scaling. We also investigate the extent to which individual avalanches at finite temperature can be traced back to parent avalanches in the athermal system.</description>

      <title>Fully independent response in disordered solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unlike in crystals, it is difficult to trace emergent material properties of amorphous solids to their underlying structure. Nevertheless, one can tune features of a disordered spring network, ranging from bulk elastic constants to specific allosteric responses, through highly precise alterations of the structure. This has been understood through the notion of independent bond-level response -- the observation that in many cases, different springs have different effects on different properties. While this idea has motivated inverse design in numerous contexts, it has not been formalized and quantified in a general context that not just informs but enables and predicts inverse design. Here, we show how to quantify independent response by linearizing the simultaneous change in multiple emergent features, and introduce the much stronger notion of fully independent response. Remarkably, we find that the mechanical properties of disordered solids are always fully independent across a wide array of scenarios, regardless of the target features, tunable parameters, and details of particle-particle interactions. Furthermore, our formulation quantifies the susceptibility of feature changes to parameter changes, which we find to be correlated with the maximum linear tunability. These results formalize our understanding of a key fundamental difference between ordered and disordered solids while also creating a practical tool to both understand and perform inverse design.</description>

      <title>Real-space chirality from crystalline topological defects in the Kitaev spin liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that certain crystalline topological defects in the gapless Kitaev honeycomb spin liquid model generate a chirality that depends in a universal manner on their emergent flux. Focusing on 5-7 dislocations as building blocks, consisting of pentagon and heptagon disclinations, we identify the Kitaev bond label configurations that preserve solvability. By defining and computing multiple formulations of local Chern markers we find that the 5 and 7 lattice defects host a contribution to real-space chirality, which we dub "Chern charge" or $\mathcal{Q_M}$. The sign of this local Chern charge obeys $\text{sgn}({\mathcal{Q_M}}) = - i ~ \text{sgn}(F) W$ where $F$ is the disclination Frank angle and $W = \pm i$ is its emergent-gauge-field flux. We show that lattice curvature and torsion can interplay with the surrounding gapless background to modify the $\mathcal{Q_M}$ profile and magnitude, but that the sign of $\mathcal{Q_M}$ is set by local properties of the defect, enabling the identification of Chern charges.</description>

      <title>Comparing the effects of Boltzmann machines as associative memory in Generative Adversarial Networks between classical and quantum sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.15220v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum effect on machine learning (ML) models exemplified by the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), which is a promising deep learning framework. In the general GAN framework the generator maps uniform noise to a fake image. In this study, we utilize the Associative Adversarial Network (AAN), which consists of a standard GAN and an associative memory. Further, we set a Boltzmann Machine (BM), which is an undirected graphical model that learns low-dimensional features extracted from a discriminator, as the memory. Owing to difficulty calculating the BM's log-likelihood gradient, it is necessary to approximate it by using the sample mean obtained from the BM, which has tentative parameters. To calculate the sample mean, a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is often used. In a previous study, this was performed using a quantum annealer device, and the performance of the "Quantum" AAN was compared to that of the standard GAN. However, its better performance than the standard GAN is not well understood. In this study, we introduce two methods to draw samples: classical sampling via MCMC and quantum sampling via quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulation, which is quantum simulation on the classical computer. Then, we compare these methods to investigate whether quantum sampling is advantageous. Specifically, calculating the discriminator loss, the generator loss, inception score and Fr\'echet inception distance, we discuss the possibility of AAN. We show that the AANs trained by both MCMC and QMC are more stable during training and produce more varied images than the standard GANs. However, the results indicate no difference in sampling by QMC simulation compared to that by MCMC.</description>

      <title>The Fock-space landscape of many-body localisation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12685v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article reviews recent progress in understanding the physics of many-body localisation (MBL) in disordered and interacting quantum many-body systems, from the perspective of ergodicity breaking on the associated Fock space. This approach to MBL is underpinned by mapping the dynamics of the many-body system onto that of a fictitious single particle on the high-dimensional, correlated and disordered Fock-space graph; yet, as we elaborate, the problem is fundamentally different from that of conventional Anderson localisation on high-dimensional or hierarchical graphs. We discuss in detail the nature of eigenstate correlations on the Fock space, both static and dynamic, and in the ergodic and many-body localised phases as well as in the vicinity of the MBL transition. The latter in turn sheds light on the nature of the transition, and motivates a scaling theory for it in terms of Fock-space based quantities. We also illustrate how these quantities can be concretely connected to real-space observables. An overview is given of several analytical and numerical techniques which have proven important in developing a comprehensive picture. Finally, we comment on some open questions in the field of MBL where the Fock-space approach is likely to prove insightful.</description>

      <title>What can we learn from quantum convolutional neural networks?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16664v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) shows promise for analyzing quantum data. A notable example is the use of quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs), implemented as specific types of quantum circuits, to recognize phases of matter. In this approach, ground states of many-body Hamiltonians are prepared to form a quantum dataset and classified in a supervised manner using only a few labeled examples. However, this type of dataset and model differs fundamentally from typical QML paradigms based on feature maps and parameterized circuits. In this study, we demonstrate how models utilizing quantum data can be interpreted through hidden feature maps, where physical features are implicitly embedded via ground-state feature maps. By analyzing selected examples previously explored with QCNNs, we show that high performance in quantum phase recognition comes from generating a highly effective basis set with sharp features at critical points. The learning process adapts the measurement to create sharp decision boundaries. Our analysis highlights improved generalization when working with quantum data, particularly in the limited-shots regime. Furthermore, translating these insights into the domain of quantum scientific machine learning, we demonstrate that ground-state feature maps can be applied to fluid dynamics problems, expressing shock wave solutions with good generalization and proven trainability.</description>

      <title>Ground state-based quantum feature maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07174v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a quantum data embedding protocol based on the preparation of a ground state of a parameterized Hamiltonian. We analyze the corresponding quantum feature map, recasting it as an adiabatic state preparation procedure with Trotterized evolution. We compare the properties of underlying quantum models with ubiquitous Fourier-type quantum models, and show that ground state embeddings can be described effectively by a spectrum with degree that grows rapidly with the number of qubits, corresponding to a large model capacity. We observe that the spectrum contains massive frequency degeneracies, and the weighting coefficients for the modes are highly structured, thus limiting model expressivity. Our results provide a step towards understanding models based on quantum data, and contribute to fundamental knowledge needed for building efficient quantum machine learning (QML) protocols. As non-trivial embeddings are crucial for designing QML protocols that cannot be simulated classically, our findings guide the search for high-capacity quantum models that can largely outperform classical models.</description>

      <title>Stark localization near Aubry-Andr\'e criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14971v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the Stark localization near the Aubry-Andr\'{e} (AA) critical point. We perform careful studies for reporting system-dependent parameters, such as localization length, inverse participation ratio (IPR), and energy gap between the ground and first excited state, for characterizing the localization-delocalization transition. We show that the scaling exponents possessed by these key descriptors of localization are quite different from that of a pure AA model or Stark model. Near the critical point of the AA model, in the presence of Stark field of strength $h$, the localization length $\zeta$ scales as $\zeta\propto h^{-\nu}$ with $\nu\approx0.29$ which is different than both the pure AA model ($\nu=1$) and Stark model ($\nu\approx0.33$). The IPR in this case scales as IPR $\propto h^{s}$ with $s\approx0.096$ which is again significantly different than both the pure AA model ($s\approx0.33$) and Stark model ($s\approx0.33$). The energy gap, $\Delta$, scales as $E\propto h^{\nu z}$, where $z\approx2.37$ which is however same as the pure AA model. Finally, we discuss how invoking a criticality inducing additional control parameter may help in designing better many-body quantum sensors. Quantum critical sensors exploit the venerability of the wavefunction near the quantum critical point against small parameter shifts. By incorporating a control parameter in the form of the quasi-periodic field, i.e., the AA potential, we show a significant advantage can be drawn in estimating an unknown parameter, which is considered here to be the Stark weak field strength, with high precision.</description>
