      <title>On Design of Representative Distributionally Robust Formulations for Evaluation of Tail Risk Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) is a risk measure widely used to quantify the impact of extreme losses. Owing to the lack of representative samples CVaR is sensitive to the tails of the underlying distribution. In order to combat this sensitivity, Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO), which evaluates the worst-case CVaR measure over a set of plausible data distributions is often deployed. Unfortunately, an improper choice of the DRO formulation can lead to a severe underestimation of tail risk. This paper aims at leveraging extreme value theory to arrive at a DRO formulation which leads to representative worst-case CVaR evaluations in that the above pitfall is avoided while simultaneously, the worst case evaluation is not a gross over-estimate of the true CVaR. We demonstrate theoretically that even when there is paucity of samples in the tail of the distribution, our formulation is readily implementable from data, only requiring calibration of a single scalar parameter. We showcase that our formulation can be easily extended to provide robustness to tail risk in multivariate applications as well as in the evaluation of other commonly used risk measures. Numerical illustrations on synthetic and real-world data showcase the practical utility of our approach.</description>

      <title>Correlation and Beyond: Positive Definite Dependence Measures for Robust Inference, Flexible Scenarios, and Stress Testing for Financial Portfolios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15268v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We live in a multivariate world, and effective modeling of financial portfolios, including their construction, allocation, forecasting, and risk analysis, simply is not possible without explicitly modeling the dependence structure of their assets. Dependence structure can drive portfolio results more than the combined effects of other parameters in investment and risk models, but the literature provides relatively little to define the finite-sample distributions of dependence measures in useable and useful ways under challenging, real-world financial data conditions. Yet this is exactly what is needed to make valid inferences about their estimates, and to use these inferences for essential purposes such as hypothesis testing, dynamic monitoring, realistic and granular scenario and reverse scenario analyses, and mitigating the effects of correlation breakdowns during market upheavals. This work develops a new and straightforward method, Nonparametric Angles-based Correlation (NAbC), for defining the finite-sample distributions of any dependence measure whose matrix of pairwise associations is positive definite (e.g. Pearsons, Kendalls, Spearmans, Tail Dependence Matrix, and others). The solution remains valid under marginal asset distributions characterized by notably different and varying degrees of serial correlation, non-stationarity, heavy-tailedness, and asymmetry. Importantly, NAbCs p-values and confidence intervals remain analytically consistent at both the matrix level and the pairwise cell level. Finally, NAbC maintains validity even when selected cells in the matrix are frozen for a given scenario or stress test, thus enabling flexible, granular, and realistic scenarios. NAbC stands alone in providing all of these capabilities simultaneously, and should prove to be a very useful means by which we can better understand and manage financial portfolios in our multivariate world.</description>

      <title>Optimal sharing, equilibria, and welfare without risk aversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03328v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper examines optimal risk sharing for empirically realistic risk attitudes, providing results on Pareto optimality, competitive equilibria, utility frontiers, and the first and second theorems of welfare. Empirical studies suggest, contrary to classical assumptions, that risk seeking is prevalent in particular subdomains, and is even the majority finding for losses, underlying for instance the disposition effect. We first analyze cases of expected utility agents, some of whom may be risk seeking. Yet more empirical realism is obtained by allowing agents to be risk averse in some subdomains but risk seeking in others, which requires generalizing expected utility. Here we provide first results, pleading for future research. Our main new tool for analyzing generalized risk attitudes is a counter-monotonic improvement theorem.</description>
