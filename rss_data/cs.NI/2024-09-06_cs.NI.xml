      <title>VECA: Reliable and Confidential Resource Clustering for Volunteer Edge-Cloud Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Volunteer Edge-Cloud (VEC) computing has a significant potential to support scientific workflows in user communities contributing volunteer edge nodes. However, managing heterogeneous and intermittent resources to support machine/deep learning (ML/DL) based workflows poses challenges in resource governance for reliability, and confidentiality for model/data privacy protection. There is a need for approaches to handle the volatility of volunteer edge node availability, and also to scale the confidential data-intensive workflow execution across a large number of VEC nodes. In this paper, we present VECA, a reliable and confidential VEC resource clustering solution featuring three-fold methods tailored for executing ML/DL-based scientific workflows on VEC resources. Firstly, a capacity-based clustering approach enhances system reliability and minimizes VEC node search latency. Secondly, a novel two-phase, globally distributed scheduling scheme optimizes job allocation based on node attributes and using time-series-based Recurrent Neural Networks. Lastly, the integration of confidential computing ensures privacy preservation of the scientific workflows, where model and data information are not shared with VEC resources providers. We evaluate VECA in a Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) cloud testbed that features OpenFaaS and MicroK8S to support two ML/DL-based scientific workflows viz., G2P-Deep (bioinformatics) and PAS-ML (health informatics). Results from tested experiments demonstrate that our proposed VECA approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods; especially VECA exhibits a two-fold reduction in VEC node search latency and over 20% improvement in productivity rates following execution failures compared to the next best method.</description>

      <title>What is Normal? A Big Data Observational Science Model of Anonymized Internet Traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding what is normal is a key aspect of protecting a domain. Other domains invest heavily in observational science to develop models of normal behavior to better detect anomalies. Recent advances in high performance graph libraries, such as the GraphBLAS, coupled with supercomputers enables processing of the trillions of observations required. We leverage this approach to synthesize low-parameter observational models of anonymized Internet traffic with a high regard for privacy.</description>

      <title>VQ-DeepVSC: A Dual-Stage Vector Quantization Framework for Video Semantic Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In response to the rapid growth of global videomtraffic and the limitations of traditional wireless transmission systems, we propose a novel dual-stage vector quantization framework, VQ-DeepVSC, tailored to enhance video transmission over wireless channels. In the first stage, we design the adaptive keyframe extractor and interpolator, deployed respectively at the transmitter and receiver, which intelligently select key frames to minimize inter-frame redundancy and mitigate the cliff-effect under challenging channel conditions. In the second stage, we propose the semantic vector quantization encoder and decoder, placed respectively at the transmitter and receiver, which efficiently compress key frames using advanced indexing and spatial normalization modules to reduce redundancy. Additionally, we propose adjustable index selection and recovery modules, enhancing compression efficiency and enabling flexible compression ratio adjustment. Compared to the joint source-channel coding (JSCC) framework, the proposed framework exhibits superior compatibility with current digital communication systems. Experimental results demonstrate that VQ-DeepVSC achieves substantial improvements in both Multi-Scale Structural Similarity (MS-SSIM) and Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) metrics than the H.265 standard, particularly under low channel signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) or multi-path channels, highlighting the significantly enhanced transmission capabilities of our approach.</description>

      <title>Towards Autonomous Cybersecurity: An Intelligent AutoML Framework for Autonomous Intrusion Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of mobile networks from 5G to 6G has necessitated the development of autonomous network management systems, such as Zero-Touch Networks (ZTNs). However, the increased complexity and automation of these networks have also escalated cybersecurity risks. Existing Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) leveraging traditional Machine Learning (ML) techniques have shown effectiveness in mitigating these risks, but they often require extensive manual effort and expert knowledge. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an Automated Machine Learning (AutoML)-based autonomous IDS framework towards achieving autonomous cybersecurity for next-generation networks. To achieve autonomous intrusion detection, the proposed AutoML framework automates all critical procedures of the data analytics pipeline, including data pre-processing, feature engineering, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and model ensemble. Specifically, it utilizes a Tabular Variational Auto-Encoder (TVAE) method for automated data balancing, tree-based ML models for automated feature selection and base model learning, Bayesian Optimization (BO) for hyperparameter optimization, and a novel Optimized Confidence-based Stacking Ensemble (OCSE) method for automated model ensemble. The proposed AutoML-based IDS was evaluated on two public benchmark network security datasets, CICIDS2017 and 5G-NIDD, and demonstrated improved performance compared to state-of-the-art cybersecurity methods. This research marks a significant step towards fully autonomous cybersecurity in next-generation networks, potentially revolutionizing network security applications.</description>

      <title>Hemispherical Antenna Array Architecture for High-Altitude Platform Stations (HAPS) for Uniform Capacity Provision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel hemispherical antenna array (HAA) designed for high-altitude platform stations (HAPS). A significant limitation of traditional rectangular antenna arrays for HAPS is that their antenna elements are oriented downward, resulting in low gains for distant users. Cylindrical antenna arrays were introduced to mitigate this drawback; however, their antenna elements face the horizon leading to suboptimal gains for users located beneath the HAPS. To address these challenges, in this study, we introduce our HAA. An HAA's antenna elements are strategically distributed across the surface of a hemisphere to ensure that each user is directly aligned with specific antenna elements. To maximize users minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), we formulate an optimization problem. After performing analog beamforming, we introduce an antenna selection algorithm and show that this method achieves optimality when a substantial number of antenna elements are selected for each user. Additionally, we employ the bisection method to determine the optimal power allocation for each user. Our simulation results convincingly demonstrate that the proposed HAA outperforms the conventional arrays, and provides uniform rates across the entire coverage area. With a $20~\mathrm{MHz}$ communication bandwidth, and a $50~\mathrm{dBm}$ total power, the proposed approach reaches sum rates of $14~\mathrm{Gbps}$.</description>

      <title>Ising Machines' Dynamics and Regularization for Near-Optimal Large and Massive MIMO Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.10535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.10535v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimal MIMO detection has been one of the most challenging and computationally inefficient tasks in wireless systems. We show that the new analog computing techniques like Coherent Ising Machines (CIM) are promising candidates for performing near-optimal MIMO detection. We propose a novel regularized Ising formulation for MIMO detection that mitigates a common error floor problem and further evolves it into an algorithm that achieves near-optimal MIMO detection. Massive MIMO systems, that have a large number of antennas at the Access point (AP), allow linear detectors to be near-optimal. However, the simplified detection in these systems comes at the cost of overall throughput, which could be improved by supporting more users. By means of numerical simulations, we show that in principle a MIMO detector based on a hybrid use of a CIM would allow us to add more transmitter antennas/users and increase the overall throughput of the cell by a significant factor. This would open up the opportunity to operate using more aggressive modulation and coding schemes and hence achieve high throughput: for a $16\times16$ large MIMO system, we estimate around 2.5$\times$ more throughput in mid-SNR regime ($\approx 12 dB$) and 2$\times$ more throughput in high-SNR regime( $&gt;$ 20dB) than the industry standard, Minimum-Mean Square Error decoding (MMSE).</description>

      <title>Uplink MIMO Detection using Ising Machines: A Multi-Stage Ising Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.12830v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output~(MIMO) signal detection is central to every state-of-the-art communication system, and enhancements in error performance and computation complexity of MIMO detection would significantly enhance data rate and latency experienced by the users. Theoretically, the optimal MIMO detector is the maximum-likelihood (ML) MIMO detector; however, due to its extremely high complexity, it is not feasible for large real-world communication systems. Over the past few years, algorithms based on physics-inspired Ising solvers, like Coherent Ising machines and Quantum Annealers, have shown significant performance improvements for the MIMO detection problem. However, the current state-of-the-art is limited to low-order modulations or systems with few users. In this paper, we propose an adaptive multi-stage Ising machine-based MIMO detector that extends the performance gains of physics-inspired computation to Large and Massive MIMO systems with a large number of users and very high modulation schemes~(up to 256-QAM). We enhance our previously proposed delta Ising formulation and develop a heuristic that adaptively optimizes the performance and complexity of our proposed method. We perform extensive micro-benchmarking to optimize several free parameters of the system and evaluate our methods' BER and spectral efficiency for Large and Massive MIMO systems (up to 32 users and 256 QAM modulation).</description>

      <title>Energy performance of LR-FHSS: analysis and evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Long-range frequency hopping spread spectrum (LR-FHSS) is a pivotal advancement in the LoRaWAN protocol that is designed to enhance the network's capacity and robustness, particularly in densely populated environments. Although energy consumption is paramount in LoRaWAN-based end devices, {this is the first study} in the literature, to our knowledge, that models the impact of this novel mechanism on energy consumption. In this article, we provide a comprehensive energy consumption analytical model of LR-FHSS, focusing on three critical metrics: average current consumption, battery lifetime, and energy efficiency of data transmission. The model is based on measurements performed on real hardware in a fully operational LR-FHSS network. While in our evaluation, LR-FHSS can show worse consumption figures than LoRa, we find that with optimal configuration, the battery lifetime of LR-FHSS end devices can reach 2.5 years for a 50 min notification period. For the most energy-efficient payload size, this lifespan can be extended to a theoretical maximum of up to 16 years with a one-day notification interval using a cell-coin battery.</description>
