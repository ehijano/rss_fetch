      <title>Mapping the Future of Human Digital Twin Adoption in Job-Shop Industries: A Strategic Prioritization Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although Digital Twin is actively deployed in manufacturing, its human-centric counterpart - Human Digital Twin (HDT) is understudied, especially in job-shop production with high task variability and manual labor. HDT applications like ergonomic posture monitoring, fatigue prediction and health-based task assignment offer benefits to industries in emerging economies. However, poor digital maturity, lack of awareness and doubts about use-case applicability hinder adoption. This study provides a strategic prioritization framework to aid human-centric digital evolution in labor-intensive industries for guiding the selection of HDT applications delivering the highest value with the lowest implementation threshold. An integrated Fuzzy AHP-TOPSIS approach evaluates the use-cases based on criteria like implementation cost, technological maturity, scalability. These criteria and use-cases were identified based on input from a five-member expert panel and verified for consistency (CR &lt; 0.1). Analysis shows posture monitoring and fatigue prediction as most influential and practicable, especially in semi-digital environments. Strengths include compliance with Industry 5.0 principles incorporating technology and human factors. Lack of field validation and subjective knowledge pose drawbacks. Future work should include simulation-based validation and pilot tests on real job-shop settings. Ultimately, the research offers a decision-support system helping industries balance innovativeness and practicability in early stage of HDT adoption.</description>

      <title>An Exterior-Embedding Neural Operator Framework for Preserving Conservation Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural operators have demonstrated considerable effectiveness in accelerating the solution of time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) by directly learning governing physical laws from data. However, for PDEs governed by conservation laws(e.g., conservation of mass, energy, or matter), existing neural operators fail to satisfy conservation properties, which leads to degraded model performance and limited generalizability. Moreover, we observe that distinct PDE problems generally require different optimal neural network architectures. This finding underscores the inherent limitations of specialized models in generalizing across diverse problem domains.
  To address these limitations, we propose Exterior-Embedded Conservation Framework (ECF), a universal conserving framework that can be integrated with various data-driven neural operators to enforce conservation laws strictly in predictions. The framework consists of two key components: a conservation quantity encoder that extracts conserved quantities from input data, and a conservation quantity decoder that adjusts the neural operator's predictions using these quantities to ensure strict conservation compliance in the final output. Since our architecture enforces conservation laws, we theoretically prove that it enhances model performance. To validate the performance of our method, we conduct experiments on multiple conservation-law-constrained PDE scenarios, including adiabatic systems, shallow water equations, and the Allen-Cahn problem. These baselines demonstrate that our method effectively improves model accuracy while strictly enforcing conservation laws in the predictions.</description>
