      <title>Analytical Correlation in the H$_{2}$ Molecule from the Independent Atom Ansatz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The independent atom ansatz of density functional theory yields an accurate analytical expression for dynamic correlation energy in the H$_{2}$ molecule: $E_{c} = 0.5(1 - \sqrt{2})(ab|ba)$ for the atom-additive self-consistent density $\rho = |a|^{2} + |b|^{2}$. Combined with exact atomic self-exchange, it recovers more than 99.5 % of nearly exact SCAN exchange-correlation energy at R &gt; 0.5 $\r{A}$, differing by less than 0.12 eV. The total energy functional correctly dissociates the H-H bond and yields absolute errors of 0.002 $\r{A}$, 0.19 eV, and 13 cm$^{-1}$ relative to experiment at the tight binding computational cost. The chemical bond formation is attributed to the asymptotic Heitler-London resonance of quasi-orthogonal atomic states ($- (ab|ba)$) with no contributions from kinetic energy or charge accumulation in the bond.</description>

      <title>The Singlet-Triplet Gap of Cyclobutadiene: The CIPSI-Driven CC($P$;$Q$) Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An accurate determination of singlet-triplet gaps in biradicals, including cyclobutadiene in the automerization barrier region where one has to balance the substantial nondynamical many-electron correlation effects characterizing the singlet ground state with the predominantly dynamical correlations of the lowest-energy triplet, remains a challenge for many quantum chemistry methods. High-level coupled-cluster (CC) approaches, such as the CC method with a full treatment of singly, doubly, and triply excited clusters (CCSDT), are often capable of providing reliable results, but the routine application of such methods is hindered by their high computational costs. We have recently proposed a practical alternative to converging the CCSDT energetics at small fractions of the computational effort, even when electron correlations become stronger and connected triply excited clusters are larger and nonperturbative, by merging the CC($P$;$Q$) moment expansions with the selected configuration interaction methodology abbreviated as CIPSI. We demonstrate that one can accurately approximate the highly accurate CCSDT potential surfaces characterizing the lowest singlet and triplet states of cyclobutadiene along the automerization coordinate and the gap between them using tiny fractions of triply excited cluster amplitudes identified with the help of relatively inexpensive CIPSI Hamiltonian diagonalizations.</description>

      <title>Renormalized Internally-Contracted Multireference Coupled Cluster with Perturbative Triples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we combine the many-body formulation of the internally contracted multireference coupled cluster (ic-MRCC) method with Evangelista's multireference formulation of the driven similarity renormalization group (DSRG). The DSRG method can be viewed as a unitary multireference coupled cluster theory, which renormalizes the amplitudes based on a flow equation approach to eliminate numerical instabilities. We extend this approach by demonstrating that the unitary flow equation approach can be adapted for nonunitary transformations, rationalizing the renormalization of ic-MRCC amplitudes. We denote the new approach, the renormalized ic-MRCC (ric-MRCC) method. To achieve high accuracy with a reasonable computational cost, we introduce a new approximation to the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion. We fully consider the linear commutator while approximating the quadratic commutator, for which we neglect specific contractions involving amplitudes with active indices. Moreover, we introduce approximate perturbative triples to obtain the ric-MRCCSD[T] method. We demonstrate the accuracy of our approaches in comparison to advanced multireference methods for the potential energy curves of H8, F2, H2O, N2, and Cr2. Additionally, we show that ric-MRCCSD and ric-MRCSSD[T] match the accuracy of CCSD(T) for evaluating spectroscopic constants and of full configuration interaction energies for a set of small molecules.</description>

      <title>Stochastically accelerated perturbative triples correction in coupled cluster calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel algorithm that leverages stochastic sampling techniques to compute the perturbative triples correction in the coupled-cluster (CC) framework. By combining elements of randomness and determinism, our algorithm achieves a favorable balance between accuracy and computational cost. The main advantage of this algorithm is that it allows for the calculation to be stopped at any time, providing an unbiased estimate, with a statistical error that goes to zero as the exact calculation is approached. We provide evidence that our semi-stochastic algorithm achieves substantial computational savings compared to traditional deterministic methods. Specifically, we demonstrate that a precision of 0.5 millihartree can be attained with only 10\% of the computational effort required by the full calculation. This work opens up new avenues for efficient and accurate computations, enabling investigations of complex molecular systems that were previously computationally prohibitive.</description>

      <title>An improved penalty-based excited-state variational Monte Carlo approach with deep-learning ansatzes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce several improvements to the penalty-based variational quantum Monte Carlo (VMC) algorithm for computing electronic excited states, and demonstrate that the accuracy of the updated method is competitive with other available excited-state VMC approaches. A theoretical comparison of the computational aspects of these algorithms is presented, where several benefits of the penalty-based method are identified. Our main contributions include an automatic mechanism for tuning the scale of the penalty terms, an updated form of the overlap penalty with proven convergence properties, and a new term that penalizes the spin of the wave function, enabling the selective computation of states with a given spin. With these improvements, along with the use of the latest self-attention-based ansatz, the penalty-based method achieves a mean absolute error below 1 kcal/mol for the vertical excitation energies of a set of 26 atoms and molecules, without relying on variance matching schemes. Considering excited states along the dissociation of the carbon dimer, the accuracy of the penalty-based method is on par with that of natural-excited-state (NES) VMC, while also providing results for larger sections of the potential energy surface. Additionally, the accuracy of the original penalty-based method is improved for a conical intersection of ethylene, with the predicted angle of the intersection agreeing well with both NES-VMC and multi-reference configuration interaction.</description>

      <title>Do Molecular Geometries Change Under Vibrational Strong Coupling?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As pioneering experiments have shown, strong vibrational coupling between molecular vibrations and light modes in an optical cavity can significantly alter molecular properties and even affect chemical reactivity. However, the current theoretical description is limited and far from complete. To explore the origin of this exciting observation, we investigate how the molecular structure changes under strong light-matter coupling using an ab-initio method based on the cavity Born-Oppenheimer Hartree-Fock ansatz. By optimizing H$_2$O and H$_2$O$_2$ resonantly coupled to cavity modes, we study the importance of reorientation and geometric relaxation. In addition, we show that the inclusion of one or two cavity modes can change the observed results. On the basis of our findings, we derive a simple concept to estimate the effect of the cavity interaction on the molecular geometry using the molecular polarizability and the dipole moments.</description>

      <title>Dissociation and isomerization following ionization of ethylene: insights from non-adiabatic dynamics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photoionized and electronically excited ethylene \ce{C2H4+} can undergo \ce{H}-loss, \ce{H2}-loss, and ethylene-ethylidene isomerization, where the latter entails a hydrogen migration. Recent pioneering experiments with few-femtosecond extreme ultraviolet pulses and complementary theoretical studies have shed light on the photodynamics of this prototypical organic cation. However, no theoretical investigation based on dynamics simulations reported to date has described the mechanisms and time scales of dissociation and isomerization. Herein, we simulate the coupled electron-nuclear dynamics of ethylene following vertical ionization and electronic excitation to its four lowest-lying cationic states. The electronic structure is treated at the CASSCF level, with an active space large enough to describe bond breaking and formation. The simulations indicate that dissociation and isomerization take place mainly on the cationic ground state and allow the probing of previous hypotheses concerning the correlation between the photochemical outcome and the traversed conical intersections. The results, moreover, support the long-standing view that \ce{H2}-loss may occur from the ethylidene form. However, the ethylene-ethylidene isomerization time predicted by the simulations is considerably longer than those previously inferred from indirect experimental measurements.</description>

      <title>Which Electronic Structure Method to Choose in Trajectory Surface Hopping Dynamics Simulations? Azomethane as a Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-adiabatic dynamics simulations have become a standard approach to explore photochemical reactions. Such simulations require underlying potential energy surfaces and couplings between them, calculated at a chosen level of theory, yet this aspect is rarely assessed. Here, in combination with the popular trajectory surface hopping dynamics method, we use a high-accuracy XMS-CASPT2 electronic structure level as a benchmark for assessing the performances of various post-Hartree-Fock methods (namely CIS, ADC(2), CC2 and CASSCF) and exchange-correlation functionals (PBE, PBE0, CAM-B3LYP) in a TD-DFT/TDA context, using the isomerization around a double bond as test case. Different relaxation pathways are identified, and the ability of the different methods to reproduce their relative importance and timescale is discussed. The results show that multi-reference electronic structure methods should be preferred, when studying non-adiabatic decay between excited and ground states. If not affordable, TD-DFT with TDA and hybrid functionals, and ADC(2) are efficient alternative, but overestimate the non-radiative decay yield and thus may miss deexcitation pathways.</description>

      <title>Simulating Attochemistry: Which Dynamics Method to Use?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attochemistry aims to exploit the properties of coherent electronic wavepackets excited via attosecond pulses, to control the formation of photoproducts. Such molecular processes can in principle be simulated with various nonadiabatic dynamics methods, yet the impact of the approximations underlying the methods is rarely assessed. The performances of widely used mixed quantum-classical approaches, the Tully surface hopping, and classical Ehrenfest methods are evaluated against the high-accuracy DD-vMCG quantum dynamics. This comparison is conducted on the valence ionization of fluorobenzene. Analyzing the nuclear motion induced in the branching space of the nearby conical intersection, the results show that the mixed quantum-classical methods reproduce quantitatively the average motion of a quantum wavepacket when initiated on a single electronic state. However, they fail to properly capture the nuclear motion induced by an electronic wavepacket along the derivative coupling, the latter originating from the quantum electronic coherence property -- key to attochemistry.</description>

      <title>Arbitrage equilibria in active matter systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The motility-induced phase separation (MIPS) phenomenon in active matter has been of great interest for the past decade or so. A central conceptual puzzle is that this behavior, which is generally characterized as a nonequilibrium phenomenon, can yet be explained using simple equilibrium models of thermodynamics. Here, we address this problem using a new theory, statistical teleodynamics, which is a conceptual synthesis of game theory and statistical mechanics. In this framework, active agents compete in their pursuit of maximum effective utility, and this self-organizing dynamics results in an arbitrage equilibrium in which all agents have the same effective utility. We show that MIPS is an example of arbitrage equilibrium and that it is mathematically equivalent to other phase-separation phenomena in entirely different domains, such as sociology and economics. As examples, we present the behavior of Janus particles in a potential trap and the effect of chemotaxis on MIPS.</description>

      <title>On the Definition of Velocity in Discrete-Time, Stochastic Langevin Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We systematically develop beneficial and practical velocity measures for accurate and efficient statistical simulations of the Langevin equation, with direct applications to computational statistical mechanics and molecular dynamics sampling. Recognizing that the existing velocity measures for the most statistically accurate discrete-time Verlet-type algorithms are inconsistent with the simulated configurational coordinate, we seek to create new velocity companions that both improve existing methods as well as offer practical options for implementation in existing computer codes. The work is based on the set of GJ methods that, of all methods, correctly reproduces the most basic statistical features of a Langevin system; namely correct Boltzmann distribution for harmonic potentials and correct transport in the form of drift and diffusion for linear potentials. Several new accompanying velocities exhibiting correct drift are identified, and we expand on an earlier conclusion that only half-step velocities can exhibit correct, time-step independent Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions. Specific practical and efficient algorithms are given in familiar forms, and these are used to numerically validate the analytically derived expectations.</description>

      <title>Classical and quantum thermodynamics described as a system-bath model: The dimensionless minimum work principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate a thermodynamic theory applicable to both classical and quantum systems. These systems are depicted as thermodynamic system-bath models capable of handling isothermal, isentropic, thermostatic, and entropic processes. Our approach is based on the use of a dimensionless thermodynamic potential expressed as a function of the intensive and extensive thermodynamic variables. Using the principles of dimensionless minimum work and dimensionless maximum entropy derived from quasi-static changes of external perturbations and temperature, we obtain the Massieu-Planck potentials as entropic potentials and the Helmholtz-Gibbs potentials as free energy. These potentials can be interconverted through time-dependent Legendre transformations. Our results are verified numerically for an anharmonic Brownian system described in phase space using the low-temperature quantum Fokker-Planck equations in the quantum case and the Kramers equation in the classical case, both developed for the thermodynamic system-bath model. Thus, we clarify the conditions for thermodynamics to be valid even for small systems described by Hamiltonians and establish a basis for extending thermodynamics to non-equilibrium conditions.</description>

      <title>Superionic surface Li-ion transport in carbonaceous materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unlike Li-ion transport in the bulk of carbonaceous materials, little is known about Li-ion diffusion on their surface. In this study, we have discovered an ultra-fast Li-ion transport phenomenon on the surface of carbonaceous materials, particularly when they have limited Li insertion capacity along with a high surface area. This is exemplified by a carbon black, Ketjen Black (KB). An ionic conductivity of 18.1 mS cm-1 at room temperature is observed, far exceeding most solid-state ion conductors. Theoretical calculations reveal a low diffusion barrier for the surface Li species. The species is also identified as Li*, which features a partial positive charge. As a result, lithiated KB functions effectively as an interlayer between Li and solid-state electrolytes (SSE) to mitigate dendrite growth and cell shorting. This function is found to be electrolyte agnostic, effective for both sulfide and halide SSEs. Further, lithiated KB can act as a high-performance mixed ion/electron conductor that is thermodynamically stable at potentials near Li metal. A graphite anode mixed with KB instead of a solid electrolyte demonstrates full utilization with a capacity retention of ~85% over 300 cycles. The discovery of this surface-mediated ultra-fast Li-ion transport mechanism provides new directions for the design of solid-state ion conductors and solid-state batteries.</description>

      <title>Effect of Halogen Substituents on Charge Transport Properties of n-type Organic Semiconductors: A Theoretical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Organic semiconductors (OSCs) have received much attention as promising materials for electronic devices. In this study, we investigate the impact of halogen groups on the charge transport properties of n-type OSC-6,13 bis ((triisopropylsilyl) ethynyl)-5,7,12,14-tetraazapentacene (TIPS-TAP). The computed mobilities for TAPs substituted with F and Cl exhibit excellent agreement with the experimental values, while the simulation overestimates the electron mobility for TAP. Interestingly, the mobility of TIPS-TAP-4F is significantly lower than that of TIPS-TAP-4Cl/Br, despite their similar packing structures. This discrepancy can be attributed to the strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluoride, leading to reduced electron transfer integrals and increased reorganization energy. While molecular packing is widely accepted as a dominant factor in charge transport in OSCs, our study highlights the essential role of electronic effects in OSC charge transport. This study provides new insights into the understanding of the charge transport mechanism in OSCs.</description>

      <title>Optimal transport distances to characterise electronic excitations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09118v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the character of electronic excitations is important in computational and reaction mechanistic studies, but their classification from simulations remains an open problem. Distances based on optimal transport have proven very useful in a plethora of classification problems and seem therefore a natural tool to try to tackle this challenge. We propose and investigate a new diagnostic $\Theta$ based on the Sinkhorn divergence from optimal transport. We evaluate a $k$-NN classification algorithm on $\Theta$, the popular $\Lambda$ diagnostic as well as their combination, and assess their performance in labelling excitations, finding that (i) The combination only slightly improves the classification, (ii) Rydberg excitations are not separated well in any setting, and (iii) $\Theta$ breaks down for charge transfer in small molecules. We then define a length scale-normalised version of $\Theta$ and show that the result correlates closely with $\Lambda$ for results obtained with Gaussian basis functions. Finally, we discuss the orbital-dependence of our approach and explore an orbital-independent version. Using an optimised combination of the optimal transport and overlap diagnostics together with a different metric is in our opinion the most promising for future classification studies.</description>

Abstract: Data generation remains a bottleneck in training surrogate models to predict molecular properties. We demonstrate that multitask Gaussian process regression overcomes this limitation by leveraging both expensive and cheap data sources. In particular, we consider training sets constructed from coupled-cluster (CC) and density functional theory (DFT) data. We report that multitask surrogates can predict at CC-level accuracy with a reduction to data generation cost by over an order of magnitude. Of note, our approach allows the training set to include DFT data generated by a heterogeneous mix of exchange-correlation functionals without imposing any artificial hierarchy on functional accuracy. More generally, the multitask framework can accommodate a wider range of training set structures -- including full disparity between the different levels of fidelity -- than existing kernel approaches based on $\Delta$-learning, though we show that the accuracy of the two approaches can be similar. Consequently, multitask regression can be a tool for reducing data generation costs even further by opportunistically exploiting existing data sources.</description>

      <title>Chemical Transferability and Accuracy of Ionic Liquid Simulations with Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01980</link>

Abstract: Ionic liquids (ILs) are an exciting class of electrolytes finding applications in many areas from energy storage to solvents, and have been touted as ``designer solvents'', as they can be mixed to precisely tailor the physiochemical properties. As using machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) to simulate ILs is still relatively unexplored, several questions need to be answered to see if MLIPs can be transformative for ILs. Since ILs are often not pure, but are either mixed together or contain additives, we first demonstrate that a MLIP can be trained to be chemically transferable, i.e., can be applied to compositions not directly train on, but with similar chemistries, whilst only being trained on a few compositions. We also investigate the accuracy of MLIPs for a novel IL, which we experimentally synthesis and characterise. Our MLIP trained on $\sim$200 DFT frames is in reasonable agreement with our experiments and good agreement against DFT, demonstrating the data-efficient power of this method.</description>

      <title>Plasmon-driven substitution of 4 mercaptophenylboronic acid to 4-nitrothiophenol monitored by surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Plasmon-driven reactions on plasmonic nanoparticles (NPs) occur under significantly different conditions from those of classical organic synthesis and provide a promising pathway for enhancing the efficiency of various chemical processes. However, these reactions can also have undesirable effects, such as 4-mercaptophenylboronic acid (MPBA) deboronation. MPBA chemisorbs well to Ag NPs through its thiol group and can subsequently bind to diols, enabling the detection of various biological structures by surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), but not upon its deboronation. To avoid this reaction, we investigated the experimental conditions of MPBA deboronation on Ag NPs by SERS. Our results showed that the level of deboronation strongly depends on both the morphology of the system and the excitation laser wavelength and power. In addition, we detected not only the expected products, namely thiophenol and biphenyl-4,4-dithiol, but also 4-nitrothiophenol (NTP). The crucial reagent for NTP formation was an oxidation product of hydroxylamine hydrochloride, the reduction agent used in Ag NP synthesis. Ultimately, this reaction was replicated by adding NaNO2 to the system, and its progress was monitored as a function of the laser power, thereby identifying a new reaction of plasmon-driven -B(OH)2 substitution for -NO2.</description>

      <title>Solomon equations for qubit and two-level systems: Insights into non-Poissonian quantum jumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06900v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We measure and model the combined relaxation of a qubit coupled to a discrete two-level system~(TLS) environment, also known as the central spin model. If the TLSs are much longer-lived than the qubit, non-exponential relaxation and non-Poissonian quantum jumps can be observed. In the limit of large numbers of TLSs, the relaxation is likely to follow a power law, which we confirm with measurements on a superconducting fluxonium qubit. Moreover, the observed relaxation and quantum jump statistics are described by the Solomon equations, for which we present a derivation starting from the general Lindblad equation for an arbitrary number of TLSs. We also show how to reproduce the non-Poissonian quantum jump statistics using a diffusive stochastic Schr\"odinger equation. The fact that the measured quantum jump statistics can be reproduced by the Solomon equations, which ignore the quantum measurement backaction, hints at a quantum-to-classical transition.</description>

      <title>Quantum Equation of Motion with Orbital Optimization for Computing Molecular Properties in Near-Term Quantum Computing</title>

Abstract: Determining the properties of molecules and materials is one of the premier applications of quantum computing. A major question in the field is how to use imperfect near-term quantum computers to solve problems of practical value. Inspired by the recently developed variants of the quantum counterpart of the equation-of-motion (qEOM) approach and the orbital-optimized variational quantum eigensolver (oo-VQE), we present a quantum algorithm (oo-VQE-qEOM) for the calculation of molecular properties by computing expectation values on a quantum computer. We perform noise-free quantum simulations of BeH$_2$ in the series of STO-3G/6-31G/6-31G* basis sets and of H$_4$ and H$_2$O in 6-31G using an active space of four electrons and four spatial orbitals (8 qubits) to evaluate excitation energies, electronic absorption, and, for twisted H$_4$, circular dichroism spectra. We demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can reproduce the results of conventional classical CASSCF calculations for these molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Dark excitons and hot electrons modulate exciton-photon strong coupling in metal-organic optical microcavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14835v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Polaritons, formed as a result of strong hybridization of matter with light, are promising for important applications including organic solar cells, optical logic gates, and qubits. Owing to large binding energies of Frenkel excitons (matter), strong matter-light coupling phenomena are possible at room temperature, high exciton densities, and even with low-quality-factor microcavities. In such cases, due to polaritons' high degree of delocalization, simultaneous effects from dark excitons and hot electrons may affect performance of potential devices. Their understanding, therefore, is of paramount importance, but their disentanglement in optical spectroscopy, however, thus far remained unattainable. Here, we overcome this challenge by careful and systematic analysis of transient polaritonic spectra, supported by analytical models. In doing so, we conclude that dark excitons affect the strength of exciton-photon coupling and manifest themselves as Fano-like polaritonic gain-loss spectra. Free electrons add additional loss component to and imprint a two-temperature dynamics on the polaritonic response. The developed general methodology can be applied to a variety of other microcavity structures. Our findings are significant for distinguishing polaritons and other excitations in studies of polariton-electron and plasmon-electron coupling phenomena as well as photonic control over photophysical and photochemical processes.</description>

      <title>Understanding inner-shell excitations in molecules through spectroscopy of the 4f hole states of YbF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10692v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Molecules containing a lanthanide atom have sets of electronic states arising from excitation of an inner-shell electron. These states have received little attention, but are thought to play an important role in laser cooling of such molecules and may be a useful resource for testing fundamental physics. We study a series of inner-shell excited states in YbF using resonance-enhanced multi-photon ionisation spectroscopy. We investigate the excited states of lowest energy, 8474, 9013 and 9090 cm$^{-1}$ above the ground state, all corresponding to the configuration 4f$^{13}$6s$^{2}$ ${}^{2}F_{7/2}$ of the Yb$^+$ ion. They are metastable, since they have no electric dipole allowed transitions to the ground state. We also characterize a state at 31050 cm$^{-1}$ that is easily excited from both the ground and metastable states, which makes it especially useful for this spectroscopic study. Finally, we study a state at 48729 cm$^{-1}$, which is above the ionization limit and features strong auto-ionizing resonances that prove useful for efficient detection of the molecules and for identifying the rotational quantum number of each line in the spectrum. We resolve the rotational structures of all these states and find that they can all be described by a very simple model based on Hund's case (c). Our study provides information necessary for laser slowing and magneto-optical trapping of YbF, which is an important species for testing fundamental physics. We also consider whether the low-lying inner-shell states may themselves be useful as probes of the electron's electric dipole moment or of varying fundamental constants, since they are long-lived states in a laser-coolable molecule featuring closely-spaced levels of opposite parity.</description>

      <title>Collective Quantum Entanglement in Molecular Cavity Optomechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12102v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an optomechanical scheme for reaching quantum entanglement in vibration polaritons. The system involves $N$ molecules, whose vibrations can be fairly entangled with plasmonic cavities. We find that the vibration-photon entanglement can exist at room temperature and is robust against thermal noise. We further demonstrate the quantum entanglement between the vibrational modes through the plasmonic cavities, which shows a delocalized nature and an incredible enhancement with the number of molecules. The underlying mechanism for the entanglement is attributed to the strong vibration-cavity coupling which possesses collectivity. Our results provide a molecular optomechanical scheme which offers a promising platform for the study of noise-free quantum resources and macroscopic quantum phenomena.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Atom-level pretraining with Quantum Mechanics (QM) data for Graph Neural Networks Molecular property models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14837v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the rapid and significant advancements in deep learning for Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) models, the challenge of learning robust molecular representations that effectively generalize in real-world scenarios to novel compounds remains an elusive and unresolved task. This study examines how atom-level pretraining with quantum mechanics (QM) data can mitigate violations of assumptions regarding the distributional similarity between training and test data and therefore improve performance and generalization in downstream tasks. In the public dataset Therapeutics Data Commons (TDC), we show how pretraining on atom-level QM improves performance overall and makes the activation of the features distributes more Gaussian-like which results in a representation that is more robust to distribution shifts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that hidden state molecular representations are analyzed to compare the effects of molecule-level and atom-level pretraining on QM data.</description>
