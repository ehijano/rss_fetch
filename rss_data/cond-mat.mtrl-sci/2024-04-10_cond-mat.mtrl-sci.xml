      <title>Chiral two-dimensional MoS2 by molecular functionalization as ultra-sensitive detectors for circularly polarized light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inducing chirality in optically and electronically active materials is interesting for applications in sensing and quantum information transmission. Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal chalcogenides (TMDs) possess excellent electronic and optical properties but are achiral. Here we demonstrate chirality induction in atomically thin layers of 2D MoS2 by functionalization with chiral thiol molecules. Analysis of X-ray absorption near-edge structure and Raman optical activity with circularly polarized excitation suggest chemical and electronic interactions that leads chirality transfer from the molecules to the MoS2. We confirm chirality induction in 2D MoS2 with circular dichroism measurements that show absorption bands at wavelengths of 380-520 nm and 520-600 nm with giant molar ellipticity of 10^8 deg cm2/dmol 2-3 orders of magnitude higher than 3D chiral materials. Phototransistors fabricated from atomically thin chiral MoS2 for detection of circularly polarized light exhibit responsivity of &gt;10^2 A/W and maximum anisotropy g-factor of 1.98 close to the theoretical maximum of 2.0, which indicates that the chiral states of photons are fully distinguishable by the photodetectors. Our results demonstrate that it is possible achieve chirality induction in monolayer MoS2 by molecular functionalization and realise ultra-sensitive detectors for circularly polarized photons.</description>

      <title>Physics of acceptors in GaN: Koopmans tuned HSE hybrid functional calculations and experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE) hybrid functional has become a widely used tool for theoretical calculations of point defects in semiconductors. It generally offers a satisfactory qualitative description of defect properties, including the donor/acceptor nature of defects, lowest energy charge states, thermodynamic and optical transition levels, Franck-Condon shifts, photoluminescence (PL) band shapes, and carrier capture cross sections. However, there are noticeable quantitative discrepancies in these properties when compared to experimental results. Some of these discrepancies arise from the presence of self-interaction in various parametrizations of the HSE. Other errors are due to the use of the periodic boundary conditions. In this study, we demonstrate that the error corrections scheme based on extrapolation to the dilute limit effectively eliminates the errors due to artificial electrostatic interactions of periodic images and interactions due to the defect state delocalization. This yields parametrizations of HSE that satisfy the generalized Koopmans' condition, essentially eliminating self-interaction from defect state orbitals. We apply this HSE Koopmans tuning individually to a range of cation site acceptors in GaN (Be\textsubscript{Ga}, Mg\textsubscript{Ga}, Zn\textsubscript{Ga}, Ca\textsubscript{Ga}, Cd\textsubscript{Ga}, and Hg\textsubscript{Ga}) and compare the HSE results with experimental data from PL spectra. The Koopmans-compliant HSE calculations show a significantly improved quantitative agreement with the experiment.</description>

      <title>SAM-I-Am: Semantic Boosting for Zero-shot Atomic-Scale Electron Micrograph Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image segmentation is a critical enabler for tasks ranging from medical diagnostics to autonomous driving. However, the correct segmentation semantics - where are boundaries located? what segments are logically similar? - change depending on the domain, such that state-of-the-art foundation models can generate meaningless and incorrect results. Moreover, in certain domains, fine-tuning and retraining techniques are infeasible: obtaining labels is costly and time-consuming; domain images (micrographs) can be exponentially diverse; and data sharing (for third-party retraining) is restricted. To enable rapid adaptation of the best segmentation technology, we propose the concept of semantic boosting: given a zero-shot foundation model, guide its segmentation and adjust results to match domain expectations. We apply semantic boosting to the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to obtain microstructure segmentation for transmission electron microscopy. Our booster, SAM-I-Am, extracts geometric and textural features of various intermediate masks to perform mask removal and mask merging operations. We demonstrate a zero-shot performance increase of (absolute) +21.35%, +12.6%, +5.27% in mean IoU, and a -9.91%, -18.42%, -4.06% drop in mean false positive masks across images of three difficulty classes over vanilla SAM (ViT-L).</description>

      <title>CryinGAN: Design and evaluation of point-cloud-based generative adversarial networks using disordered materials $-$ application to Li$_3$ScCl$_6$-LiCoO$_2$ battery interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative models have received significant attention in recent years for materials science applications, particularly in the area of inverse design for materials discovery. While current efforts have mainly focused on bulk materials with relatively small unit cells, the possibility of generative models for more complex, disordered materials would significantly extent the current capabilities of generative modeling. Generative models would also benefit from better ways to assess their performance. They are typically evaluated on the new, unverified materials being generated, which give limited metrics for evaluation. In this work, we design and evaluate models intended for disordered interface structure generation. Using a disordered Li$_3$ScCl$_6$-LiCoO$_2$ battery interface, we tested different point-cloud-based generative adversarial network architectures that further include bond distance information in the discriminator, rather than only atomic coordinates. By working with a fixed material system, we evaluated the model performance through direct comparisons between training and generated structures. The best performing architecture, Crystal Interface Generative Adversarial Network (CryinGAN), uses two separate 1D convolutional discriminators, one that accepts coordinates and another that accepts bond distances as input. We demonstrate that CryinGAN is able to successfully generate low-interface-energy structures for systems with &gt; 250 atoms, in which the generated interfaces are structurally similar to the training structures. This study highlights the capabilities of a relatively simple generative model in generating large disordered materials, and discusses the limitations of the point cloud representation. Insights are provided to help guide the development of future generative models that are useful to not just disordered, but also ordered materials.</description>

      <title>Chemical Interface Damping by Electrochemical Gold Oxidation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chemical interface damping is a change in the effective collision frequency of conduction band electrons in metal originating from a chemical change of the metal interface. In this work, we present in-situ ellipsometric measurements that reveal the chemical interface damping effect from electrochemical oxidation of single crystal and polycrystalline gold films. We observe an increase in collision frequency of up to 21 meV for single-crystalline gold. To compare to results obtained with thiols and metal-oxides on gold nanoparticles, we normalize the collision frequency by the electron mean free path to the surface of the structure. We show that electrochemical gold oxidation provides a stronger effect on collision frequency than these coatings. Similar ellipsometric experiments have previously been conducted to investigate the optical properties of gold oxide, but without taking chemical interface damping into account. The change in reflection from oxidation of gold was solely attributed to the oxide coating. We also show that the chemical interface damping effect saturates at a larger effective oxide thickness, which is attributed to the stabilization of the gold-oxide interface.</description>

      <title>Revealing mechanism of pore defect formation in laser directed energy deposition of aluminum alloy via in-situ synchrotron X-ray imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser metal additive manufacturing technology is capable of producing components with complex geometries and compositions that cannot be realized by conventional manufacturing methods. However, a large number of pores generated during the additive manufacturing process greatly affect the mechanical properties of the additively manufactured parts, and the mechanism of such pore generation has not been revealed by direct observation clearly. Here, we report the mechanism of pore generation in the laser direct energy deposition process as revealed by {\it in-situ} high-speed high-resolution synchrotron X-ray imaging. We found that dissolution and re-precipitation of external gases and precipitation of metal vapors are the two main mechanisms of pore formation. We further explored the effects of different process parameters on the generation of pores and optimized the process to suppress pore generation. This work provides important insights into the formation of porosity defects during laser metal additive manufacturing, and can provide guidance for related process optimization.</description>

      <title>The effects of V doping on the intrinsic properties of SmFe10Co2 alloys: a theoretical investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present study focuses on the intrinsic properties of the SmFe10Co2-xVx (x = 0-2) alloys, which includes the SmFe10Co2 alloy, one of the most promising permanent magnets with the ThMn12 type of structure due to its large saturation magnetization (1.78 T), high Curie temperature (Tc = 859 K), and anisotropy field (12 T) experimentally obtained. Unfortunately, its low coercivity (&lt;0.4 T) hinders its use in permanent magnet applications. The effect of V-doping on magnetization, magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy, and Curie temperature is investigated by electronic band structure calculations. The spin-polarized fully relativistic Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker (SPR-KKR) band structure method, which employs the coherent potential approximation (CPA) to deal with substitutional disorder, has been used. The Hubbard-U correction to local spin density approximation (LSDA +U) was used to account for the large correlation effects due to the 4f electronic states of Sm. The computed magnetic moments and magnetocrystalline anisotropy energies were compared with existing experimental data to validate the theoretical approach's reliability. The exchange-coupling parameters from the Heisenberg model were used for obtaining the mean-field estimated Curie temperature. The magnetic anisotropy energy was separated into contributions from transition metals and Sm, and its relationships with the local environment, interatomic distances, and valence electron delocalization were analyzed. The suitability of the hypothetical SmFe10CoV alloy for permanent magnet manufacture was assessed using the calculated anisotropy field, magnetic hardness, and intrinsic magnetic properties.</description>

      <title>Multi-interface engineering to realize all-solution processed highly efficient Kesterite solar cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of Kesterite Cu2ZnSn(S, Se)4 solar cells in the past few years, how to achieve higher cost-performance ratio has become an important topic in the future development and industrialization of this technology. Herein, we demonstrate an all-solution route for the cell fabrication, in particular targeting at the solution processed window layer comprised of ZnO nanoparticles/Ag nanowires. A multi-interface engineering strategy assisted by organic polymers and molecules is explored to synergistically improve the film deposition, passivate the surface defects and facilitate the charge transfer. These efforts help us achieve high-performance and robust Kesterite solar cells at extremely low time and energy costs, with efficiency records of 14.37% and 13.12% being realized in rigid and flexible Kesterite solar cells, respectively. Our strategy here is also promising to be transplanted into other solar cells with similar geometric and energy band structures, helping reduce production costs and shorten the production cycle (i.e. increasing production capacity) of these photovoltaic industries.</description>

      <title>14N Hyperfine and nuclear interactions of axial and basal NV centers in 4H-SiC: A high frequency (94 GHz) ENDOR study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers (NCVSi) - in 4H silicon carbide (SiC) constitute an ensemble of spin S = 1 solid state qubits interacting with the surrounding 14N and 29Si nuclei. As quantum applications based on a polarization transfer from the electron spin to the nuclei require the knowledge of the electron-nuclear interaction parameters, we have used high-frequency (94 GHz) electron-nuclear double resonance spectroscopy combined with first-principles density functional theory to investigate the hyperfine and nuclear quadrupole interactions of the basal and axial NV centers. We observed that the four inequivalent NV configurations (hk, kh, hh, and kk) exhibit different electron-nuclear interaction parameters, suggesting that each NV center may act as a separate optically addressable qubit. Finally, we rationalized the observed differences in terms of distinctions in the local atomic structures of the NV configurations. Thus, our results provide the basic knowledge for an extension of quantum protocols involving the 14N nuclear spin.</description>

      <title>Magnetic-field induced spiral order in the electric polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a phenomenological model for magnetoelectricity in multiferroic materials. The distinctive feature of the model is a two-component complex order parameter that encodes the electric polarization, along with a direct coupling between the polarization and magnetic field. Our model effectively elucidates that a sufficiently strong magnetic field can destroy electric polarization. Furthermore, the transition field strength diminishes with rising temperature, following a power-law relation with the exponent being precisely worked out. At lower field strength, the electric polarization takes a spiral order in the magnetic field, with the spiral wavelength inversely proportional to the magnetic field strength. We anticipate these predictions can be experimentally tested in future studies on multiferroic materials.</description>

      <title>Multiscale structure-property discovery via active learning in scanning tunneling microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomic arrangements and local sub-structures fundamentally influence emergent material functionalities. The local structures are conventionally probed using spatially resolved studies and the property correlations are usually deciphered by a researcher based on sequential explorations and auxiliary information, thus limiting the throughput efficiency. Here we demonstrate a Bayesian deep learning based framework that automatically correlates material structure with its electronic properties using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) measurements in real-time. Its predictions are used to autonomously direct exploration toward regions of the sample that optimize a given material property. This autonomous method is deployed on the low-temperature ultra-high vacuum STM to understand the structure-property relationship in a europium-based semimetal, EuZn2As2, one of the promising candidates for studying the magnetism-driven topological properties. The framework employs a sparse sampling approach to efficiently construct the scalar-property space using a minimal number of measurements, about 1 - 10 % of the data required in standard hyperspectral imaging methods. We further demonstrate a target-property-guided active learning of structures within a multiscale framework. This is implemented across length scales in a hierarchical fashion for the autonomous discovery of structural origins for an observed material property. This framework offers the choice to select and derive a suitable scalar property from the spectroscopic data to steer exploration across the sample space. Our findings reveal correlations of the electronic properties unique to surface terminations, local defect density, and point defects.</description>

      <title>All-optical scanning vector magnetometry based on fine and hyperfine interactions in spin-$\frac{3}{2}$ centers in silicon carbide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The possibility of using axial spin color centers with $S=3/2$, oriented along the hexagonal $c$ axis in a silicon carbide (SiC) wafer, has been demonstrated for all-optical measurement of projection of the external magnetic field coinciding with the $c$ axis of the crystal, and the polar and azimuthal angles of the external measured magnetic field at room and significantly higher temperatures. A distinctive feature of spin centers in SiC, in which optically induced spin alignment is carried out, is the presence of a unique system of spin levels in a magnetic field, caused by fine structure interaction and hyperfine interaction with the $^{29}$Si nuclei and there is a wide range of level anticrossings (LACs), leading to an exceptionally strong change in photoluminescence in the region of LAC and the dependence of the LAC spectrum on the orientation of the external measured magnetic field, which made it possible to develop the all-optical vector magnetometry method. Such measurements do not require microwave radiation, it is possible to use single spin center for the all-optical vector magnetometry. The proposed magnetometer is based on an external magnetic field cancellation scheme, which leads to a LAC spectrum observed in a zero external magnetic field, called its reference spectrum, by maintaining a local region of zero magnetic field at the site of optical excitation of spin centers. 4H-SiC plate is placed on the scanning stage of a confocal microscope inside the Helmholtz coils. Sensitivity to a constant magnetic field for $z$ component of the magnetic field ${B}_{z}$ is better than $0.1\mu$T$/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ in a volume of $1\times10^{-8}$mm$^{3}$ at room temperature. The sensitivity of determining the angles polar and azimuthal is determined by the sensitivity to determining the perpendicular component of the magnetic field, which is better than $5~\mu$T$/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$.</description>

      <title>Defect-engineering hexagonal boron nitride using low-energy Ar+ irradiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monolayer hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has recently become the focus of intense research as a material to host quantum emitters. Although it is well known that such emission is associated with point defects, so far no conclusive correlation between the spectra and specific defects has been demonstrated. Here, we prepare atomically clean suspended hBN samples and subject them to low-energy ion irradiation. The samples are characterized before and after irradiation via automated scanning transmission electron microscopy imaging to assess the defect concentrations and distributions. We find an intrinsic defect concentration of ca. 0.03/nm2 (with ca. 55% boron and 8% nitrogen single vacancies, 20% double vacancies and 16% more complex vacancy structures). To be able to differentiate between these and irradiation-induced defects, we create a significantly higher (but still moderate) concentration of defects with the ions (0.30/nm2), and now find ca. 55% boron and 12% nitrogen single vacancies, 14% double vacancies, and 18% more complex vacancy structures. The results demonstrate that already the simplest irradiation provides selectivity for the defect types, and open the way for future experiments to explore changing the selectivity by modifying the irradiation parameters.</description>

      <title>BAMBOO: a predictive and transferable machine learning force field framework for liquid electrolyte development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the widespread applications of machine learning force field (MLFF) on solids and small molecules, there is a notable gap in applying MLFF to complex liquid electrolytes. In this work, we introduce BAMBOO (ByteDance AI Molecular Simulation Booster), a novel framework for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, with a demonstration of its capabilities in the context of liquid electrolytes for lithium batteries. We design a physics-inspired graph equivariant transformer architecture as the backbone of BAMBOO to learn from quantum mechanical simulations. Additionally, we pioneer an ensemble knowledge distillation approach and apply it on MLFFs to improve the stability of MD simulations. Finally, we propose the density alignment algorithm to align BAMBOO with experimental measurements. BAMBOO demonstrates state-of-the-art accuracy in predicting key electrolyte properties such as density, viscosity, and ionic conductivity across various solvents and salt combinations. Our current model, trained on more than 15 chemical species, achieves the average density error of 0.01 g/cm^3 on various compositions compared with experimental data. Moreover, our model demonstrates transferability to molecules not included in the quantum mechanical dataset. We envision this work as paving the way to a ''universal MLFF'' capable of simulating properties of common organic liquids.</description>

      <title>Laser driven melt pool resonances through dynamically oscillating energy inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatially selective melting of metal materials by laser irradiation allows for the precise welding as well as the 3D printing of complex metal parts. However, the simple scanning of a conventional Gaussian beam typically results in a melt track with randomly distributed surface features due to the complex and dynamic behavior of the melt pool. In this study, the implications of utilizing a dynamically oscillating energy input on driving melt track fluctuations is investigated. Specifically, the laser intensity and/or intensity distribution is sinusoidally modulated at different scan speeds, and the effect of modulation frequency on the resulting surface features of the melt track is examined. The formation of periodically oriented surface features indicates an evident frequency coupling between the melt pool and the modulation frequency. Moreover, such a frequency coupling becomes most prominent under a specific modulation frequency, suggesting resonant behavior. The insights provided in this study will enable the development of novel methods, allowing for the control and/or mitigation of inherent fluctuations in the melt pool through laser-driven resonances.</description>

      <title>Robustness of topological magnons in disordered arrays of skyrmions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effects of disorder on the robustness of topological magnon states of two-dimensional ferromagnetic skyrmions is investigated. It is diagnosed by evaluating a real space topological invariant, the bosonic Bott index (BI). The disorder simultaneously breaks the axially symmetric shape and the crystalline ordering of the skyrmions array. The corresponding magnonic fluctuations and band spectrum are determined in terms of magnetic field and strength of disorder. We observe the closing of the existing band gaps as the individual skyrmions start to occupy random positions. The analysis reveals that topological states (TSs) persist beyond the perturbative limit when skyrmions reach the glassy phase. In addition, the localization of topologically protected edge states is weakened by the disordered skyrmion structure with increasing localization length. Our findings shed light on the physical understanding of the coexistence of disordered magnetic textures and their topological spin fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Geometric frustration and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions in a quantum star lattice hybrid copper sulfate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the magnetism of a layered, spin-$\frac12$ organic-inorganic copper sulfate, which is a close realization of the star lattice antiferromagnet, one of the playgrounds of geometric frustration and resonating valence bond physics in two spatial dimensions. Our thermodynamic measurements show no ordering down to 0.1 K and a characteristic field-induced entropic shift, revealing the presence of an infinite number of competing states down to very low energy scales. The response to external magnetic fields shows, in addition, a peculiar anisotropy, reflected in the formation of a 1/3 magnetization plateau (stable up to full saturation around 105 T) and a paramagnetic, Curie-like susceptibility for one direction of the field (${\bf H}\parallel{\bf c}$), and a completely different response in other field directions. Our first-principles density functional theory calculations and exact diagonalizations show that these experimental puzzles are distinctive signatures of a strong interplay between geometric frustration and sizable Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, and the emergence of a continuous U(1) symmetry at low energy scales.</description>

      <title>Unravelling the Band Structure and Orbital Character of a $\pi$-Conjugated 2D Graphdiyne-Based Organometallic Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphdiyne-based carbon systems generate intriguing layered sp-sp$^2$ organometallic lattices, characterized by flexible acetylenic groups connecting planar carbon units through metal centers. At their thinnest limit, they can result in two-dimensional (2D) organometallic networks exhibiting unique quantum properties and even confining the surface states of the substrate, which is of great importance for fundamental studies. In this work, we present the on-surface synthesis of a highly crystalline 2D organometallic network grown on Ag(111). The electronic structure of this mixed honeycomb-kagome arrangement - investigated by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and scanning tunneling spectroscopy - reveals a strong electronic conjugation within the network, leading to the formation of two intense electronic band-manifolds. In comparison to theoretical density functional theory calculations, we observe that these bands exhibit a well-defined orbital character that can be associated with distinct regions of the sp-sp$^2$ monomers. Moreover, we find that the halogen by-products resulting from the network formation locally affect the pore-confined states, causing a significant energy shift. This work contributes to the understanding of the growth and electronic structure of graphdiyne-like 2D networks, providing insights into the development of novel carbon materials beyond graphene with tailored properties.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the magnetic properties of a cobalt oxalate metal-organic-framework featuring the hyperoctagon lattice. Our thermodynamic measurements reveal the $J_{\rm{eff}}$ = 1/2 state of the high-spin Co$^{2+}$ (3$\textit{d}^{7}$) ion and the two successive magnetic transitions at zero field with two-stage entropy release. $^{13}$C-NMR measurements reveal the absence of an internal magnetic field in the intermediate temperature phase. Multiple field-induced phases are observed before full saturation at around 40 T. We argue the unique cobalt oxalate network gives rise to the Kitaev interaction and/or a bond frustration effect, providing an unconventional platform for frustrated magnetism on the hyperoctagon lattice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are promising candidates to improve the thermal conductivity of nano-composites. The main obstacle to these applications is the extremely high thermal boundary (Kapitza) resistance between the CNTs and their matrix. In this theoretical work our goal is to maximize the heat flux through the CNT by functionalizing the CNT ends. We use a Landauer approach to calculate and optimize the energy flux from a soft to a hard material in one dimension through a connecting continuous medium of varying elasticity and density. The transmission probability of phonons through the system is calculated both numerically and analytically. We find that over 90% of the maximum heat flux into CNT is possible for 1nm length of the intermediate material at room temperature (300K).</description>

      <title>Pressure-tuned many-body phases through $\Gamma$-K valleytronics in moir\'e bilayer WSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments in twisted bilayer transition-metal dichalcogenides have revealed a variety of strongly correlated phenomena. To theoretically explore their origin, we combine here ab initio calculations with correlated model approaches to describe and study many-body effects in twisted bilayer WSe$_2$ under pressure. We find that the interlayer distance is a key factor for the electronic structure, as it tunes the relative energetic positions between the K and the $\Gamma$ valleys of the valence band maximum of the untwisted bilayer. As a result, applying uniaxial pressure to a twisted bilayer induces a charge-transfer from the K valley to the flat bands in the $\Gamma$ valley. Upon Wannierizing moir\'e bands from both valleys, we establish the relevant tight-binding model parameters and calculate the effective interaction strengths using the constrained random phase approximation. With this, we approximate the interacting pressure-doping phase diagram of WSe$_2$ moir\'e bilayers using self-consistent mean field theory. Our results establish twisted bilayer WSe$_2$ as a platform that allows the direct pressure-tuning of different correlated phases, ranging from Mott insulators, charge-valley-transfer insulators to Kondo lattice-like systems.</description>

      <title>Strengthening from dislocation restructuring and local climb at platelet linear complexions in Al-Cu alloys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stress-driven segregation at dislocations can lead to structural transitions between different linear complexion states. In this work, we examine how platelet array linear complexions influence dislocation motion and quantify the associated strengthening effect in Al-Cu alloys using atomistic simulations. The presence of platelet complexions leads to faceting of the dislocations, with nanoscale segments climbing upwards along the platelet growth direction, resulting in a complex non-planar configuration that restricts subsequent dislocation motion. Upon deformation, the leading partial dislocation must climb down from the platelet complexions first, followed by a similar sequence at the trailing partial dislocation, in order to overcome the precipitates and commence plastic slip. The dislocation depinning mechanism of linear complexions is strikingly different from traditional precipitation-strengthened alloys, where dislocations overcome obstacles by either shearing through or looping around obstacles. The critical shear stress required to unpin dislocations from platelet complexions is found to be inversely proportional to precipitate spacing, which includes not just the open space (as observed in Orowan bowing) but also the region along the platelet particle where climb occurs. Thus, platelet linear complexions provide a new way to modify dislocation structure directly and improve the mechanical properties of metal alloys.</description>

      <title>Why does silicon have an indirect band gap?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Density functional theory (DFT) is a powerful tool for predicting the electronic band structures of functional materials. However, it is often difficult to intuit how major band structure features$-$such as band gap magnitude, location of band extrema, effective masses, etc.$-$arise from the underlying crystal chemistry of a material. Band structure is represented in reciprocal space, but arises from the orbital and bonding interactions between atoms in real space. Here, we present a conceptual and computable framework to extract chemical bonding origins of DFT-calculated band structure features. As a key example, we explain here the indirect band gap of silicon, which profoundly impacts its properties for use in photovoltaics and electronics. Even in this basic semiconductor material, our approach leads to new insights to understand and engineer its conduction band minimum position. These calculation techniques can be broadly applied to reveal the crystal chemistry origins of electronic structure features in other optical, electronic, and magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Reference Energies for Valence Ionizations and Satellite Transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13877v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Upon ionization of an atom or a molecule, another electron (or more) can be simultaneously excited. These concurrently generated states are called "satellites" (or shake-up transitions) as they appear in ionization spectra as higher-energy peaks with weaker intensity and larger width than the main peaks associated with single-particle ionizations. Satellites, which correspond to electronically excited states of the cationic species, are notoriously challenging to model using conventional single-reference methods due to their high excitation degree compared to the neutral reference state. This work reports 42 satellite transition energies and 58 valence ionization potentials of full configuration interaction (FCI) quality computed in small molecular systems. Following the protocol developed for the quest database [https://doi.org/10.1002/wcms.1517, V\'eril et al. Wiley Interdiscip. Rev.: Comput. Mol. Sci. 2021, 11, e1517], these reference energies are computed using the configuration interaction using a perturbative selection made iteratively (CIPSI) method. In addition, the accuracy of the well-known coupled-cluster (CC) hierarchy (CC2, CCSD, CC3, CCSDT, CC4, and CCSDTQ) is gauged against these new accurate references. The performances of various approximations based on many-body Green's functions ($GW$, GF2, and $T$-matrix) for ionization potentials are also analyzed. Their limitations in correctly modeling satellite transitions are discussed.</description>
