      <title>MOCKA -- A PLATO mock asteroseismic catalogue: Simulations for gravity-mode oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With ESA's PLATO space mission set for launch in December 2026, a new photometric legacy and a future of new scientific discoveries await. In this work we investigate PLATO's potential for observing pulsating stars across the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram as part of the PLATO Complimentary Science program (PLATO-CS). Specifically, a PLATO mock asteroseismic catalogue (MOCKA) of intermediate to massive stars is presented as a benchmark to highlight the asteroseismic yield of PLATO-CS in a quantitative way. MOCKA includes simulations of $\beta$~Cephei, slowly pulsating B (SPB), $\delta$~Scuti, $\gamma$~Doradus, RR Lyrae, Cepheid, hot subdwarf, and white dwarf stars. In particular, main-sequence gravity (g) mode pulsators are of interest as some of these stars form an important foundation for the scientific calibration of PLATO. MOCKA is based on a magnitude limited ($G\lesssim17$) \textit{Gaia} catalogue and is a product of realistic end-to-end \texttt{PlatoSim} simulations of stars for the first PLATO pointing field in the Southern hemisphere, which will be observed for a minimally 2-yr duration. We show that an abundant spectrum of frequencies is achievable across a wide range of magnitudes and co-pointing PLATO cameras. Within the magnitude limited regimes simulated ($G \lesssim 14$ for $\gamma$~Doradus stars and $G \lesssim 16$ for SPB stars) the dominant g-mode frequency is recovered in more than $95\%$ of the cases. MOCKA help us to understand the limits of the PLATO mission as well as highlight the opportunities to push astrophysics beyond current stellar models. All data products of this paper are made available to the community for further exploration. The key data products of MOCKA are the magnitude limited \textit{Gaia} catalogue of the first PLATO pointing field, together with fully reduced light curves from multi-camera observations for each pulsation class.</description>

      <title>Magnetic flux emergence and solar eruptions in partially ionized plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have performed 3D MHD simulations to study the effect of partial ionization in the process of magnetic flux emergence in the Sun. In fact, we continue previous work and we now focus: 1) on the emergence of the magnetic fields above the solar photosphere and 2) on the eruptive activity, which follows the emergence into the corona. We find that in the simulations with partial ionization (PI), the structure of the emerging field consists of arch-like fieldlines with very little twist since the axis of the initial rising field remains below the photosphere. The plasma inside the emerging volume is less dense and it is moving faster compared to the fully ionized (FI) simulation. In both cases, new flux ropes (FR) are formed due to reconnection between emerging fieldlines, and they eventually erupt in an ejective manner towards the outer solar atmosphere. We are witnessing three major eruptions in both simulations. At least for the first eruption, the formation of the eruptive FR occurs in the low atmosphere in the FI case and at coronal heights in the PI case. Also, in the first PI eruption, part of the eruptive FR carries neutrals in the high atmosphere, for a short period of time. Overall, the eruptions are relatively faster in the PI case, while a considerable amount of axial flux is found above the photosphere during the eruptions in both simulations.</description>

      <title>Common envelopes at StanFest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe some of our group's recent work on common envelopes. Our goal is to understand the onset and outcomes of dynamically unstable mass transfer, including the properties of the binaries left behind and the outflows during the common envelope stage. We have also started thinking about light curves of common envelope events. During a talk at StanFest, a meeting in honour of Stan Owocki's retirement held in Leuven in July, 2024, the first author reported on some of the results we recently obtained and briefly outlined future prospects.</description>

      <title>The symbiotic star V694 Mon has transitioned from the accreting-only state to the steady burning phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose that the drastic photometric and spectroscopic changes affecting the symbiotic star V694 Mon since 2018, are due to its transition from the accreting-only state to steady hydrogen-burning on the surface of the white dwarf, closely mimicking the pattern followed by V4368 Sgr. The phase of peak optical brightness and weakest emission lines has probably been reached in early 2024. The high-velocity absorptions powered by jet-ejection and the wild flickering, which dominated the century-long quiescence, should not reappear as long has nuclear burning will hold (time-scale of decades). The 3500 Lsun burning luminosity suggests a mass of 0.60 Msun for the WD.</description>

      <title>Suppression of photospheric velocity fluctuations in strongly magnetic O-stars in radiation-magnetohydrodynamic simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: O-stars generally show clear signs of strong line-broadening (in addition to rotational broadening) in their photospheric absorption lines (typically referred to as 'macroturbulence'), believed to originate in a turbulent sub-surface zone associated with enhanced opacities due to recombination of iron-group elements (at T~ 150-200 kK). O-stars with detected global magnetic fields also display such macroturbulence; the sole exception to this is NGC 1624-2, which also has the strongest (by far) detected field of the known magnetic O-stars. It has been suggested that this lack of additional line-broadening is because NGC 1624-2's exceptionally strong magnetic field might be able able to suppress the turbulent velocity field generated in the iron opacity peak zone. For moderately strong magnetic cases (~1 kG) the simulated atmospheres are highly structured characterised by large root-mean-square velocities, and our results are qualitatively similar to those found in previous non-magnetic studies. By contrast, we find that a strong horizontal magnetic field in excess of 10 kG can indeed suppress the large velocity fluctuations and thus stabilise (and thereby also inflate) the atmosphere of a typical early O-star in the Galaxy. On the other hand, an equally strong radial field is only able to suppress horizontal motions, and as a consequence these models exhibit significant radial fluctuations. Our simulations provide an overall physical rationale as to why NGC 1624-2 with its strong ~20 kG dipolar field lacks the large macroturbulent line broadening that all other known slowly rotating early O-stars exhibit. However, they also highlight the importance of field geometry for controlling the atmospheric dynamics in massive and luminous stars that are strongly magnetic, tentatively suggesting latitudinal dependence of macroturbulence and basic photospheric parameters.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Radio Emission from the $\beta$ Cep star V2187 Cyg</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the radio emission from the $\beta$ Cep star V2187 Cyg using archive data from the Jansky Very Large Array. The observations were made in ten epochs at 1.39 and 4.96 GHz in the highest angular resolution A configuration. We determine a spectral index of of $\alpha = 0.6\pm0.2$ ($S_{\nu} \propto \nu^\alpha$), consistent with an ionized wind or a partially optically-thick synchrotron or gyrosynchrotron source. The emission is spatially unresolved at both frequencies. The 4.96 GHz data shows a radio pulse with a duration of about one month that can be modeled in terms of an internal shock in the stellar wind produced by a sudden increase in the mass-loss rate and the terminal velocity. The quiescent radio emission of V2187 Cyg at 4.96 GHz (with a flux density of $\simeq 150~\mu Jy$), cannot be explained in terms of an internally (by V2187 Cyg) or externally (by a nearby O star) photoionized wind. We conclude that, despite the spectral index suggestive of free-free emission from an ionized wind, the radio emission of V2187 Cyg most likely has a magnetic origin, a possibility that can be tested with a sensitive search for circular polarization in the radio, as expected from gyro-synchrotron radiation, and also by trying to measure the stellar magnetic field, that is expected to be in the range of several kGauss.</description>

      <title>Complex investigations of an active star-formation region in southern part of Mon R2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue to present the results of a Byurakan Narrow Band Imaging Survey (BNBIS). In this work we present the results of the search and further detailed investigation of the objects, found in the course of the BNBIS survey in the southern part of the Mon R2 association. For the search of HH objects the narrow band images, obtained with the 1-m Schmidt telescope of the Byurakan Observatory, were used. Newly found objects were imaged in optical and near-IR range with the Apache Point Observatory 3.5 meter telescope, and observed spectrally with long-slit spectrograph and scanning Fabry-Perot interferometer on 6 m telescope of Special Astrophysical Observatory of the Russian Academy of Sciences using SCORPIO-2. We found three new HH groups: HH 1233, HH 1234 and HH 1235, two of them represent extended collimated flows. HH 1233 is the C-shape bipolar outflow system associated with the 2MASS 06084223$-$0657385 source star. HH 1234 is the helical chain of HH knots near the star V963 Mon. HH 1235 is a separate compact knot, connected with the visible only in mid- and far-IR source WISE J060856.57$-$070103.5. We found also several molecular hydrogen outflows, one of which coincides with HH 1233 and two other are associated with the deeply embedded IR sources in the same field. One more probable bipolar H$_2$ outflow is related to WISE J060856.57$-$070103.5. The emission spectra and spectral energy distributions of the source stars were analyzed. According to them they should be under rather early evolutional stage.</description>

      <title>Early-time millimeter observations of the nearby Type II SN 2024ggi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The short-lived ionized emission lines in early spectroscopy of the nearby type II supernova SN 2024ggi signify the presence of dense circumstellar matter (CSM) close to its progenitor star. We proposed the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations by its Director's Discretionary Time program to catch the potential synchrotron radiation associated with the ejecta-CSM interaction. Multi-epoch observations were conducted using ALMA band 6 at +8, +13, and +17 days after the discovery. The data show non-detections at the position of SN 2024ggi with a 3sigma upper limit of less than 0.15 mJy, corresponding to a luminosity of approximately 8*10^24 erg/s/Hz. In this paper, we leverage the non-detections to place constraints on the properties of CSM surrounding SN 2024ggi. We investigate both the Wind and Eruptive models for the radial distribution of CSM, assuming a constant mass-loss rate in the Wind model and a distance-variant mass-loss rate in the Eruptive model. The derived CSM distribution for the Wind model does not align with the early-time spectral features, while the ALMA observations suggest a mass-loss rate of ~ 5*10^-3 Msun/year for the Eruptive model. Conducting multi-epoch millimeter/submillimeter observations shortly after the explosion, with a cadence of a few days, could offer a promising opportunity to capture the observable signature of the Eruptive model.</description>

      <title>On the proton precipitation sites in solar flares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectrocopy Imager (RHESSI) $\gamma$-ray observations of the extraordinary GOES X25 flare SOL2003-10-28T11:10 are revisited to investigate previously reported conclusions that flare-accelerated electrons and protons precipitate along spatially separated flare loops. In contrast to previous works which reconstructed 2.223 MeV images over extended time periods ($\sim$20 minutes), we selected shorter integration times of the order of 2 to 3 minutes. Using simulations of the 2.223 MeV profile by Murphy et al. (2003) in combination with observations of the prompt $\gamma$-ray lines from the INTEGRAL mission, we obtain two separated integration time ranges representing the peak of the flare and the start of the decay, respectively. The resulting $\gamma$-ray images are then compared to GONG white-light (WL) observations to identify where along the flaring ribbons electrons and protons precipitation occurs. We point out that previously reported results comparing RHESSI hard X-ray (HXR) and $\gamma$-ray images only hold if the relative time evolution in the two energy ranges is the same. As the decay times for the 28 October 2003 is different at the considered two energy ranges (200-300 keV and around 2.223 MeV), the previously published conclusion that electrons and protons precipitate at different locations is an overstatement. Using shorter integration times reveals that the $\gamma$-ray and HXR sources spatially coincide with the WL flare ribbons. Our key conclusion is that electron and proton precipitation sites coincide with the flare ribbons, suggesting that the electron and proton precipitation sites are the same, at least within RHESSI's imaging capabilities. This result solves the twenty-years-long mystery around the previously reported different electron and proton precipitation sites.</description>

      <title>Minute-cadence Observations of the LAMOST Fields with the TMTS: VI. Absolute Physical Parameters of Contact Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the development of wide-field surveys, a large amount of data on short-period W UMa contact binaries have been obtained. Continuous and uninterrupted light curves as well as high-resolution spectroscopic data are crucial in determining the absolute physical parameters. Targets with both TMTS light curves and LAMOST medium-resolution spectra were selected. The absolute physical parameters were inferred with the W-D code for ten systems, all of them are W-type shallow or medium contact binaries. The O'Connell effect observed in the light curves can be explained by adding a spot on the primary or secondary component in the models. According to O-C analysis, the orbital periods exhibit a long-term increasing or decreasing trend, amongst which J0132, J1300, and J1402 show periodic variations that may be attributed to the presence of a third body or magnetic activity cycles. Spectral subtraction analysis revealed that the equivalent width of H$\alpha$ indicates strong magnetic activity in J0047, J0305, J0638, and J1402. Among the 10 selected binary systems, except for J0132 and J0913, the more massive components are found to be main-sequence stars while the less massive components have evolved off the main sequence. In J0132, both components are in the main sequence, whereas both components of J0913 lie above the terminal-age main sequence. Based on the relationship between orbital angular momentum and total mass for these two systems, as well as their low fill-out factors, it is possible that these two systems are newly formed contact binaries, having recently evolved from the detached configuration.</description>

      <title>Testing the asteroseismic estimates of stellar radii with surface brightness-colour relations and {\it Gaia} DR3 parallaxes. II. Red giants and red clump stars from the {\it Kepler} catalogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent investigation highlighted peculiar trends between the radii derived from surface brightness-colour relations (SBCRs) combined with Gaia DR3 parallaxes with respect to asteroseismic scaling relation radii from K2 data. [...] We investigated on the robustness of the results based on Kepler data. We cross-matched asteroseismic and astrometric data for over 12,000 red giant branch and red clump stars from the end-of-mission Kepler catalogue with the Gaia DR3 and TIC v8.2 to obtain precise parallaxes, V- and K-band magnitudes, and E(B - V) colour excesses. Two well-tested SBCRs from the literature were adopted to estimate stellar radii. The analysis confirmed that SBCR and asteroseismic radii agree very well. The overall differences are only 1-2% depending on the adopted SBCR. The dispersion of 7% was about two-thirds of what was found for K2-based data. As a difference from the K2-based investigation, the ratio of SBCRs-to-asteroseismic radii did not depend on the metallicity [Fe/H]. Moreover, the intriguing decreasing trend with [$\alpha$/Fe] of the radius ratio for massive stars that was observed in K2 data was absent in Kepler data. The SBCR radii are systematically higher than asteroseismic estimates by 5% for stars with masses below 1.0 $M_{\odot}$. The SBCRs have proven to be a highly effective tool for estimating radii with a precision comparable to that obtained from asteroseismology, but at a significantly lower observational cost. Moreover, the superior concordance of Kepler-derived radii with SBCR measurements and the absence of the discrepancies observed in the K2-derived radii suggest the existence of underlying systematic errors that impact specific mass and metallicity regimes within the K2 dataset.</description>

      <title>Science Filter Characterization of the Solar Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (SUIT) on board Aditya-L1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Solar Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (SUIT) on board the Aditya-L1 mission is designed to observe the Sun across 200-400 nm wavelength. The telescope used 16 dichroic filters tuned at specific wavelengths in various combinations to achieve its science goals. For accurate measurements and interpretation, it is important to characterize these filters for spectral variations as a function of spatial location and tilt angle. Moreover, we also measured out-of-band and in-band transmission characteristics with respect to the inband transmissions. In this paper, we present the experimental setup, test methodology, and the analyzed results. Our findings reveal that the transmission properties of all filters meet the expected performance for spatial variation of transmission and the transmission band at a specific tilt angle. The out-of-band transmission for all filters is below 1% with respect to in-band, except for filters BB01 and NB01. These results confirm the capabilities of SUIT to effectively capture critical solar features in the anticipated layer of the solar atmosphere.</description>

      <title>Population synthesis of hot-subdwarf B stars with COMPAS: parameter variations and a prescription for hydrogen-rich shells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subdwarf B stars are a well-known class of hot, low-mass stars thought to be formed through interactions in stellar binary systems. While different formation channels for subdwarf B stars have been studied through a binary population synthesis approach, it has also become evident that the characteristics of the found populations depend on the initial set of assumptions that describe the sometimes poorly constrained physical processes, such as common envelope episodes or angular momentum loss during mass transfer events. In this work we present a parameter study of subdwarf B populations, including a novel analytic prescription that approximates the evolution of subdwarf B stars with hydrogen-rich outer shells, an element previously overlooked in rapid binary population synthesis. We find that all studied parameters strongly impact the properties of the population, with the possibility of igniting helium below the expected core-mass value near the tip of the red giant branch strongly affecting the total number of subdwarf B candidates. Critically, our newly proposed prescription for the evolution of subdwarf B stars with hydrogen-shells helps to reconcile theoretical predictions of surface gravity and effective temperature with observational results. Our prescription is useful in the context of rapid binary population synthesis studies and can be applied to other rapid binary population synthesis codes' output.</description>

      <title>Infrared properties of Planetary Nebulae with PG1159 central stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the properties of 26 PNe with PG1159-type central stars known till date and compare them with the properties of PNe having [WR], $wels$ and hydrogen-rich central stars published earlier. We use archival photometric measurements of $2MASS$ for near-IR analysis and $WISE$ and $IRAS$ data for mid- and far-IR analysis and derive the IR properties of PG1159-PNe. We analyze the IR colour-colour diagrams of PG1159-PNe and compare them with the other three groups of PNe. Similar to the [WR]-PNe, many PG1159-PNe also show large amount of near-IR emission from the hot-dust component but their AGB dust is relatively cooler. We also report here the dust colour temperatures, dust masses, dust-to-gas mass ratios, IR luminosities and IR excess of PG1159-PNe and plot them against their surface H$\beta$ brightness (age) and compare them with the distribution of other groups of PNe. The IR luminosity and dust temperature show strong correlation with surface H$\beta$ brightness, however, the dust-to-gas mass ratio and IR excess do not show any trend. While the mean dust mass has a lower value for PG1159-PNe, in compared to other groups, the average dust-to-gas mass ratio is found to be marginally larger for PG1159-PNe. An analysis of the number distribution of different groups of PNe against surface H$\beta$ brightness shows that a) younger [WR]-, $wels$- and normal-PNe have a similar distribution indicating that they all have evolved from the AGB in a similar way, b) while there is an overlap of surface H$\beta$ brightness between [WR]- and PG1159-PNe, showing an evolutionary connection between them, there exists a significant gap between the values derived for $wels$- and PG1159-PNe.</description>

      <title>ALMA detections of circumstellar disks in the giant Hii region M17. Probing the intermediate- to high-mass pre-main-sequence population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our current understanding is that intermediate- to high-mass stars form in a way similar to low-mass stars, that is, through disk accretion. However, the physical conditions that play a role in disk formation, evolution, and the possibility of (sub)stellar companion formation, are significantly different. We search for the mm counterparts of four intermediate- to high-mass (4-10 Solar mass) young stellar objects (YSOs) in the giant Hii region M17 at a distance of 1.7 kpc. These objects expose their photospheric spectrum such that their location on the pre-main-sequence (PMS) is well established. They have a circumstellar disk that is likely remnant of the formation process. With ALMA we have detected, for the first time, these four YSOs in M17, in Band 6 and 7, as well as four other serendipitous objects. Besides the flux measurements, the source size and spectral index provide important constraints on the physical mechanism(s) producing the observed emission. We apply different models to estimate the dust and gas mass contained in the disks. All our detections are spatially unresolved, constraining the source size to &lt;120 au, and have a spectral index in the range 0.5-2.7. The derived (upper limits on the) disk dust masses are on the order of a few Earth masses and estimations of the upper limits on the gas mass vary between $10^{-5}$ and $10^{-3}$ Solar mass. In two objects (B331 and B268) free-free emission indicates the presence of ionized material around the star. The four serendipitous detections are likely (low-mass) YSOs. We compare the derived disk masses of our M17 targets to those obtained for YSOs in low-mass star-forming regions (SFRs) and Herbig stars, as a function of stellar mass, age, luminosity, and outer disk radius. The M17 sample, though small, is both the most massive and the youngest sample, yet has the lowest mean disk mass.</description>

      <title>The Eclipsing Binaries via Artificial Intelligence. II. Need for Speed in PHOEBE Forward Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In modern astronomy, the quantity of data collected has vastly exceeded the capacity for manual analysis, necessitating the use of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to assist scientists with the most labor-intensive tasks. AI can optimize simulation codes where computational bottlenecks arise from the time required to generate forward models. One such example is PHOEBE, a modeling code for eclipsing binaries (EBs), where simulating individual systems is feasible, but analyzing observables for extensive parameter combinations is highly time-consuming.
  To address this, we present a fully connected feedforward artificial neural network (ANN) trained on a dataset of over one million synthetic light curves generated with PHOEBE. Optimization of the ANN architecture yielded a model with six hidden layers, each containing 512 nodes, provides an optimized balance between accuracy and computational complexity. Extensive testing enabled us to establish ANN's applicability limits and to quantify the systematic and statistical errors associated with using such networks for EB analysis. Our findings demonstrate the critical role of dilution effects in parameter estimation for EBs, and we outline methods to incorporate these effects in AI-based models.
  This proposed ANN framework enables a speedup of over four orders of magnitude compared to traditional methods, with systematic errors not exceeding 1\%, and often as low as 0.01\%, across the entire parameter space.</description>

      <title>Towards advanced forecasting of solar energetic particle events with the PARASOL model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gradual solar energetic particle (SEP) events are generally attributed to the particle acceleration in shock waves driven by coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Space-weather effects of such events are important, so there has been continuous effort to develop models able to forecast their various characteristics. Here we present the first version of a new such model with the primary goal to address energetic storm particle (ESP) events. The model, PARASOL, is built upon the PArticle Radiation Asset Directed at Interplanetary Space Exploration (PARADISE) test-particle simulation model of SEP transport, but includes a semi-analytical description of an inner (i.e., near the shock) part of the foreshock region. The semi-analytical foreshock description is constructed using simulations with the SOLar Particle Acceleration in Coronal Shocks (SOLPACS) model, which simulates proton acceleration self-consistently coupled with Alfven wave generation upstream of the shock, and subsequent fitting of the simulation results with suitable analytical functions. PARASOL requires input of solar wind and shock magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) parameters. We evaluate the performance of PARASOL by simulating the 12 July 2012 SEP event, using the EUropean Heliospheric FORecasting Information Asset (EUHFORIA) MHD simulation of the solar wind and CME in this event. The PARASOL simulation has reproduced the observed ESP event ($E \lesssim 5$ MeV) in the close vicinity of the shock within one order of magnitude in intensity.</description>

      <title>A 22-Year Cycle of the Network Topology for Solar Active Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, solar cycles 21 to 24 were compared using complex network analysis. A network was constructed for these four solar cycles to facilitate the comparison. In these networks, the nodes represent the active regions of the Sun that emit flares, and the connections correspond to the sequence of solar flares over time. This resulted in a directed network with self-connections allowed. The model proposed by Abe and Suzuki for earthquake networks was followed. The incoming degree for each node was calculated, and the degree distribution was analyzed. It was found that for each solar cycle, the degree distribution follows a power law, indicating that solar flares tend to appear in correlated active zones rather than being evenly distributed. Additionally, a variation in the characteristic exponent {\gamma} for each cycle was observed, with higher values in even cycles compared to odd cycles. A more detailed analysis was performed by constructing 11-year networks and shifting them in one-year intervals. This revealed that the characteristic exponent shows a period of approximately 22 years coincident with the Hale cycle, suggesting that the complex networks provide information about the solar magnetic activity.</description>

      <title>Constraining the inner boundaries of COCONUT through plasma \b{eta} and Alfv\'en speed</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Space weather modelling has been gaining importance due to our increasing dependency on technology sensitive to space weather effects, such as satellite services, air traffic and power grids. Improving the reliability, accuracy and numerical performance of space weather modelling tools, including global coronal models, is essential to develop timely and accurate forecasts and to help partly mitigate the space weather threat. Global corona models, however, require accurate boundary conditions, for the formulations of which we have very limited observational data. Unsuitable boundary condition prescriptions may lead to inconsistent features in the solution flow field and spoil the code's accuracy and performance. In this paper, we develop an adjustment to the inner boundary condition of the COCONUT global corona model to better capture the dynamics over and around the regions of stronger magnetic fields by constraining the plasma \b{eta} and the Alfv\'en speed. Using data from solar observations and solar atmospheric modelling codes such as Bifrost, we find that the baseline homogeneous boundary condition formulations for pressure and density do not capture the plasma conditions physically accurately. We develop a method to adjust these prescribed pressure and density values by placing constraints on the plasma \b{eta} and the Alfv\'en speed that act as proxies. We demonstrate that we can remove inexplicable fast streams from the solution by constraining the maximum Alfv\'en speed and the minimum plasma \b{eta} on the boundary surface. We also show that the magnetic topology is not significantly affected by this treatment otherwise. The presented technique shows the potential to ease the modelling of solar maxima, especially removing inexplicable features while, at the same time, not significantly affecting the magnetic field topology around the affected regions.</description>

      <title>OB associations: from stellar to galactic scales</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-density and unbound stellar groups, OB associations have been historically delineated through their bright and massive members. They have been analysed for decades, but the arrival of Hipparcos, and more recently of Gaia led to a change of paradigm by allowing the identification of more reliable members using parallaxes and proper motions. This renewed interest offers an opportunity to emphasize the role of OB associations across many areas of astronomy. In this review, I highlight their importance across multiple scales: how OB associations constitute suitable sites to study massive stars and stellar multiplicity, their relation with star clusters, their interactions with the interstellar medium through the feedback of their massive members, and how they shape the structure and evolution of the Milky Way and beyond.</description>

      <title>Timing of Seven Isolated Pulsars in the Globular Cluster Terzan 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Globular clusters host large populations of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) due to their high gravitational encounter rates, producing many binary systems and thus MSPs via the recycling process. Seven pulsars with spin periods ranging from 3 ms to 134 ms have been discovered in Terzan 1, which was targeted for pulsar searches with the Green Bank Telescope after Australia Telescope Compact Array imaging revealed steep-spectrum point sources in the cluster core. We have obtained timing observations over seven years, for the first seven Green Bank Telescope (GBT) discoveries (Terzan 1 A through G), using the GBT and Murriyang, CSIRO's Parkes radio telescope. All seven pulsars are isolated, consistent with Terzan 1's classification as a core-collapsed cluster (core collapse is predicted to disrupt, or ionize, binaries). With these timing solutions, we measured the positions and observed period derivatives, dP/dt, for each pulsar. The measured dP/dt values are composed of intrinsic spin-down and accelerations experienced by the pulsars (primarily from the cluster's gravitational potential), and they can be used to infer line-of-sight accelerations. We attempted to constrain the radius and density of the cluster core using these inferred accelerations. A wide range of radii and densities are possible, pointing to the need for continued timing as well as new discoveries to better constrain these cluster properties. We additionally find that Ter 1 A may be younger than the cluster and thus may have formed via a formation channel other than a core-collapse supernova. Theoretical formation mechanisms such as electron-capture supernovae from accretion- or merger-induced collapse of white dwarfs could potentially explain these pulsars' origins. It may therefore be a member of a small but growing class of globular cluster pulsars that appear to be significantly younger than their host clusters.</description>

      <title>Jitter Across 15 Years: Leveraging Precise Photometry from Kepler and TESS to Extract Exoplanets from Radial Velocity Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar activity contamination of radial velocity (RV) data is one of the top challenges plaguing the field of extreme precision RV (EPRV) science. Previous work has shown that photometry can be very effective at removing such signals from RV data, especially stellar activity caused by rotating star spots and plage.The exact utility of photometry for removing RV activity contamination, and the best way to apply it, is not well known. We present a combination photometric and RV study of eight Kepler/K2 FGK stars with known stellar variability. We use NEID RVs acquired simultaneously with TESS photometry, and we perform injection recovery tests to quantify the efficacy of recent TESS photometry versus archival Kepler/K2 photometry for removing stellar variability from RVs. We additionally experiment with different TESS sectors when training our models in order to quantify the real benefit of simultaneously acquired RVs and photometry. We conclude that Kepler photometry typically performs better than TESS at removing noise from RV data when it is available, likely due to longer baseline and precision. In contrast, for targets with available K2 photometry, especially those most active, and with high precision ($\sigma_{NEID}$ $&lt;$ 1 m s$^{-1}$) NEID RVs, TESS may be the more informative dataset. However, contrary to expectations, we have found that training on simultaneous photometry does not always achieve the best results.</description>

      <title>The SOFIA Massive (SOMA) Star Formation Survey. V. Clustered Protostars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present $\sim8-40\,\mu$m SOFIA-FORCAST images of seven regions of ``clustered" star formation as part of the SOFIA Massive (SOMA) Star Formation Survey. We identify a total of 34 protostar candidates and build their spectral energy distributions (SEDs). We fit these SEDs with a grid of radiative transfer models based on the Turbulent Core Accretion (TCA) theory to derive key protostellar properties, including initial core mass, $M_c$, clump environment mass surface density, $\Sigma_{\rm cl}$, and current protostellar mass, $m_*$. We also carry out empirical graybody (GB) estimation of $\Sigma_{\rm cl}$, which allows a case of restricted SED fitting within the TCA model grid. We also release version 2.0 of the open-source Python package \emph{sedcreator}, designed to automate the aperture photometry and SED building and fitting process for sources in clustered environments, where flux contamination from close neighbors typically complicates the process. Using these updated methods, SED fitting yields values of $M_c\sim30-200\:M_{\odot}$, $\Sigma_{\text{cl,SED}}\sim0.1-3\:{\rm{g\:cm}}^{-2}$, and $m_*\sim4-50\:M_{\odot}$. The graybody fitting yields smaller values of $\Sigma_{\text{cl,GB}}\lesssim1\:{\rm{g\:cm}}^{-2}$. From these results, we do not find evidence for a critical $\Sigma_{\rm{cl}}$ needed to form massive ($\gtrsim 8\:M_\odot$) stars. However, we do find tentative evidence for a dearth of the most massive ($m_*\gtrsim30\:M_\odot$) protostars in the clustered regions suggesting a potential impact of environment on the stellar initial mass function.</description>

      <title>Modelling chemical clocks -- Theoretical evidences of the space and time evolution of [s/alpha] in the Galactic disc with Gaia-ESO survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chemical clocks based on [s-process elements/alpha-elements] ratios are widely used to estimate ages of Galactic stellar populations. However, the [s/alpha] vs. age relations are not universal, varying with metallicity, location in the Galactic disc, and specific s-process elements. Current Galactic chemical evolution models struggle to reproduce the observed [s/alpha] increase at young ages. We provide chemical evolution models for the Milky Way disc to identify the conditions required to reproduce the observed [s/H], [s/Fe], and [s/alpha] vs. age relations. We adopt a multi-zone chemical evolution model including state-of-the-art nucleosynthesis prescriptions for neutron-capture elements (AGB stars, rotating massive stars, neutron star mergers, magneto-driven supernovae). We explore variations in gas infall, AGB yield dependencies on progenitor stars, and rotational velocity distributions for massive stars. Results are compared with open cluster data from the Gaia-ESO survey. A three-infall scenario for disc formation captures the rise of [s/alpha] with age in the outer regions but fails in the inner ones, especially for second s-process peak elements. Ba production in the last 3 Gyr of chemical evolution would need to increase by half to match observations. S-process contributions from low-mass AGB stars improve predictions but require increases not supported by nucleosynthesis calculations, even with potential i-process contribution. Variations in the metallicity dependence of AGB yields show inconsistent effects across elements. Distributions of massive star rotational velocities fail to improve results due to balanced effects on elements. We confirm that there is no single relationship [s/alpha] vs. age, but that it varies along the MW disc. Current prescriptions for neutron-capture element yields cannot fully capture the complexity of evolution, particularly in the inner disc.</description>

      <title>The Fate of Oceans on First-Generation Planets Orbiting White Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several groups have recently suggested that small planets orbiting very closely around white dwarf stars could be promising locations for life to arise, even after stellar death. There are still many uncertainties, however, regarding the existence and habitability of these worlds. Here, we consider the retention of water during post-main-sequence evolution of a Sun-like star, and during the subsequent migration of planets to the white dwarf's habitable zone. This inward migration is driven by dynamical mechanisms such as planet-planet interactions in packed systems, which can excite planets to high eccentricities, setting the initial conditions for tidal migration into short-period orbits. In order for water to persist on the surfaces of planets orbiting white dwarfs, the water must first survive the AGB phase of stellar evolution, then avoid being lost due to photoevaporation due to X-ray and extreme ultraviolet (XUV) radiation from the newly-formed white dwarf, and then finally survive the tidal migration of the planet inwards to the habitable zone. We find that while this journey will likely desiccate large swaths of post-main-sequence planetary systems, planets with substantial reservoirs of water may retain some surface water, especially if their migration occurs at later white dwarf cooling ages. Therefore, although stellar evolution may pose a challenge for the retention of water on exoplanet surfaces, it is possible for planets to retain surface oceans even as their host stars die and their orbits evolve.</description>

      <title>Lessons from the high-resolution spectroscopy of AW UMa and Epsilon CrA: Is the Lucy model valid?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00155v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A re-examination of high-resolution spectral monitoring of the W UMa-type binaries AW UMa and Epsilon CrA casts doubt on the widely utilized Lucy (1968a, 1968b) model of contact binaries. The detection of the very faint profile of the secondary component in AW UMa leads to a new spectroscopic determination of the mass ratio, q(sp) = 0.092 +/- 0.007, which is close to the previous, medium-resolution spectroscopic result of Pribulla &amp; Rucinski (2008), q(sp) = 0.101 +/- 0.006, and remains substantially different from a cluster of generally accepted photometric results by several authors, concentrated around q(ph) = 0.080 +/- 0.005. The two approaches are independent, with the spectroscopic technique being more direct yet more demanding on telescope/spectrograph resources, while the photometric determinations are accessible to smaller telescopes but entirely dependent on the Lucy model. A survey of binaries with the best-determined values of the mass ratio shows a common tendency for q(ph) &lt; q(sp). The tendency for systematically smaller values of q(ph) may result from the overfilling of the primary lobe and underfilling of the secondary lobe relative to the Roche model geometry, as predicted by the Stepien (2009) model; the tendency may be variable in time. Despite the observed moderate inter-systemic velocities, the photometric Lucy model may remain useful in providing approximate, though biased, results for the mass ratio. A complicating factor in detailed spectral analysis may be the occurrence of Enhanced Spectral-line Perturbations (ESP) projected over the secondary profiles, appearing in different numbers in the two studied binaries. The ESPs are tentatively identified within the Stepien model as collision fronts or fountains of hot, primary-component gas from the circumbinary, energy-carrying flow.</description>

      <title>$1/f$ Noise in the Heliosphere: A Target for PUNCH Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a broad review of 1/f noise observations in the heliosphere, and discuss and complement the theoretical background of generic 1/f models as relevant to NASA's PUNCH mission. First observed in the voltage fluctuations of vacuum tubes, the scale-invariant 1/f spectrum has since been identified across a wide array of natural and artificial systems, including heart rate fluctuations and loudness patterns in musical compositions. In the solar wind, the interplanetary magnetic field trace spectrum exhibits 1/f scaling within the frequency range from around 2e-6 Hz to around 1e-3 Hz at 1 au. One compelling mechanism for the generation of 1/f noise is the superposition principle, where a composite 1/f spectrum arises from the superposition of a collection of individual power-law spectra characterized by a scale-invariant distribution of correlation times. In the context of the solar wind, such a superposition could originate from scale-invariant reconnection processes in the corona. Further observations have detected 1/f signatures in the photosphere and corona at frequency ranges compatible with those observed at 1 au, suggesting an even lower altitude origin of 1/f spectrum in the solar dynamo itself. This hypothesis is bolstered by dynamo experiments and simulations that indicate inverse cascade activities, which can be linked to successive flux tube reconnections beneath the corona, and are known to generate 1/f noise possibly through nonlocal interactions at the largest scales. Conversely, models positing in situ generation of $1/f$ signals face causality issues in explaining the low-frequency portion of the 1/f spectrum. Understanding 1/f noise in the solar wind may inform central problems in heliospheric physics, such as the solar dynamo, coronal heating, the origin of the solar wind, and the nature of interplanetary turbulence.</description>

      <title>Cosmic ray north-south anisotropy: rigidity spectrum and solar cycle variations observed by ground-based muon detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03182v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The north-south (NS) anisotropy of galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) is dominated by a diamagnetic drift flow of GCRs in the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF), allowing us to derive key parameters of cosmic-ray propagation, such as the density gradient and diffusion coefficient. We propose a new method to analyze the rigidity spectrum of GCR anisotropy and reveal a solar cycle variation of the NS anisotropy's spectrum using ground-based muon detectors in Nagoya, Japan, and Hobart, Australia. The physics-based correction method for the atmospheric temperature effect on muons is used to combine the different-site detectors free from local atmospheric effects. NS channel pairs in the multi-directional muon detectors are formed to enhance sensitivity to the NS anisotropy, and in this process, general graph matching in graph theory is introduced to survey optimized pairs. Moreover, Bayesian estimation with the Gaussian process allows us to unfold the rigidity spectrum without supposing any analytical function for the spectral shape. Thanks to these novel approaches, it has been discovered that the rigidity spectrum of the NS anisotropy is dynamically varying with solar activity every year. It is attributed to a rigidity-dependent variation of the radial density gradient of GCRs based on the nature of the diamagnetic drift in the IMF. The diffusion coefficient and mean-free-path length of GCRs as functions of the rigidity are also derived from the diffusion-convection flow balance. This analysis expands the estimation limit of the mean-free-path length into $\le200$ GV rigidity region from $&lt;10$ GV region achieved by solar energetic particle observations.</description>

      <title>First Resolution of Microlensed Images of a Binary-Lens Event</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13015v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We resolve the multiple images of the binary-lens microlensing event ASASSN-22av using the GRAVITY instrument of the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI). The light curves show weak binary-lens perturbations, complicating the analysis, but the joint modeling with the VLTI data breaks several degeneracies, arriving at a strongly favored solution. Thanks to precise measurements of angular Einstein radius \theta_E = 0.724 +/- 0.002 mas and microlens parallax, we determine that the lens system consists of two M dwarfs with masses of M_1 = 0.258 +/- 0.008 M_sun and M_2 = 0.130 +/- 0.007 M_sun, a projected separation of r_\perp = 6.83 +/- 0.31 au and a distance of D_L = 2.29 +/- 0.08 kpc. The successful VLTI observations of ASASSN-22av open up a new path for studying intermediate-separation (i.e., a few astronomical units) stellar-mass binaries, including those containing dark compact objects such as neutron stars and stellar-mass black holes.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Field Geometry and Anisotropic Scattering Effects on Solar Radio Burst Observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19630v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fine structures of solar radio bursts reveal complex dynamics in the corona, yet the observed characteristics of these sub-second bursts are additionally complicated by radio wave scattering in the turbulent solar corona. We examine the impact of anisotropic turbulence in radio-wave propagation simulations with non-radial magnetic field structures in shaping the morphology, time-characteristics, and source position of fine structures. The apparent sources are found to move along the direction of the magnetic-field lines and not along the density gradient, whereas the major axis of the scattered source is perpendicular to the local magnetic field (the scattering anisotropy axis). Using a dipolar magnetic field structure of an active region, we reproduce observed radio fine structure source motion parallel to the solar limb associated with a coronal loop and provide a natural explanation for puzzling observations of solar radio burst position motions with LOFAR. Furthermore, the anisotropy aligned with a dipolar magnetic field causes the apparent source images to bifurcate into two distinct components, with characteristic sizes smaller than in unmagnetized media. The temporal broadening induced by scattering reduces the observed frequency drift rate of fine structures, depending on the contribution of scattering to the time profile. The findings underscore the role of magnetic field geometry and anisotropic scattering for the interpretation of solar radio bursts and highlight that anisotropic scattering produces more than a single source.</description>

      <title>Protoplanetary discs around sun-like stars appear to live longer when the metallicity is low</title>

Abstract: Previous Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations of the star-forming cluster NGC 346 in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) had revealed a large population of pre-main sequence (PMS) candidates, characterised by Halpha excess emission in their photometry. However, without access to spectroscopy, the nature of these objects remained unclear. Using the NIRSpec instrument on board JWST, we studied a sample of these stars, with masses in the range ~0.9-1.8 Msun, effective temperatures in the range 4,500-8,000 K, and PMS ages between ~0.1 and 30 Myr. Here we present the first spectra of solar-mass PMS stars in the metal-poor SMC (Z=1/8 Zsun) and discuss the physical properties of ten representative sources with good signal-to-noise ratio. The observations indicate that even the oldest of these PMS candidates are still accreting gas with typical rates of ~10^{-8} Msun/yr for stars older than ~10 Myr, confirming their PMS nature. The spectra also reveal near-infrared excess and molecular hydrogen excitation lines consistent with the presence of discs around these stars. These findings suggest that in a low-metallicity environment circumstellar discs can live longer than previously thought.</description>

      <title>Transient electromagnetic sources can detect solitary black holes in Milky Way galaxy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02790v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Milky Way galaxy is estimated to host up to a billion stellar-mass solitary black holes (BHs). The number and distribution of BH masses can provide crucial information about the processes involved in BH formation, the existence of primordial BHs, and the interpretation of gravitational wave (GW) signals detected in LIGO-VIRGO-KAGRA. {Sahu et al. recently confirmed one solitary stellar-mass BH in our galaxy using astrometric microlensing}. This work proposes a novel mechanism to identify such BH by analyzing the frequency and damping of the quasi-normal modes of GW generated from the interaction of the BH and EM wave originating from a transient electromagnetic (TEM) source. The incoming EM waves distort the curvature of a BH, releasing GWs as it returns to a steady state. Using the covariant semi-tetrad formalism, we quantify the generated GWs via the \emph{Regge-Wheeler tensor} and relate the GW amplitude to the energy of the TEM. We demonstrate that isolated BHs at a distance of 50 pc from Earth can be detected by LIGO A+ and 100 pc by Cosmic Explorer/Einstein Telescope. Additionally, we discuss the observational implications for orphan afterglows associated with GRBs, highlighting the potential for further discoveries.</description>

Abstract: Dwarf galaxy streams encode vast amounts of information essential to understanding early galaxy formation and nucleosynthesis channels. Due to the variation in the timescales of star formation history in their progenitors, stellar streams serve as `snapshots' that record different stages of galactic chemical evolution. This study focusses on the Cetus stream, stripped from a low-mass dwarf galaxy. We carried out a comprehensive analysis of the chemical composition of 22 member stars based on their high-resolution spectra. We derived abundances for up to 28 chemical species from C to Dy and, for 20 of them, we account for the departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium. We confirm that the Cetus stream has a mean metallicity of [Fe/H] = $-2.11$ $\pm$ 0.21. All observed Cetus stars are $\alpha$ enhanced with [$\alpha$/Fe] $\simeq$ 0.3. The absence of the $\alpha$-`knee' implies that star formation stopped before iron production in type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) became substantial. Neutron capture element abundances suggest that both the rapid (r-) and the main slow (s-) processes contributed to their origin. The decrease in [Eu/Ba] from a typical r-process value of [Eu/Ba] = 0.7 to 0.3 with increasing [Ba/H] indicates a distinct contribution of the r- and s-processes to the chemical composition of different Cetus stars. For barium, the r-process contribution varies from 100 % to 20 % in different sample stars, with an average value of 50 %. Our abundance analysis indicates that the star formation in the Cetus progenitor ceased after the onset of the main s-process in low- to intermediate-mass asymptotic giant branch stars but before SNe Ia played an important role. A distinct evolution scenario is revealed by comparing the abundances in the Ursa Minor dwarf spheroidal galaxy, showing the diversity in the chemical evolution of low-mass dwarf galaxies.</description>

      <title>An HST Transmission Spectrum of the Closest M-Dwarf Transiting Rocky Planet LTT 1445Ab</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Which rocky exoplanets have atmospheres? This presumably simply question is the first that must be answered to understand the prevalence of nearby habitable planets. A mere 6.9 pc from Earth, LTT 1445A is the closest transiting M-dwarf system, and its largest known planet, at $\rm 1.31\; R_{\oplus}$ and 424 K, is one of the most promising targets in which to search for an atmosphere. We use HST/WFC3 transmission spectroscopy with the G280 and G141 grisms to study the spectrum of LTT 1445Ab between $\rm 0.2-1.65\;\mu m$. In doing so, we uncover a UV flare on the neighboring star LTT 1445C that is completely invisible at optical wavelengths; we report one of the first simultaneous near-UV/optical spectra of an M~dwarf flare. The planet spectrum is consistent with a flat line (with median transit depth uncertainties of 128 and 52 ppm for the G280 and G141 observations, respectively), though the infrared portion displays potential features that could be explained by known opacity sources such as HCN. Some atmospheric retrievals weakly favor ($\sim2\sigma$) an atmosphere, but it remains challenging to discern between stellar contamination, an atmosphere, and a featureless spectrum at this time. We do, however, confidently rule out $\leq100\times$ solar metallicity atmospheres. Although stellar contamination retrievals cannot fit the infrared features well, the overall spectrum is consistent with stellar contamination from hot or cold spots. Based on the UV/optical data, we place limits on the extent of stellar variability expected in the near-infrared ($30-40$ ppm), which will be critical for future JWST observations.</description>

      <title>Planetary migration in wind-fed non-stationary accretion disks in binary systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20556v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An accretion disk can be formed around a secondary star in a binary system when the primary companion leaves the Main sequence and starts to lose mass at an enhanced rate. We study the accretion disk evolution and planetary migration in wide binaries. We use a numerical model of a non-stationary alpha-disk with a variable mass inflow. We take into account that the low-mass disk has an extended region that is optically thin along the rotation axis. We consider irradiation by both the host star and the donor. The migration path of a planet in such a disk is determined by the migration rate varying during the disk evolution. Giant planets may open/close the gap several times over the disk lifetime. We identify the new type of migration specific to parts of the growing disk with a considerable radial gradient of an aspect ratio. Its rate is enclosed between the type 2 and the fast type 1 migration rates being determined by the ratio of time and radial derivatives of the disk aspect ratio. Rapid growth of the wind rate just before the envelope loss by the donor leads to the formation of a zone of decretion, which may lead to substantial outward migration. In binaries with an initial separation $a\lesssim 100$\,AU migration becomes most efficient for planets with 60--80 Earth masses. This results in approaching a short distance from the host star where tidal forces become non-negligible. Less massive Neptune-like planets at the initial orbits $r_\mathrm{p} \lesssim 2$\,AU can reach these internal parts in binaries with $a \lesssim 30$\,AU. In binaries, mass loss by the primary component at late evolutionary stages can significantly modify the structure of a planetary system around the secondary component resulting in mergers of relatively massive planets with a host star.</description>

      <title>From Misaligned Sub-Saturns to Aligned Brown Dwarfs: The Highest $M_{\rm p}/M{_*}$ Systems Exhibit Low Obliquities, Even around Hot Stars</title>

Abstract: We present a pattern emerging from stellar obliquity measurements in single-star systems: planets with high planet-to-star mass ratios ($M_{\rm p}/M{_*}$$&gt;$ $2\times10^{-3}$) -- such as super-Jupiters, brown dwarf companions, and M-dwarfs hosting Jupiter-like planets -- tend to be aligned, even around hot stars. This alignment represents a 3.7$\sigma$ deviation from the obliquity distribution observed in systems with lower mass ratios ($M_{\rm p}/M{_*}$$&lt;$ $2\times10^{-3}$), which predominantly include Jupiters and sub-Saturns. The only known outlier system, XO-3, exhibits misalignment confirmed via our newly collected Rossiter-McLaughlin effect measurement ($\lambda=41.8^{+2.1}_{-2.0}$ degrees). However, the relatively large $\textit{Gaia}$ Renormalized Unit Weight Error (RUWE) of XO-3 suggests that it may harbor an undetected binary companion, potentially contributing to its misalignment. Given that tidal realignment mechanisms are weak for hot stars, the observed alignment in high $M_{\rm p}/M{_*}$ systems is likely $\textit{primordial}$ rather than resulting from tidal interactions. One possible explanation is that only dynamically isolated planets can continue accreting gas and evolve into super-Jupiters while maintaining their primordial alignment. Conversely, planets formed in compact configurations may be unable to grow beyond the gap-opening mass, for which our work suggests an empirical boundary $M_{\rm p}/M{_*}$$=$ $2\times10^{-3}$, identified between aligned high $M_{\rm p}/M{_*}$ systems and misaligned low $M_{\rm p}/M{_*}$ systems, with dynamical instabilities contributing to the diverse spin-orbit misalignments observed in the latter.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Galactic Winds in M82 I: the recent starburst and launch of outflow in simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09452v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the launch of the galactic outflow in M82 through hydrodynamic simulations. Employing a sink-particle module, we self-consistently resolve the star formation and feedback processes, avoiding the reliance on various assumed models. We probe the effects of different stellar feedback mechanisms, gas return from star-forming clouds and gas disc mass on the starburst and outflow. Our simulations can generate a starburst that lasts $\sim25$ Myr, peaking at 20-50 $\rm{M_{\odot} yr^{-1}}$. However, the total stellar mass formed in the starburst often exceeds M82's estimated value. The outflow's launch occurs in two stages. Initially, continuous SNe explosions form small bubbles, merging into a super bubble foam composed of warm/hot gas and high-density cool filaments. After $\sim10$ Myr of SN injection, the super bubble breakout the disc, marking the second stage, which takes $\sim15$ Myr to develop a kpc-scale outflow. Our simulations reveal that cool filaments within the ISM can survive from the stellar feedback, then were entrained into the outflow and stretched to hundreds pc in length. While the mass loading factor of the well-developed outflow is comparable to M82, the cool gas mass outflow rate is often lower, and its velocity is slower than the estimated value in M82 by $\sim60\%$. Warm and hot gas are $\sim25\%$ slower. SN feedback acts as the primary driver of the outflow, while gas return significantly influences the starburst and outflow. Other factors have moderate effects. To address the shortcoming in our results, enhanced SN feedback effect due to clustered SNe is likely necessary.</description>
