      <title>Algorithmic contiguity from low-degree conjecture and applications in correlated random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, assuming a natural strengthening of the low-degree conjecture, we provide evidence of computational hardness for two problems: (1) the (partial) matching recovery problem in the sparse correlated Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs $\mathcal G(n,q;\rho)$ when the edge-density $q=n^{-1+o(1)}$ and the correlation $\rho&lt;\sqrt{\alpha}$ lies below the Otter's threshold, solving a remaining problem in \cite{DDL23+}; (2) the detection problem between the correlated sparse stochastic block model $\mathcal S(n,\tfrac{\lambda}{n};k,\epsilon;s)$ and a pair of independent stochastic block models $\mathcal S(n,\tfrac{\lambda s}{n};k,\epsilon)$ when $\epsilon^2 \lambda s&lt;1$ lies below the Kesten-Stigum (KS) threshold and $s&lt;\sqrt{\alpha}$ lies below the Otter's threshold, solving a remaining problem in \cite{CDGL24+}.
  One of the main ingredient in our proof is to derive certain forms of \emph{algorithmic contiguity} between two probability measures based on bounds on their low-degree advantage. To be more precise, consider the high-dimensional hypothesis testing problem between two probability measures $\mathbb{P}$ and $\mathbb{Q}$ based on the sample $\mathsf Y$. We show that if the low-degree advantage $\mathsf{Adv}_{\leq D} \big( \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbb{P}}{\mathrm{d}\mathbb{Q}} \big)=O(1)$, then (assuming the low-degree conjecture) there is no efficient algorithm $\mathcal A$ such that $\mathbb{Q}(\mathcal A(\mathsf Y)=0)=1-o(1)$ and $\mathbb{P}(\mathcal A(\mathsf Y)=1)=\Omega(1)$. This framework provides a useful tool for performing reductions between different inference tasks.</description>

      <title>On Volume Minimization in Conformal Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the question of volume optimality in split conformal regression, a topic still poorly understood in comparison to coverage control. Using the fact that the calibration step can be seen as an empirical volume minimization problem, we first derive a finite-sample upper-bound on the excess volume loss of the interval returned by the classical split method. This important quantity measures the difference in length between the interval obtained with the split method and the shortest oracle prediction interval. Then, we introduce EffOrt, a methodology that modifies the learning step so that the base prediction function is selected in order to minimize the length of the returned intervals. In particular, our theoretical analysis of the excess volume loss of the prediction sets produced by EffOrt reveals the links between the learning and calibration steps, and notably the impact of the choice of the function class of the base predictor. We also introduce Ad-EffOrt, an extension of the previous method, which produces intervals whose size adapts to the value of the covariate. Finally, we evaluate the empirical performance and the robustness of our methodologies.</description>

      <title>Estimation of the Learning Coefficient Using Empirical Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The learning coefficient plays a crucial role in analyzing the performance of information criteria, such as the Widely Applicable Information Criterion (WAIC) and the Widely Applicable Bayesian Information Criterion (WBIC), which Sumio Watanabe developed to assess model generalization ability. In regular statistical models, the learning coefficient is given by d/2, where d is the dimension of the parameter space. More generally, it is defined as the absolute value of the pole order of a zeta function derived from the Kullback-Leibler divergence and the prior distribution. However, except for specific cases such as reduced-rank regression, the learning coefficient cannot be derived in a closed form. Watanabe proposed a numerical method to estimate the learning coefficient, which Imai further refined to enhance its convergence properties. These methods utilize the asymptotic behavior of WBIC and have been shown to be statistically consistent as the sample size grows. In this paper, we propose a novel numerical estimation method that fundamentally differs from previous approaches and leverages a new quantity, "Empirical Loss," which was introduced by Watanabe. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed method exhibits both lower bias and lower variance compared to those of Watanabe and Imai. Additionally, we provide a theoretical analysis that elucidates why our method outperforms existing techniques and present empirical evidence that supports our findings.</description>

      <title>Improved Online Confidence Bounds for Multinomial Logistic Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10020v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an improved online confidence bound for multinomial logistic (MNL) models and apply this result to MNL bandits, achieving variance-dependent optimal regret. Recently, Lee &amp; Oh (2024) established an online confidence bound for MNL models and achieved nearly minimax-optimal regret in MNL bandits. However, their results still depend on the norm-boundedness of the unknown parameter $B$ and the maximum size of possible outcomes $K$. To address this, we first derive an online confidence bound of $O\left(\sqrt{d \log t} + B \right)$, which is a significant improvement over the previous bound of $O (B \sqrt{d} \log t \log K )$ (Lee &amp; Oh, 2024). This is mainly achieved by establishing tighter self-concordant properties of the MNL loss and introducing a novel intermediary term to bound the estimation error. Using this new online confidence bound, we propose a constant-time algorithm, OFU-MNL++, which achieves a variance-dependent regret bound of $O \Big( d \log T \sqrt{ \smash[b]{\sum_{t=1}^T} \sigma_t^2 } \Big) $ for sufficiently large $T$, where $\sigma_t^2$ denotes the variance of the rewards at round $t$, $d$ is the dimension of the contexts, and $T$ is the total number of rounds. Furthermore, we introduce a Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)-based algorithm, OFU-MN$^2$L, which achieves an anytime poly(B)-free regret of $O \Big( d \log (BT) \sqrt{ \smash[b]{\sum_{t=1}^T} \sigma_t^2 } \Big) $.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial Reinforcement Learning with Preference Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider combinatorial reinforcement learning with preference feedback, where a learning agent sequentially offers an action--an assortment of multiple items to--a user, whose preference feedback follows a multinomial logistic (MNL) model. This framework allows us to model real-world scenarios, particularly those involving long-term user engagement, such as in recommender systems and online advertising. However, this framework faces two main challenges: (1) the unknown value of each item, unlike traditional MNL bandits that only address single-step preference feedback, and (2) the difficulty of ensuring optimism while maintaining tractable assortment selection in the combinatorial action space with unknown values. In this paper, we assume a contextual MNL preference model, where the mean utilities are linear, and the value of each item is approximated by a general function. We propose an algorithm, MNL-VQL, that addresses these challenges, making it both computationally and statistically efficient. As a special case, for linear MDPs (with the MNL preference feedback), we establish the first regret lower bound in this framework and show that MNL-VQL achieves nearly minimax-optimal regret. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to provide statistical guarantees in combinatorial RL with preference feedback.</description>

      <title>AdaPTS: Adapting Univariate Foundation Models to Probabilistic Multivariate Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pre-trained foundation models (FMs) have shown exceptional performance in univariate time series forecasting tasks. However, several practical challenges persist, including managing intricate dependencies among features and quantifying uncertainty in predictions. This study aims to tackle these critical limitations by introducing adapters; feature-space transformations that facilitate the effective use of pre-trained univariate time series FMs for multivariate tasks. Adapters operate by projecting multivariate inputs into a suitable latent space and applying the FM independently to each dimension. Inspired by the literature on representation learning and partially stochastic Bayesian neural networks, we present a range of adapters and optimization/inference strategies. Experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets confirm the efficacy of adapters, demonstrating substantial enhancements in forecasting accuracy and uncertainty quantification compared to baseline methods. Our framework, AdaPTS, positions adapters as a modular, scalable, and effective solution for leveraging time series FMs in multivariate contexts, thereby promoting their wider adoption in real-world applications. We release the code at https://github.com/abenechehab/AdaPTS.</description>

      <title>Generalised Parallel Tempering: Flexible Replica Exchange via Flows and Diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parallel Tempering (PT) is a classical MCMC algorithm designed for leveraging parallel computation to sample efficiently from high-dimensional, multimodal or otherwise complex distributions via annealing. One limitation of the standard formulation of PT is the growth of computational resources required to generate high-quality samples, as measured by effective sample size or round trip rate, for increasingly challenging distributions. To address this issue, we propose the framework: Generalised Parallel Tempering (GePT) which allows for the incorporation of recent advances in modern generative modelling, such as normalising flows and diffusion models, within Parallel Tempering, while maintaining the same theoretical guarantees as MCMC-based methods. For instance, we show that this allows us to utilise diffusion models in a parallelised manner, bypassing the usual computational cost of a large number of steps to generate quality samples. Further, we empirically demonstrate that GePT can improve sample quality and reduce the growth of computational resources required to handle complex distributions over the classical algorithm.</description>

      <title>Single-Step Consistent Diffusion Samplers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sampling from unnormalized target distributions is a fundamental yet challenging task in machine learning and statistics. Existing sampling algorithms typically require many iterative steps to produce high-quality samples, leading to high computational costs that limit their practicality in time-sensitive or resource-constrained settings. In this work, we introduce consistent diffusion samplers, a new class of samplers designed to generate high-fidelity samples in a single step. We first develop a distillation algorithm to train a consistent diffusion sampler from a pretrained diffusion model without pre-collecting large datasets of samples. Our algorithm leverages incomplete sampling trajectories and noisy intermediate states directly from the diffusion process. We further propose a method to train a consistent diffusion sampler from scratch, fully amortizing exploration by training a single model that both performs diffusion sampling and skips intermediate steps using a self-consistency loss. Through extensive experiments on a variety of unnormalized distributions, we show that our approach yields high-fidelity samples using less than 1% of the network evaluations required by traditional diffusion samplers.</description>

      <title>Image Super-Resolution with Guarantees via Conformal Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing use of generative ML foundation models for image super-resolution calls for robust and interpretable uncertainty quantification methods. We address this need by presenting a novel approach based on conformal prediction techniques to create a "confidence mask" capable of reliably and intuitively communicating where the generated image can be trusted. Our method is adaptable to any black-box generative model, including those locked behind an opaque API, requires only easily attainable data for calibration, and is highly customizable via the choice of a local image similarity metric. We prove strong theoretical guarantees for our method that span fidelity error control (according to our local image similarity metric), reconstruction quality, and robustness in the face of data leakage. Finally, we empirically evaluate these results and establish our method's solid performance.</description>

      <title>k-LLMmeans: Summaries as Centroids for Interpretable and Scalable LLM-Based Text Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce k-LLMmeans, a novel modification of the k-means clustering algorithm that utilizes LLMs to generate textual summaries as cluster centroids, thereby capturing contextual and semantic nuances often lost when relying on purely numerical means of document embeddings. This modification preserves the properties of k-means while offering greater interpretability: the cluster centroid is represented by an LLM-generated summary, whose embedding guides cluster assignments. We also propose a mini-batch variant, enabling efficient online clustering for streaming text data and providing real-time interpretability of evolving cluster centroids. Through extensive simulations, we show that our methods outperform vanilla k-means on multiple metrics while incurring only modest LLM usage that does not scale with dataset size. Finally, We present a case study showcasing the interpretability of evolving cluster centroids in sequential text streams. As part of our evaluation, we compile a new dataset from StackExchange, offering a benchmark for text-stream clustering.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional censored MIDAS logistic regression for corporate survival forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of forecasting corporate distress, a problem marked by three key statistical hurdles: (i) right censoring, (ii) high-dimensional predictors, and (iii) mixed-frequency data. To overcome these complexities, we introduce a novel high-dimensional censored MIDAS (Mixed Data Sampling) logistic regression. Our approach handles censoring through inverse probability weighting and achieves accurate estimation with numerous mixed-frequency predictors by employing a sparse-group penalty. We establish finite-sample bounds for the estimation error, accounting for censoring, the MIDAS approximation error, and heavy tails. The superior performance of the method is demonstrated through Monte Carlo simulations. Finally, we present an extensive application of our methodology to predict the financial distress of Chinese-listed firms. Our novel procedure is implemented in the R package 'Survivalml'.</description>

      <title>Solving Empirical Bayes via Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work applies modern AI tools (transformers) to solving one of the oldest statistical problems: Poisson means under empirical Bayes (Poisson-EB) setting. In Poisson-EB a high-dimensional mean vector $\theta$ (with iid coordinates sampled from an unknown prior $\pi$) is estimated on the basis of $X=\mathrm{Poisson}(\theta)$. A transformer model is pre-trained on a set of synthetically generated pairs $(X,\theta)$ and learns to do in-context learning (ICL) by adapting to unknown $\pi$. Theoretically, we show that a sufficiently wide transformer can achieve vanishing regret with respect to an oracle estimator who knows $\pi$ as dimension grows to infinity. Practically, we discover that already very small models (100k parameters) are able to outperform the best classical algorithm (non-parametric maximum likelihood, or NPMLE) both in runtime and validation loss, which we compute on out-of-distribution synthetic data as well as real-world datasets (NHL hockey, MLB baseball, BookCorpusOpen). Finally, by using linear probes, we confirm that the transformer's EB estimator appears to internally work differently from either NPMLE or Robbins' estimators.</description>

      <title>Gradient GA: Gradient Genetic Algorithm for Drug Molecular Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular discovery has brought great benefits to the chemical industry. Various molecule design techniques are developed to identify molecules with desirable properties. Traditional optimization methods, such as genetic algorithms, continue to achieve state-of-the-art results across multiple molecular design benchmarks. However, these techniques rely solely on random walk exploration, which hinders both the quality of the final solution and the convergence speed. To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach called Gradient Genetic Algorithm (Gradient GA), which incorporates gradient information from the objective function into genetic algorithms. Instead of random exploration, each proposed sample iteratively progresses toward an optimal solution by following the gradient direction. We achieve this by designing a differentiable objective function parameterized by a neural network and utilizing the Discrete Langevin Proposal to enable gradient guidance in discrete molecular spaces. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves both convergence speed and solution quality, outperforming cutting-edge techniques. For example, it achieves up to a 25% improvement in the top-10 score over the vanilla genetic algorithm. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/debadyuti23/GradientGA.</description>

      <title>Solvable Dynamics of Self-Supervised Word Embeddings and the Emergence of Analogical Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The remarkable success of large language models relies on their ability to implicitly learn structured latent representations from the pretraining corpus. As a simpler surrogate for representation learning in language modeling, we study a class of solvable contrastive self-supervised algorithms which we term quadratic word embedding models. These models resemble the word2vec algorithm and perform similarly on downstream tasks. Our main contributions are analytical solutions for both the training dynamics (under certain hyperparameter choices) and the final word embeddings, given in terms of only the corpus statistics. Our solutions reveal that these models learn orthogonal linear subspaces one at a time, each one incrementing the effective rank of the embeddings until model capacity is saturated. Training on WikiText, we find that the top subspaces represent interpretable concepts. Finally, we use our dynamical theory to predict how and when models acquire the ability to complete analogies.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Early Warnings using Machine Learning in an Online Game-experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stemming from physics and later applied to other fields such as ecology, the theory of critical transitions suggests that some regime shifts are preceded by statistical early warning signals. Reddit's r/place experiment, a large-scale social game, provides a unique opportunity to test these signals consistently across thousands of subsystems undergoing critical transitions. In r/place, millions of users collaboratively created compositions, or pixel-art drawings, in which transitions occur when one composition rapidly replaces another. We develop a machine-learning-based early warning system that combines the predictive power of multiple system-specific time series via gradient-boosted decision trees with memory-retaining features. Our method significantly outperforms standard early warning indicators. Trained on the 2022 r/place data, our algorithm detects half of the transitions occurring within 20 minutes at a false positive rate of just 3.7%. Its performance remains robust when tested on the 2023 r/place event, demonstrating generalizability across different contexts. Using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) for interpreting the predictions, we investigate the underlying drivers of warnings, which could be relevant to other complex systems, especially online social systems. We reveal an interplay of patterns preceding transitions, such as critical slowing down or speeding up, a lack of innovation or coordination, turbulent histories, and a lack of image complexity. These findings show the potential of machine learning indicators in socio-ecological systems for predicting regime shifts and understanding their dynamics.</description>

      <title>Thinning a Wishart Random Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work has explored data thinning, a generalization of sample splitting that involves decomposing a (possibly matrix-valued) random variable into independent components. In the special case of a $n \times p$ random matrix with independent and identically distributed $N_p(\mu, \Sigma)$ rows, Dharamshi et al. (2024a) provides a comprehensive analysis of the settings in which thinning is or is not possible: briefly, if $\Sigma$ is unknown, then one can thin provided that $n&gt;1$. However, in some situations a data analyst may not have direct access to the data itself. For example, to preserve individuals' privacy, a data bank may provide only summary statistics such as the sample mean and sample covariance matrix. While the sample mean follows a Gaussian distribution, the sample covariance follows (up to scaling) a Wishart distribution, for which no thinning strategies have yet been proposed. In this note, we fill this gap: we show that it is possible to generate two independent data matrices with independent $N_p(\mu, \Sigma)$ rows, based only on the sample mean and sample covariance matrix. These independent data matrices can either be used directly within a train-test paradigm, or can be used to derive independent summary statistics. Furthermore, they can be recombined to yield the original sample mean and sample covariance.</description>

      <title>Statistical modeling of categorical trajectories with multivariate functional principal components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are many examples in which the statistical units of interest are samples of a continuous time categorical random process, that is to say a continuous time stochastic process taking values in a finite state space. Without loosing any information, we associate to each state a binary random function, taking values in $\{0,1\}$, and turn the problem of statistical modeling of a categorical process into a multivariate functional data analysis issue. The (multivariate) covariance operator has nice interpretations in terms of departure from independence of the joint probabilities and the multivariate functional principal components are simple to interpret. Under the weak hypothesis assuming only continuity in probability of the $0-1$ trajectories, it is simple to build consistent estimators of the covariance kernel and perform multivariate functional principal components analysis. The sample paths being piecewise constant, with a finite number of jumps, this a rare case in functional data analysis in which the trajectories can be observed exhaustively. The approach is illustrated on a data set of sensory perceptions, considering different gustometer-controlled stimuli experiments. We show how it can be easily extended to analyze experiments, such as temporal check-all-that-apply, in which two states or more can be observed at the same time.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Generative Modeling of Wireless Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning the distribution of the wireless channel within a specific environment of interest is essential to exploit the full potential of machine learning (ML) for wireless communications and radar applications. Generative modeling offers a promising framework to address this problem. However, existing approaches pose unresolved challenges, including the need for high-quality training data, limited generalizability, and a lack of physical interpretability. To address these issues, we propose a model that combines the physics-related compressibility of wireless channels with sparse Bayesian generative modeling (SBGM) to learn the distribution of the underlying physical channel parameters. By leveraging the sparsity-inducing characteristics of SBGM, our method can learn from compressed observations received by an access point (AP) during default online operation. Moreover, it is physically interpretable and generalizes to arbitrary system configurations without requiring retraining.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Berkeley Admissions data: Statistical Tests for Causal Hypotheses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reasoning about fairness through correlation-based notions is rife with pitfalls. The 1973 University of California, Berkeley graduate school admissions case from Bickel et. al. (1975) is a classic example of one such pitfall, namely Simpson's paradox. The discrepancy in admission rates among males and female applicants, in the aggregate data over all departments, vanishes when admission rates per department are examined. We reason about the Berkeley graduate school admissions case through a causal lens. In the process, we introduce a statistical test for causal hypothesis testing based on Pearl's instrumental-variable inequalities (Pearl 1995). We compare different causal notions of fairness that are based on graphical, counterfactual and interventional queries on the causal model, and develop statistical tests for these notions that use only observational data. We study the logical relations between notions, and show that while notions may not be equivalent, their corresponding statistical tests coincide for the case at hand. We believe that a thorough case-based causal analysis helps develop a more principled understanding of both causal hypothesis testing and fairness.</description>

      <title>Learning to Solve the Min-Max Mixed-Shelves Picker-Routing Problem via Hierarchical and Parallel Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Mixed-Shelves Picker Routing Problem (MSPRP) is a fundamental challenge in warehouse logistics, where pickers must navigate a mixed-shelves environment to retrieve SKUs efficiently. Traditional heuristics and optimization-based approaches struggle with scalability, while recent machine learning methods often rely on sequential decision-making, leading to high solution latency and suboptimal agent coordination. In this work, we propose a novel hierarchical and parallel decoding approach for solving the min-max variant of the MSPRP via multi-agent reinforcement learning. While our approach generates a joint distribution over agent actions, allowing for fast decoding and effective picker coordination, our method introduces a sequential action selection to avoid conflicts in the multi-dimensional action space. Experiments show state-of-the-art performance in both solution quality and inference speed, particularly for large-scale and out-of-distribution instances. Our code is publicly available at http://github.com/LTluttmann/marl4msprp.</description>

      <title>A Latent Causal Inference Framework for Ordinal Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ordinal variables, such as on the Likert scale, are common in applied research. Yet, existing methods for causal inference tend to target nominal or continuous data. When applied to ordinal data, this fails to account for the inherent ordering or imposes well-defined relative magnitudes. Hence, there is a need for specialised methods to compute interventional effects between ordinal variables while accounting for their ordinality. One potential framework is to presume a latent Gaussian Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) model: that the ordinal variables originate from marginally discretizing a set of Gaussian variables whose latent covariance matrix is constrained to satisfy the conditional independencies inherent in a DAG. Conditioned on a given latent covariance matrix and discretisation thresholds, we derive a closed-form function for ordinal causal effects in terms of interventional distributions in the latent space. Our causal estimation combines naturally with algorithms to learn the latent DAG and its parameters, like the Ordinal Structural EM algorithm. Simulations demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach in estimating ordinal causal effects both for known and unknown structures of the latent graph. As an illustration of a real-world use case, the method is applied to survey data of 408 patients from a study on the functional relationships between symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder and depression.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Super-Resolution for High-Fidelity Physical System Simulations with Uncertainty Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) is a promising tool for generating high-fidelity simulations of physical systems from low-resolution data, enabling fast and accurate predictions in engineering applications. However, existing deep-learning based SR methods, require large labeled datasets and lack reliable uncertainty quantification (UQ), limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. To overcome these challenges, we propose a probabilistic SR framework that leverages the Statistical Finite Element Method and energy-based generative modeling. Our method enables efficient high-resolution predictions with inherent UQ, while eliminating the need for extensive labeled datasets. The method is validated on a 2D Poisson example and compared with bicubic interpolation upscaling. Results demonstrate a computational speed-up over high-resolution numerical solvers while providing reliable uncertainty estimates.</description>

      <title>Small Loss Bounds for Online Learning Separated Function Classes: A Gaussian Process Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In order to develop practical and efficient algorithms while circumventing overly pessimistic computational lower bounds, recent work has been interested in developing oracle-efficient algorithms in a variety of learning settings. Two such settings of particular interest are online and differentially private learning. While seemingly different, these two fields are fundamentally connected by the requirement that successful algorithms in each case satisfy stability guarantees; in particular, recent work has demonstrated that algorithms for online learning whose performance adapts to beneficial problem instances, attaining the so-called small-loss bounds, require a form of stability similar to that of differential privacy. In this work, we identify the crucial role that separation plays in allowing oracle-efficient algorithms to achieve this strong stability. Our notion, which we term $\rho$-separation, generalizes and unifies several previous approaches to enforcing this strong stability, including the existence of small-separator sets and the recent notion of $\gamma$-approximability. We present an oracle-efficient algorithm that is capable of achieving small-loss bounds with improved rates in greater generality than previous work, as well as a variant for differentially private learning that attains optimal rates, again under our separation condition. In so doing, we prove a new stability result for minimizers of a Gaussian process that strengthens and generalizes previous work.</description>

      <title>Dimension-free Score Matching and Time Bootstrapping for Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models generate samples by estimating the score function of the target distribution at various noise levels. The model is trained using samples drawn from the target distribution, progressively adding noise. In this work, we establish the first (nearly) dimension-free sample complexity bounds for learning these score functions, achieving a double exponential improvement in dimension over prior results. A key aspect of our analysis is the use of a single function approximator to jointly estimate scores across noise levels, a critical feature of diffusion models in practice which enables generalization across timesteps. Our analysis introduces a novel martingale-based error decomposition and sharp variance bounds, enabling efficient learning from dependent data generated by Markov processes, which may be of independent interest. Building on these insights, we propose Bootstrapped Score Matching (BSM), a variance reduction technique that utilizes previously learned scores to improve accuracy at higher noise levels. These results provide crucial insights into the efficiency and effectiveness of diffusion models for generative modeling.</description>

      <title>Proper Learnability and the Role of Unlabeled Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proper learning refers to the setting in which learners must emit predictors in the underlying hypothesis class $H$, and often leads to learners with simple algorithmic forms (e.g. empirical risk minimization (ERM), structural risk minimization (SRM)). The limitation of proper learning, however, is that there exist problems which can only be learned improperly, e.g. in multiclass classification. Thus, we ask: Under what assumptions on the hypothesis class or the information provided to the learner is a problem properly learnable? We first demonstrate that when the unlabeled data distribution is given, there always exists an optimal proper learner governed by distributional regularization, a randomized generalization of regularization. We refer to this setting as the distribution-fixed PAC model, and continue to evaluate the learner on its worst-case performance over all distributions. Our result holds for all metric loss functions and any finite learning problem (with no dependence on its size). Further, we demonstrate that sample complexities in the distribution-fixed PAC model can shrink by only a logarithmic factor from the classic PAC model, strongly refuting the role of unlabeled data in PAC learning (from a worst-case perspective).
  We complement this with impossibility results which obstruct any characterization of proper learnability in the realizable PAC model. First, we observe that there are problems whose proper learnability is logically undecidable, i.e., independent of the ZFC axioms. We then show that proper learnability is not a monotone property of the underlying hypothesis class, and that it is not a local property (in a precise sense). Our impossibility results all hold even for the fundamental setting of multiclass classification, and go through a reduction of EMX learning (Ben-David et al., 2019) to proper classification which may be of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: Confidence sequences are anytime-valid analogues of classical confidence intervals that do not suffer from multiplicity issues under optional continuation of the data collection. As in classical statistics, asymptotic confidence sequences are a nonparametric tool showing under which high-level assumptions asymptotic coverage is achieved so that they also give a certain robustness guarantee against distributional deviations. In this paper, we propose a new flexible class of confidence sequences yielding sharp asymptotic time-uniform confidence sequences under mild assumptions. Furthermore, we highlight the connection to corresponding sequential testing problems and detail the underlying limit theorem.</description>

      <title>Balancing the Scales: A Theoretical and Algorithmic Framework for Learning from Imbalanced Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Class imbalance remains a major challenge in machine learning, especially in multi-class problems with long-tailed distributions. Existing methods, such as data resampling, cost-sensitive techniques, and logistic loss modifications, though popular and often effective, lack solid theoretical foundations. As an example, we demonstrate that cost-sensitive methods are not Bayes consistent. This paper introduces a novel theoretical framework for analyzing generalization in imbalanced classification. We propose a new class-imbalanced margin loss function for both binary and multi-class settings, prove its strong $H$-consistency, and derive corresponding learning guarantees based on empirical loss and a new notion of class-sensitive Rademacher complexity. Leveraging these theoretical results, we devise novel and general learning algorithms, IMMAX (Imbalanced Margin Maximization), which incorporate confidence margins and are applicable to various hypothesis sets. While our focus is theoretical, we also present extensive empirical results demonstrating the effectiveness of our algorithms compared to existing baselines.</description>

      <title>(How) Can Transformers Predict Pseudo-Random Numbers?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformers excel at discovering patterns in sequential data, yet their fundamental limitations and learning mechanisms remain crucial topics of investigation. In this paper, we study the ability of Transformers to learn pseudo-random number sequences from linear congruential generators (LCGs), defined by the recurrence relation $x_{t+1} = a x_t + c \;\mathrm{mod}\; m$. Our analysis reveals that with sufficient architectural capacity and training data variety, Transformers can perform in-context prediction of LCG sequences with unseen moduli ($m$) and parameters ($a,c$). Through analysis of embedding layers and attention patterns, we uncover how Transformers develop algorithmic structures to learn these sequences in two scenarios of increasing complexity. First, we analyze how Transformers learn LCG sequences with unseen ($a, c$) but fixed modulus, and we demonstrate successful learning up to $m = 2^{32}$. Our analysis reveals that models learn to factorize the modulus and utilize digit-wise number representations to make sequential predictions. In the second, more challenging scenario of unseen moduli, we show that Transformers can generalize to unseen moduli up to $m_{\text{test}} = 2^{16}$. In this case, the model employs a two-step strategy: first estimating the unknown modulus from the context, then utilizing prime factorizations to generate predictions. For this task, we observe a sharp transition in the accuracy at a critical depth $=3$. We also find that the number of in-context sequence elements needed to reach high accuracy scales sublinearly with the modulus.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11711v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emerging zero-shot capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to their applications in areas extending well beyond natural language processing tasks. In reinforcement learning, while LLMs have been extensively used in text-based environments, their integration with continuous state spaces remains understudied. In this paper, we investigate how pre-trained LLMs can be leveraged to predict in context the dynamics of continuous Markov decision processes. We identify handling multivariate data and incorporating the control signal as key challenges that limit the potential of LLMs' deployment in this setup and propose Disentangled In-Context Learning (DICL) to address them. We present proof-of-concept applications in two reinforcement learning settings: model-based policy evaluation and data-augmented off-policy reinforcement learning, supported by theoretical analysis of the proposed methods. Our experiments further demonstrate that our approach produces well-calibrated uncertainty estimates. We release the code at https://github.com/abenechehab/dicl.</description>

      <title>On the Statistical Complexity of Estimating Vendi Scores from Empirical Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21719v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evaluating the diversity of generative models without access to reference data poses methodological challenges. The reference-free Vendi score offers a solution by quantifying the diversity of generated data using matrix-based entropy measures. The Vendi score is usually computed via the eigendecomposition of an $n \times n$ kernel matrix for $n$ generated samples. However, the heavy computational cost of eigendecomposition for large $n$ often limits the sample size used in practice to a few tens of thousands. In this paper, we investigate the statistical convergence of the Vendi score. We numerically demonstrate that for kernel functions with an infinite feature map dimension, the score estimated from a limited sample size may exhibit a non-negligible bias relative to the population Vendi score, i.e., the asymptotic limit as the sample size approaches infinity. To address this, we introduce a truncation of the Vendi statistic, called the $t$-truncated Vendi statistic, which is guaranteed to converge to its asymptotic limit given $n=O(t)$ samples. We show that the existing Nystr\"om method and the FKEA approximation method for approximating the Vendi score both converge to the population truncated Vendi score. We perform several numerical experiments to illustrate the concentration of the Nystr\"om and FKEA-computed Vendi scores around the truncated Vendi and discuss how the truncated Vendi score correlates with the diversity of image and text data.</description>

      <title>Multifidelity Simulation-based Inference for Computationally Expensive Simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08416v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Across many domains of science, stochastic models are an essential tool to understand the mechanisms underlying empirically observed data. Models can be of different levels of detail and accuracy, with models of high-fidelity (i.e., high accuracy) to the phenomena under study being often preferable. However, inferring parameters of high-fidelity models via simulation-based inference is challenging, especially when the simulator is computationally expensive. We introduce MF-NPE, a multifidelity approach to neural posterior estimation that leverages inexpensive low-fidelity simulations to infer parameters of high-fidelity simulators within a limited simulation budget. MF-NPE performs neural posterior estimation with limited high-fidelity resources by virtue of transfer learning, with the ability to prioritize individual observations using active learning. On one statistical task with analytical ground-truth and two real-world tasks, MF-NPE shows comparable performance to current approaches while requiring up to two orders of magnitude fewer high-fidelity simulations. Overall, MF-NPE opens new opportunities to perform efficient Bayesian inference on computationally expensive simulators.</description>

      <title>Misspecification-robust likelihood-free inference in high dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2002.09377v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Likelihood-free inference for simulator-based statistical models has developed rapidly from its infancy to a useful tool for practitioners. However, models with more than a handful of parameters still generally remain a challenge for the Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) based inference. To advance the possibilities for performing likelihood-free inference in higher dimensional parameter spaces, we introduce an extension of the popular Bayesian optimisation based approach to approximate discrepancy functions in a probabilistic manner which lends itself to an efficient exploration of the parameter space. Our approach achieves computational scalability for higher dimensional parameter spaces by using separate acquisition functions and discrepancies for each parameter. The efficient additive acquisition structure is combined with exponentiated loss -likelihood to provide a misspecification-robust characterisation of the marginal posterior distribution for all model parameters. The method successfully performs computationally efficient inference in a 100-dimensional space on canonical examples and compares favourably to existing modularised ABC methods. We further illustrate the potential of this approach by fitting a bacterial transmission dynamics model to a real data set, which provides biologically coherent results on strain competition in a 30-dimensional parameter space.</description>

      <title>Training Neural Networks on Data Sources with Unknown Reliability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.02895v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When data is generated by multiple sources, conventional training methods update models assuming equal reliability for each source and do not consider their individual data quality. However, in many applications, sources have varied levels of reliability that can have negative effects on the performance of a neural network. A key issue is that often the quality of the data for individual sources is not known during training. Previous methods for training models in the presence of noisy data do not make use of the additional information that the source label can provide. Focusing on supervised learning, we aim to train neural networks on each data source for a number of steps proportional to the source's estimated reliability by using a dynamic re-weighting strategy motivated by likelihood tempering. This way, we allow training on all sources during the warm-up and reduce learning on less reliable sources during the final training stages, when it has been shown that models overfit to noise. We show through diverse experiments that this can significantly improve model performance when trained on mixtures of reliable and unreliable data sources, and maintain performance when models are trained on reliable sources only.</description>

      <title>Do PAC-Learners Learn the Marginal Distribution?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.06285v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Fundamental Theorem of PAC Learning asserts that learnability of a concept class $H$ is equivalent to the $\textit{uniform convergence}$ of empirical error in $H$ to its mean, or equivalently, to the problem of $\textit{density estimation}$, learnability of the underlying marginal distribution with respect to events in $H$. This seminal equivalence relies strongly on PAC learning's `distribution-free' assumption, that the adversary may choose any marginal distribution over data. Unfortunately, the distribution-free model is known to be overly adversarial in practice, failing to predict the success of modern machine learning algorithms, but without the Fundamental Theorem our theoretical understanding of learning under distributional constraints remains highly limited.
  In this work, we revisit the connection between PAC learning, uniform convergence, and density estimation beyond the distribution-free setting when the adversary is restricted to choosing a marginal distribution from a known family $\mathscr{P}$. We prove that while the traditional Fundamental Theorem indeed fails, a finer-grained connection between the three fundamental notions continues to hold:
  1. PAC-Learning is strictly sandwiched between two refined models of density estimation, both equivalent to standard density estimation in the distribution-free case, differing only in whether the learner $\textit{knows}$ the set of well-estimated events in $H$.
  2. Under reasonable assumptions on $H$ and $\mathscr{P}$, density estimation is equivalent to \emph{uniform estimation}, a relaxation of uniform convergence allowing non-empirical estimators.
  Together, our results give a clearer picture of how the Fundamental Theorem extends beyond the distribution-free setting and shed new light on the classically challenging problem of learning under arbitrary distributional assumptions.</description>

      <title>Empirical Bayes Estimation with Side Information: A Nonparametric Integrative Tweedie Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05883v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the problem of compound estimation of normal means while accounting for the presence of side information. Leveraging the empirical Bayes framework, we develop a nonparametric integrative Tweedie (NIT) approach that incorporates structural knowledge encoded in multivariate auxiliary data to enhance the precision of compound estimation. Our approach employs convex optimization tools to estimate the gradient of the log-density directly, enabling the incorporation of structural constraints. We conduct theoretical analyses of the asymptotic risk of NIT and establish the rate at which NIT converges to the oracle estimator. As the dimension of the auxiliary data increases, we accurately quantify the improvements in estimation risk and the associated deterioration in convergence rate. The numerical performance of NIT is illustrated through the analysis of both simulated and real data, demonstrating its superiority over existing methods.</description>

      <title>Universal Sharpness Dynamics in Neural Network Training: Fixed Point Analysis, Edge of Stability, and Route to Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In gradient descent dynamics of neural networks, the top eigenvalue of the loss Hessian (sharpness) displays a variety of robust phenomena throughout training. This includes early time regimes where the sharpness may decrease during early periods of training (sharpness reduction), and later time behavior such as progressive sharpening and edge of stability. We demonstrate that a simple $2$-layer linear network (UV model) trained on a single training example exhibits all of the essential sharpness phenomenology observed in real-world scenarios. By analyzing the structure of dynamical fixed points in function space and the vector field of function updates, we uncover the underlying mechanisms behind these sharpness trends. Our analysis reveals (i) the mechanism behind early sharpness reduction and progressive sharpening, (ii) the required conditions for edge of stability, (iii) the crucial role of initialization and parameterization, and (iv) a period-doubling route to chaos on the edge of stability manifold as learning rate is increased. Finally, we demonstrate that various predictions from this simplified model generalize to real-world scenarios and discuss its limitations.</description>

      <title>Multivariate root-n-consistent smoothing parameter free matching estimators and estimators of inverse density weighted expectations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08494v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Expected values weighted by the inverse of a multivariate density or, equivalently, Lebesgue integrals of regression functions with multivariate regressors occur in various areas of applications, including estimating average treatment effects, nonparametric estimators in random coefficient regression models or deconvolution estimators in Berkson errors-in-variables models. The frequently used nearest-neighbor and matching estimators suffer from bias problems in multiple dimensions. By using polynomial least squares fits on each cell of the $K^{\text{th}}$-order Voronoi tessellation for sufficiently large $K$, we develop novel modifications of nearest-neighbor and matching estimators which again converge at the parametric $\sqrt n $-rate under mild smoothness assumptions on the unknown regression function and without any smoothness conditions on the unknown density of the covariates. We stress that in contrast to competing methods for correcting for the bias of matching estimators, our estimators do not involve nonparametric function estimators and in particular do not rely on sample-size dependent smoothing parameters. We complement the upper bounds with appropriate lower bounds derived from information-theoretic arguments, which show that some smoothness of the regression function is indeed required to achieve the parametric rate. Simulations illustrate the practical feasibility of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Error-controlled non-additive interaction discovery in machine learning models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17016v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models are powerful tools for detecting complex patterns within data, yet their "black box" nature limits their interpretability, hindering their use in critical domains like healthcare and finance. To address this challenge, interpretable ML methods have been developed to explain how features influence model predictions. However, these methods often focus on univariate feature importance, overlooking the complex interactions between features that ML models are capable of capturing. Recognizing this limitation, recent efforts have aimed to extend these methods to discover feature interactions, but existing approaches struggle with robustness and error control, especially under data perturbations. In this study, we introduce Diamond, a novel method for trustworthy feature interaction discovery. Diamond uniquely integrates the model-X knockoffs framework to control the false discovery rate (FDR), ensuring that the proportion of falsely discovered interactions remains low. A key innovation in Diamond is its non-additivity distillation procedure, which refines existing interaction importance measures to distill non-additive interaction effects, ensuring that FDR control is maintained. This approach addresses the limitations of off-the-shelf interaction measures, which, when used naively, can lead to inaccurate discoveries. Diamond's applicability spans a wide range of ML models, including deep neural networks, transformer models, tree-based models, and factorization-based models. Our empirical evaluations on both simulated and real datasets across various biomedical studies demonstrate Diamond's utility in enabling more reliable data-driven scientific discoveries. This method represents a significant step forward in the deployment of ML models for scientific innovation and hypothesis generation.</description>

      <title>Application of Langevin Dynamics to Advance the Quantum Natural Gradient Optimization Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01978v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Quantum Natural Gradient (QNG) algorithm for optimization of variational quantum circuits has been proposed recently. In this study, we employ the Langevin equation with a QNG stochastic force to demonstrate that its discrete-time solution gives a generalized form of the above-specified algorithm, which we call Momentum-QNG. Similar to other optimization algorithms with the momentum term, such as the Stochastic Gradient Descent with momentum, RMSProp with momentum and Adam, Momentum-QNG is more effective to escape local minima and plateaus in the variational parameter space and, therefore, achieves a better convergence behavior compared to the basic QNG. In this paper we benchmark Momentum-QNG together with basic QNG, Adam and Momentum optimizers and find the optimal values of its hyperparameters. Our open-source code is available at https://github.com/borbysh/Momentum-QNG</description>

      <title>Rethinking Conventional Wisdom in Machine Learning: From Generalization to Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15156v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The remarkable success of large language pretraining and the discovery of scaling laws signify a paradigm shift in machine learning. Notably, the primary objective has evolved from minimizing generalization error to reducing approximation error, and the most effective strategy has transitioned from regularization (in a broad sense) to scaling up models. This raises a critical question:
  Do the established principles that proved successful in the generalization-centric era remain valid in this new era of scaling?
  This paper examines several influential regularization-based principles that may no longer hold true in the scaling-centric, large language model (LLM) era. These principles include explicit L2 regularization and implicit regularization through small batch sizes and large learning rates. Additionally, we identify a new phenomenon termed ``scaling law crossover,'' where two scaling curves intersect at a certain scale, implying that methods effective at smaller scales may not generalize to larger ones. Together, these observations highlight two fundamental questions within this new paradigm:
  $\bullet$ Guiding Principles for Scaling: If regularization is no longer the primary guiding principle for model design, what new principles are emerging to guide scaling?
  $\bullet$ Model Comparison at Scale: How to reliably and effectively compare models at the scale where only a single experiment is feasible?</description>

      <title>Conformal Prediction Sets Can Cause Disparate Impact</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01888v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conformal prediction is a statistically rigorous method for quantifying uncertainty in models by having them output sets of predictions, with larger sets indicating more uncertainty. However, prediction sets are not inherently actionable; many applications require a single output to act on, not several. To overcome this limitation, prediction sets can be provided to a human who then makes an informed decision. In any such system it is crucial to ensure the fairness of outcomes across protected groups, and researchers have proposed that Equalized Coverage be used as the standard for fairness. By conducting experiments with human participants, we demonstrate that providing prediction sets can lead to disparate impact in decisions. Disquietingly, we find that providing sets that satisfy Equalized Coverage actually increases disparate impact compared to marginal coverage. Instead of equalizing coverage, we propose to equalize set sizes across groups which empirically leads to lower disparate impact.</description>

      <title>Artificial Kuramoto Oscillatory Neurons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13821v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has long been known in both neuroscience and AI that ``binding'' between neurons leads to a form of competitive learning where representations are compressed in order to represent more abstract concepts in deeper layers of the network. More recently, it was also hypothesized that dynamic (spatiotemporal) representations play an important role in both neuroscience and AI. Building on these ideas, we introduce Artificial Kuramoto Oscillatory Neurons (AKOrN) as a dynamical alternative to threshold units, which can be combined with arbitrary connectivity designs such as fully connected, convolutional, or attentive mechanisms. Our generalized Kuramoto updates bind neurons together through their synchronization dynamics. We show that this idea provides performance improvements across a wide spectrum of tasks such as unsupervised object discovery, adversarial robustness, calibrated uncertainty quantification, and reasoning. We believe that these empirical results show the importance of rethinking our assumptions at the most basic neuronal level of neural representation, and in particular show the importance of dynamical representations.

      <description>arXiv:2411.03759v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive variational inference upper-bounds on the log-partition function of pairwise Markov random fields on the Boolean hypercube, based on quantum relaxations of the Kullback-Leibler divergence. We then propose an efficient algorithm to compute these bounds based on primal-dual optimization. An improvement of these bounds through the use of ''hierarchies,'' similar to sum-of-squares (SoS) hierarchies is proposed, and we present a greedy algorithm to select among these relaxations. We carry extensive numerical experiments and compare with state-of-the-art methods for this inference problem.</description>

      <title>Learn2Mix: Training Neural Networks Using Adaptive Data Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16482v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accelerating model convergence within resource-constrained environments is critical to ensure fast and efficient neural network training. This work presents learn2mix, a novel training strategy that adaptively adjusts class proportions within batches, focusing on classes with higher error rates. Unlike classical training methods that use static class proportions, learn2mix continually adapts class proportions during training, leading to faster convergence. Empirical evaluations conducted on benchmark datasets show that neural networks trained with learn2mix converge faster than those trained with existing approaches, achieving improved results for classification, regression, and reconstruction tasks under limited training resources and with imbalanced classes. Our empirical findings are supported by theoretical analysis.</description>

      <title>In-Context Learning of Linear Dynamical Systems with Transformers: Error Bounds and Depth-Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates approximation-theoretic aspects of the in-context learning capability of the transformers in representing a family of noisy linear dynamical systems. Our first theoretical result establishes an upper bound on the approximation error of multi-layer transformers with respect to an $L^2$-testing loss uniformly defined across tasks. This result demonstrates that transformers with logarithmic depth can achieve error bounds comparable with those of the least-squares estimator. In contrast, our second result establishes a non-diminishing lower bound on the approximation error for a class of single-layer linear transformers, which suggests a depth-separation phenomenon for transformers in the in-context learning of dynamical systems. Moreover, this second result uncovers a critical distinction in the approximation power of single-layer linear transformers when learning from IID versus non-IID data.</description>
