      <title>Identifying Stable Influencers: Distinguishing Stable and Temporal Influencers Using Long-Term Twitter Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For effective social media marketing, identifying stable influencers-those who sustain their influence over an extended period-is more valuable than focusing on users who are influential only temporarily. This study addresses the challenge of distinguishing stable influencers from transient ones among users who are influential at a given point in time. We particularly focus on two distinct types of influencers: source spreaders, who widely disseminate their own content, and brokers, who play a key role in propagating information originating from others. Using six months of retweet data from approximately 19,000 Twitter users, we analyze the characteristics of stable influencers. Our findings reveal that users who have maintained influence in the past are more likely to continue doing so in the future. Furthermore, we develop classification models to predict stable influencers among temporarily influential users, achieving an AUC of approximately 0.89 for source spreaders and 0.81 for brokers. Our experimental results highlight that current influence is a critical factor in classifying influencers, while past influence also significantly contributes, particularly for source spreaders.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Synthetic Dataset of Individual Daily Trajectories for City-Scale Mobility Analytics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urban mobility data are indispensable for urban planning, transportation demand forecasting, pandemic modeling, and many other applications; however, individual mobile phone-derived Global Positioning System traces cannot generally be shared with third parties owing to severe re-identification risks. Aggregated records, such as origin-destination (OD) matrices, offer partial insights but fail to capture the key behavioral properties of daily human movement, limiting realistic city-scale analyses.
  This study presents a privacy-preserving synthetic mobility dataset that reconstructs daily trajectories from aggregated inputs. The proposed method integrates OD flows with two complementary behavioral constraints: (1) dwell-travel time quantiles that are available only as coarse summary statistics and (2) the universal law for the daily distribution of the number of visited locations. Embedding these elements in a multi-objective optimization framework enables the reproduction of realistic distributions of human mobility while ensuring that no personal identifiers are required.
  The proposed framework is validated in two contrasting regions of Japan: (1) the 23 special wards of Tokyo, representing a dense metropolitan environment; and (2) Fukuoka Prefecture, where urban and suburban mobility patterns coexist. The resulting synthetic mobility data reproduce dwell-travel time and visit frequency distributions with high fidelity, while deviations in OD consistency remain within the natural range of daily fluctuations.
  The results of this study establish a practical synthesis pathway under real-world constraints, providing governments, urban planners, and industries with scalable access to high-resolution mobility data for reliable analytics without the need for sensitive personal records, and supporting practical deployments in policy and commercial domains.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Analysis of Instagram and TikTok as Islamic Da'wah Media in the Digital Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research aims to analyze and compare the effectiveness of Islamic da'wah on two popular social media platforms, namely Instagram and TikTok. The analysis is conducted based on four main aspects: media characteristics, da'wah communication strategies, audience engagement effectiveness, and user behavioral responses. The research employs a descriptive quantitative approach through observations of the popular da'wah account @hananattakistory during the period of October to November 2025. The findings indicate that TikTok excels in the effectiveness of disseminating da'wah messages through high interaction rates, achieving an engagement rate of 1.42%. In contrast, Instagram records a higher total interaction with an engagement rate of 5.47%, reflecting deeper and more reflective audience involvement. Qualitative analysis shows that TikTok is more effective in the initial stage of capturing audience attention (awareness), while Instagram is stronger in building loyalty and fostering a digital da'wah community. Thus, combining the use of both platforms can serve as a complementary digital da'wah strategy, expanding reach while deepening the understanding of Islamic values in the era of social media. The main contribution of this study lies in its comparative, empirically grounded approach that integrates both qualitative and quantitative analyses to map the effectiveness of da'wah across platforms, providing a strategic foundation for developing adaptive and contextual digital da'wah for young Muslim audiences.</description>

      <title>Bots Don't Sit Still: A Longitudinal Study of Bot Behaviour Change, Temporal Drift, and Feature-Structure Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social bots are now deeply embedded in online platforms for promotion, persuasion, and manipulation. Most bot-detection systems still treat behavioural features as static, implicitly assuming bots behave stationarily over time. We test that assumption for promotional Twitter bots, analysing change in both individual behavioural signals and the relationships between them. Using 2,615 promotional bot accounts and 2.8M tweets, we build yearly time series for ten content-based meta-features. Augmented Dickey-Fuller and KPSS tests plus linear trends show all ten are non-stationary: nine increase over time, while language diversity declines slightly.
  Stratifying by activation generation and account age reveals systematic differences: second-generation bots are most active and link-heavy; short-lived bots show intense, repetitive activity with heavy hashtag/URL use; long-lived bots are less active but more linguistically diverse and use emojis more variably. We then analyse co-occurrence across generations using 18 interpretable binary features spanning actions, topic similarity, URLs, hashtags, sentiment, emojis, and media (153 pairs). Chi-square tests indicate almost all pairs are dependent. Spearman correlations shift in strength and sometimes polarity: many links (e.g. multiple hashtags with media; sentiment with URLs) strengthen, while others flip from weakly positive to weakly or moderately negative. Later generations show more structured combinations of cues.
  Taken together, these studies provide evidence that promotional social bots adapt over time at both the level of individual meta-features and the level of feature interdependencies, with direct implications for the design and evaluation of bot-detection systems trained on historical behavioural features.</description>

      <title>Dirichlet Meets Horvitz and Thompson: Estimating Homophily in Large Networks via Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assessing homophily in large-scale networks is central to understanding structural regularities in graphs, and thus inform the choice of models (such as graph neural networks) adopted to learn from network data. Evaluation of smoothness metrics requires access to the entire network topology and node features, which may be impractical in several large-scale, dynamic, resource-limited, or privacy-constrained settings. In this work, we propose a sampling-based framework to estimate homophily via the Dirichlet energy (Laplacian-based total variation) of graph signals, leveraging the Horvitz-Thompson (HT) estimator for unbiased inference from partial graph observations. The Dirichlet energy is a so-termed total (of squared nodal feature deviations) over graph edges; hence, estimable under general network sampling designs for which edge-inclusion probabilities can be analytically derived and used as weights in the proposed HT estimator. We establish that the Dirichlet energy can be consistently estimated from sampled graphs, and empirically study other heterophily measures as well. Experiments on several heterophilic benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed HT estimators in reliably capturing homophilic structure (or lack thereof) from sampled network measurements.</description>
