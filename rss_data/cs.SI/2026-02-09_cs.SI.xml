      <title>A methodology for analyzing financial needs hierarchy from social discussions using LLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the hierarchical structure of financial needs as articulated in social media discourse, employing generative AI techniques to analyze large-scale textual data. While human needs encompass a broad spectrum from fundamental survival to psychological fulfillment financial needs are particularly critical, influencing both individual well-being and day-to-day decision-making. Our research advances the understanding of financial behavior by utilizing large language models (LLMs) to extract and analyze expressions of financial needs from social media posts. We hypothesize that financial needs are organized hierarchically, progressing from short-term essentials to long-term aspirations, consistent with theoretical frameworks established in the behavioral sciences. Through computational analysis, we demonstrate the feasibility of identifying these needs and validate the presence of a hierarchical structure within them. In addition to confirming this structure, our findings provide novel insights into the content and themes of financial discussions online. By inferring underlying needs from naturally occurring language, this approach offers a scalable and data-driven alternative to conventional survey methodologies, enabling a more dynamic and nuanced understanding of financial behavior in real-world contexts.</description>

      <title>Mapping the political landscape from data traces: multidimensional opinions of users, politicians and media outlets on X</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying political activity on social media often requires defining and measuring political stances of users or content. Relevant examples include the study of opinion polarization, or the study of political diversity in online content diets. While many research designs rely on operationalizations best suited for the US setting, few allow addressing more general political systems, in which users and media outlets might exhibit stances on multiple ideology and issue dimensions, going beyond traditional Liberal-Conservative or Left-Right scales. To advance the study of more general online ecosystems, we present a dataset pertaining to a population of X/Twitter users, parliamentarians, and media outlets embedded in a political space spanned by dimensions measuring attitudes towards immigration, the EU, liberal values, elites and institutions, nationalism and the environment, in addition to left-right and liberal-conservative scales. We include indicators of individual activity and popularity: mean number of posts per day, number of followers, and number of followees. We provide several benchmarks validating the positions of these entities and discuss several applications for this dataset.</description>

      <title>Impact of seed node position on network robustness under localized attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Localized attacks (LAs), where damage propagates from a single seed node to its neighbors, pose significant threats to the robustness of complex networks. Although previous studies have extensively analyzed network vulnerability under such attacks, they typically assume random seed node placement and evaluate average robustness. However, the structural position of the seed node can significantly impact the extent of damage. This study proposes the Localized Attack Vulnerability Index (LAVI), a node-level metric that quantifies the potential impact of a LA initiated at a specific node. LAVI quantifies the cumulative number of severed links during attack progression, capturing how local connectivity and topological position amplify the resulting damage. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world networks demonstrate that LAVI correlates more strongly with network robustness degradation than standard centrality measures, such as degree, closeness, and betweenness. Our findings highlight that classical centrality metrics fail to capture key dynamics of spatially localized failures, while LAVI provides an accurate and generalizable indicator of node vulnerability under such disruptions.</description>

      <title>Network Centrality Metrics Based on Unrestricted Paths, Walks and Cycles Compared to Standard Centrality Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11585v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional measures of closeness and betweenness centrality in networks rely on the shortest paths between nodes. Many standard metrics fail to accurately reflect the physical or probabilistic characteristics of nodal centrality and network flow, often overlooking processes such as cyclic and recurrent spreading. Here, we present new metrics based on our influence spreading model. These probabilistic measures consider all feasible paths, walks, and cycles within the network. We define in-centrality to assess how central a node is as a target of influence, and out-centrality for its role as a source of influence. We compare our metrics with standard ones by analyzing node rankings, using scatter plots, and calculating the Pearson correlation and Spearman's rank correlation coefficients. Our findings show that the betweenness centrality defined by the influence spreading model emphasizes the importance of alternative routes while maintaining similarity to standard betweenness centrality.</description>
