      <title>An additive Mori-Tanaka scheme for elastic-viscoplastic composites based on a modified tangent linearization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mean-field modeling based on the Eshelby inclusion problem poses some difficulties when the non-linear Maxwell-type constitutive law is used for elasto-viscoplasticity. One difficulty is that this behavior involves different orders of time differentiation, which leads a long-term memory effect. One of the possible solutions to this problem is the additive interaction law. Generally, mean field models solely use the mean values of stress and strain fields per phase, while variational approaches consider the second moments of stresses and strains. It is seen that the latter approach improves model predictions allowing to account for stress fluctuation within the phases. However, the complexity of the variational formulations still makes them difficult to apply in the large scale finite element calculations and for non-proportional loadings. Thus, there is a need to include the second moments within homogenization models based on the additive interaction law. In the present study, the incorporation of the second moments of stresses into the formulation of the additive Mori-Tanaka model of two-phase elastic-viscoplastic material is discussed. A modified tangent linearization of the viscoplastic law is proposed, while the Hill-Mandel's lemma is used to track the evolution of second moments of stresses. To study the model performance and efficiency, the results are compared to the full-field numerical calculations and predictions of other models available in the literature. Very good performance of the modified tangent linearization is demonstrated from these benchmarks for both monotonic and non monotonic loading responses.</description>

      <title>The non-equilibrium Marshak wave problem in non-homogeneous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a family of similarity solutions to the nonlinear non-equilibrium Marshak wave problem for an inhomogeneous planar medium which is coupled to a time dependent radiation driving source. We employ the non-equilibrium gray diffusion approximation in the supersonic regime. The solutions constitute a generalization of the non-equilibrium nonlinear solutions that were developed recently for homogeneous media. Self-similar solutions are constructed for a power law time dependent surface temperature, a spatial power law density profile and a material model with power law temperature and density dependent opacities and specific energy density. The extension of the problem to non-homogeneous media enables the existence of similarity solutions for a general power law specific material energy. It is shown that the solutions exist for specific values of the temporal temperature drive and spatial density exponents, which depend on the material exponents. We also illustrate how the similarity solutions take various qualitatively different forms which are analyzed with respect to various parameters. Based on the solutions, we define a set of non-trivial benchmarks for supersonic non-equilibrium radiative heat transfer. The similarity solutions are compared to gray diffusion simulations as well as to detailed implicit Monte-Carlo and discrete-ordinate transport simulations in the optically-thick regime, showing a great agreement, which highlights the benefit of these solutions as a code verification test problem.</description>

      <title>What You See is Not What You Get: Neural Partial Differential Equations and The Illusion of Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differentiable Programming for scientific machine learning (SciML) has recently seen considerable interest and success, as it directly embeds neural networks inside PDEs, often called as NeuralPDEs, derived from first principle physics. Therefore, there is a widespread assumption in the community that NeuralPDEs are more trustworthy and generalizable than black box models. However, like any SciML model, differentiable programming relies predominantly on high-quality PDE simulations as "ground truth" for training. However, mathematics dictates that these are only discrete numerical approximations of the true physics. Therefore, we ask: Are NeuralPDEs and differentiable programming models trained on PDE simulations as physically interpretable as we think? In this work, we rigorously attempt to answer these questions, using established ideas from numerical analysis, experiments, and analysis of model Jacobians. Our study shows that NeuralPDEs learn the artifacts in the simulation training data arising from the discretized Taylor Series truncation error of the spatial derivatives. Additionally, NeuralPDE models are systematically biased, and their generalization capability is likely enabled by a fortuitous interplay of numerical dissipation and truncation error in the training dataset and NeuralPDE, which seldom happens in practical applications. This bias manifests aggressively even in relatively accessible 1-D equations, raising concerns about the veracity of differentiable programming on complex, high-dimensional, real-world PDEs, and in dataset integrity of foundation models. Further, we observe that the initial condition constrains the truncation error in initial-value problems in PDEs, thereby exerting limitations to extrapolation. Finally, we demonstrate that an eigenanalysis of model weights can indicate a priori if the model will be inaccurate for out-of-distribution testing.</description>

      <title>Occupation Uncertainty Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce occupation uncertainty relations (OURs) for dynamics of a Markov process over discrete configurations. Those are lower bounds on uncertainties of system observables that are time-integrated along stochastic trajectories. The uncertainty is defined as the ratio of the variance to the square of the average, with the latter necessarily shifted by the average in a reference distribution. The derived bounds are observable independent, but rely on the reference choice. We show, however, that all OURs originate from a matrix bound on correlations between times spent in different system configurations, i.e., occupation times. This result is reference independent, and expressed only in terms of stationary probability and lifetimes of individual configurations. Any dynamics that saturates the matrix bound, is optimal in approximating stationary distribution by occupation times; this always occurs for unidirectional cycles. Furthermore, using this bound, dynamic correlations can be asymptotically bounded in terms of static correlations, in turn leading to the positivity of dynamic exponents in the thermodynamic limit. While at a finite size the matrix bound generally saturates away from equilibrium, we demonstrate detailed-balance dynamics can still saturate it asymptotically, by leading to vanishing dynamic exponents and optimal simulations in that context.</description>

      <title>dCG -- differentiable connected geometries for AI-compatible multi-domain optimization and inverse design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05833v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the domain of geometry and topology optimization, discovering geometries that optimally satisfy specific problem criteria is a complex challenge in both engineering and scientific research. In this work, we propose a new approach for the creation of multidomain connected geometries that are designed to work with automatic differentiation. We introduce the concept of differentiable Connected Geometries (dCG), discussing its theoretical aspects and illustrating its application through a simple toy examples and a more sophisticated photonic optimization task. Since these geometries are built upon the principles of automatic differentiation, they are compatible with existing deep learning frameworks, a feature we demonstrate via the application examples. This methodology provides a systematic way to approach geometric design and optimization in computational fields involving dependent geometries, potentially improving the efficiency and effectiveness of optimization tasks in scientific and engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Self-organized quantization and oscillations on continuous fixed-energy sandpiles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.04470v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Atmospheric self-organization and activator-inhibitor dynamics in biology provide examples of checkerboard-like spatio-temporal organization. We study a simple model for local activation-inhibition processes. Our model, first introduced in the context of atmospheric moisture dynamics, is a continuous-energy and non-Abelian version of the fixed-energy sandpile model. Each lattice site is populated by a non-negative real number, its energy. Upon each timestep all sites with energy exceeding a unit threshold re-distribute their energy at equal parts to their nearest neighbors. The limit cycle dynamics gives rise to a complex phase diagram in dependence on the mean energy $\mu$: For low $\mu$, all dynamics ceases after few re-distribution events. For large $\mu$, the dynamics is well-described as a diffusion process, where the order parameter, spatial variance $\sigma$, is removed. States at intermediate $\mu$ are dominated by checkerboard-like period-two phases which are however interspersed by much more complex phases of far longer periods. Phases are separated by discontinuous jumps in $\sigma$ or $\partial_{\mu}\sigma$ - akin to first and higher-order phase transitions. Overall, the energy landscape is dominated by few energy levels which occur as sharp spikes in the single-site density of states and are robust to noise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.01622v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A GPU-accelerated version of the lattice Boltzmann method for efficient simulation of soft materials is introduced. Unlike standard approaches, this method reconstructs the distribution functions from available hydrodynamic variables (density, momentum, and pressure tensor) without storing the full set of discrete populations. This scheme shows satisfactory numerical stability, significantly lower memory requirements, and data access cost. A series of benchmark tests of relevance to soft matter, such as collisions of fluid droplets, is discussed to validate the method. The results can be of particular interest for high-performance simulations of soft matter systems on future exascale computers.</description>

      <title>Lattice Boltzmann simulations for soft flowing matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the last decade, the Lattice Boltzmann method has found major scope for the simulation of a large spectrum of problems in soft matter, from multiphase and multi-component microfluidic flows, to foams, emulsions, colloidal flows, to name but a few. Crucial to many such applications is the role of supramolecular interactions which occur whenever mesoscale structures, such as bubbles or droplets, come in close contact, say of the order of tens of nanometers. Regardless of their specific physico-chemical origin, such near-contact interactions are vital to preserve the coherence of the mesoscale structures against coalescence phenomena promoted by capillarity and surface tension, hence the need of including them in Lattice Boltzmann schemes. Strictly speaking, this entails a complex multiscale problem, covering about six spatial decades, from centimeters down to tens of nanometers, and almost twice as many in time. Such a multiscale problem can hardly be taken by a single computational method, hence the need for coarse-grained models for the near-contact interactions. In this review, we shall discuss such coarse-grained models and illustrate their application to a variety of soft flowing matter problems, such as soft flowing crystals, strongly confined dense emulsions, flowing hierarchical emulsions, soft granular flows, as well as the transmigration of active droplets across constrictions. Finally, we conclude with a few considerations on future developments in the direction of quantum-nanofluidics, machine learning, and quantum computing for soft flows applications.</description>
