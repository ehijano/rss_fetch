      <title>A logarithm law for nonautonomous systems fastly converging to equilibrium and mean field coupled systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that if a nonautonomous system has in a certain sense a fast convergence to equilibrium (faster than any power law behavior) then the time $\tau _{r}(x,y)$ needed for a typical point $x$ to enter for the first time in a ball $B(y,r)$ centered in $y$, with small radius \ $r $ scales as the local dimension of the equilibrium measure \ $\mu $ at $y$, i.e. $$ \underset{r\rightarrow 0}{\lim }\frac{\log \tau _{r}(x,y)}{-\log r}% =d_{\mu }(y).$$
  We then apply the general result to concrete systems of different kind, showing such a logarithm law for asymptotically authonomous solenoidal maps and mean field coupled expanding maps.</description>

      <title>Amplification in parametrically-driven resonators near instability based on Floquet theory and Green's functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.13556v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here we use Floquet theory to calculate the response of parametrically-driven time-periodic systems near the onset of parametric instability to an added external ac signal or white noise. We provide new estimates, based on the Green's function method, for the response of the system in the frequency domain. Furthermore, we write novel expressions for the power and the noise spectral densities. We validate our theoretical results by comparing our predictions for the specific cases of a single degree of freedom parametric amplifier and of the parametric amplifier coupled to a harmonic oscillator with the numerical integration results and with analytical approximate results obtained via the averaging method up to second order.</description>

      <title>Parisi's hypercube, Fock-space fluxes, and the microscopics of near-AdS$_2$/near-CFT$_1$ duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12335v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parisi's hypercube model describes a charged particle hopping on a $d$-dimensional hypercube with disordered background fluxes in the large $d$ limit. It was noted previously [Jia and Verbaarschot, J. High Energy Phys. 11 (2020) 154] that the hypercube model at leading order in $1/d$ has the same spectral density as the double-scaled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (DS-SYK) model. In this work we identify the set of observables that have the same correlation functions as the DS-SYK model, demonstrating that the hypercube model is an equally good microscopic model for near-AdS$_2$/near-CFT$_1$ holography. Unlike the SYK model, the hypercube model is not $p$-local. Rather, we note that the shared feature between the two models is that they both have a large amount of disordered but uniform fluxes on their Fock-space graphs, and we propose this is a broader characterization of near-CFT$_1$ microscopics. Moreover, we suggest that the hypercube model can be viewed as the operator growth model of the DS-SYK model. We explain some universality in subleading corrections and relate them to bulk vertices. Finally, we revise a claim made the aforementioned reference about the existence of a spectral gap.</description>

      <title>From integrability to chaos: the quantum-classical correspondence in a triple well bosonic model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the semiclassical limit of a simple bosonic quantum many-body system exhibiting both integrable and chaotic behavior. A classical Hamiltonian is derived using coherent states. The transition from regularity to chaos in classical dynamics is visualized through Poincar\'e sections. Classical trajectories in phase space closely resemble the projections of the Husimi functions of eigenstates with similar energy, even in chaotic cases. It is demonstrated that this correlation is more evident when projecting the eigenstates onto the Fock states. The analysis is carried out at a critical energy where the eigenstates are maximally delocalized in the Fock basis. Despite the imperfect delocalization, its influence is present in the classical and quantum properties under investigation. The study systematically establishes quantum-classical correspondence for a bosonic many-body system with more than two wells, even within the chaotic region.</description>
