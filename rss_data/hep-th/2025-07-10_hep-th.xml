      <title>Bootstrapping the Simplest Deconfined Quantum Critical Point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the $N=3$ case of the $CP^{N-1}$ model, which is a field theory of $N$ complex scalars in $3d$ coupled to an Abelian gauge field with $SU(N) \times U(1)$ global symmetry. Recent evidence suggests the $N=2$ theory is not critical, which makes the $N=3$ theory the simplest possibility of deconfined quantum criticality. We apply the conformal bootstrap to correlators of charge $q=0,1,2$ scalar operators under the $U(1)$ symmetry, which gives us access also to $q=3,4$ operators. After imposing that only the lowest $q=0,1,2$ scalar operators are relevant, we find that the bootstrap bounds are saturated by the large $N$ prediction for $q=1,2,3,4$ scalar monopole operator scaling dimensions, which were shown earlier to be accurate even for small $N$, as well as a lattice prediction for the $q=0$ non-monopole scalar operator. We also predict the scaling dimensions of the lowest spinning monopole operators, which we match to the large charge prediction for spinning operators. This suggests that the critical $CP^{2}$ model is described by this bootstrap bound.</description>

      <title>Krylov Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and review a new complexity measure, called `Krylov complexity', which takes its origins in the field of quantum-chaotic dynamics, serving as a canonical measure of operator growth and spreading. Krylov complexity, underpinned by the Lanczos algorithm, has since evolved into a highly diverse field of its own right, both because of its attractive features as a complexity, whose definition does not depend on arbitrary control parameters, and whose phenomenology serves as a rich and sensitive probe of chaotic dynamics up to exponentially late times, but also because of its relevance to seemingly far-afield subjects such as holographic dualities and the quantum physics of black holes. In this review we give a unified perspective on these topics, emphasizing the robust and most general features of K-complexity, both in chaotic and integrable systems, state and prove theorems on its generic features and describe how it is geometrised in the context of (dual) gravitational dynamics. We hope that this review will serve both as a source of intuition about K-complexity in and of itself, as well as a resource for researchers trying to gain an overview over what is by now a rather large and multi-faceted literature. We also mention and discuss a number of open problems related to K-complexity, underlining its currently very active status as a field of research.</description>

      <title>Argyres-Douglas Theories, Macdonald Indices and Arc Space of Zhu Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we relate the MacDonald index of a 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFT with the Hilbert series of the arc space of the Zhu algebra of the corresponding Schur VOA. Using this, we conjecture a simple formula for the MacDonald index of $(A_1,D_{2n+1})$ Argyres-Douglas theory. We perform checks of the formula against the known Schur limits and RG flows. To match the Schur limit, we prove new $q$-series identities.</description>

      <title>Explicit Bounds on the Spectrum of 6d N=(1,0) Supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel strategy to derive explicit and uniform upper bounds on the particle spectrum of six-dimensional gravitational theories with minimal supersymmetry, focusing initially on the tensor sector. The strategy is motivated by considerations of F-theory compactifications on elliptic Calabi-Yau 3-folds. However, it admits a clear bottom-up interpretation and is thus applicable to general supergravity theories modulo certain physical conjectures. At the heart of the strategy are two key structures, most natural in birational geometry: one concerns the singularity of the natural pairs on the base manifolds, and the other, the fibration generically exhibited by the bases. Put physically, the former structure keeps the effective theories from decompactifying and the latter ensures the (generic) presence of a heterotic string. We sketch our bounding strategy and present, for an illustration, the explicit bounds thereby derived on the tensor spectrum, with the technical details relegated to a companion paper [1].</description>

      <title>A Picard rank bound for base surfaces of elliptic Calabi-Yau 3-folds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute an explicit rank bound on the Picard group of the compact surfaces, which can serve as the base of an elliptic Calabi-Yau variety with canonical singularities. To bound the Picard rank from above, we develop a novel strategy in birational geometry, motivated in part by the physics of six-dimensional vacua of F-theory as discussed in a companion paper [1] to this one. The derivation of the concrete bound illustrates the strategy and clarifies the origin of the boundedness.</description>

      <title>Hodge Duals in Spherical Compactifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general formalism for computing the Hodge dual of differential forms in arbitrary dimensions subject to a spherical constraint. This problem arises naturally in Kaluza-Klein compactifications, where sphere reductions demand careful treatment of differential forms constrained to lie on embedded submanifolds. We derive an explicit expression for the Hodge dual of a $p$-form in the presence of such constraints and validate our general ansatz through illustrative examples in three dimensions, including both flat and diagonal metric backgrounds. The resulting framework offers a systematic and practical tool for handling constrained Hodge duals, with direct applications to consistent truncations in supergravity and string theory compactifications.</description>

      <title>Landau theory for lattice higher gauge theory and Kramers-Wannier duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a Landau field theory for a lattice higher gauge theory defined on $p$-dimensional open cells (i.e., sites, links, faces, cubes, etc.), and study its continuum-limit and phases. In this approach, the $p$-dimensional Wilson-surface operator of the higher gauge theory is promoted to a fundamental functional field that is charged under the $p$-form global symmetry. By explicitly solving the functional equation of motion, we show that the classical solution exhibits the area~(perimeter) law in the strong (weak) gauge coupling limit. In the deconfined phase, we also construct topological defects for both $\mathrm{U}(1)$ and $\mathbb{Z}_N^{}$ higher gauge theories, as analogs of vortex and domain-wall solutions in conventional field theories with $0$-form global symmetries. Besides, we examine low-energy effective theory by identifying the phase modulations of the functional field as low-energy modes, and discuss the Coleman-Mermin-Wagner theorem for higher-form global symmetries. Finally, we discuss infrared duality among Landau field theories, which originates from Kramers-Wannier duality in lattice higher gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Transition from weak to strong coupling in thermal gauge theories: Lessons from ${\cal N}=4$ SYM Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the transition between weak and strong coupling in thermal ${\cal N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills (SYM) theory as a function of 't Hooft coupling $\lambda$ for several quantities of phenomenological interest for which next-to-leading order calculations are available in both regimes. We use Pad\'e approximants to interpolate between the weak and strong coupling expansions and determine the location and width of the transition between the asymptotic regimes.</description>

      <title>The QED photon-fermion vertex from its Dyson-Schwinger equation in 4D: the full vertex, the transverse form factors and the perturbative solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Dyson-Schwinger equation for the photon-fermion one-particle irreducible vertex in QED in linear covariant gauges. The longitudinal component of this vertex is described using the Ball-Chiu basis, while its transverse part is expressed with the K{\i}z{\i}lersu-Reenders-Pennington basis. Combining the vertex Ward-Takahashi identity with the vertex equation, we derive a set of exact, non-linear integral equations governing the transverse vertex. These equations hold for any linear covariant gauge and must be solved self-consistently. We discuss several approximations to the exact equations, generalizing results previously obtained at the perturbative one-loop level. Various kinematical configurations are also examined. Furthermore, we compute the perturbative solution of the transverse vertex Dyson-Schwinger equations for all transverse form factors and derive their perturbative asymptotic expressions.</description>

      <title>Exact WKB of solutions by Borel summation and open TBA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the exact WKB methods for solutions of the Schr\"{o}dinger equations corresponding to quantum Seiberg-Witten curves in 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ theories with surface defects. The tools are Borel summation and Gaiotto-Moore-Neitzke (GMN) open TBA, which is a conjecture that has largely stayed unexplored so far. We study the Borel plane of the solution regularized by a BPS soliton charge and find that its poles on the Borel plane have the physical meaning of BPS soliton central charges and 4d BPS state central charges. We discuss in detail the discontinuities associated with the singularities and propose general expressions for these discontinuities which also apply to higher-order ODEs. We apply the open TBA to genuinely nontrivial examples -- the 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ theory with a single flavor BPS state corresponding to the Weber equation and an example of the pure $SU(2)$ theory corresponding to the modified Mathieu equation -- and show how to match it with Borel summation. We provide numerical evidence for the matching of the two exact WKB methods and also for an exact solution to the modified Mathieu equation via open TBA.</description>

      <title>Gauge potentials on the M5 brane in twisted equivariant cohomotopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we work out some variations on the discussion of the C-field flux densities in the Sati-Schreiber program. We start by explaining the need for global completion of the field content: the fluxes, the gauge potentials and the gauge transformations on the worldvolume of a single M5 brane in eleven-dimensional supergravity, and how this is encoded by the choice of flux quantization law.
  \smallskip Assuming Hypothesis H that the 4-flux in M-Theory is flux quantized in a non-abelian cohomology theory called 4-cohomotopy, and the three-flux on the M5 brane worldvolume in (twisted) 3-cohomotopy, we generalize some previous calculations known in the literature to include twisting by background gravity and placing M5 branes on orbifolds. We show that the null concordances of cohomotopically charged fluxes give rise to the traditional gauge potentials and the null concordances of concordances give rise to the corresponding gauge transformations via surjections, in the cases of tangentially twisted cohomotopy, twistorial cohomotopy and equivariant twistorial cohomotopy. We construct the surjections explicitly for these cases and check the consistency relations with the corresponding Bianchi identities.
  \smallskip Thus, we show how the traditional formulas for the local gauge potentials on M5 brane worldvolume on curved spacetimes and orbifolds are indeed reproduced by the homotopy theory and, as such, become amenable to global completion in cohomotopical charge quantization.</description>

      <title>Positivity bounds in scalar-QED EFT at one-loop level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the implication of positivity bounds on loop-generated dim-8 operator coefficients is a nontrivial task, as these bounds only strictly hold when all the contributions are included in the dispersion relation up to a certain loop order in the UV theory. As a step towards more realistic gauge theories such as the Standard Model, in this paper we study the positivity bounds in the Scalar QED Effective Field Theory (EFT) from the scalar-photon scattering ($\gamma\phi \to \gamma\phi$) and the photon-photon scattering ($\gamma\gamma \to \gamma\gamma$), derived from the dispersion relation of the full one-loop EFT amplitudes. Assuming the UV theory is weakly coupled and all heavy particles have spin $\leq1$, the leading dim-8 interaction for both amplitudes are generated at the one-loop level in the UV theory. Gauge invariance imposes strong constraints on the loop structures, while potential IR divergences also require careful treatments. Our findings reveal that, for $\gamma\phi \to \gamma\phi$, while the tree-level bound does not necessarily hold, the one-loop $\beta$-function of the corresponding coefficient always tends to restore the tree-level bound, unless its actual loop order in the UV theory is further suppressed. For $\gamma\gamma \to \gamma\gamma$, on the other hand, the tree-level positivity bound is still robust at the one-loop level in the UV theory. These findings are verified in two example UV models with a heavy scalar extension. Importantly, the bounds on the $\beta$-functions that we obtain should be considered as an accidental feature at one loop, rather than a fundamental property of the theory.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study how the fusion 2-category symmetry of a fermionic (2+1)d QFT can be affected when one allows for stacking with TQFTs to be an equivalence relation for QFTs. Focusing on a simple kind of fermionic fusion 2-category described purely by group theoretical data, our results reveal that by allowing for stacking with $\mathrm{Spin}(n)_1$ as an equivalence relation enables a finite set of inequivalent modifications to the original fusion 2-categorical-symmetry. To put our results in a broader context, we relate the order of the symmetry modifications to the image of a map between groups of minimal nondegenerate extensions, and to the tangential structure set by the initial categorical symmetry on the background manifold for the QFT.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Electron EDM in the NMSSM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM) with explicit CP violation offers a promising framework for explaining the observed baryon asymmetry while remaining consistent with stringent electric dipole moment (EDM) bounds. In this work, we identify a previously overlooked set of two-loop diagrams that contribute to fermion EDMs in the NMSSM. Our analysis of the electron EDM shows that, for certain NMSSM specific CP-violating phases, these diagrams partially cancel existing contributions, thereby relaxing the associated constraints. In other phases, the diagrams dominate and tighten the bounds, which in turn necessitates more finely tuned parameters to reconcile successful baryogenesis with current EDM limits.</description>

      <title>Grand-unification Theory Atlas: Standard Model and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Under a reasonable set of ab-initio assumptions, we define and chart the atlas of simple gauge theories with families of fermions whose masses are forbidden by gauge invariance. We propose a compass to navigate the atlas based on counting degrees of freedom. When searching for Grand-unification Theories with three matter generations, the free energy singles out the SU(5) Georgi-Glashow model as the minimal one, closely followed by SO(10) with spinorial matter. The atlas also defines the dryland of grand-unifiable gauge extensions of the standard model. We further provide examples relevant for gauge dual completions of the standard model as well as extensions by an additional SU(N) gauge symmetry.</description>

      <title>Dark Walker in the Early Universe: A Strongly Coupled Sector Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the phenomenology of the ``Dark Walker'' -- an $\text{SU}(3)$ theory with eight flavors of fundamental fermions in the dark sector. During inflation, its walking dynamics generate primordial non-Gaussianities through the exchange of unparticles, while accounting for the current dark matter relic abundance if the resulting massive pseudoscalars behave as strongly interacting massive particles (SIMPs). This provides a simple yet concrete example of a strongly coupled sector during inflation.</description>

      <title>A time-reversal invariant vortex in topological superconductors and gravitational $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a topological superconductor in the presence of a time-reversal invariant vortex. The eigenmodes of the Bogoliubov-de-Genne (BdG) Hamiltonian show a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topology: the time-reversal invariant vortex with odd winding number supports a pair of helical Majorana zero-modes at the vortex and the edge, while there is no such zero-modes when the winding number is even. We find that this $\mathbb{Z}_2$ structure can be interpreted as an emergent gravitational effect. Identifying the gap function as spatial components of the vielbein in 2 +1-dimensional gravity theory, we can explicitly convert the BdG equation into the Dirac equation coupled to a nontrivial gravitational background. We find that the gravitational curvature is induced at the vortex core, with its total flux quantized in integer multiples of $\pi$, reflecting the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological structure. Although the curvature vanishes everywhere except at the vortex core, the fermionic spectrum remains sensitive to the total curvature flux, owing to the gravitational Aharonov-Bohm effect.</description>

      <title>A proposal for the role of higher spin fields in Conformal Cyclic Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a research program into how the special properties of the cubic chiral higher spin gravity theory may play a role in conformal cyclic cosmology and black hole physics, in particular for the black hole information paradox. The paper is qualitative, raising a number of questions and connections, that may be interesting to pursue in more detail. The proposal is based on a new -- at least not so commonly expressed -- view on the presumptive role of higher spin gauge fields in fundamental physics. In short, it is proposed that the non-unitary time evolution of the cubic chiral higher spin gravity theory is precisely what is needed for bridging the very large entropy gap between aeons in Roger Penrose's cosmological theory CCC.</description>

Abstract: Monopoles have been a subject of much theoretical and experimental research since they were proposed to symmetrize Maxwells equations. However, no experimental signature of their existence has been detected. Many mechanisms have been proposed to explain this lack of success. In here we generalize QED to a two photon theory where the magnetic photon and the monopole belong to dark matter. A naive mixing interaction produces duality and generates experimental consequences for indirect monopole detection via the magnetic charge of the electron.</description>

      <title>On the third law of black hole mechanics for supersymmetric black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently it has been shown that the third law of black hole mechanics can be violated: an exactly extremal Reissner-Nordstrom black hole can form in finite time in gravitational collapse of matter with a large charge to mass ratio. However, it has also been proved that this cannot happen if the matter satisfies a ``supersymmetric'' lower bound on its energy in terms of its charge. This paper proves an analogous result for black holes with a negative cosmological constant. The result states that a supersymmetric Kerr-Newman-anti de Sitter black hole cannot form in gravitational collapse of charged matter satisfying the supersymmetric bound. The results for zero or negative cosmological constant are extended to apply to two-sided black holes: it is proved that an initially non-extremal black hole cannot evolve to a supersymmetric black hole in finite time, irrespective of whether or not the initial black hole was formed in gravitational collapse.</description>

      <title>Analytic toolkit for the Anderson model with arbitrary disorder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Anderson model in one dimension is a quantum particle on a discrete chain of sites with nearest-neighbor hopping and random on-site potentials. It is a progenitor of many further models of disordered systems, and it has spurred numerous developments in diverse branches of physics. The literature is silent, however, on practical analytic tools for computing the density-of-states of this model when the distribution of the on-site potentials is arbitrary. Here, supersymmetry-based techniques are employed to give an explicit linear integral equation whose solutions control the density-of-states. The output of this analytic procedure is in perfect agreement with numerical sampling. By Thouless formula, these results immediately provide analytic control over the localization length.</description>

      <title>Casimir Energy and Modularity in Higher-dimensional Conformal Field Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.14866v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An important problem in Quantum Field Theory (QFT) is to understand the structures of observables on spacetime manifolds of nontrivial topology. Such observables arise naturally when studying physical systems at finite temperature and/or finite volume and encode subtle properties of the underlying microscopic theory that are often obscure on the flat spacetime. Locality of the QFT implies that these observables can be constructed from more basic building blocks by cutting-and-gluing along a spatial slice, where a crucial ingredient is the Hilbert space on the spatial manifold. In Conformal Field Theory (CFT), thanks to the operator-state correspondence, we have a non-perturbative understanding of the Hilbert space on a spatial sphere. However it remains a challenge to consider more general spatial manifolds. Here we study CFTs in spacetime dimensions $d&gt;2$ on the spatial manifold $T^2\times \mathbb{R}^{d-3}$ which is one of the simplest manifolds beyond the spherical topology. We focus on the ground state in this Hilbert space and analyze universal properties of the ground state energy, also commonly known as the Casimir energy, which is a nontrivial function of the complex structure moduli $\tau$ of the torus. The Casimir energy is subject to constraints from modular invariance on the torus which we spell out using $PSL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ spectral theory. Moreover we derive a simple universal formula for the Casimir energy in the thin torus limit using the effective field theory (EFT) from Kaluza-Klein reduction of the CFT, with exponentially small corrections from worldline instantons. We illustrate our formula with explicit examples from well-known CFTs including the critical $O(N)$ model in $d=3$ and holographic CFTs in $d\geq 3$.</description>

      <title>The K\"all\'en-Lehmann representation in de Sitter spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.00090v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study two-point functions of symmetric traceless local operators in the bulk of de Sitter spacetime. We derive the K\"all\'en-Lehmann spectral decomposition for any spin and show that unitarity implies its spectral densities are nonnegative. In addition, we recover the K\"all\'en-Lehmann decomposition in Minkowski space by taking the flat space limit. Using harmonic analysis and the Wick rotation to Euclidean Anti de Sitter, we derive an inversion formula to compute the spectral densities. Using the inversion formula, we relate the analytic structure of the spectral densities to the late-time boundary operator content. We apply our technical tools to study two-point functions of composite operators in free and weakly coupled theories. In the weakly coupled case, we show how the K\"all\'en-Lehmann decomposition is useful to find the anomalous dimensions of the late-time boundary operators. We also derive the K\"all\'en-Lehmann representation of two-point functions of spinning primary operators of a Conformal Field Theory on de Sitter.</description>

      <title>A story of non-conformal branes: spindles, disks, circles and black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03989v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the $(p+2)$-dimensional gauged supergravities arising as a consistent truncation of type II on $S^{8-p}$, which are associated with the near-horizon limit of D$p$-branes, for $p=2,4,5,6$ (and NS5-branes for $p=5$). In a truncation of these theories with only abelian gauge fields and scalars, we find several classes of new solutions, with and without supersymmetry. Our ansatz for such backgrounds is inspired by the recent progress in the study of branes wrapped on orbifolds, but unlike those examples we consider "non-conformal branes", $i.e.$ no Anti de Sitter factors in the metric. Focusing on cases with non-trivial gauge fields, we can divide the solutions that we present in three categories: 1) branes wrapping Riemann surfaces, spindles and disks, 2) branes wrapped on a circle with a holonomy for the gauge field along the circle and 3) electrically charged black holes in gauged supergravity, which uplift to rotating branes in ten dimensions. We carefully analyze the conditions for supersymmetry in all these cases.</description>

Abstract: In recent years, the holographic duality between $T\bar{T}$-deformed conformal field theory (CFT) and Anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime with finite radial cutoff has received significant attention. The study of $T\bar{T}$ deformation within the framework of de Sitter (dS)/CFT duality has also progressed. This paper shows that the trace flow equation in dS spacetime can be analytically extended from its AdS counterpart through double Wick rotations. Meanwhile, we generalize the replica method in both AdS and dS holography to derive a general expression for the entanglement entropy of arbitrary single spatial intervals within the $T\bar{T}$-deformed framework. For both finite size and finite temperature systems, we obtain the analytical expression for the entanglement entropy after $T\bar{T}$ deformation. Finally, in dS/dS holography and half-dS holography, we find that the dual field theory exhibits non-locality by analyzing the strong subadditivity and boosted strong subadditivity of entanglement entropy.</description>

      <title>Bridging 4D QFTs and 2D VOAs via 3D high-temperature EFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18130v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The high-temperature limit of the superconformal index, especially on higher sheets, often captures useful universal information about a theory. In 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal field theories with fractional r-charges, there exists a special notion of high-temperature limit on higher sheets that captures data of three-dimensional topological quantum field theories arising from r-twisted circle reduction. These TQFTs are closely tied with the VOA of the 4d SCFT. We study such high-temperature limits. More specifically, we apply Di~Pietro-Komargodski type supersymmetric effective field theory techniques to r-twisted circle reductions of $(A_1,A_{2n})$ Argyres-Douglas theories, leveraging their Maruyoshi-Song Lagrangian with manifest $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetry. The result on the second sheet is the Gang-Kim-Stubbs family of 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ SUSY enhancing rank-$0$ theories with monopole superpotentials, whose boundary supports the Virasoro minimal model VOAs $M(2,2n+3)$. Upon topological twist, they give non-unitary TQFTs controlled by the $M(2,2n+3)$ modular tensor category (MTC). The high-temperature limit on other sheets yields their unitary or non-unitary Galois conjugates. This opens up the prospect of a broader four-supercharge perspective on the celebrated correspondence between 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFTs and 2d VOAs via interpolating 3d EFTs. Several byproducts follow, including a systematic approach to 3d SUSY enhancement from 4d SUSY enhancement, and a 3d QFT handle on Galois orbits of various MTCs associated with 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFTs.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the $\mathcal{N} = 2$ supersymmetric generalization of the dual equivalence between the Maxwell-Chern-Simons model and two massive self-dual models. One of the self-dual models is described by a real scalar superfield, while the other is described by a chiral spinor superfield. The equivalence is analyzed in the presence of dynamical matter chiral superfields. Initially, we establish the duality by demonstrating the existence of master actions that interpolate between the models. We then show that the field equations are identical when the proper identifications are made. Finally, we confirm the dual equivalence by defining a master generating functional, which, after changing the variables, provides the generating functionals of the Maxwell-Chern-Simons model and the two massive self-dual models coupled to matter.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the emergence of geometric phases in chiral transformations within gauge theories coupled to fermions. We begin by analyzing the Schwinger model in (1+1) dimensions, where chiral symmetry is explicitly modified due to the dynamical generation of a photon mass. This model provides a controlled setting to study the interplay between anomalies and vacuum structure.
  Building on these insights, we extend our analysis to four-dimensional QED by promoting the vacuum angle $\theta$ to a dynamical field $\theta(x)$. This generalization allows us to explore how the axial anomaly and the presence of a nontrivial vacuum structure modify the conventional chiral symmetry.
  Using the adiabatic approximation, we demonstrate that chiral transformations are modified by the emergence of a nontrivial Berry phase, which introduces a geometric correction that depends on the topological properties of the vacuum. This result suggests that chiral transformations acquire an effective gauge structure in parameter space, in the presence of a dynamical $\theta(x)$ field, leading to new physical consequences at low energies.
  This framework establishes a novel connection between chiral symmetries, anomalies, and geometric phases, offering a unified approach to describing topological effects, vacuum structure, and infrared modifications in gauge theories with fermions. Moreover, our results suggest that Berry phases play a crucial role in the infrared structure of QED, potentially providing a mechanism for regularizing infrared divergences in theories with axial anomalies.</description>

Abstract: We investigate black hole quasinormal modes using the exact WKB method. We perform an analytic continuation from the horizon to infinity along the positive real axis of the radial coordinate and impose appropriate boundary conditions at these asymptotic positions. We clarify the role of previously overlooked logarithmic spirals of Stokes curves and branch cuts emerging from the horizon. We carefully reformulate the derivation of the quasinormal mode conditions using the exact WKB analysis, incorporating the contributions from these features into the calculation. We successfully derive correct results for both solvable model examples and the Schwarzschild spacetime. Our formulation enjoys straightforward extensions to other background geometries as well as a wide range of other physical systems.</description>

      <title>Soft theorems and spontaneous symmetry breaking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10577v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The soft photon and soft graviton theorems of Weinberg are known to derive from conservation laws associated with asymptotic symmetries. Within the corresponding classical theories, one often speaks of spontaneous symmetry breaking and vacuum degeneracy, but a genuine quantum description of this phenomenon has largely been lacking. Here we establish spontaneous breaking of asymptotic symmetries and the existence of Goldstone `particles' using exclusively the language of quantum field theory. This is made possible through the reformulation of massless scattering theory in terms of carrollian conformal field theory, and the observation that soft theorems correspond to Ward identities of broken symmetries. A suitable version of Goldstone theorem shows that there must exist zero-momentum particles described by conformal fields on the celestial sphere, in agreement with the common lore. More specifically, these belong to unitary representations in the discrete series of the Lorentz group, and are therefore naturally equipped with logarithmic two-point functions. We discuss the relevance of these observations to the problem of infrared divergences that scattering amplitudes suffer from.</description>

      <title>The non-relativistic limit of HSZ Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22707v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the non-relativistic (NR) limit of HSZ theory, a higher-derivative theory of gravity with exact and manifest T-duality invariance. Since the theory can be formulated using the generalized metric formalism, the HSZ Lagrangian remains convergent to all orders in derivatives when taking the NR limit. In this work, we analyze the three-derivative corrections to the symmetry transformations of the fields in the NR case, as well as the four-derivative action in the absence of a b-field. Interestingly, the corrections to the metric degrees of freedom cannot be fully trivialized, as in the relativistic case, in order to preserve the convergence of the theory. As HSZ theory interpolates order by order between heterotic and bosonic string theories, the results of this work can be interpreted as a truncation of the four-derivative structure of heterotic supergravity in the NR limit.</description>

      <title>Charged rotating quantum black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19941v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamic and holographic properties of charged and rotating quantum black holes in a doubly holographic braneworld setup. These quantum black holes are derived from the anti-de Sitter C-metric and are exact solutions to a semi-classical gravitational theory which incorporates all orders of the backreaction of quantum fields on spacetime. The inclusion of both charge and rotation extends and generalizes previous studies. The thermodynamics and critical behavior of the black holes are examined from the bulk, brane, and boundary perspectives, and we demonstrate that the inclusion of either charge or rotation removes the re-entrant phase transitions seen in the neutral-static case. The critical exponents of the system are calculated using numerical methods and found to differ from the standard mean field theory values for the neutral-static black holes' re-entrant phase transitions, but in agreement with mean-field theory for the phase transitions of the black holes with charge and rotation. Additionally, to test the validity of the semiclassical treatment, we study a mass-gap energy scale $M_{\rm gap}$ to identify regimes where quantum fluctuations of spacetime geometry are expected to become significant and speculate about a connection with weak cosmic censorship gedankenexperiments. We also generalize the quantum Penrose inequality and the quantum reverse isoperimetric inequality to include charge and rotation. Finally, we compute a renormalized gyromagnetic ratio and analyze it in the limit of large backreaction.</description>

      <title>Higher-derivative Heterotic Kerr-Sen Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain the four-derivative corrections to the Kerr-Sen solution in heterotic supergravity, which includes the Gibbons-Maeda-Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger solution as a limiting case. In particular, we first embed the Kerr solution into heterotic supergravity and compute the higher-derivative corrections. We then obtain the corrections to the Kerr-Sen solution by performing an $O(2,1)$ boost of the Kerr solution, which, in contrast to the two-derivative case, requires field redefinitions to make the $O(2,1)$ invariance of the action manifest. Finally, we compute the multipole moments and find that they are distinct from those of the Kerr solution at the four-derivative level. We also find that the multipole moments are distinct from those of the Kerr-Newman solution in Einstein-Maxwell theory at the four-derivative level, even for the most general choice of four-derivative corrections. This gives a way to experimentally distinguish traces of string theory in gravitational wave data.</description>

Abstract: This is the 10th and final chapter of my book on Quantum Information, based on the course I have been teaching at Caltech since 1997. An earlier version of this chapter (originally Chapter 5) has been available on the course website since 1998, but this version is substantially revised and expanded. Topics covered include classical Shannon theory, quantum compression, quantifying entanglement, accessible information, and using the decoupling principle to derive achievable rates for quantum protocols. This is a draft, pre-publication copy of Chapter 10, which I will continue to update. See the URL on the title page for further updates and drafts of other chapters, and please send me an email if you notice errors.</description>

      <title>Classical double copy in the black hole mini-superspace</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09374v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a novel formulation of classical double copy in the mini-superspace of static, spherically symmetric black holes where the map between the solutions of general relativity and Maxwell's theory can be realized in Boyer-Lindsquit coordinates. By employing the reduced action principle, we show that the double copy structure can be generalized to Lovelock gravities and quasi-topological gravities. However, the gravitational solutions are mapped to the purely electric solutions of Maxwell's theory with a difference: instead of a direct match between the Kerr-Schild scalar in the gravity side and the scalar potential in the gauge theory side, the scalar potential becomes a polynomial in the Kerr-Schild scalar, giving rise to a generalization of the Kerr-Schild double copy. We calculate the Regge-Teitelboim surface charges and prove that the mass of the black hole solution is identified with the electric charge corresponding to the Coulomb part of the gauge theory solution in the same way it does in the case of general relativity.</description>

      <title>Mass-Assisted Local Deconfinement in a Confined $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Lattice Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11645v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Confinement is a prominent phenomenon in condensed matter and high-energy physics that has recently become the focus of quantum-simulation experiments of lattice gauge theories (LGTs). As such, a theoretical understanding of the effect of confinement on LGT dynamics is not only of fundamental importance, but can lend itself to upcoming experiments. Here, we show how confinement in a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT can be locally avoided by proximity to a resonance between the fermion mass and the electric field strength. Furthermore, we show that this local deconfinement can become global for certain initial conditions, where information transport occurs over the entire chain. In addition, we show how this can lead to strong quantum many-body scarring starting in different initial states. Our findings provide deeper insights into the nature of confinement in $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGTs and can be tested on current and near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-enhanced Lieb-Robinson bounds for a class of Bose-Hubbard type Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04672v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several recent works have derived Lieb-Robinson bounds (LRBs) for Bose-Hubbard-type Hamiltonians. For certain structured initial states, e.g., vacuum perturbations or near-stationary states, information propagates with velocity $v \leq C$ . However, for general bounded-density initial states, it was shown by the first author, Vu, and Saito that the velocity can grow in time as $v \sim t^{D-1}$, where $D$ is the spatial dimension -- demonstrating the possibility of accelerated information spreading in bosonic systems. In this work, we introduce a new perspective on this phenomenon: we show that translation invariance combined with local $p$-body repulsion ($n^p$ with $p &gt; D+1$) qualitatively alters the propagation behavior, leading to a bound of the form $v \sim t^{\frac{D}{p - D - 1}}$ for general bounded-energy-density initial states. In particular, this establishes for an almost-linear light cone at large $p$, in stark contrast to the previously found accelerated regimes. Our result identifies symmetry-driven constraints as a new mechanism for suppressing propagation speed in bosonic systems and thereby reframes the scope of what types of LRBs can hold. We further provide matching examples showing that, under the given assumptions, this bound is sharp -- no further improvement in the power of $t$ is possible without invoking additional dynamical constraints.</description>

      <title>Random matrix universality in dynamical correlation functions at late times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12103v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the behavior of two-time correlation functions at late times for finite system sizes considering observables whose (one-point) average value does not depend on energy. In the long time limit, we show that such correlation functions display a ramp and a plateau determined by the correlations of energy levels, similar to what is already known for the spectral form factor. The plateau value is determined, in absence of degenerate energy levels, by the fluctuations of diagonal matrix elements, which highlights differences between different symmetry classes. We show this behavior analytically by employing results from Random Matrix Theory and the Eigenstate Thermalisation Hypothesis, and numerically by exact diagonalization in the toy example of a Hamiltonian drawn from a Random Matrix ensemble and in a more realistic example of disordered spin glasses at high temperature. Importantly, correlation functions in the ramp regime do not show self-averaging behaviour, and, at difference with the spectral form factor the time average does not coincide with the ensemble average.</description>

      <title>Composite heavy axion-like dark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel class of Dark Matter (DM) candidates in the form of a heavy composite Axion-Like Particle (ALP) with highly suppressed electromagnetic interactions populating vast yet unexplored domains in the ALP parameter space. This is achieved for the first time in the simplest dark confining gauge theory yielding a new composite glueball ALP (GALP) DM coupling-mass relation found in terms of two distinct fundamental scales -- the large dark fermion mass scale and the dynamical scale of dark confinement. The presence of a heavy fermion portal between the visible (photons) and dark (GALPs) sectors ensures a strong radiative suppression of the GALP-photon coupling naturally without any fine-tuning. The observable features of heavy GALP DM in a minimal realization are controlled by only three physical parameters. Our work paves the road for a novel research field exploring the theory and phenomenology of composite ALPs in multi-messenger astrophysics and cosmology.</description>

      <title>Geometry and periods of $G_2$-moduli spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09987v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the geometry of the moduli space $\mathscr{M}$ of torsion-free $G_2$-structures on a compact $G_2$-manifold $M$, equipped with the volume-normalised $L^2$-metric $\mathscr{G}$. When $b^1(M) = 0$, this metric is known to be of Hessian type and to admit a global potential. Here we give a new description of the geometry of $\mathscr{M}$, based on the observation that there is a natural way to immerse the moduli space into a homogeneous space $\mathfrak{D}$ diffeomorphic to $GL(n+1)/ (\{\pm 1\} \times O(n))$, where $n = b^3(M) - 1$. We point out that the formal properties of this immersion $\Phi : \mathscr{M} \rightarrow \mathfrak{D}$ are very similar to those of the period map defined on the moduli spaces of Calabi--Yau threefolds. With a view to understand the curvatures of $\mathscr{G}$, we also derive a new formula for the fourth derivative of the potential and relate it to the second fundamental form of $\Phi(\mathscr{M}) \subset \mathfrak{D}$.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-wave signatures of non-violent non-locality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13714v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measurement of gravitational waves can provide precision tests of the nature of black holes and compact objects. In this work, we test Giddings' non-violent non-locality proposal, which posits that quantum information is transferred via a nonlocal interaction that generates metric perturbations around black holes. In contrast to firewalls, these quantum fluctuations would be spread out over a larger distance range -- up to a Schwarzschild radius away. In this letter, we model the modification to the gravitational waveform from non-violent non-locality. We modify the nonspinning EOBNRv2 effective one body waveform to include metric perturbations that are due to a random Gaussian process. We find that the waveform exhibits random deviations which are particularly important in the late inspiral-plunge phase. We find an optimal dephasing parameter for detecting this effect with a principal component analysis. This is particularly intriguing because it predicts random phase deviations across different gravitational wave events, providing theoretical support for hierarchical tests of general relativity. We estimate the constraint on the perturbations in non-violent non-locality with events for the LIGO-Virgo network and for a third-generation network.</description>

      <title>Confined Monopoles in Chiral Bag</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The chiral bag model offers a dual description of hadron physics in terms of quarks and hadrons in the sense of Cheshire Cat principle. In this work, we find that, within the chiral bag, confinement is likely caused by monopole condensation. The chiral bag surface can be interpreted as an $\eta'$ domain wall, where a dynamical Chern-Simons theory emerges. Under level-rank duality, the Chern-Simons theory serves as the counterterm introduced to block the so-called color charge leakage. To ensure the correct net baryon number of the full chiral bag, an additional Chern-Simons theory involving the vector meson field arises on the bag surface and extends outside the bag. This leads to a Chern-Simons-Higgs theory localized on the $\eta'$ domain wall, as previously conjectured. We also propose that the skyrmion description of baryons could be understood as a system of monopoles enveloped by a meson cloud.</description>

      <title>Non-commutativity in Hayward spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17789v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a new black hole solution, namely, a Hayward-like metric incorporating corrections due to non-commutativity by taking into account $\partial_r\wedge\partial_\theta$ Moyal twist. We begin by deriving this solution using the non-commutative gauge theory framework. The general properties of the metric are then analyzed, including the event horizon structure and the Kretschmann scalar. Analogous to the standard Hayward solution, the modified black hole remains regular, provided that additional dependence on the angle $\theta$. Next, we examine the thermodynamic properties, computing the Hawking temperature, entropy, and heat capacity. From the temperature profile, we verify that there is no physical remnant mass when $T^{(\Theta,l)} \to 0$, indicating a complete evaporation process. Quantum radiation is analyzed by considering both bosonic and fermionic particle modes, with an estimation of the particle creation density provided for each case. The effective potential is evaluated perturbatively to accomplish the analysis of quasinormal modes and the time-domain response for scalar perturbations. The study of null geodesics is explored to enable the characterization of the photon sphere and black hole shadows. Additionally, constraints on the shadows are estimated based on EHT (Event Horizon Telescope) data. Furthermore, the Gaussian curvature is determined to assess the stability of critical orbits, followed by an analysis of gravitational lensing using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. Finally, the constraints (bounds) on the parameters $\Theta$ (non-commutativity) and $l$ (``Hayward parameter'') are derived based on solar system tests, including the perihelion precession of Mercury, light deflection, and the Shapiro time delay effect.</description>

      <title>Topological regular black holes without Cauchy horizon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04427v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Regular and spherically symmetric black holes that solve the singularity problems of the Schwarzschild solution are phenomenologically viable at large distance but usually suffer from the Cauchy horizon instability. To overcome this drawback, we extended the analysis to include hyperbolic and toroidal horizon topologies within the framework of static, topologically maximally symmetric spacetimes. We show that both hyperbolic and toroidal black holes can be constructed without Cauchy horizons and without curvature singularities, thereby avoiding the mass inflation instability. These solutions exhibit asymptotic flatness in a generalized quasi-Minkowskian sense. The phenomenological aspects of these solutions are also studied by examining their thermodynamical properties, the photon sphere, and the effective potentials, ensuring consistency with observable properties such as black hole shadows. Lastly, we investigate a reconstruction technique within a scalar-tensor gravity framework, illustrating how the discussed metrics can arise from well-defined scalar field dynamics. Our investigation presents a viable pathway for constructing physically realistic, regular black holes in both General Relativity and modified gravity, broadening the landscape of singularity-free spacetimes and offering models that may better reflect the nature of strong gravitational fields in astrophysical and cosmological settings.</description>

Abstract: We show that for massless helicity $h$ particles, the angular momentum eigenstates are given in an appropriate coordinate system by the spin-weighted spherical harmonics ${_{-h}Y_{jm}}$ of spin-weight $-h$. In particular, these are simultaneous eigenstates of the Hamiltonian, helicity, $J^2$, and $J_z$. The appearance of the spin-weighted spherical harmonics as opposed to the ordinary spherical harmonics reflects the nontrivial topological structure of massless particles with nonzero helicity. The resultant angular momentum multiplet structure is quite different than that of massive particles, with at most one multiplet for each angular momentum $j$ and with $|h|$ acting as a lower bound on $j$. This illustrates the obstruction to a spin-orbital decomposition of the angular momentum for massless particles, as such a sparse multiplet structure is not consistent with any reasonable spin-orbital splitting.</description>

      <title>Entanglement, Trace Anomaly and Confinement in QCD</title>

Abstract: We formulate confinement in QCD as an entropic surface phenomenon. Quark and gluon quantum information is localized on a two-dimensional transverse sheet of radius $R_{\mathrm{EE}}$; at this radius the QCD vacuum -- partitioned by a hadron into interior and exterior regions -- reaches its maximal entanglement entropy. Lattice QCD determinations of scalar (trace) gravitational form factors of hadrons fix both $R_{\mathrm{EE}}$ and the transverse trace-anomaly density $\rho_h(R_{\mathrm{EE}})$ with percent-level accuracy, enabling a parameter-free mechanical entropy $S_{\mathrm{EE}}(y)=c_h\,y$ growing linearly with rapidity $y$. The associated entropy gradient changes sign at $R_{\mathrm{EE}}$: it repels color fields for $r&lt;R_{\mathrm{EE}}$ and attracts them for $r&gt;R_{\mathrm{EE}}$, trapping partons at all scales -- UV and IR -- in contrast to Wilson's area law, which probes only long distances. Squaring the entropy density, as required by unitarity, yields $\sigma\propto y^{\delta}$. World data demand $\delta=2$ for elastic $pp\,(p\bar p)$ scattering and heavy-quark photoproduction, but a softer $\delta=0.387$ for $\phi$ photoproduction, all two orders of magnitude below the Froissart--Martin bound. These results provide the first confinement criterion derived directly from nonperturbative QCD, unifying the trace anomaly, entanglement entropy, and high-energy scattering within a single quantitative framework.</description>
