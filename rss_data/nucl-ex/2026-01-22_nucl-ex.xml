      <title>Experimental Determination of Slow-Neutron Detection Efficiency and Background Discrimination in Mixed Radiation Fields Using Differential CR-39 Track Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measuring slow neutrons is difficult when the radiation field also contains charged particles and fast neutrons, especially when the radiation composition is not known in advance. In this work, we present a tested method to measure slow neutron fluence using CR-39 solid state nuclear track detectors. Two detectors are used together: a boron coated CR-39 detector and an uncoated CR-39 detector.The uncoated detector records tracks from charged particles and fast neutrons but does not respond to slow neutrons. The boron coated detector additionally detects charged particles produced when slow neutrons react with boron and generate lithium and alpha particles. Subtracting the track density of the uncoated detector from that of the boron coated detector provides a reliable and conservative measure of slow neutrons.Experiments using a reference thermal neutron source show that the difference between the two detectors increases linearly with exposure time. Statistical analysis gives a slow neutron equivalent track rate of 5.84 plus or minus 0.18 tracks per minute, clearly different from zero. The slope of this response is used to determine the detection efficiency of the boron coated detector. The uncoated detector measures the background caused by fast neutron leakage from the source.
  These results show that boron coated CR-39 detectors cannot be used alone for accurate slow neutron measurements. Reliable neutron fluence determination requires the simultaneous use of an uncoated detector. The difference between the two detectors provides a correct estimate of the thermal neutron flux in mixed radiation fields and where conventional neutron detectors cannot be used.</description>

      <title>Probing Late-Stage Hadronic Interactions at High Baryon Density via $K^{*0}$ Production in the RHIC Beam Energy Scan Program</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A precision measurement of the $K^{*0}$ meson yield is reported in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 7.7,\; 11.5,\; 14.6,\; 19.6,$ and $27~\mathrm{GeV}$ using the high-statistics data sample collected by the STAR experiment during the Beam Energy Scan II (BES-II) program at RHIC. The transeverse momentum ($p_{T}$)-integrated yield ratios $(K^{*0} + \overline{K^{*0}})/(K^{+} + K^{-})$ in central collisions show a suppression relative to peripheral collisions at the $(1.7\text{-}3.6)\,\sigma$ level, while a thermal model without final-stage rescattering overpredicts this ratio with a deviation of $(6.9\text{-}8.2)\,\sigma$. These results indicate a loss of the measured $K^{*0}$ signal in central collisions due to re-scattering of its hadronic decay products in the hadronic phase. The $p_{T}$-integrated yield of charged kaons exhibits an approximate scaling with charged-particle multiplicity, independent of collision energy and system size. A similar trend is observed for the short-lived $K^{*0}$ resonance, although significant deviations emerge at lower energies. At BES energies, the $K^{*0}/K$ ratio shows stronger suppression than at the highest RHIC and LHC energies within a given multiplicity bin, particularly in central and mid-central collisions. This behavior is consistent with changes in the effective hadronic interaction cross section and is supported by transport model calculations, which indicate dominant meson-baryon interactions at lower energies and meson-meson interactions at higher energies.</description>

      <title>One- and three-dimensional identical charged-kaon femtoscopic correlations in Pb--Pb collisions at $\mathbf{ \sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}=5.02}$ TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The identical charged-kaon correlations induced by quantum-statistics effects and final-state interactions are measured in Pb$-$Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 5.02$ TeV. The results of one- (1D) and three-dimensional (3D) analyses show that the obtained system-size parameters (radii) are smaller for more peripheral collisions and decrease with increasing pair transverse momentum $k_{\rm T}$. The 1D parameters agree within uncertainties with those obtained in Pb$-$Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=2.76$ TeV. The observed power-law dependence of the extracted 3D radii as a function of the pair transverse momentum is a signature of the collective flow in the particle-emitting system created in Pb$-$Pb collisions. This dependence is well reproduced by the integrated hydrokinetic model calculations except for the outward projection of the radius (measured in the longitudinally co-moving system) for the most central collisions. The time of maximal emission for kaons is extracted from the 3D analysis in a wide collision centrality range from 0 to 90%. Its reduction with decreasing charged-particle multiplicity is well reproduced by the hydrokinetic model predictions, and means that kaons are emitted earlier in more peripheral events.</description>

      <title>Space-time evolution of particle emission in p$-$Pb collisions at $\mathbf{\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=~5.02}$ TeV with 3D kaon femtoscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The measurement of three-dimensional femtoscopic correlations between identical charged kaons (K$^\pm$K$^\pm$) produced in p$-$Pb collisions at center-of-mass energy per nucleon pair $\sqrt{s{_{\rm NN}}} = 5.02$ TeV with ALICE at the LHC is presented for the first time. This measurement, supplementary to those in pp and Pb$-$Pb collisions, allows understanding the particle-production mechanisms at different charged-particle multiplicities and provides information on the dynamics of the source of particles created in p$-$Pb collisions, for which a general consensus does not yet exist. It is shown that the measured source sizes increase with charged-particle multiplicity and decrease with increasing pair transverse momentum. These trends for K$^\pm$K$^\pm$ are similar to the ones observed earlier in identical charged-pion and K$_{\rm s}^{0}$K$_{\rm s}^{0}$ correlations in Pb$-$Pb collisions at various energies and in $\pi^\pm \pi^\pm$ correlations in p$-$Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s{_{\rm NN}}} = 5.02$ TeV. At comparable multiplicity, the source sizes measured in p$-$Pb collisions agree within uncertainties with those observed in pp collisions, and there is an indication that they are smaller than those observed in Pb$-$Pb collisions. The obtained results are also compared with predictions from the hadronic interaction model EPOS~3, which tends to underestimate the source size for the most central collisions and agrees with the data for semicentral and peripheral events. Furthermore, the time of maximal emission for kaons is extracted. It turns out to be comparable with the value obtained in highly peripheral Pb$-$Pb collisions at the same energy, indicating that the kaon emission evolution is similar to that in p$-$Pb collisions.</description>

      <title>Differentiable quantum-trajectory simulation of Lindblad dynamics for QGP transport-coefficient inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study parameter estimation for the transport coefficients of the quark-gluon plasma by differentiating open-quantum-system-based Monte Carlo simulations of quarkonium suppression. The underlying simulator requires solving a Lindblad equation in a large Hilbert space, which makes parameter estimation computationally expensive. We approach the problem using gradient-based optimization. Specifically, we apply the score-function gradient estimator to differentiate through discrete jump sampling in the Monte Carlo wave-function algorithm used to solve the Lindblad equation. The resulting stochastic gradient estimator exhibits sufficiently low variance and can still be estimated in an embarrassingly parallel manner, enabling efficient scaling of the simulations. We implement this gradient estimator in the existing open-source quarkonium suppression code QTraj. To demonstrate its utility for parameter estimation, we infer the two transport coefficients $\hat{\kappa}$ and $\hat{\gamma}$ using gradient-based optimization on synthetic nuclear modification factor data.</description>

      <title>$H$ dibaryon and its cousins from SU(6)-constrained baryon-baryon interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We constrain the $S$-wave baryon-baryon interaction using SU(6) symmetry within a nonrelativistic effective field theory. The most general leading-order Lagrangian contains two independent parameters, which we determine using physical $NN$ and lattice QCD $\Omega\Omega$ scattering lengths. This framework allows for parameter-free predictions in the strangeness $S=-2$ sector relevant to the $H$ dibaryon. Solving the coupled-channel scattering problem, we identify two bound states below the $\Lambda\Lambda$ threshold, one deeply bound and one shallow, along with resonances near the $\Sigma\Sigma$ and $\Sigma^*\Sigma^*$ thresholds. We demonstrate that these poles result in distinct enhancements in $\Lambda\Lambda$ invariant mass distributions, suggesting that the $H$ dibaryon exists as a multichannel bound state and providing clear signatures for experimental verification.</description>

      <title>$\textit{Ab initio}$ Exact Calculation of Strongly-Correlated Nucleonic Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09252v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dense nucleonic matter is of vital importance for understanding compact stars and inferring the transition into deconfined quark phase. We present the $\textit{ab initio}$ exact calculations of infinite nucleonic matter with the state-of-the-art full configuration-interaction quantum Monte Carlo (FCIQMC) method, enabling us to rigorously benchmark many-body methods and assess the degree to which the nucleonic matter is correlated. This method has been numerically validated by exact diagonalization within a small model space. Calculations of nucleonic matter using chiral nuclear forces reveal that the symmetric nuclear matter is strikingly strongly correlated, raising questions on previous $\textit{ab initio}$ calculations of nuclear matter with many-body expansion truncations and offering insights into simultaneous descriptions of finite nuclei and infinite nucleonic matter from first principles.</description>

      <title>Skewness-dependent moments of the pion GPD from nonlocal quark-bilinear correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present lattice QCD calculations of the odd Mellin moments of pion valence-quark generalized parton distribution (GPD) up to fifth order, $\langle x^4\rangle$, and for the skewness range $[-0.33, 0]$ using operator product expansion of bilocal quark-bilinear operators. The calculations are performed on an ensemble with lattice spacing $a=0.04~\mathrm{fm}$ and valence pion mass $300$ $\mathrm{MeV}$, employing boosted pion states with momenta up to 2.428 GeV and momentum transfers reaching 2.748 GeV$^2$. We employ ratio-scheme renormalization and next-to-leading-logarithmic resummed perturbative matching. At zero skewness, our results are consistent with previous lattice studies. By combining matrix elements at multiple values of skewness and momentum transfer, skewness-dependent moments are obtained through simultaneous polynomiality-constrained fits.</description>
