      <title>Shock waves in nonlinear transmission lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider interaction between the small amplitude travelling waves ("sound") and the shock waves in the transmission line containing both nonlinear capacitors and nonlinear inductors. We calculate for the "sound" wave the coefficient of reflection from (the coefficient of transmission through) the shock wave. These coefficients are expressed in terms of the wave speeds and the wave impedances. When only the capacitors or only the inductors are nonlinear, the coefficients are expressed in terms of the wave speeds only. We explicitly include into consideration of the shocks the dissipation, introducing ohmic resistors shunting the inductors and also in series with the capacitors. This allows us to describe the shocks as physical objects of finite width and study their profiles. In some particular cases the profiles were obtained in terms of elementary functions.</description>

      <title>Dynamic instabilities and turbulence of merged rotating Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18474v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the simulation results of merging harmonically confined rotating Bose-Einstein condensates in two dimensions. Merging of the condensate is triggered by positioning the rotation axis at the trap minima and moving both condensates towards each other while slowly ramping their rotation frequency. We analyze the dynamics of the merged condensate by letting them evolve under a single harmonic trap. We systematically investigate the formation of solitonic and vortex structures in the final, unified condensate, considering both non-rotating and rotating initial states. In both cases, merging leads to the formation of solitons that decay into vortex pairs through snake instability, and subsequently, these pairs annihilate. Soliton formation and decay-induced phase excitations generate sound waves, more pronounced when the merging time is short. We witness no sound wave generation at sufficiently longer merging times that finally leads to the condensate reaching its ground state. With rotation, we notice off-axis merging (where the rotation axes are not aligned), leading to the distortion and weakening of soliton formation. The incompressible kinetic energy spectrum exhibits a Kolmogorov-like cascade [$E(k) \sim k^{-5/3}$] in the initial stage for merging condensates rotating above a critical frequency and a Vinen-like cascade [$E(k) \sim k^{-1}$] at a later time for all cases. Our findings hold potential significance for atomic interferometry, continuous atomic lasers, and quantum sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Deep learning for dynamic modeling and coded information storage of vector-soliton pulsations in mode-locked fiber lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Soliton pulsations are ubiquitous feature of non-stationary soliton dynamics in mode-locked lasers and many other physical systems. To overcome difficulties related to huge amount of necessary computations and low efficiency of traditional numerical methods in modeling the evolution of non-stationary solitons, we propose a two-parallel bidirectional long short-term memory recurrent neural network, with the main objective to predict dynamics of vector-soliton pulsations in various complex states, whose real-time dynamics is verified by experiments. Besides, the scheme of coded information storage based on the TP-Bi_LSTM RNN, instead of actual pulse signals, is realized too. The findings offer new applications of deep learning to ultrafast optics and information storage.</description>
