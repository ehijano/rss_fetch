      <title>Random vortex dynamics and Monte-Carlo simulations for wall-bounded viscous flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Functional integral representations for solutions of the motion equations for wall-bounded incompressible viscous flows, expressed (implicitly) in terms of distributions of solutions to stochastic differential equations of McKean-Vlasov type, are established by using a perturbation technique. These representations are used to obtain exact random vortex dynamics for wall-bounded viscous flows. Numerical schemes therefore are proposed and the convergence of the numerical schemes for random vortex dynamics with an additional force term is established. Several numerical experiments are carried out for demonstrating the motion of a viscous flow within a thin layer next to the fluid boundary.</description>

      <title>Sparse additive function decompositions facing basis transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-dimensional real-world systems can often be well characterized by a small number of simultaneous low-complexity interactions. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) decomposition and the anchored decomposition are typical techniques to find sparse additive decompositions of functions. In this paper, we are interested in a setting, where these decompositions are not directly spare, but become so after an appropriate basis transform. Noting that the sparsity of those additive function decompositions is equivalent to the fact that most of its mixed partial derivatives vanish, we can exploit a connection to the underlying function graphs to determine an orthogonal transform that realizes the appropriate basis change. This is done in three steps: we apply singular value decomposition to minimize the number of vertices of the function graph, and joint block diagonalization techniques of families of matrices followed by sparse minimization based on relaxations of the zero ''norm'' for minimizing the number of edges. For the latter one, we propose and analyze minimization techniques over the manifold of special orthogonal matrices. Various numerical examples illustrate the reliability of our approach for functions having, after a basis transform, a sparse additive decomposition into summands with at most two variables.</description>

      <title>Positivity-preserving and energy-dissipating discontinuous Galerkin methods for nonlinear nonlocal Fokker-Planck equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with structure-preserving numerical approximations for a class of nonlinear nonlocal Fokker-Planck equations, which admit a gradient flow structure and find application in diverse contexts. The solutions, representing density distributions, must be non-negative and satisfy a specific energy dissipation law. We design an arbitrary high-order discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method tailored for these model problems. Both semi-discrete and fully discrete schemes are shown to admit the energy dissipation law for non-negative numerical solutions. To ensure the preservation of positivity in cell averages at all time steps, we introduce a local flux correction applied to the DDG diffusive flux. Subsequently, a hybrid algorithm is presented, utilizing a positivity-preserving limiter, to generate positive and energy-dissipating solutions. Numerical examples are provided to showcase the high resolution of the numerical solutions and the verified properties of the DG schemes.</description>

      <title>Conservative Surrogate Models for Optimization with the Active Subspace Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are interested in building low-dimensional surrogate models to reduce optimization costs, while having theoretical guarantees that the optimum will satisfy the constraints of the full-size model, by making conservative approximations. The surrogate model is constructed using a Gaussian process regression (GPR). To ensure conservativeness, two new approaches are proposed: the first one using bootstrapping, and the second one using concentration inequalities. Those two techniques are based on a stochastic argument and thus will only enforce conservativeness up to a user-defined probability threshold. The method has applications in the context of optimization using the active subspace method for dimensionality reduction of the objective function and the constraints, addressing recorded issues about constraint violations. The resulting algorithms are tested on a toy optimization problem in thermal design.</description>

      <title>Divergence conforming DG method for the optimal control of the Oseen equation with variable viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces the divergence-conforming discontinuous Galerkin finite element method (DGFEM) for numerically approximating optimal control problems with distributed constraints, specifically those governed by stationary generalized Oseen equations. We provide optimal a priori error estimates in energy norms for such problems using the divergence-conforming DGFEM approach. Moreover, we thoroughly analyze $L^2$ error estimates for scenarios dominated by diffusion and convection. Additionally, we establish the new reliable and efficient a posteriori error estimators for the optimal control of the Oseen equation with variable viscosity. Theoretical findings are validated through numerical experiments conducted in both two and three dimensions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the uniform convergence of the geometric multigrid V-cycle for hybrid high-order (HHO) and other discontinuous skeletal methods. Our results generalize previously established results for HDG methods, and our multigrid method uses standard smoothers and local solvers that are bounded, convergent, and consistent. We use a weak version of elliptic regularity in our proofs. Numerical experiments confirm our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Performance evaluation of accelerated complex multiple-precision LU decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The direct method is one of the most important algorithms for solving linear systems of equations, with LU decomposition comprising a significant portion of its computation time. This study explores strategies to accelerate complex LU decomposition using multiple-precision floating-point arithmetic of the multiple-component type. Specifically, we explore the potential efficiency gains using a combination of SIMDization and the 3M method for complex matrix multiplication. Our benchmark tests compare this approach with the direct method implementation in MPLAPACK, focusing on computation time and numerical errors.</description>

      <title>On properties of a semi-explicit in time fourth-order vector compact scheme for the multidimensional acoustic wave equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We deal with an initial-boundary value problem for the multidimensional acoustic wave equation, with the variable speed of sound. For a three-level semi-explicit in time higher-order vector compact scheme, we prove stability and derive 4th order error bound in the enlarged energy norm. This scheme is three-point in each spatial direction, and it exploits additional sought functions which approximate 2nd order non-mixed spatial derivatives of the solution to the equation. At the first time level, a similar two-level in time scheme is applied, with no derivatives of the data. No iterations are required to implement the scheme. We also present results of various 3D numerical experiments that demonstrate a very high accuracy of the scheme for smooth data, its advantages in the error behavior over the classical explicit 2nd order scheme for nonsmooth data as well and an example of the wave in a layered medium initiated by the Ricker-type wavelet source function.</description>

      <title>Convergence analysis of OT-Flow for sample generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep generative models aim to learn the underlying distribution of data and generate new ones. Despite the diversity of generative models and their high-quality generation performance in practice, most of them lack rigorous theoretical convergence proofs. In this work, we aim to establish some convergence results for OT-Flow, one of the deep generative models. First, by reformulating the framework of OT-Flow model, we establish the $\Gamma$-convergence of the formulation of OT-flow to the corresponding optimal transport (OT) problem as the regularization term parameter $\alpha$ goes to infinity. Second, since the loss function will be approximated by Monte Carlo method in training, we established the convergence between the discrete loss function and the continuous one when the sample number $N$ goes to infinity as well. Meanwhile, the approximation capability of the neural network provides an upper bound for the discrete loss function of the minimizers. The proofs in both aspects provide convincing assurances for OT-Flow.</description>

      <title>Instantaneous control strategies for magnetically confined fusion plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The principle behind magnetic fusion is to confine high temperature plasma inside a device in such a way that the nuclei of deuterium and tritium joining together can release energy. The high temperatures generated needs the plasma to be isolated from the wall of the device to avoid damages and the scope of external magnetic fields is to achieve this goal. In this paper, to face this challenge from a numerical perspective, we propose an instantaneous control mathematical approach to steer a plasma into a given spatial region. From the modeling point of view, we focus on the Vlasov equation in a bounded domain with self induced electric field and an external strong magnetic field. The main feature of the control strategy employed is that it provides a feedback on the equation of motion based on an instantaneous prediction of the discretized system. This permits to directly embed the minimization of a given cost functional into the particle interactions of the corresponding Vlasov model. The numerical results demonstrate the validity of our control approach and the capability of an external magnetic field, even if in a simplified setting, to lead the plasma far from the boundaries.</description>

      <title>Algorithms of constrained uniform approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the problem of the best uniform approximation of a continuous function on a convex domain. The approximation is by linear combinations of a finite system of functions (not necessarily Chebyshev) under arbitrary linear constraints. By modifying the concept of alternance and of the Remez iterative procedure we present a method, which demonstrates its efficiency in numerical problems. The linear rate of convergence is proved under some favourable assumptions. A special attention is paid to systems of complex exponents, Gaussian functions, lacunar algebraic and trigonometric polynomials. Applications to signal processing, linear ODE, switching dynamical systems, and to Markov-Bernstein type inequalities are considered.</description>

      <title>On solution of tropical discrete best approximation problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a discrete best approximation problem formulated in the framework of tropical algebra, which deals with the theory and applications of algebraic systems with idempotent operations. Given a set of samples of input and output of an unknown function, the problem is to construct a generalized tropical Puiseux polynomial that best approximates the function in the sense of a tropical distance function. The construction of an approximate polynomial involves the evaluation of both unknown coefficient and exponent of each monomial in the polynomial. To solve the approximation problem, we first reduce the problem to an equation in unknown vector of coefficients, which is given by a matrix with entries parameterized by unknown exponents. We derive a best approximate solution of the equation, which yields both vector of coefficients and approximation error parameterized by the exponents. Optimal values of exponents are found by minimization of the approximation error, which is reduced to a minimization of a function of exponents over all partitions of a finite set. We solve this minimization problem in terms of max-plus algebra (where addition is defined as maximum and multiplication as arithmetic addition) by using a computational procedure based on the agglomerative clustering technique. This solution is extended to the minimization problem of finding optimal exponents in the polynomial in terms of max-algebra (where addition is defined as maximum). The results obtained are applied to develop new solutions for conventional problems of discrete best approximation of real functions by piecewise linear functions and piecewise Puiseux polynomials. We discuss computational complexity of the proposed solution and estimate upper bounds on the computational time. We demonstrate examples of approximation problems solved in terms of max-plus and max-algebra, and give graphical illustrations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the past decades, a remarkable amount of research has been carried out regarding fast solvers for large linear systems resulting from various discretizations of fractional differential equations (FDEs). In the current work, we focus on multigrid methods for a Riesz-space FDE whose theoretical convergence analysis of such multigrids is currently limited to the two-grid method. Here we provide a detailed theoretical convergence study in the case of V-cycle and W-cycle. Moreover, we discuss its use combined with a band approximation and we compare the result with both $\tau$ and circulant preconditionings. The numerical tests include 2D problems as well as the extension to the case of a Riesz-FDE with variable coefficients. Finally, we apply the best-performing method to an image deblurring problem with Tikhonov regularization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a type of tensor neural network based machine learning method to solve elliptic multiscale problems. Based on the special structure, we can do the direct and highly accurate high dimensional integrations for the tensor neural network functions without Monte Carlo process. Here, with the help of homogenization techniques, the multiscale problem is first transformed to the high dimensional limit problem with reasonable accuracy. Then, based on the tensor neural network, we design a type of machine learning method to solve the derived high dimensional limit problem. The proposed method in this paper brings a new way to design numerical methods for computing more general multiscale problems with high accuracy. Several numerical examples are also provided to validate the accuracy of the proposed numerical methods.</description>

      <title>A Mixed Multiscale Spectral Generalized Finite Element Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a multiscale mixed finite element method for solving second order elliptic equations with general $L^{\infty}$-coefficients arising from flow in highly heterogeneous porous media. Our approach is based on a multiscale spectral generalized finite element method (MS-GFEM) and exploits the superior local mass conservation properties of mixed finite elements. Following the MS-GFEM framework, optimal local approximation spaces are built for the velocity field by solving local eigenvalue problems over generalized harmonic spaces. The resulting global velocity space is then enriched suitably to ensure inf-sup stability. We develop the mixed MS-GFEM for both continuous and discrete formulations, with Raviart-Thomas based mixed finite elements underlying the discrete method. Exponential convergence with respect to local degrees of freedom is proven at both the continuous and discrete levels. Numerical results are presented to support the theory and to validate the proposed method.</description>

      <title>The cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with rough potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with a spatially rough potential, a key equation in the mathematical setup for nonlinear Anderson localization. Our study comprises two main parts: new optimal results on the well-posedness analysis on the PDE level, and subsequently a new efficient numerical method, its convergence analysis and simulations that illustrate our analytical results. In the analysis part, our results focus on understanding how the regularity of the solution is influenced by the regularity of the potential, where we provide quantitative and explicit characterizations. Ill-posedness results are also established to demonstrate the sharpness of the obtained regularity characterizations and to indicate the minimum regularity required from the potential for the NLS to be solvable. Building upon the obtained regularity results, we design an appropriate numerical discretization for the model and establish its convergence with an optimal error bound. The numerical experiments in the end not only verify the theoretical regularity results, but also confirm the established convergence rate of the proposed scheme. Additionally, a comparison with other existing schemes is conducted to demonstrate the better accuracy of our new scheme in the case of a rough potential.</description>

      <title>Approximating maps into manifolds with lower curvature bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many interesting functions arising in applications map into Riemannian manifolds. We present an algorithm, using the manifold exponential and logarithm, for approximating such functions. Our approach extends approximation techniques for functions into linear spaces so that we can upper bound the forward error in terms of a lower bound on the manifold's sectional curvature. Furthermore, when the sectional curvature of a manifold is nonnegative, such as for compact Lie groups, the error is guaranteed to not be worse than in the linear case. We implement the algorithm in a Julia package and apply it to two example problems from Krylov subspaces and dynamic low-rank approximation, respectively. For these examples, the maps are confirmed to be well approximated by our algorithm.</description>

      <title>Diffraction Tomography for a Generalized Incident Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffraction tomography is an inverse scattering technique used to reconstruct the spatial distribution of the material properties of a weakly scattering object. The object is exposed to radiation, typically light or ultrasound, and the scattered waves induced from different incident field angles are recorded. In conventional diffraction tomography, the incident wave is assumed to be a monochromatic plane wave, an unrealistic simplification in practical imaging scenarios. In this article, we extend conventional diffraction tomography by introducing the concept of customized illumination scenarios, with a pronounced emphasis on imaging with focused beams. We present a new forward model that incorporates a generalized incident field and extends the classical Fourier diffraction theorem to the use of this incident field. This yields a new two-step reconstruction process which we comprehensively evaluate through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>A low-order locking-free multiscale finite element method for isotropic elasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multiscale hybrid-mixed (MHM) method consists of a multi-level strategy to approximate the solution of boundary value problems with heterogeneous coefficients. In this context, we propose a family of low-order finite elements for the linear elasticity problem which are free from Poisson locking. The finite elements rely on face degrees of freedom associated with multiscale bases obtained from local Neumann problems with piecewise polynomial interpolations on faces. We establish sufficient refinement levels on the fine-scale mesh such that the MHM method is well-posed, optimally convergent under local regularity conditions, and locking-free. Two-dimensional numerical tests assess theoretical results.</description>

Abstract: Square matrices of the form $\widetilde{\mathbf{A}} =\mathbf{A} + \mathbf{e}D \mathbf{f}^\mathsf{T}$ are considered. An explicit expression for the inverse is given, provided $\widetilde{\mathbf{A}}$ and $D$ are invertible with $\text{rank}(\widetilde{\mathbf{A}}) =\text{rank}(\mathbf{A})+\text{rank}(\mathbf{e}D \mathbf{f}^\mathsf{T})$. The inverse is presented in two alternative ways, one that uses singular value decomposition and another that depends directly on the components $\mathbf{A}$, $\mathbf{e}$, $\mathbf{f}$ and $D$. As a consequence of the derivations follows a rank-deficient matrix determinant lemma.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the unique continuation problem for the Schr\"odinger equations. We prove a H\"older type conditional stability estimate and build up a parameterized stabilized finite element scheme adaptive to the \textit{a priori} knowledge of the solution, achieving error estimates in interior domains with convergence up to continuous stability. The approximability of the scheme to solutions with only $H^1$-regularity is studied and the convergence rate for solutions with regularity higher than $H^1$ is also shown. Comparisons in terms of different parameterization for different regularities will be illustrated with respect to the convergence and condition numbers of the linear systems. Finally, numerical experiments will be given to illustrate the theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimator for numerical integration for functions that do not need to be square integrable w.r.t. the invariant distribution. For chains with a spectral gap we show that the absolute mean error for $L^p$ functions, with $p \in (1,2)$, decreases like $n^{1/p -1}$, which is known to be the optimal rate. This improves currently known results where an additional parameter $\delta&gt;0$ appears and the convergence is of order $n^{(1+\delta)/p-1}$.</description>

      <title>High-order transient multidimensional simulation of a thermo-electro-chemo-mechanical model for Lithium-ion batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We build a transient multidimensional multiphysical model based on continuum theories, involving the coupled mechanical, thermal and electrochemical phenomena occurring simultaneously in the discharge or charge of lithium-ion batteries. The process delivers a system of coupled nonlinear partial differential equations. Besides initial and boundary conditions, we highlight the treatment of the electrode-electrolyte interface condition, which corresponds to a Butler-Volmer reaction kinetics equation. We present the derivation of the strong and weak forms of the model, as well as the discretization procedure in space and in time. The discretized model is computationally solved in two dimensions by means of a finite element method that employs $hp$ layered meshes, along with staggered second order semi-implicit time integration. The expected error estimate is of higher order than any other similar work, both in space and in time. A representative battery cell geometry, under distinct operating scenarios, is simulated. The numerical results show that the full model allows for important additional insights to be drawn than when caring only for the electrochemical coupling. Considering the multiphysics becomes more important as the applied current is increased, whether for discharge or for charge. Our full model provides battery design professionals with a valuable tool to optimize designs and advance the energy storage industry.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Active Discretizations for Accelerating Temporal Uncertainty Management of Gas Pipeline Loads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a predictor-corrector adaptive method for the simulation of hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) on networks under general uncertainty in parameters, initial conditions, or boundary conditions. The approach is based on the stochastic finite volume (SFV) framework that circumvents sampling schemes or simulation ensembles while also preserving fundamental properties, in particular hyperbolicity of the resulting systems and conservation of the discrete solutions. The initial boundary value problem (IBVP) on a set of network-connected one-dimensional domains that represent a pipeline is represented using active discretization of the physical and stochastic spaces, and we evaluate the propagation of uncertainty through network nodes by solving a junction Riemann problem. The adaptivity of our method in refining discretization based on error metrics enables computationally tractable evaluation of intertemporal uncertainty in order to support decisions about timing and quantity of pipeline operations to maximize delivery under transient and uncertain conditions. We illustrate our computational method using simulations for a representative network.</description>

      <title>Unconditionally positivity-preserving approximations of the Ait-Sahalia type model Explicit Milstein-type schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present article aims to design and analyze efficient first-order strong schemes for a generalized A\"{i}t-Sahalia type model arising in mathematical finance and evolving in a positive domain $(0, \infty)$, which possesses a diffusion term with superlinear growth and a highly nonlinear drift that blows up at the origin. Such a complicated structure of the model unavoidably causes essential difficulties in the construction and convergence analysis of time discretizations. By incorporating implicitness in the term $\alpha_{-1} x^{-1}$ and a corrective mapping $\Phi_h$ in the recursion, we develop a novel class of explicit and unconditionally positivity-preserving (i.e., for any step-size $h&gt;0$) Milstein-type schemes for the underlying model. In both non-critical and general critical cases, we introduce a novel approach to analyze mean-square error bounds of the novel schemes, without relying on a priori high-order moment bounds of the numerical approximations. The expected order-one mean-square convergence is attained for the proposed scheme. The above theoretical guarantee can be used to justify the optimal complexity of the Multilevel Monte Carlo method. Numerical experiments are finally provided to verify the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Complex-Valued Signal Recovery using the Bayesian LASSO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recovering complex-valued image recovery from noisy indirect data is important in applications such as ultrasound imaging and synthetic aperture radar. While there are many effective algorithms to recover point estimates of the magnitude, fewer are designed to recover the phase. Quantifying uncertainty in the estimate can also provide valuable information for real-time decision making. This investigation therefore proposes a new Bayesian inference method that recovers point estimates while also quantifying the uncertainty for complex-valued signals or images given noisy and indirect observation data. Our method is motivated by the Bayesian LASSO approach for real-valued sparse signals, and here we demonstrate that the Bayesian LASSO can be effectively adapted to recover complex-valued images whose magnitude is sparse in some (e.g.~the gradient) domain. Numerical examples demonstrate our algorithm's robustness to noise as well as its computational efficiency.</description>

Abstract: Enceladus is the Saturnian satellite known to have water vapor erupting from its south pole region called Tiger Stripes. Data collected by Cassini Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph during Enceladus transiting Saturn allow us to estimate water plume absorption from 1115.35 - 1912.50 Angstrom and compare it to the Mie solutions of Maxwell equations for particles with a diameter in the range from 10 nm up to 2 um. The best fit performed using Gradient Descent method indicates a presence of submicrometer particles of diameters: 120-180 nm and 240-320 nm consistent with Thermofilum sp., Thermoproteus sp., and Pyrobaculum sp. cell sizes present in hydrothermal vents on Earth.</description>

      <title>Systematic construction of continuous-time neural networks for linear dynamical systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discovering a suitable neural network architecture for modeling complex dynamical systems poses a formidable challenge, often involving extensive trial and error and navigation through a high-dimensional hyper-parameter space. In this paper, we discuss a systematic approach to constructing neural architectures for modeling a subclass of dynamical systems, namely, Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) systems. We use a variant of continuous-time neural networks in which the output of each neuron evolves continuously as a solution of a first-order or second-order Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE). Instead of deriving the network architecture and parameters from data, we propose a gradient-free algorithm to compute sparse architecture and network parameters directly from the given LTI system, leveraging its properties. We bring forth a novel neural architecture paradigm featuring horizontal hidden layers and provide insights into why employing conventional neural architectures with vertical hidden layers may not be favorable. We also provide an upper bound on the numerical errors of our neural networks. Finally, we demonstrate the high accuracy of our constructed networks on three numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Augmented Lagrangian method for coupled-cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose to improve the convergence properties of the single-reference coupled cluster (CC) method through an augmented Lagrangian formalism. The conventional CC method changes a linear high-dimensional eigenvalue problem with exponential size into a problem of determining the roots of a nonlinear system of equations that has a manageable size. However, current numerical procedures for solving this system of equations to get the lowest eigenvalue suffer from two practical issues: First, solving the CC equations may not converge, and second, when converging, they may converge to other -- potentially unphysical -- states, which are stationary points of the CC energy expression. We show that both issues can be dealt with when a suitably defined energy is minimized in addition to solving the original CC equations. We further propose an augmented Lagrangian method for coupled cluster (alm-CC) to solve the resulting constrained optimization problem. We numerically investigate the proposed augmented Lagrangian formulation showing that the convergence towards the ground state is significantly more stable and that the optimization procedure is less susceptible to local minima. Furthermore, the computational cost of alm-CC is comparable to the conventional CC method.</description>

      <title>Linearised Calder\'on problem: Reconstruction of unbounded perturbations in 3D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently an algorithm was given in [Garde &amp; Hyv\"onen, SIAM J. Math. Anal., 2024] for exact direct reconstruction of any $L^2$ perturbation from linearised data in the two-dimensional linearised Calder\'on problem. It was a simple forward substitution method based on a 2D Zernike basis. We now consider the three-dimensional linearised Calder\'on problem in a ball, and use a 3D Zernike basis to obtain a method for exact direct reconstruction of any $L^3$ perturbation from linearised data. The method is likewise a forward substitution, hence making it very efficient to numerically implement. Moreover, the 3D method only makes use of a relatively small subset of boundary measurements for exact reconstruction, compared to a full $L^2$ basis of current densities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we study the stability of the origin for the multivariate geometric Brownian motion. More precisely, under suitable sufficient conditions, we construct a Lyapunov function such that the origin of the multivariate geometric Brownian motion is globally asymptotically stable in probability. Moreover, we show that such conditions can be rewritten as a Bilinear Matrix Inequality (BMI) feasibility problem. We stress that no commutativity relations between the drift matrix and the noise dispersion matrices are assumed and therefore the so-called Magnus representation of the solution of the multivariate geometric Brownian motion is complicated. In addition, we exemplify our method in numerous specific models from the literature such as random linear oscillators, satellite dynamics, inertia systems, diagonal noise systems, cancer self-remission and smoking.</description>

Abstract: A framework for numerical evaluation of entropy-conservative volume fluxes in gas flows with internal energies is developed, for use with high-order discretization methods. The novelty of the approach lies in the ability to use arbitrary expressions for the internal degrees of freedom of the constituent gas species. The developed approach is implemented in an open-source discontinuous Galerkin code for solving hyperbolic equations. Numerical simulations are carried out for several model 2-D flows and the results are compared to those obtained with the finite volume-based solver DLR TAU.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we study consensus-based optimization (CBO), which is a multi-agent metaheuristic derivative-free optimization method that can globally minimize nonconvex nonsmooth functions and is amenable to theoretical analysis. Based on an experimentally supported intuition that, on average, CBO performs a gradient descent of the squared Euclidean distance to the global minimizer, we devise a novel technique for proving the convergence to the global minimizer in mean-field law for a rich class of objective functions. The result unveils internal mechanisms of CBO that are responsible for the success of the method. In particular, we prove that CBO performs a convexification of a large class of optimization problems as the number of optimizing agents goes to infinity. Furthermore, we improve prior analyses by requiring mild assumptions about the initialization of the method and by covering objectives that are merely locally Lipschitz continuous. As a core component of this analysis, we establish a quantitative nonasymptotic Laplace principle, which may be of independent interest. From the result of CBO convergence in mean-field law, it becomes apparent that the hardness of any global optimization problem is necessarily encoded in the rate of the mean-field approximation, for which we provide a novel probabilistic quantitative estimate. The combination of these results allows to obtain probabilistic global convergence guarantees of the numerical CBO method.</description>

      <title>Legendre Expansions of Products of Functions with Applications to Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2110.01372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given the Fourier-Legendre expansions of $f$ and $g$, and mild conditions on $f$ and $g$, we derive the Fourier-Legendre expansion of their product in terms of their corresponding Fourier-Legendre coefficients. In this way, expansions of whole number powers of $f$ may be obtained. We establish upper bounds on rates of convergence. We then employ these expansions to solve semi-analytically a class of nonlinear PDEs with a polynomial nonlinearity of degree 2. The obtained numerical results illustrate the efficiency and performance accuracy of this Fourier-Legendre based solution methodology for solving an important class of nonlinear PDEs.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Anisotropic Consensus-Based Optimization in Mean-Field Law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.08136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.08136v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study anisotropic consensus-based optimization (CBO), a multi-agent metaheuristic derivative-free optimization method capable of globally minimizing nonconvex and nonsmooth functions in high dimensions. CBO is based on stochastic swarm intelligence, and inspired by consensus dynamics and opinion formation. Compared to other metaheuristic algorithms like particle swarm optimization, CBO is of a simpler nature and therefore more amenable to theoretical analysis. By adapting a recently established proof technique, we show that anisotropic CBO converges globally with a dimension-independent rate for a rich class of objective functions under minimal assumptions on the initialization of the method. Moreover, the proof technique reveals that CBO performs a convexification of the optimization problem as the number of agents goes to infinity, thus providing an insight into the internal CBO mechanisms responsible for the success of the method. To motivate anisotropic CBO from a practical perspective, we further test the method on a complicated high-dimensional benchmark problem, which is well understood in the machine learning literature.</description>

      <title>A neuron-wise subspace correction method for the finite neuron method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.12031v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm called Neuron-wise Parallel Subspace Correction Method (NPSC) for the finite neuron method that approximates numerical solutions of partial differential equations (PDEs) using neural network functions. Despite extremely extensive research activities in applying neural networks for numerical PDEs, there is still a serious lack of effective training algorithms that can achieve adequate accuracy, even for one-dimensional problems. Based on recent results on the spectral properties of linear layers and landscape analysis for single neuron problems, we develop a special type of subspace correction method that optimizes the linear layer and each neuron in the nonlinear layer separately. An optimal preconditioner that resolves the ill-conditioning of the linear layer is presented for one-dimensional problems, so that the linear layer is trained in a uniform number of iterations with respect to the number of neurons. In each single neuron problem, a good local minimum that avoids flat energy regions is found by a superlinearly convergent algorithm. Numerical experiments on function approximation problems and PDEs demonstrate better performance of the proposed method than other gradient-based methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.10648v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Gray-Scott model is a set of reaction-diffusion equations that describes chemical systems far from equilibrium. Interest in this model stems from its ability to generate spatio-temporal structures, including pulses, spots, stripes, and self-replicating patterns. We consider an extension of this model in which the spread of the different chemicals is assumed to be nonlocal, and can thus be represented by an integral operator. In particular, we focus on the case of strictly positive, symmetric, $L^1$ convolution kernels that have a finite second moment. Modeling the equations on a finite interval, we prove the existence of small-time weak solutions in the case of nonlocal Dirichlet and Neumann boundary constraints. We then use this result to develop a finite element numerical scheme that helps us explore the effects of nonlocal diffusion on the formation of pulse solutions.</description>

      <title>On discrete ground states of rotating Bose-Einstein condensates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.00402v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ground states of Bose-Einstein condensates in a rotating frame can be described as constrained minimizers of the Gross-Pitaevskii energy functional with an angular momentum term. In this paper we consider the corresponding discrete minimization problem in Lagrange finite element spaces of arbitrary polynomial order and we investigate the approximation properties of discrete ground states. In particular, we prove a priori error estimates of optimal order in the $L^2$- and $H^1$-norm, as well as for the ground state energy and the corresponding chemical potential. A central issue in the analysis of the problem is the missing uniqueness of ground states, which is mainly caused by the invariance of the energy functional under complex phase shifts. Our error analysis is therefore based on an Euler-Lagrange functional that we restrict to certain tangent spaces in which we have local uniqueness of ground states. This gives rise to an error decomposition that is ultimately used to derive the desired a priori error estimates. We also present numerical experiments to illustrate various aspects of the problem structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.00822v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a full space-time numerical solution of the advection-diffusion equation using a continuous Galerkin finite element method. The Galerkin/least-square method is employed to ensure stability of the discrete variational problem. In the full space-time formulation, time is considered another dimension, and the time derivative is interpreted as an additional advection term of the field variable. We derive a priori error estimates and illustrate spatio-temporal convergence with several numerical examples. We also derive a posteriori error estimates, which coupled with adaptive space-time mesh refinement provide efficient and accurate solutions. The accuracy of the space-time solutions is illustrated against analytical solutions as well as against numerical solutions using a conventional time-marching algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17350v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a mixed finite element method for the spatial approximation of a time-fractional Fokker--Planck equation in a convex polyhedral domain, where the given driving force is a function of space. Taking into account the limited smoothing properties of the model, and considering an appropriate splitting of the errors, we employed a sequence of clever energy arguments to show optimal convergence rates with respect to both approximation properties and regularity results. In particular, error bounds for both primary and secondary variables are derived in $L^2$-norm for cases with smooth and nonsmooth initial data. We further investigate a fully implicit time-stepping scheme based on a convolution quadrature in time generated by the backward Euler method. Our main result provides pointwise-in-time optimal $L^2$-error estimates for the primary variable. Numerical examples are then presented to illustrate the theoretical contributions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05654v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural integral equations are deep learning models based on the theory of integral equations, where the model consists of an integral operator and the corresponding equation (of the second kind) which is learned through an optimization procedure. This approach allows to leverage the nonlocal properties of integral operators in machine learning, but it is computationally expensive. In this article, we introduce a framework for neural integral equations based on spectral methods that allows us to learn an operator in the spectral domain, resulting in a cheaper computational cost, as well as in high interpolation accuracy. We study the properties of our methods and show various theoretical guarantees regarding the approximation capabilities of the model, and convergence to solutions of the numerical methods. We provide numerical experiments to demonstrate the practical effectiveness of the resulting model.</description>

      <title>Explicit stabilized multirate methods for the monodomain model in cardiac electrophysiology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fully explicit stabilized multirate (mRKC) methods are well-suited for the numerical solution of large multiscale systems of stiff ordinary differential equations thanks to their improved stability properties. To demonstrate their efficiency for the numerical solution of stiff, multiscale, nonlinear parabolic PDE's, we apply mRKC methods to the monodomain equation from cardiac electrophysiology. In doing so, we propose an improved version, specifically tailored to the monodomain model, which leads to the explicit exponential multirate stabilized (emRKC) method. Several numerical experiments are conducted to evaluate the efficiency of both mRKC and emRKC, while taking into account different finite element meshes (structured and unstructured) and realistic ionic models. The new emRKC method typically outperforms a standard implicit-explicit baseline method for cardiac electrophysiology. Code profiling and strong scalability results further demonstrate that emRKC is faster and inherently parallel without sacrificing accuracy.</description>

      <title>Unconditionally positivity-preserving explicit Euler-type schemes for a generalized Ait-Sahalia model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02596v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present work is devoted to strong approximations of a generalized A\"{i}t-Sahalia model arising from mathematical finance. The numerical study of the considered model faces essential difficulties caused by a drift that blows up at the origin, highly nonlinear drift and diffusion coefficients and positivity-preserving requirement. In this paper, a novel explicit Euler-type scheme is proposed, which is easily implementable and able to preserve positivity of the original model unconditionally, i.e., for any time step-size $h &gt;0$. A mean-square convergence rate of order $0.5$ is also obtained for the proposed scheme in both non-critical and general critical cases. Our work is motivated by the need to justify the multi-level Monte Carlo (MLMC) simulations for the underlying model, where the rate of mean-square convergence is required and the preservation of positivity is desirable particularly for large discretization time steps. Numerical experiments are finally provided to confirm the theoretical findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04946v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a second-order accurate time-stepping scheme for solving a time-fractional diffusion equation with a Caputo derivative of order~$\alpha \in (0,1)$. The basic idea of our scheme is based on local integration followed by linear interpolation. It reduces to the standard Crank--Nicolson scheme in the classical diffusion case, that is, as $\alpha\to 1$. Using a novel approach, we show that the proposed scheme is $\alpha$-robust and second-order accurate in the $L^2(L^2)$-norm, assuming a suitable time-graded mesh. For completeness, we use the Galerkin finite element method for the spatial discretization and discuss the error analysis under reasonable regularity assumptions on the given data. Some numerical results are presented at the end.</description>

Abstract: We propose a novel way to describe numerical methods for ordinary differential equations via the notion of multi-indice. The main idea is to replace rooted trees in Butcher's B-series by multi-indices. The latter were introduced recently in the context of describing solutions of singular stochastic partial differential equations. The combinatorial shift away from rooted trees allows for a compressed description of numerical schemes. Moreover, these multi-indices B-series characterise uniquely the Taylor development of local and affine equivariant maps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.09284v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe a family of iterative algorithms that involve the repeated execution of discrete and inverse discrete Fourier transforms. One interesting member of this family is motivated by the discrete Fourier transform uncertainty principle and involves the application of a sparsification operation to both the real domain and frequency domain data with convergence obtained when real domain sparsity hits a stable pattern. This sparsification variant has practical utility for signal denoising, in particular the recovery of a periodic spike signal in the presence of Gaussian noise. General convergence properties and denoising performance relative to existing methods are demonstrated using simulation studies. An R package implementing this technique and related resources can be found at https://hrfrost.host.dartmouth.edu/IterativeFT.</description>

      <title>Samplet basis pursuit: Multiresolution scattered data approximation with sparsity constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.10180v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider scattered data approximation in samplet coordinates with $\ell_1$-regularization. The application of an $\ell_1$-regularization term enforces sparsity of the coefficients with respect to the samplet basis. Samplets are wavelet-type signed measures, which are tailored to scattered data. They provide similar properties as wavelets in terms of localization, multiresolution analysis, and data compression. By using the Riesz isometry, we embed samplets into reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and discuss the properties of the resulting functions. We argue that the class of signals that are sparse with respect to the embedded samplet basis is considerably larger than the class of signals that are sparse with respect to the basis of kernel translates. Vice versa, every signal that is a linear combination of only a few kernel translates is sparse in samplet coordinates. Therefore, samplets enable the use of well-established multiresolution techniques on general scattered data sets.
  We propose the rapid solution of the problem under consideration by combining soft-shrinkage with the semi-smooth Newton method. Leveraging on the sparse representation of kernel matrices in samplet coordinates, this approach converges faster than the fast iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm and is feasible for large-scale data. Numerical benchmarks are presented and demonstrate the superiority of the multiresolution approach over the single-scale approach. As large-scale applications, the surface reconstruction from scattered data and the reconstruction of scattered temperature data using a dictionary of multiple kernels are considered.</description>
