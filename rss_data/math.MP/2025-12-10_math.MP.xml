      <title>Some Difference Relations for Orthogonal Polynomials of a Continuous Variable in the Askey Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orthogonal polynomials of a continuous variable in the Askey scheme satisfying second order difference equations, such as the Askey-Wilson polynomial, can be studied by the quantum mechanical formulation, idQM (discrete quantum mechanics with pure imaginary shifts). These idQM systems have the shape invariance property, which relates the Hilbert space $\mathsf{H}_{\lambda}$ ($\lambda$ : a set of parameters) and that with shifted parameters $\mathsf{H}_{\lambda+\delta}$ ($\delta$ : shift of $\lambda$), and gives the forward and backward shift relations for the orthogonal polynomials. Based on the forward shift relation and the Christoffel's theorem with some polynomial $\check{\Phi}(x)$, which is expressed in terms of the quantities appeared in the forward and backward shift relations, we obtain some difference relations for the orthogonal polynomials. The multiplication of $\sqrt{\check{\Phi}(x)}$ gives a surjective map from $\mathsf{H}_{\lambda+2\delta}$ to $\mathsf{H}_{\lambda}$. Similarly, for the orthogonal polynomials in the Askey scheme satisfying second order differential equations, such as the Jacobi polynomial, we obtain some differential relations, and the multiplication of $\sqrt{\check{\Phi}(x)}$ in this case gives a surjective map from $\mathsf{H}_{\lambda+\delta}$ to $\mathsf{H}_{\lambda}$.</description>

      <title>Limit absorption and Green function estimates for matrix-valued periodic operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The boundary value of the resolvent of a generic periodic tight-binding Hamiltonian with matrix symbols is shown to satisfy a limit absorption principle which is continuous in energy in dimensions $d=3$, and in dimension $d=2$ away from critical points of the energy bands corresponding to van Hove singularities. The analysis away from critical points of the energy bands is based on the coarea formula, while at the critical points it involves a parametric Morse lemma and stationary phase arguments. In particular, at Weyl points a new type of oscillatory integrals is dealt with.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping Noncommutative Geometry with Dirac Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper surveys a bootstrap framework for random Dirac operators arising from finite spectral triples in noncommutative geometry. Motivated by a toy model for quantum gravity to replace integration over metrics by integration over Dirac operators, we give an overview of multitrace and multimatrix random matrix models built from spectral triples and analyze them in the large $N$ limit using positivity constraints on Hankel moment matrices. In this setting, the bootstrap philosophy, originating in the S-matrix program and revived in modern conformal bootstrap theory, reappears as a rigorous analytic tool for extracting spectral data from consistency alone, without solving the model explicitly.
  We explain how Schwinger-Dyson equations, factorization at large $N$, and the noncommutative moment problem lead to finite-dimensional semidefinite programs whose feasible regions encode the allowed pairs of coupling constants and moments. Connections with spectral geometry, in particular the study of Laplace eigenvalues, are also discussed, illustrating how bootstrapping provides a unified mechanism for deriving bounds in both commutative and noncommutative settings.</description>

      <title>Character Formulas for Kirillov-Reshetikhin Modules via Folding of Supercharacters of $\mathfrak{gl}(M|N)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive decomposition formulas for supercharacters of quantum affine ortho-symplectic superalgebras and twisted quantum affine superalgebras into supercharacters of their finite-type quantum sub-superalgebras, by employing Cauchy-type identities for supersymmetric Schur functions. These formulas are obtained via a folding (reduction) procedure applied to the supercharacters of the finite-dimensional general linear Lie superalgebra $\mathfrak{gl}(M|N)$. As a special case, our results provide explicit character formulas for a class of Kirillov--Reshetikhin modules of quantum affine algebras (and their Yangian counterparts), thereby proving a previously proposed conjecture derived from Bethe ansatz analysis (arXiv:2309.16660).</description>

      <title>Dubrovin duality for open Hurwitz flat F-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the Dubrovin dual of a Hurwitz Frobenius manifold extends naturally to an F-manifold with compatible flat connection on the universal curve, in the sense of the open WDVV equations. A similar result is proven for the Frobenius manifold itself in arXiv:2503.09258 . This equips the universal curve with two F-manifolds with compatible flat structure, and we study their duality. We show that they combine into a bi-flat F-manifold. Conditions on open WDVV solutions imposed in previous work are retrieved in this setting, thus providing them with a geometrical meaning. Finally, explicit examples are computed. For Saito Frobenius manifolds of types $A$ and $D$, the extended prepotentials coincide with open WDVV solutions computed independently, whereas even the existence of the solution in type $E$ had not been previously discussed. On the other hand, new non-homogeneous solutions are constructed by duality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently De les Coves, Drescher and Netzer showed that an analogue of the Birkhoff--von Neumann theorem fails in the quantum setting. Motivated by this and questions arising in the study of quantum automorphisms of graphs, we introduce a graph-based variant of quantum magic squares and show that the analogue already fails for the cycle \(C_4\), via an explicit counterexample. We also show that they admit monic linear matrix inequality descriptions, hence form compact free spectrahedra.</description>

      <title>Bianchi Cosmologies in a Thurston-Based Theory of Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The strong interplay between Bianchi--Kantowski--Sachs (BKS) spacetimes and Thurston geometries motivates the exploration of the role of topology in our understanding of gravity. As such, we study non-tilted BKS solutions of a theory of gravity that explicitly depends on Thurston geometries. We show that shear-free solutions with perfect fluid, as well as static vacuum solutions, exist for all topologies. Moreover, we prove that, aside from non-rotationally-symmetric Bianchi II models, all BKS metrics isotropize in the presence of a positive cosmological constant, and that recollapse is never possible when the weak energy condition is satisfied. This contrasts with General Relativity (GR), where these two properties fail for Bianchi IX and KS metrics. No additional parameters compared to GR are required for these results. We discuss, in particular, how this framework might allow for simple inflationary models in any topology.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-Based Quantum Codes Beyond the Pauli Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Typical stabilizer codes aim to solve the general problem of fault-tolerance without regard for the structure of a specific system. By incorporating a broader representation-theoretic perspective, we provide a generalized framework that allows the code designer to take this structure into account. For any representation of a finite group, we produce a quantum code with a code space invariant under the group action, providing passive error mitigation against errors belonging to the image of the representation. Furthermore, errors outside this scope are detected and diagnosed by performing a projective measurement onto the isotypic components corresponding to irreducible representations of the chosen group, effectively generalizing syndrome extraction to symmetry-resolved quantum measurements. We show that all stabilizer codes are a special case of this construction, including qudit stabilizer codes, and show that there is a natural one logical qubit code associated to the dihedral group. Thus we provide a unifying framework for existing codes while simultaneously facilitating symmetry-aware codes tailored to specific systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum algorithms for viscosity solutions to nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi equations based on an entropy penalisation method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a framework for efficient extraction of the viscosity solutions of nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi equations with convex Hamiltonians. These viscosity solutions play a central role in areas such as front propagation, mean-field games, optimal control, machine learning, and a direct application to the forced Burgers' equation. Our method is based on an entropy penalisation method proposed by Gomes and Valdinoci, which generalises the Cole-Hopf transform from quadratic to general convex Hamiltonians, allowing a reformulation of viscous Hamilton-Jacobi dynamics by a discrete-time linear dynamics which approximates a linear heat-like parabolic equation, and can also extend to continuous-time dynamics. This makes the method suitable for quantum simulation. The validity of these results hold for arbitrary nonlinearity that correspond to convex Hamiltonians, and for arbitrarily long times, thus obviating a chief obstacle in most quantum algorithms for nonlinear partial differential equations. We provide quantum algorithms, both analog and digital, for extracting pointwise values, gradients, minima, and function evaluations at the minimiser of the viscosity solution, without requiring nonlinear updates or full state reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Classical and quantum dynamics of a particle confined in a paraboloidal cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a classical and quantum analysis of a particle confined in a three-dimensional paraboloidal cavity formed by two confocal paraboloids. Classically, the system is integrable and presents three independent constants of motion, namely, the energy, the $z$-component of the angular momentum, and a third dynamical constant associated with the paraboloidal geometry, which can be derived from the separability of the Hamilton--Jacobi equation. We derive closed-form analytical expressions for the actions, which allow us to determine the two conditions to get periodic closed trajectories. We classify these trajectories through the indices $(s,t,\ell)$. The caustic paraboloids that bound the motion provide a complete geometric characterization of admissible trajectories. Quantum mechanically, separability of the Schr\"odinger equation in parabolic coordinates yields eigenmodes described by Whittaker functions. We determine the energy spectrum and identify degeneracies arising not only from azimuthal symmetry but also from specific cavity deformations. A direct correspondence between classical trajectories and quantum eigenstates reveals that probability densities concentrate in the classically allowed region with controlled penetration into forbidden zones.</description>

      <title>Analytical Study for Primordial Non-Gaussianity in the gravity 4D Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An inflationary model can be constrained by non-gaussian statistics as a parameter in the LSS (Large Scale Structure) distribution, and in the radiation of CMB (Cosmic Microwave Background) fluctuating temperature. Data on the CMB from Planck Collaboration provide up-to-date constraints on the parameters controlling the degree of non-Gaussianity in certain inflationary models, thus supporting or not supporting the model. Setting the non-Gaussianity parameter investigated in this study can be a reference whether or not it is a good parameter in constraining cosmological inflation models. This study attempts to examine the non-Gaussianity of the 3+1-dimensional 4DEGB gravitational cosmological inflation model starting from random field statistics. The non-Gaussian signature generated by the model is quantified, and the parameters controlling the degree of non-Gaussianity are constrained using data observation of Planck Collaboration. The method used in investigating non-Gaussianity is the in-in formalism, applied after obtaining the 3-point of $\zeta$ (curvature perturbation) terms of the perturbation expansion to the third order. The 3-point correlation function helps to create a bispectrum used to investigate the non-gaussinity of the inflation model. The results of this study show that the model tested is the slow roll pressed in the squeezed limit, because it witnesses a dominant local shape function. It has such as the non-gaussianity possessed by the single scalar field inflation as confirmation that Gauss-Bonnet term within Einstein-Hilbert action is topologically invariant, and no influence gravitational field equations in $D&lt;5$ spacetimes.</description>

      <title>A tentative proposal towards an equivariant mirror symmetry for Hitchin systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by Aganagic's equivariant mirror symmetry for certain Coulomb branches of a $3d$ $\mathcal{N}= 4$ gauge quiver theory, we would like to propose a set of ideas towards an extension of Aganagic's proposal to Hitchin systems. At the end, there are two main points in our proposal; namely, that the equivariant mirror of the Hitchin systems should be a Landau-Ginzburg model (with twisted masses) and that the dichotomy between additive and multiplicative varieties in the context of mirror symmetry for Nakajima quiver varieties should be considered in the case of Hitchin systems.</description>

      <title>Haagerup Symmetry in $(E_8)_1$?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We suggest that the chiral $(\mathfrak{e}_8)_1$ theory -- in many senses the simplest VOA -- may have Haagerup symmetry $\mathcal{H}_i$ for $i=1,2,3$. Likewise, we suggest that the non-chiral $(E_8)_1$ WZW model may have $\mathcal{H}_i \times \mathcal{H}_i^\textrm{op}$ symmetry, and that gauging the diagonal symmetry gives a $c=8$ theory with $\mathcal{Z}(\mathcal{H}_3)$ symmetry, which is the theory predicted in \cite{Evans:2010yr}. Along the way, we show that $(E_8)_1$ also has a $\mathrm{Fib} \times \mathrm{Fib}^\text{op}$ symmetry, and that gauging the diagonal symmetry gives the $(G_2)_1 \times (F_4)_1$ WZW model, explaining the well-known conformal embedding $(G_2)_1 \times (F_4)_1 \subset (E_8)_1$. Finally, we suggest a relation to theories with $\mathcal{H}_3$ symmetry at $c=2,6$, complimenting the discussion with new modular bootstrap results.</description>

      <title>Photon Phase-Space Dynamics in a Plasma Wakefield Accelerator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Frequency up-shifting of laser light in a beam-driven plasma wakefield has the potential to provide high-intensity sources of short wavelength radiation. Simulations have demonstrated that a laser pulse can undergo large frequency shifts, limited only by the drive beam energy, when the plasma density is tailored to match the accelerating phase of the wake to the group velocity of the pulse. Here, we study the dynamical evolution of photons in the phase-space vicinity of the plasma wake- phase matching condition. Numerical calculations using a photon kinetic model are validated by direct comparison with full electromagnetic particle-in-cell simulations. These calculations form the basis of a linear theory of the photon dynamics which reveals several important results, including scalings for the properties of the witness pulse and a self-similar solution for the photon phase-space dynamics. One prediction of the theory is that the pulse can be compressed indefinitely with no lower bound on the duration. This predication suggests that photon acceleration can provide a novel source of sub-femtosecond, short wavelength radiation.</description>

      <title>Many interacting particles in solution. I. Screening-ranged expansions of electrostatic potential and energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an analytical many-body formalism for systems of spherical particles carrying arbitrary free charge distributions and interacting in a polarizable electrolyte solution, that we model within the linearized Poisson--Boltzmann framework. Building on the detailed spectral analysis of the associated nonstandard Neumann--Poincar\'e-type operators developed in our companion study~\cite{supplem_pre_math}, we construct exact explicit expansions of the electrostatic potential and energy in ascending orders of Debye screening thereby obtaining systematic "screening-ranged" series for potentials and energies. These screening-ranged expansions provide a unified and tractable description of many-body electrostatics. We demonstrate the versatility of the approach by showing how it generalizes and improves upon both classical and modern methods, enabling rigorous treatment of heterogeneously charged systems (such as Janus particles) and accurate modeling of higher-order phenomena (such as asymmetric dielectric screening, opposite-charge repulsion, like-charge attraction) as well as yielding many-body generalizations to analytical explicit results previously known only in the two-body setting.</description>

      <title>Decomposable semigroups on C*-algebras and D-divisible dynamical maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze semigroups of decomposable maps on C*-algebras in context of the algebraic structure of associated infinitesimal generators. Case of von Neumann algebras, including $B(\mathcal{H})$ for $\mathcal{H}$ a Hilbert space, is also addressed. We then elaborate on D-divisible (decomposably divisible) dynamical maps on the Banach space of trace class operators. Our analysis extends earlier results on decomposable dynamical maps on matrix algebras (J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 56 485202) and provides a partial generalization of the seminal work of Lindblad (Commun. Math. Phys. 48 119-130) on completely positive semigroups.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric cavity magnomechanics with gain-assisted transparency and amplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate magnomechanically induced transparency in a parity-time-symmetric cavity magnomechanical system with traveling-field-induced non-Hermiticity. The setup consists of a microwave cavity mode coupled to magnons in a single-crystal yttrium iron garnet sphere, which in turn are hybridized with a vibrational mechanical mode through magnetostrictive interaction. In the Hermitian regime, strong photon-magnon coupling generates a single transparency window in the cavity transmission, which splits into a doublet when the magnon is coherently hybridized with the mechanical mode via magnomechanical coupling. This establishes a versatile platform in which the transparency spectrum can be engineered from single- to multi-window response using experimentally accessible, scaled magnomechanical interactions. When a non-Hermitian coupling is introduced, the system enters a parity-time-broken regime in which the transparency ceases to be purely passive and becomes gain assisted, leading to asymmetric transmission with amplification on one side of the resonance and enhanced absorption on the other. By tuning the cavity detuning, we convert magnomechanical transparency into Fano-type line shapes with strongly non-Lorentzian phase dispersion and map their deformation into asymmetric, gain-assisted Fano ridges in the joint space of probe and magnon detunings. Finally, we analyze the associated group delay and show that both slow- and fast-light behavior can be widely tuned by varying the photon-magnon and magnomechanical couplings together with the non-Hermitian strength, highlighting parity-time-symmetric cavity magnomechanics as a promising platform for reconfigurable quantum signal processing and enhanced sensing.</description>

      <title>Many interacting particles in solution. II. Screening-ranged expansion of electrostatic forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a fully analytical integration of the Maxwell stress tensor and derive exact relations for interparticle forces in systems of multiple dielectric spheres immersed in a polarizable ionic solvent, within the framework of the linearized Poisson--Boltzmann theory. Building upon the screening-ranged (in ascending orders of Debye screening) expansions of the potentials developed and rigorously analyzed in the accompanying works \cite{supplem_pre,supplem_pre_math,supplem_prl}, we construct exact screening-ranged many-body expansions for electrostatic forces in explicit analytical form. These results establish a rigorous foundation for evaluating screened electrostatic interactions in complex particle systems and provide direct analytical connections to, and systematic improvements upon, various earlier approximate or limited-case formulations available in the literature, both at zero and finite ionic strength.</description>

      <title>Many interacting particles in solution. III. Spectral analysis of the associated Neumann--Poincar\'e-type operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interaction of particles in an electrolytic medium can be calculated by solving the Poisson equation inside the solutes and the linearized Poisson--Boltzmann equation in the solvent, with suitable boundary conditions at the interfaces. Analytical approaches often expand the potentials in spherical harmonics, relating interior and exterior coefficients and eliminating some coefficients in favor of others, but a rigorous spectral analysis of the corresponding formulations is still lacking. Here, we introduce composite many-body Neumann--Poincar\'e-type operators and prove that they are compact with spectral radii strictly less than one. These results provide the foundation for systematic screening-ranged expansions, in powers of the Debye screening parameters, of electrostatic potentials, interaction energies, and forces, and establish the analytical framework for the accompanying works~\cite{supplem_prl,supplem_pre,supplem_pre_force}.</description>

      <title>Calibration of a DEM contact model for wet industrial granular materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents and calibrates a Discrete Element Method (DEM) contact model for wet granular materials in the pendular regime. The model extends a previously calibrated dry contact formulation by incorporating liquid bridges that generate capillary adhesion between particles, while liquid migration is represented through evolving bridge volumes. Two reactor-grade polypropylene powders with different particle size distributions, bulk densities, and surface morphologies are investigated, resulting in distinct wetting behavior. A schematic framework is introduced to relate increasing liquid content to the transition from dry to wet contacts using two key parameters: the minimum liquid film volume and the maximum liquid bridge volume. These parameters are calibrated using dynamic angle of repose measurements from rotating drum experiments. The calibrated model reproduces the experimental flow behavior of both powders: full agreement is obtained for the coarser, more porous powder across all liquid contents, while for the finer, denser powder, agreement is achieved at low to moderate liquid contents. At higher liquid contents, discrepancies arise due to agglomeration effects amplified by particle scaling. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the dynamic angle of repose as a calibration target and highlight the limitations of particle scaling for strongly cohesive wet granular systems. The proposed framework provides a practical basis for DEM-based modeling of wet powder flow in industrial processes.</description>

      <title>Vacuum Energy and Topological Mass in Interacting Elko and Scalar Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a four-dimensional system composed of a mass-dimension-one fermionic field, also known as Elko, interacting with a real scalar field. Our main objective is to analyze the Casimir effects associated with this system, assuming that both the Elko and scalar fields satisfy Dirichlet boundary conditions on two large parallel plates separated by a distance $L$. In this scenario, we calculate the vacuum energy density and its first-order correction in the coupling constants of the theory. Additionally, we consider the mass correction for each field separately, namely the topological mass that arises from the boundary conditions imposed on the fields and which also depends on the coupling constants. To develop this analysis, we use the mathematical formalism known as the effective potential, expressed as a path integral in quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Brachistochrone-ruled timelike surfaces in Newtonian and relativistic spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study \emph{brachistochrone-ruled timelike surfaces} in Newtonian and relativistic spacetimes. Starting from the classical cycloidal brachistochrone in a constant gravitational field, we construct a Newtonian ``brachistochrone-ruled worldsheet'' whose rulings are time-minimizing trajectories between pairs of endpoints. We then generalize this construction to stationary Lorentzian spacetimes by exploiting the reduction of arrival-time functionals to Finsler- or Jacobi-type length functionals on a spatial manifold. In this framework, relativistic brachistochrones arise as geodesics of an associated Finsler structure, and brachistochrone-ruled timelike surfaces are timelike surfaces ruled by these time-minimizing worldlines. We work out explicit examples in Minkowski spacetime and in the Schwarzschild exterior: in the flat case, for a bounded-speed time functional, the brachistochrones are straight timelike lines and a simple family of brachistochrone-ruled surfaces turns out to be totally geodesic; in the Schwarzschild case, we show how coordinate-time minimization at fixed energy reduces to geodesics of a Jacobi metric on the spatial slice, and outline a numerical scheme for constructing brachistochrone-ruled timelike surfaces. Finally, we discuss basic geometric properties of such surfaces and identify natural Jacobi fields along the rulings.</description>

      <title>Three views on the thinned Bernoulli field on the line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the thinned Bernoulli field (TBF) on the one-dimensional integer lattice, where isolated occupied sites are removed from a standard Bernoulli configuration with density $p$. Our present work complements previous findings in higher dimensions and on trees by focusing on the detailed behavior on the line, particularly as $p$ approaches $1.$ First we show that while the TBF on the line is always quasilocally Gibbs, it displays a growing sensitivity to boundary conditions as $p$ increases, indicating an incipient loss of quasilocality. We provide precise asymptotics for this phenomenon, which is an echo of non-quasilocality happening in higher dimensions. Second, we turn to the one-sided point of view and prove that the TBF is a g-measure in the sense of dynamical systems and ergodic theory. The corresponding g-function is quasilocal but becomes long-range again for large $p$. From that we finally develop our third view, in which we provide a transparent construction of the process in terms of a driving Markov chain on the integers of generalized house of cards type, offering a novel perspective on the TBF.</description>

      <title>Axial Symmetric Navier Stokes Equations and the Beltrami /anti Beltrami spectrum in view of Physics Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, I further continue an investigation on Beltrami Flows began in 2015 with A. Sorin and amply reprised and developed in 2022 with M. Trigiante. Instead of a compact $3$-torus $T^3=\mathbb{R}^3/\Lambda$ where $\Lambda$ is a crystallographic lattice, as done in previous work, here I considered flows confined in a cylinder with identified opposite bases. In this topology I considered axial symmetric flows and found a complete basis of axial symmetric harmonic $1$-forms that, for each energy level, decomposes into six components: two Beltrami, two anti-Beltrami and two closed forms. These objects, that are written in terms of trigonometric and Bessel functions, constitute a function basis for an $L^2$ space of axial symmetric flows. I have presented a general scheme for the search of axial symmetric solutions of Navier Stokes equation by reducing the latter to an hierachy of quadratic relations on the development coefficients of the flow in the above described functional basis. It is proposed that the coefficients can be determined by means of a Physics Informed like Neural Network optimization recursive algorithm. Indeed the present paper provides the theoretical foundations for such a algorithmic construction that is planned for a future publication.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the unitary Drinfeld center of a unitary tensor category is equivalente to the category of unitary bimodules for the canonical W*-algebra object, generalizing M\"uger's result to the non-fusion case. This is then used to express factorization homology in terms of C*-algebraic extensions of symmetric enveloping algebras and actions of Drinfeld dobules of compact quantum groups.</description>

      <title>The Maxwell equations on full sub-extremal and extremal Kerr spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Cauchy problem for the Maxwell equations in the exterior region of Kerr black hole spacetimes. The equations are formulated for components of the Maxwell field relative to the algebraically special frame of Kerr, with the unknowns treated as tensorial quantities associated with a non-integrable horizontal distribution. The extremal Maxwell components decouple into Teukolsky equations, whereas the middle Maxwell components form a coupled system of transport and elliptic equations. Assuming control over the extremal components, we prove uniform boundedness (without loss of derivatives) and decay estimates for the middle components in the full |a|&lt;=M range of spacetime parameters. Our analysis relies on (i) deriving a decoupled system of transport and elliptic equations for two modified middle Maxwell components and (ii) decomposing general solutions into a dynamical and stationary part, the latter determined by two real (electric and magnetic) charges which are entirely read off from the initial data at the event horizon.
  In the sub-extremal |a|&lt;M case, works of Shlapentokh-Rothman and the second author provide the necessary control over the extremal components, yielding unconditional boundedness and decay results for all the unknowns in the equations.
  In the extremal |a|=M case, we formulate a conjectural boundedness and decay statement for the extremal components, motivated by work of Casals, Gralla and Zimmerman on fixed azimuthal mode solutions compactly supported away from the event horizon. Our boundedness and decay results for all the unknowns in the equations remain, therefore, conditional. We show that the complicated dynamics of the extremal components at the event horizon is inherited by the middle components; in particular, we uncover novel conservation laws for the middle components of axisymmetric solutions.</description>

Abstract: As a contribution to the field of quantum mereology, we study how a change of tensor product structure in a finite-dimensional Hilbert space affects its entanglement properties. In particular, we ask whether, given a time-evolving state, there exists a tensor product structure in which no entanglement is generated. We give a concrete, constructive example of disentangling tensor product structure in the case of a C-NOT gate evolution between two qbits, before showing that this cannot be achieved for most time-evolving quantum states.</description>

      <title>Dynamics generated by spatially growing derivations on quasi-local algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02941v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove global existence and uniqueness of dynamics on the quasi-local algebra $\mathcal{A}$ of a quantum lattice system for spatially growing derivations $\mathcal{L}_\Phi = \sum_x [ \Phi_x , \cdot ]$. Existing results assume that the local terms $\Phi_x\in\mathcal{A}$ of the generator are uniformly bounded in space with respect to appropriate weighted norms $\lVert \Phi_x \rVert_{G,x}$. Analogous to the global existence result for first order ODEs, we show that global existence and uniqueness persist if the size of the local terms $\lVert \Phi_x \rVert_{G,x}$ grows at most linearly in space. This considerably enlarges the class of derivations known to have well-defined dynamics. Moreover, we obtain Lieb-Robinson bounds with exponential light cones for such dynamics.
  For the proof, we assume Lieb-Robinson bounds with linear light cones for dynamics, whose generators have uniformly bounded local terms. Such bounds are known to hold, for example, if the local terms are of finite range or exponentially localized.</description>

      <title>Correlation length in random MPS and PEPS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.11682</link>
      <description>arXiv:1906.11682v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tensor network states are used extensively as a mathematically convenient description of physically relevant states of many-body quantum systems. Those built on regular lattices, i.e. matrix product states (MPS) in dimension 1 and projected entangled pair states (PEPS) in dimension 2 or higher, are of particular interest in condensed matter physics. The general goal of this work is to characterize which features of MPS and PEPS are generic and which are, on the contrary, exceptional. This problem can be rephrased as follows: given an MPS or PEPS sampled at random, what are the features that it displays with either high or low probability? One property which we are particularly interested in is that of having either rapidly decaying or long-range correlations. In a nutshell, our main result is that translation-invariant MPS and PEPS typically exhibit exponential decay of correlations at a high rate. We have two distinct ways of getting to this conclusion, depending on the dimensional regime under consideration. Both yield intermediate results which are of independent interest, namely: the parent Hamiltonian and the transfer operator of such MPS and PEPS typically have a large spectral gap. In all these statements, our aim is to get a quantitative estimate of the considered quantity (generic correlation length or spectral gap), which has the best possible dependency on the physical and bond dimensions of the random MPS or PEPS.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Hodge Theorem: curl and asymmetric pseudodifferential projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02015v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a new approach to the study of spectral asymmetry. Working with the operator $\operatorname{curl}:=*\mathrm{d}$ on a connected oriented closed Riemannian 3-manifold, we construct, by means of microlocal analysis, the asymmetry operator -- a scalar pseudodifferential operator of order $-3$. The latter is completely determined by the Riemannian manifold and its orientation, and encodes information about spectral asymmetry. The asymmetry operator generalises and contains the classical eta invariant traditionally associated with the asymmetry of the spectrum, which can be recovered by computing its regularised operator trace. Remarkably, the whole construction is direct and explicit.</description>

      <title>Geometric approach for the identification of Hamiltonian systems of quasi-Painlev\'e type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19053v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Some new Hamiltonian systems of quasi-Painlev\'e type are presented and the analogue of Okamoto's space of initial conditions computed. Using the geometric approach that was introduced originally for the identification problem of Painlev\'e equations, comparing the irreducible components of the inaccessible divisors arising in the blow-up process, we find bi-rational coordinate changes between some of these systems that give rise to the same global Hamiltonian structure. This scheme thus gives a method for identifying Hamiltonian systems up to bi-rational maps, which is performed in this article for systems of quasi-Painlev\'e type having singularities that are either square-root type algebraic poles or ordinary poles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16597v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a rigorous proof for the existence of a finite-energy, self-similar solution to the focusing cubic Schr\"odinger equation in three spatial dimensions. The proof is computer-assisted and relies on a fixed point argument that shows the existence of a solution in the vicinity of a numerically constructed approximation. The latter is obtained by a standard pseudo-spectral method. The computer-assisted part of the rigorous proof uses nothing but fraction arithmetic in order to obtain quantitative bounds for the fixed point argument.</description>

      <title>Recovering Parameters from Edge Fluctuations: Beta-Ensembles and Critically-Spiked Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14414v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Lambda=\{\Lambda_0,\Lambda_1,\Lambda_2,\ldots\}$ be the point process that describes the edge scaling limit of either (i) "regular" beta-ensembles with inverse temperature $\beta&gt;0$, or (ii) the top eigenvalues of Wishart or Gaussian invariant random matrices perturbed by $r_0\geq1$ critical spikes. In other words, $\Lambda$ is the eigenvalue point process of one of the scalar or multivariate stochastic Airy operators. We prove that a single observation of $\Lambda$ suffices to recover (almost surely) either (i) $\beta$ in the case of beta-ensembles, or (ii) $r_0$ in the case of critically-spiked models. Our proof relies on the recently-developed semigroup theory for the multivariate stochastic Airy operators.
  Going beyond these parameter-recovery applications, our results also (iii) refine our understanding of the rigidity properties of $\Lambda$, and (iv) shed new light on the equality (in distribution) of stochastic Airy spectra with different dimensions and the same Robin boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Lorentzian Gromov-Hausdorff convergence and pre-compactness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10380v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of the paper is to introduce a convergence \`a la Gromov-Hausdorff for Lorentzian spaces, building on $\epsilon$-nets consisting of causal diamonds and relying only on the time separation function. This yields a geometric notion of convergence, which can be applied to synthetic Lorentzian spaces (Lorentzian pre-length spaces) or smooth spacetimes. Among the main results, we prove a Lorentzian counterpart of the celebrated Gromov's pre-compactness theorem for metric spaces, where controlled covers by balls are replaced by controlled covers by diamonds. This yields a geometric pre-compactness result for classes of globally hyperbolic spacetimes, satisfying a uniform doubling property on Cauchy hypersurfaces and a suitable control on the causality, and a curvature-driven pre-compactness result. The final part of the paper establishes several applications: we show that Chru\'sciel-Grant approximations are an instance of the Lorentzian Gromov-Hausdorff convergence here introduced, we prove that timelike sectional curvature bounds are stable under such a convergence, we introduce timelike blow-up tangents and discuss connections with the main conjecture of causal set theory.</description>

      <title>Quantum Glassiness From Efficient Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00087v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show a relation between quantum learning theory and algorithmic hardness. We use the existence of efficient, local learning algorithms for energy estimation -- such as the classical shadows algorithm -- to prove that finding near-ground states of disordered quantum systems exhibiting a certain topological property is impossible in the average case for Lipschitz quantum algorithms. A corollary of our result is that many standard quantum algorithms fail to find near-ground states of these systems, including time-$T$ Lindbladian dynamics from an arbitrary initial state, time-$T$ quantum annealing, phase estimation to $T$ bits of precision, and depth-$T$ variational quantum algorithms, whenever $T$ is less than some universal constant times the logarithm of the system size. To achieve this, we introduce a generalization of the overlap gap property (OGP) for quantum systems that we call the quantum overlap gap property (QOGP). We prove that preparing low-energy states of systems which exhibit the QOGP is intractable for quantum algorithms whose outputs are stable under perturbations of their inputs. We then prove that the QOGP is satisfied for a sparsified variant of the quantum $p$-spin model, giving the first known algorithmic hardness-of-approximation result for quantum algorithms in finding the ground state of a non-stoquastic, noncommuting quantum system. Inversely, we show that the Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev (SYK) model does not exhibit the QOGP, consistent with previous evidence that the model is rapidly mixing at low temperatures.</description>

      <title>$f(R,\mathcal{G})$-cosmological dynamics in the FLRW background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the cosmological dynamics of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity models in a four-dimensional spatially flat FLRW metric. These models are described by $f\left( R,\mathcal{G}\right) =f\left( R+\mu \mathcal{G}\right) $ theory of gravity. They are equivalent to models linear in the Ricci scalar $R$ and in the Gauss-Bonnet scalar $\mathcal{G}$ with one nonminimally coupled scalar field without kinetic term. We analyze the stability of the de Sitter solutions and construct the phase space of the field equations to investigate the cosmological evolution. We show that $f\left( R+\mu \mathcal{G}\right) $-theory provides a double inflationary epoch, this can be used to unify the early-time and late-time acceleration phases of the universe. Moreover, we discuss the initial value problem for theory to be cosmologically viable. Finally, the effects of the cold dark matter in cosmic evolution are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10293v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study classical continuous automorphisms of the torus (cat maps) from the viewpoint of the Koopman theory. We find analytical formulae for Koopman modes defined coherently on the whole of the torus, and their decompositions associated with the partition of the torus into ergodic components. The spectrum of the Koopman operator is studied in four cases of cat maps: cyclic, quasi-cyclic, critical (transition from quasi-cyclic to chaotic behaviour) and chaotic. The synthetic spectrum associated with the ergodic decomposition is also studied.</description>

      <title>Form factors of composite branch-point twist operators in the sinh-Gordon model on a multi-sheeted Riemann surface: semiclassical limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12878v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum sinh-Gordon model in 1+1 dimensions is one of the simplest and best-studied massive integrable relativistic quantum field theories. We consider this theory on a multi-sheeted Riemann surfaces with a flat metric, which can be seen as a pile of planes connected to each other along cut lines. The cut lines end at branch points, which are represented by a twist operator ${\cal T}_n.$ Operators of such kind are interesting in the framework of the problem of computing von Neumann and Renyi entanglement entropies in the original model on the plane. The composite branch-point twist operators (CTO) are a natural generalization of the twist operators, obtained by placing a local operator to a branch point by means of a certain limiting procedure. Correlation function in quantum field theory can be, in principle, found by means of the spectral decomposition. It allows one to express them in terms of form factors of local operators, i.e. their matrix elements in the basis of stationary states. In integrable models complete sets of exact form factors of all operators can be found exactly as solutions of a system of bootstrap equations. Nevertheless, identification of these solution to the operators in terms of the basic fields remains problematic. In this work, we develop a technique of computing form factors of a class of CTO determined in terms of the basic field in the semiclassical approximation.</description>

      <title>Vacuum Energy and Topological Mass from a Constant Magnetic Field and Boundary Conditions in Coupled Scalar Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15121v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the combined effects of a uniform magnetic field and boundary conditions on vacuum energy and topological mass generation in a coupled scalar field theory. The system consists of a real scalar field, subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions, interacting via self- and cross-couplings with a gauge-coupled complex scalar field obeying mixed boundary conditions between two perfectly reflecting parallel plates. The magnetic field induces Landau quantization, leading to novel contributions. Employing zeta-function regularization within the effective potential formalism, we derive the renormalized effective potential up to second order in the coupling constants without imposing a vanishing magnetic field in the renormalization scheme. Our renormalization approach preserves magnetic contributions while properly removing divergences, enabling a consistent treatment of finite-size corrections, magnetic effects, and interaction terms. We compute the vacuum energy per unit area of the plates, analyze the emergence of a topological mass from boundary and magnetic contributions, and evaluate the first-order coupling-constant corrections at two-loop order. Detailed asymptotic analysis are presented for both weak- and strong-field regimes, revealing exponential suppression at high magnetic fields and nontrivial polynomial and logarithmic behavior in the weak-field limit.</description>

      <title>Hypergeometry from $\mathrm{\widehat P}$-Symmetry: Feynman Integrals in One and Two Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16305v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Feynman integrals with generic propagator powers in one and two spacetime dimensions are investigated from various perspectives. In particular, we argue that the class of track integrals at any loop order is fixed by the recently found $\mathrm{\widehat P}$-symmetries of Yangian type. All track integrals up to six external points (and four loops) are bootstrapped explicitly as well as the full family of one-loop integrals at any multiplicity. Moreover, the triangle tracks at generic loop order, which constitute the most generic family of track-type integrals, are bootstrapped in this way. The results are compared to the direct evaluation via a `spectral transform' from the integrability toolbox that turns out to be particularly efficient for position-space tree integrals in lower dimensions. We prove that all $\mathrm{\widehat P}$-symmetries of these integrals can be derived from the framework of Aomoto--Gelfand hypergeometric functions, which applies to integrals in one and two dimensions. Finally, we also demonstrate the method's applicability to conformal integrals by deriving the complete results for all comb-channel conformal partial waves as well as the conformal double-box integral. We explicitly go through all examples of the above integrals in 1D and then provide a straightforward recipe for how to read off their 2D counterparts.</description>

We construct a consistence thermodynamics for the Taub-NUT-like BH and determine its thermodynamic topological class. The Lorentz symmetry breaking affects the mass and temperature of the BH but does not affect its thermodynamic topological classification.</description>

      <title>Encoding the Einstein Equations into an Algebraic Commutator Condition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03048v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the structure of the Lorentz group in four dimensions is such that unimodular (trace-free) gravity can be consistently represented as an algebraic condition on the symmetric product space of 2-forms. This condition states that the commutator between the Riemann tensor and the Hodge dual must be equal to the commutator between the Kulkarni-Nomizu product of the energy-momentum and the metric with the Hodge dual; symbolically, $[\text{Riem}, \star] = 4\pi [T\KN g, \star]$. We show that this condition is equivalent to the trace-free field equations, that the right-hand-side vanishes if and only if the energy-momentum tensor vanishes (recovering the appropriate Einstein spacetime limit) and that this condition can be solved for electrovacuum in the spherically symmetric ansatz to yield Reissner-Nordstr\"om-de Sitter uniquely. This analysis suggests that the conceptual distinction between unimodular gravity and General Relativity is one of emphasis on how irreducible representations of the Riemann tensor are constrained by the existence of energy-momentum and the associated field equations.</description>

      <title>Beyond Hoeffding and Chernoff: Trading conclusiveness for advantages in quantum hypothesis testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07601v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ultimate limits of quantum state discrimination are often thought to be captured by asymptotic bounds that restrict the achievable error probabilities, notably the quantum Chernoff and Hoeffding bounds. Here we study hypothesis testing protocols that are permitted a probability of producing an inconclusive discrimination outcome, and investigate their performance when this probability is suitably constrained. We show that even by allowing an arbitrarily small probability of inconclusiveness, the limits imposed by the quantum Hoeffding and Chernoff bounds can be significantly exceeded. This completely circumvents the conventional trade-offs between error exponents in hypothesis testing while incurring only a vanishingly small overhead over conventional approaches. Such improvements over standard state discrimination are robust and can be obtained even when an exponentially vanishing probability of inconclusive outcomes is demanded. Relaxing the constraints on the inconclusive probability can enable even larger advantages, but this comes at a price. We show a 'strong converse' property of this setting: targeting error exponents beyond those achievable with vanishing inconclusiveness necessarily forces the probability of inconclusive outcomes to converge to one. By exactly quantifying the rate of this convergence, we give a complete characterisation of the trade-offs between error exponents and rates of conclusive outcome probabilities. Overall, our results provide a comprehensive asymptotic picture of how the allowance for inconclusive measurement outcomes reshapes optimal quantum hypothesis testing.</description>

      <title>Exponentially Slow Mixing of the Low Temperature SK Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22621v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a short proof that low-temperature dynamics for the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model have mixing time exponential in the system size, based on the recently proved existence of gapped spin configurations by (Minzer-Sah-Sawhney 2023, Dandi-Gamarnik-Zdeborov\'a 2023). This result is in contrast with a well established physics prediction which posits a stretched exponential mixing time of order $e^{N^{1/3 \pm o(1)}}$. Our proof clarifies that this prediction cannot apply to mixing from worst case initial conditions, but should presumably be understood to concern dynamics from a suitably random initialization.</description>

      <title>The Mean-Field Dynamics of Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01868v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a mathematical framework that interprets Transformer attention as an interacting particle system and studies its continuum (mean-field) limits. By idealizing attention on the sphere, we connect Transformer dynamics to Wasserstein gradient flows, synchronization models (Kuramoto), and mean-shift clustering. Central to our results is a global clustering phenomenon whereby tokens cluster asymptotically after long metastable states where they are arranged into multiple clusters. We further analyze a tractable equiangular reduction to obtain exact clustering rates, show how commonly used normalization schemes alter contraction speeds, and identify a phase transition for long-context attention. The results highlight both the mechanisms that drive representation collapse and the regimes that preserve expressive, multi-cluster structure in deep attention architectures.</description>
