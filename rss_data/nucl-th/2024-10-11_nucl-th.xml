      <title>Isospin composition of fission barriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ a microscopic method to study how isospin affect the fission potential of $^{240}$Pu. Our approach uses constrained Hartree-Fock theory (CHF) which allows us to separately investigate the isoscalar and isovector properties of the nuclear energy density functional (EDF). By analyzing the isoscalar and isovector components of the EDF along the fission path we can assess the isovector contribution to fission barriers. We study this effect for the fully adiabatic path to scission. The isovector component of the fission potential is found to increase in magnitude as the nucleus evolves towards scission, exemplifying the importance of stringent constraints on the isovector sector of the nuclear EDF for reliable predictions of fission properties.</description>

      <title>Re-investigation of neutron capture by 84Kr and 86Kr in the s-process nucleosynthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermonuclear reaction rates and Maxwellian averaged cross sections (MACS) for the 84Kr(n,{\gamma}) 85Kr and 86Kr(n,{\gamma}) 87Kr processes were examined using the statistical model code Talys v1.96. The effects of nuclear level densities (NLDs) on Maxwellian averaged cross sections and neutron capture rates are examined both quantitatively and qualitatively. The present Talys based MACS and radiative capture rates for 84Kr(n,{\gamma}) 85Kr and 86Kr(n,{\gamma}) 87Kr processes agree well with the earlier reported findings. The statistical models nuclear properties (level density and gamma ray strength) were fine tuned to reproduce the existing experimental nuclear data.</description>

      <title>Investigation of Nuclear Structure and $\beta$-decay Properties of As Isotopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nuclear ground state properties of 67 80As nuclei have been investigated within the framework of relativistic mean field (RMF) approach. The RMF model with density dependent (DDME2) interaction is utilized for the calculation of potential energy curves and the nuclear ground state deformation parameters $\beta_2$ of selected As isotopes. Later, the $\beta$ decay properties of As isotopes were studied using the proton neutron quasi particle random phase approximation pnQRPA model. These include Gamow Tellar (GT) strength distributions, log ft values, $\beta$ decay half lives, stellar $\beta$ plus minus decays and stellar electron positron capture rates. The $\beta_2$ values computed from RMF model were employed in the on QRPA model as an input parameter for the calculations of $\beta$-decay properties for 67 80As. The calculated log ft values were in decent agreement with the measured data. The predicted $\beta$-decay half lives matched the experimental values within a factor of 10. The stellar rates were compared with the shell model results. Only at high temperature and density values, the sum of $\beta$ plus and electron capture rates had a finite contribution. On the other hand, the sum of $\beta$ negative and positron capture rates were sizeable only at low density and high temperature values. For all such cases, the pn QRPA rates were found to be bigger than the shell model rates up to a factor of 33 or more. The findings reported in the current investigation could prove valuable for simulating the late stage stellar evolution of massive stars.</description>

      <title>Relativistic spin hydrodynamics revisited with general rotation by entropy-current analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the canonical formulation of spin hydrodynamics for Dirac fermions with a general thermal vorticity. The orders of the general thermal vorticity and the corresponding spin variables are considered independently from those of the conventional hydrodynamic variables and their perturbative gradients. Assuming a totally antisymmetric spin current of Dirac fermions, the entropy-current analysis with a general spin potential indicates that the constitutive relations of the stress-energy tensor have to involve spin variables, particularly those linked to boost symmetry, to adhere to the entropy principle. In the presence of the degree of freedom associated with boost symmetry, we choose the constitutive relations of the canonical formulation to be connected to those of the phenomenological formulation through pseudogauge transformation. Subsequently, a linear-mode analysis is conducted using the resulting spin hydrodynamic equations. It is observed that the spin and hydrodynamic modes in this canonical formulation display different characteristics compared to those in the phenomenological formulation up to the second order of gradient.</description>

      <title>Frozen and $\beta$-equilibrated $f$ and $p$ modes of cold neutron stars: nuclear metamodel predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When the chemical re-equilibration timescale is sufficiently long, the normal and quasi-normal mode frequencies of neutron stars should be calculated in the idealized limit that the internal composition of each fluid element is fixed over the oscillation period. However, many studies rely on a barotropic equation of state, which implicitly overlooks potential out-of-$\beta$-equilibrium effects. To investigate possible biases arising from this assumption, we calculate the non-radial fundamental ($f$) and first pressure ($p_1$) modes for a wide range of neutron star structures, each governed by different nucleonic equations of state. This ensemble is generated using the metamodel technique, a phenomenological framework that incorporates constraints from experimental nuclear physics and chiral effective field theory. The metamodel also provides the internal composition of $\beta$-equilibrated $npe\mu$ matter, allowing us to calculate oscillation modes beyond those supported by a purely barotropic fluid. Thus, we systematically assess the impact of assuming a barotropic equation of state across various equations of state and provide a distribution of expected $f$ and $p_1$ mode frequencies that may be detectable by next-generation gravitational wave interferometers.</description>

      <title>Towards a fluid-dynamic description of an entire heavy-ion collision: from the colliding nuclei to the quark-gluon plasma phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fluid-dynamical modeling of a nuclear collision at high energy usually starts shortly after the collision. A major source of uncertainty comes from the detailed modeling of the initial state. While the collision itself likely involves far-from-equilibrium dynamics, it is not excluded that a fluid theory of second order can reasonably well describe its soft features. Here we explore this possibility and discuss how the state before the collision can be described in that setup, what are the requirements from relativistic causality to the form of the equations of motion, how much entropy production can result from shear and bulk viscous dissipation during the initial longitudinal dynamics, and how one can thus obtain sensible initial conditions for the subsequent transverse expansion. While we do here only first steps, we outline a larger program. If the latter could be successfully completed it could lead to a dynamical description of heavy-ion collisions where the only uncertainty lies in the thermodynamic and transport properties of quantum chromodynamics.</description>

      <title>Toward hybrid quantum simulations with qubits and qumodes on trapped-ion platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the feasibility of hybrid quantum computing using both discrete (qubit) and continuous (qumode) variables on trapped-ion platforms. Trapped-ion systems have demonstrated record one- and two-qubit gate fidelities and long qubit coherence times while qumodes, which can be represented by the collective vibrational modes of the ion chain, have remained relatively unexplored for their use in computing. Using numerical simulations, we show that high-fidelity hybrid gates and measurement operations can be achieved for existing trapped-ion quantum platforms. As an exemplary application, we consider quantum simulations of the Jaynes-Cummings-Hubbard model, which is given by a one-dimensional chain of interacting spin and boson degrees of freedom. Using classical simulations, we study its real-time evolution and we develop a suitable variational quantum algorithm for the ground state preparation. Our results motivate further studies of hybrid quantum computing in this context, which may lead to direct applications in condensed matter and fundamental particle and nuclear physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There exist metastable domain walls of the flavor-singlet meson $\eta$ for the ${\rm U}(1)$ axial symmetry in two-flavor color superconductivity (2SC) in QCD at large baryon density. We show that, due to the coupling of $\eta$ to confined ${\rm SU}(2)$ gluons in the 2SC phase, the effective theory on the domain wall is described by the ${\rm SU}(2)_{-1}$ Chern-Simons theory, which is dual to the ${\rm U}(1)_{2}$ Chern-Simons theory. This theory has a spin-1 droplet excitation that does not carry baryon number, which we identify as a vector meson. We also discuss the effective theories and baryonic droplet excitations on the domain walls of the flavor-singlet mesons in the superfluid phases of QCD at large isospin density and two-color QCD at large baryon density.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Jet Energy Loss in Pb+Pb collisions at LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we give a method to study the energy loss of jets in the medium using a variety of jet energy loss observables such as nuclear modification factor and transverse momentum asymmetry in dijets and $\gamma$-jets in heavy ion collisions. The energy loss of jets in the medium depends mainly on the size and the properties of medium viz. temperature and is a function of energy of the jets as predicted by various models. A Monte Carlo (MC) method is employed to generate the transverse momentum and path-lengths of the initial jets that undergo energy loss. Using different scenarios of energy loss, the transverse momentum and system size dependence of nuclear modification factors and different measures of dijet momentum imbalance at energies $sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV and 5.02 TeV and $\gamma$-jet asymmetry at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ =2.76 TeV in Pb+Pb collisions are simulated. The results are compared with the measurements by ATLAS and CMS experiments as a function of transverse momentum and centrality. The study demonstrates how the system size and energy dependence of jet energy loss can be quantified using various experimental observables.</description>

      <title>Three-point functions from a Schwinger-Keldysh effective action, resummed in derivatives</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The search for the conjectured QCD critical point in heavy-ion collisions requires to account for far-from equilibrium effects as well as fluctuations, and in particular non-Gaussian fluctuations, in the modeling of the dynamics of the hot and dense matter created in such collisions. In order to study far-from equilibrium effects as well as fluctuations, in this work we construct a Schwinger-Keldysh effective field theory (EFT) for the diffusion of the density to all orders in derivatives. The dissipation in the free part of our EFT follows the Boltzmann equation in the relaxation-time approximation (RTA). The interaction part of the EFT is constructed based on the self-interaction of the density field. We analytically find the quadratic and cubic parts of the KMS-invariant EFT in closed form, resummed in derivatives. We then explicitly compute the symmetrized three-point function at tree level, and investigate its analytical structure in detail. We also analytically calculate the branch-point singularity that appears in the structure of the two-point response function due to loop effects. We discuss the applicability of our results to the real-time dynamics of the correlation functions and the possible relation to thermalization when the system is far from equilibrium.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When the quark masses are lighter than those in QCD, the standard lore is that a chiral transition of first order must emerge for three, light flavors. Recently, however, numerical simulations on the lattice suggest that the chiral transition is of second order in the chiral limit. Using an extended linear sigma model in the mean field approximation, we study the relation between terms which break the anomalous, $U(1)_A$ symmetry and the order of the chiral phase transition, especially how a chiral transition of second order can arise for three, massless flavors. We note that in an (unphysical) region of the "Columbia" phase diagram, when the strange quark mass is light and negative, corresponding to topological angle $\theta=\pi$, the $CP$ symmetry is spontaneously broken.</description>

      <title>New quantification of symmetry energy from neutron skin thicknesses of $^{48}$Ca and $^{208}$Pb</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15434v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Precise knowledge of the nuclear symmetry energy can be tentatively calibrated through multimessenger constraints. The neutron skin thickness of a heavy nucleus is one of the most sensitive indicators for probing the isovector components of effective interactions in asymmetric nuclear matter. Recent studies have suggested that the experimental data from the CREX and PREX2 Collaborations are not mutually compatible within existing nuclear models. In this study, we review the quantification of the slope parameter of symmetry energy $L$ from the neutron skin thicknesses of $^{48}$Ca and $^{208}$Pb. Skyrme energy density functionals classified by various isoscalar incompressibility coefficients $K$ are employed to evaluate the bulk properties of finite nuclei. The calculated results suggest that the slope parameter $L$ deduced from $^{208}$Pb is sensitive to the compression modulus of symmetric nuclear matter, but not that from $^{48}$Ca. The effective parameter sets classified by $K=220$ MeV can provide an almost overlaping range of $L$ from $^{48}$Ca and $^{208}$Pb.</description>

Abstract: Interacting quark stars, which are entirely composed of interacting quark matter including perturbative QCD corrections and color superconductivity, can meet constraints from various pulsar observations. In realistic scenarios, pressure anisotropies are expected in the star's interior. Recently, the stellar structural properties of anisotropic interacting quark stars have been investigated. In this study, we further explore the universal relations (URs) related to the moment of inertia $I$, tidal deformability $\Lambda$, compactness $C$, and the $f$-mode nonradial pulsation frequency for such stars. Our results reveal that these approximate URs generally hold, being insensitive to both the EOS variations as well as to the presence of anisotropy. In contrast to previous studies on anisotropic neutron stars, we find that more positive anisotropy tends to enhance the $I-\Lambda$ and $I-C$ URs, but weakens the $C-\Lambda$ UR. For all the URs involving $f$-mode frequency, we find that they are enhanced by the inclusion of anisotropy (whether positive or negative). Utilizing these URs and the tidal deformability constraint from the GW170817 event, we put limits on the structural properties of isotropic and anisotropic quark stars, such as the moment of inertia $I_{1.4}$, the canonical radius $R_{1.4}$ and the canonical $f$-mode frequency $f_{f,1.4}$, all of which are very different compared to those of neutron stars.</description>

Abstract: We present the first experimental method to directly correlate initial participant asymmetry with final-state multiplicity to quantify contribution of preferential emission to the rapidity-odd component of pseudorapidity distribution of produced particles in heavy-ion collisions. Within a transport model simulation, the correlator displays an increase from mid to large rapidities and from central to peripheral collisions. It also displays sensitivity to spectator dynamics, with its magnitude decreasing as more spectators undergo evaporation or fragmentation. The proposed correlator provides a powerful experimental tool to constrain particle production mechanisms and the space-time evolution of spectator matter in heavy-ion collisions</description>

      <title>Diagrammatic ab initio methods for infinite nuclear matter with modern chiral interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A comparative study of the equation of state for pure neutron matter and symmetric nuclear matter is presented using three ab initio methods based on diagrammatic expansions: coupled-cluster theory, self-consistent Green's functions, and many-body perturbation theory. We critically evaluate these methods by employing different chiral potentials at next-to-next-to-leading-order -- all of which include both two- and three-nucleon contributions -- and by exploring various many-body truncations. Our investigation yields highly precise results for pure neutron matter and robust predictions for symmetric nuclear matter, particularly with soft interactions. Moreover, the new calculations demonstrate that the $\rm{ NNLO_{sat} }(450)$ and $\Delta \rm{NNLO_{go}}(394)$ potentials are consistent with the empirical constraints on the saturation point of symmetric nuclear matter. Additionally, this benchmark study reveals that diagrammatic expansions with similar architectures lead to consistent many-body correlations, even when applied across different methods. This consistency underscores the robustness of the diagrammatic approach in capturing the essential physics of nucleonic systems.</description>

      <title>Neutrinos from dense environments : Flavor mechanisms, theoretical approaches, observations, and new directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.11814v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutrino masses and mixings produce vacuum oscillations, an established quantum mechanical phenomenon. In matter, the Mikheev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein effect, due to neutrino interactions with the background particles, triggers resonant flavor modification. In dense environments, such as core-collapse supernovae or compact mergers, sizable neutrino-neutrino interactions, shock waves and turbulence impact the neutrino flavor content under a variety of phenomena. Theoretical approaches of neutrino propagation range from the mean-field approximation to the full quantum kinetic equations. Intriguing connections have been uncovered between weakly interacting dense neutrino gases and other many-body systems and domains, from condensed matter and nuclear physics to quantum computing. Besides the intrinsic theoretical interest, establishing how neutrinos change flavor contributes to answer the longstanding open questions of how massive stars explode and of the r-process sites. It is also important for future observations of core-collapse supernova neutrinos and of the diffuse supernova neutrino background that should be discovered in the foreseeable future.</description>

      <title>Numerical indication that center vortices drive dynamical mass generation in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.18690v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first calculation of the response of the momentum space quark propagator to center vortices in the ground state fields of QCD is presented. Center vortices are identified on 2+1-flavour dynamical gauge fields with $m_\pi \simeq 156$ MeV to obtain the vortex-removed and vortex-only quark propagator. Dynamical mass generation is found to vanish upon vortex removal, while the vortex-only field is able to generate dynamical mass. These new signatures strengthen the lattice QCD evidence indicating that center vortices underpin both dynamical chiral symmetry breaking and quark confinement.</description>

      <title>Finite-volume scattering on the left-hand cut</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18793v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The two-particle finite-volume scattering formalism derived by L\"uscher and generalized in many subsequent works does not hold for energies far enough below the two-particle threshold to reach the nearest left-hand cut. The breakdown of the formalism is signaled by the fact that a real scattering amplitude is predicted in a regime where it should be complex. In this work, we address this limitation by deriving an extended formalism that includes the nearest branch cut, arising from single particle exchange. We focus on two-nucleon ($NN \to NN$) scattering, for which the cut arises from pion exchange, but give expressions for any system with a single channel of identical particles. The new result takes the form of a modified quantization condition that can be used to constrain an intermediate K-matrix in which the cut is removed. In a second step, integral equations, also derived in this work, must be used to convert the K-matrix to the physical scattering amplitude. We also show how the new formalism reduces to the standard approach when the $N \to N \pi$ coupling is set to zero.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04900v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the thermodynamics of the Polyakov-Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model considering the effects of an effective chiral chemical potential. We offer a new parametrization of the Polyakov-loop potential depending on temperature and the chiral chemical potential which, when used together with a proper regularization scheme of vacuum contributions, predicts results consistent with those from lattice simulations.</description>

      <title>QCD Phase Diagram and the Finite Volume Fireball: A Model Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20073v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Experimental investigations of the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter involve collisions of heavy ions at ultrarelativistic velocities. The medium created in such a collision is often of dimensions a few fermi, in particular in the Beam Energy Scan experiments. An understanding of the effect of the finite volume and the boundary is important for connecting the experimental results to the phase diagram.
  Using the Nambu Jona-Lasinio model, an effective theory for the chiral transition of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), we have studied the effect of the finite volume of the fireball on the transition line at finite temperature and density using the MIT boundary condition to mimic the condition that the system is deconfined inside. The shift of the transition temperature for finite volume and finite volume effect on number density and its susceptibilities are studied. The volume effects should be considered when looking for signatures of the phase diagram in experiments.</description>

      <title>Imaging the Wakes of Jets with Energy-Energy-Energy Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the partons in a jet propagate through the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) produced in a heavy-ion collision, they lose energy to, kick, and are kicked by the medium. The resulting modifications to the parton shower encode information about the microscopic nature of QGP. The momentum and energy lost by the parton shower are gained by the medium and, since QGP is a strongly coupled liquid, this means that the jet excites a wake in the droplet of QGP. After freezeout, this wake becomes soft hadrons with net momentum in the jet direction meaning that reconstructed jets include hadrons originating from both the modified parton shower and its wake. This makes it challenging to find an unambiguous experimental view of the response of a droplet of QGP to a jet. Recent years have seen significant advances in the understanding of the substructure of jets using correlation functions of the energy flux operator. So far, such studies have focused primarily on the two-point correlator, which serves to identify the angular scale of the underlying dynamics. Higher-point correlators hold the promise of mapping out the dynamics themselves. We perform the first study of the shape-dependent three-point energy-energy-energy correlator in heavy-ion collisions. Using the Hybrid Model to simulate the interactions of high energy jets with QGP, we show that hadrons originating from wakes are the dominant contribution to the three-point correlator in the regime where the three points are well-separated in angle, forming a roughly equilateral triangle. This equilateral region of the correlator is far from the region populated by collinear vacuum emissions, making it a canvas on which jet wakes can be imaged. Our work is a key step towards the systematic use of energy correlators to image and unravel the dynamical response of a droplet of QGP to a passing jet, and motivates many experimental and theoretical studies.</description>

      <title>Neutral pion polarizabilities from four-point functions in lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13388v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report a proof-of-principle lattice QCD simulation of the electric and magnetic polarizabilities for a neutral pion in the four-point function method. The results are based on the same quenched Wilson ensembles on a $24^3\times 48$ lattice at $\beta=6.0$ with pion mass from 1100 to 370 MeV previously used for a charged pion. For electric polarizability, the results are largely consistent with those from the background field method and ChPT. In contrast, there are significant differences for magnetic polarizability among the four-point function method, the background field method, and ChPT. The situation points to the potentially important role of disconnected diagrams for a neutral pion. We elucidate a transparent quark decomposition in the four-point function method that can be used to shed light on the issue.</description>

      <title>Relaxation time approximation revisited and pole/cut structure in retarded correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05131v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we aim to discuss the following two questions:
  Q1. Mathematical justification of the model of relaxation time approximation (RTA);
  Q2. Pole/cut structure in the retarded correlators within the kinetic description.
  We find that only the RTA with an energy-independent relaxation time can be justified in the case of hard interactions. Accordingly, we propose an alternative approach to restore the collision invariance lacking in traditional RTA. Furthermore, hydrodynamic poles are the long-lived non-analytical structures in this case. Whereas for soft interactions, commonly encountered in relativistic kinetic theory, the gapless eigenspectrum leads to dominant long-lived branch-cuts. When particles are massive or the perturbations are inhomogeneous, the non-analytical structures become more complex and richer.</description>

      <title>Exclusive rare semileptonic decays of $B$ and $B_c$ mesons in the relativistic independent quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06951v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the exclusive rare semileptonic decays: $B(B_c)\to K(D_{(s)})l\bar{l}/\Sigma\nu_l\bar{\nu_l}$ ($l=\mu, \tau$) in the framework of relativistic independent quark (RIQ) model based on an average flavor independent confining potential in equally mixed scalar-vector harmonic form. The invariant weak form factors, parametrising the matrix elements between participating meson states are calculated in the parent meson rest frame. The momentum transfer dependence of the form factors is reliably determined in the whole accessible kinematical range: $q^2_{min}\leq 0\leq q^2_{max}$. Our predicted branching fractions for $B\to K\mu^+\mu^-/\tau^+\tau^-(\Sigma\nu_l\bar{\nu_l})$, $B_c\to D(D_s)\mu^+\mu^-$, $B_c\to D(D_s)\tau^+\tau^-$ and $B_c\to D(D_s)\Sigma\nu_l\bar{\nu_l}$, obtained in order of $10^{-7}(10^{-6})$, $10^{-9}(10^{-7})$, $10^{-9}(10^{-8})$ and $10^{-8}(10^{-7})$, respectively are in reasonable agreement with other Standard Model predictions and Lattice QCD results. The averaged values of the lepton polarization asymmetries for decay modes are obtained as $\langle P_L(B\to K\mu^+\mu^-)\rangle$=-0.97, $\langle P_L(B_c\to D_{(s)}\mu^+\mu^-)\rangle$=-0.972, $\langle P_L(B\to K\tau^+\tau^-)\rangle$=-0.224, $\langle P_L(B_c\to D\tau^+\tau^-)\rangle$=-0.275 and $\langle P_L(B_c\to D_s\tau^+\tau^-)\rangle$=-0.194.</description>
