      <title>A VLBI Software Correlator for Fast Radio Transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One major goal in fast radio burst science is to detect fast radio bursts (FRBs) over a wide field of view without sacrificing the angular resolution required to pinpoint them to their host galaxies. Wide-field detection and localization capabilities have already been demonstrated using connected-element interferometry; the CHIME/FRB Outriggers project will push this further using widefield cylindrical telescopes as widefield outriggers for very long baseline interferometry (VLBI). This paper describes an offline VLBI software correlator written in Python for the CHIME/FRB Outriggers project. It includes features well-suited to modern widefield instruments like multibeaming/multiple phase center correlation, pulse gating including coherent dedispersion, and a novel correlation algorithm based on the quadratic estimator formalism. This algorithm mitigates sensitivity loss which arises in instruments where the windowing and channelization is done outside the VLBI correlator at each station, which accounts for a 30 percent sensitivity drop away from the phase center. Our correlation algorithm recovers this sensitivity on both simulated and real data. As an end to end check of our software, we have written a preliminary pipeline for VLBI calibration and single-pulse localization, which we use in Lanman et al. (2024) to verify the astrometric accuracy of the CHIME/FRB Outriggers array.</description>

      <title>Measuring Fiber Positioning Accuracy and Throughput with Fiber Dithering for the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Highly multiplexed, fiber-fed spectroscopy is enabling surveys of millions of stars and galaxies. The performance of these surveys depends on accurately positioning fibers in the focal plane to capture target light. We describe a technique to measure the positioning accuracy of fibers by dithering fibers slightly around their ideal locations. This approach also enables measurement of the total system throughput and point spread function delivered to the focal plane. We then apply this technique to observations from the Dark Energy Survey Instrument (DESI), and demonstrate that DESI positions fibers to within 0.08" of their targets (5% of a fiber diameter) and achieves a system throughput within about 5% of expectations.</description>

      <title>BRDF-Based Photometric Modeling of LEO Constellation Satellite from Massive Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling the brightness of satellites in large Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) constellations can not only assist the astronomical community in assessing the impact of reflected light from satellites, optimizing observing schedules and guiding data processing, but also motivate satellite operators to improve their satellite designs, thus facilitating cooperation and consensus among different stakeholders. This work presents a photometric model of the Starlink satellites based on the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) using millions of photometric observations. To enhance model accuracy and computational efficiency, data filtering and reduction are employed, and chassis blocking on the solar array and the earthshine effect are taken into account. The assumptions of the model are also validated by showing that the satellite attitude is as expected, the solar array is nearly perpendicular to the chassis, and both the solar array pseudo-specular reflection and the chassis earthshine should be included in the model. Reflectance characteristics of the satellites and the apparent magnitude distributions over station are finally discussed based on the photometric predictions from the model. In addition to assessing the light pollution and guiding the development of response measures, accurate photometric models of satellites can also play an important role in areas such as space situational awareness.</description>

      <title>Precision premium transformation -- a high-precision astrometric solution based on the precision premium curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. In Gaia era, atmospheric turbulence, which causes stochastic wander of a star image, is a fundamental limitation to the astrometric accuracy of ground-based optical imaging. However, the positional bias caused by turbulence (called turbulence error here) can be effectively reduced by measuring a target relative to another reference (a star or a fast-moving target) which locates in the range of only several tens of arcsec, since they suffer from similar turbulence errors. This phenomenon is called the precision premium and has been effectively applied to the astrometry of solar system. Further investigation for the precision premium shows that, the precision premium works at less than about 100 arcsec for two specific objects and the relative positional precision as a function of their angular seperation can be well fitted by a sigmoidal function, called the precision premium curve (PPC). Aims. We want to reduce the turbulence error of a target if it is imaged in an area of high stellar density of a ground-based observation by taking advantage of more Gaia reference stars. Methods. Based on the PPC, we proposed a high-precision astrometric solution called precision premium transformation (PPT) in this paper, which takes advantage of high similarity of turbulence errors in a small region and the dense Gaia reference stars in the region to reduce the turbulence errors on the observation, through a weighted solution. Results. Through systematic analysis, the PPT method exhibits significant advantages in terms of not only precision but also applicability when a target is imaged in an area of high stellar density. The PPT method is also applied to the determination of the proper motion of an open cluster, and the results demonstrate and quantify benefits that the PPT method bestows on ground-based astrometry.</description>

      <title>In-Depth Modeling of Tilt-To-Length Coupling in LISA's Interferometers and TDI Michelson Observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present first-order models for tilt-to-length (TTL) coupling in LISA, both for the individual interferometers as well as in the time-delay interferometry (TDI) Michelson observables. These models include the noise contributions from angular and lateral jitter coupling of the six test masses, six movable optical subassemblies (MOSAs), and three spacecraft. We briefly discuss which terms are considered to be dominant and reduce the TTL model for the second-generation TDI Michelson X observable to these primary noise contributions to estimate the resulting noise level. We show that the expected TTL noise will initially violate the entire mission displacement noise budget, resulting in the known necessity to fit and subtract TTL noise in data post-processing. By comparing the noise levels for different assumptions prior to subtraction, we show why noise mitigation by realignment prior to subtraction is favorable. We then discuss that the TTL coupling in the individual interferometers will have noise contributions that will not be present in the TDI observables. Models for TTL coupling noise in TDI and in the individual interferometers are therefore different, and commonly made assumptions are valid as such only for TDI but not for the individual interferometers. Finally, we analyze what implications can be drawn from the presented models for the subsequent fit-and-subtraction in post-processing. We show that noise contributions from the test mass and inter-satellite interferometers are indistinguishable, such that only the combined coefficients can be fit and used for subtraction. However, a distinction is considered not necessary. Additionally, we show a correlation between coefficients for transmitter and receiver jitter couplings in each individual TDI Michelson observable. This full correlation can be resolved by using all three Michelson observables for fitting the TTL coefficients.</description>

      <title>Search for anti-quark nuggets via their interaction with the LHC beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anti-quark nuggets (AQNs) have been suggested to solve the dark matter (DM) and the missing antimatter problem in the universe and have been proposed as an explanation of various observations. Their size is in the {\mu}m range and their density is about equal to the nuclear density with an expected flux of about $0.4 / km^2 / year$. For the typical velocity of DM constituents ($\sim$250 km/s), the solar system bodies act as highly performing gravitational lenses. Here we assume that DM streams or clusters are impinging, e.g., on the Earth, as it was worked out for DM axions and Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs). Interestingly, in the LHC beam, unforeseen beam losses are triggered by so-called Unidentified Falling Objects (UFOs), which are believed to be constituted of dust particles with a size in the {\mu}m range and a density of several orders of magnitude lower than AQNs. Prezeau suggested that streaming DM constituents incident on the Earth should result in jet-like structures ("hairs") exiting the Earth, or a kind of caustics. Such ideas open novel directions in the search for DM. This work suggests a new analysis of the UFO results at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), assuming that they are eventually, at least partly, due to AQNs. Firstly, a reanalysis of the existing data from the 4000 beam monitors since the beginning of the LHC is proposed, arguing that dust and AQNs should behave differently. The feasibility of this idea has been discussed with CERN accelerator people and potential collaborators.</description>

      <title>Spatially Resolved Observations of Meteor Radio Afterglows with the OVRO-LWA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conducted an all-sky imaging transient search with the Owens Valley Radio Observatory Long Wavelength Array (OVRO-LWA) data collected during the Perseid meteor shower in 2018. The data collection during the meteor shower was motivated to conduct a search for intrinsic radio emission from meteors below 60 MHz known as the meteor radio afterglows (MRAs). The data collected were calibrated and imaged using the core array to obtain lower angular resolution images of the sky. These images were input to a pre-existing LWA transient search pipeline to search for MRAs as well as cosmic radio transients. This search detected 5 MRAs and did not find any cosmic transients. We further conducted peeling of bright sources, near-field correction, visibility differencing and higher angular resolution imaging using the full array for these 5 MRAs. These higher angular resolution images were used to study their plasma emission structures and monitor their evolution as a function of frequency and time. With higher angular resolution imaging, we resolved the radio emission size scales to less than 1 km physical size at 100 km heights. The spectral index mapping of one of the long duration event showed signs of diffusion of plasma within the meteor trails. The unpolarized emission from the resolved radio components suggest resonant transition radiation as the possible radiation mechanism of MRAs.</description>

      <title>ROME/REA: Three-year, Tri-color Timeseries Photometry of the Galactic Bulge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ROME/REA (Robotic Observations of Microlensing Events/Reactive Event Assessment) Survey was a Key Project at Las Cumbres Observatory (hereafter LCO) which continuously monitored 20 selected fields (3.76 sq.deg.) in the Galactic Bulge throughout their seasonal visibility window over a three-year period, between March 2017 and March 2020. Observations were made in three optical passbands (SDSS-g', -r', -i'), and LCO's multi-site telescope network enabled the survey to achieve a typical cadence of $\sim$10\,hrs in i' and ~15 hrs in g' and r'. In addition, intervals of higher cadence (&lt;1 hr) data were obtained during monitoring of key microlensing events within the fields. This paper describes the Difference Image Analysis data reduction pipeline developed to process these data, and the process for combining the photometry from LCO's three observing sites in the Southern Hemisphere. The full timeseries photometry for all 8 million stars, down to a limiting magnitude of i~18 mag is provided in the data release accompanying this paper, and samples of the data are presented for exemplar microlensing events, illustrating how the tri-band data are used to derive constraints on the microlensing source star parameters, a necessary step in determining the physical properties of the lensing object. The timeseries data also enables a wealth of additional science, for example in characterizing long-timescale stellar variability, and a few examples of the data for known variables are presented.</description>

      <title>Towards $21$-cm intensity mapping at $z=2.28$ with uGMRT using the tapered gridded estimator -- IV. Wideband analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a Wideband Tapered Gridded Estimator (TGE), which incorporates baseline migration and variation of the primary beam pattern for neutral hydrogen (${\rm H\hspace{0.5mm}}{\scriptsize {\rm I}}$) 21-cm intensity mapping (IM) with large frequency bandwidth radio-interferometric observations. Here we have analysed $394-494 \, {\rm MHz}$ $(z = 1.9 - 2.6)$ uGMRT data to estimate the Multi-frequency Angular Power Spectrum (MAPS) $C_\ell(\Delta\nu)$ from which we have removed the foregrounds using the polynomial fitting (PF) and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) methods developed in our earlier work. Using the residual $C_\ell(\Delta\nu)$ to estimate the mean squared 21-cm brightness temperature fluctuation $\Delta^2(k)$, we find that this is consistent with $0 \pm 2 \sigma$ in several $k$ bins. The resulting $2\sigma$ upper limit $\Delta^2(k) &lt; (4.68)^2 \, \rm{mK^2}$ at $k=0.219\,\rm{Mpc^{-1}}$ is nearly $15$ times tighter than earlier limits obtained from a smaller bandwidth ($24.4 \, {\rm MHz}$) of the same data. The $2\sigma$ upper limit $[\Omega_{{\rm H\hspace{0.5mm}}{\scriptsize {\rm I}}} b_{{\rm H\hspace{0.5mm}}{\scriptsize {\rm I}}}] &lt; 1.01 \times 10^{-2}$ is within an order of magnitude of the value expected from independent estimates of the ${\rm H\hspace{0.5mm}}{\scriptsize {\rm I}}$ mass density $\Omega_{{\rm H\hspace{0.5mm}}{\scriptsize {\rm I}}}$ and the ${\rm H\hspace{0.5mm}}{\scriptsize {\rm I}}$ bias $b_{{\rm H\hspace{0.5mm}}{\scriptsize {\rm I}}}$. The techniques used here can be applied to other telescopes and frequencies, including $\sim 150 \, {\rm MHz}$ Epoch of Reionization observations.</description>

      <title>ExoCubed: A Riemann-Solver based Cubed-Sphere Dynamic Core for Planetary Atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The computational fluid dynamics on a sphere is relevant to global simulations of geophysical fluid dynamics. Using the conventional spherical-polar (or lat-lon) grid results in a singularity at the poles, with orders of magnitude smaller cell sizes at the poles in comparison to the equator. To address this problem, we developed a general circulation model (dynamic core) with a gnomonic equiangular cubed-sphere configuration. This model is developed based on the Simulating Nonhydrostatic Atmospheres on Planets (SNAP) model, using a finite volume numerical scheme with a Riemann-solver-based dynamic core and the vertical implicit correction (VIC) scheme. This change of the horizontal configuration gives a 20-time acceleration of global simulations compared to the lat-lon grid with a similar number of cells at medium resolution. We presented standard tests ranging from 2D shallow-water models to 3D general circulation tests, including earth-like planets and shallow hot Jupiters, to validate the accuracy of the model. The method described in this article is generic to transform any existing finite-volume hydrodynamic model in the Cartesian geometry to the spherical geometry.</description>

      <title>The MODEST catalog of depth-dependent spatially coupled inversions of sunspots observed by Hinode/SOT-SP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a catalog that we named MODEST containing depth-dependent information on the atmospheric conditions inside sunspot groups of all types. The catalog is currently composed of 942 observations of 117 individual active regions with sunspots that cover all types of features observed in the solar photosphere. We use the SPINOR-2D code to perform spatially coupled inversions of the Stokes profiles observed by Hinode/SOT-SP at high spatial resolution. SPINOR-2D accounts for the unavoidable degradation of the spatial information due to the point spread function of the telescope. The sunspot sample focuses on complex sunspot groups, but simple sunspots are also part of the catalog for completeness. Sunspots were observed from 2006 to 2019, covering parts of solar cycles 23 and 24. The catalog is a living resource, as with time, more sunspot groups will be included.</description>

      <title>A Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background in LISA from Unresolved White Dwarf Binaries in the Large Magellanic Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is expected to detect a wide variety of gravitational wave sources in the mHz band. Some of these signals will elude individual detection, instead contributing as confusion noise to one of several stochastic gravitational-wave backgrounds (SGWBs) -- notably including the `Galactic foreground', a loud signal resulting from the superposition of millions of unresolved double white dwarf binaries (DWDs) in the Milky Way. It is possible that similar, weaker SGWBs will be detectable from other DWD populations in the local universe, including the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). We use the Bayesian LISA Inference Package ($\tt{BLIP}$) to investigate the possibility of an anisotropic SGWB generated by unresolved DWDs in the LMC. To do so, we compute the LMC SGWB from a realistic DWD population generated via binary population synthesis, simulate four years of time-domain data with $\tt{BLIP}$ comprised of stochastic contributions from the LMC SGWB and the LISA detector noise, and analyze this data with $\tt{BLIP}$'s spherical harmonic anisotropic SGWB search. We also consider the case of spectral separation from the Galactic foreground. We present the results of these analyses and show, for the first time, that the unresolved DWDs in the LMC will comprise a significant SGWB for LISA.</description>

Abstract: The EHT has captured a series of images of black holes. These images could provide valuable information about the gravitational environment near the event horizon. However, accurate detection and parameter estimation for candidate black holes are necessary. This paper explores the potential for identifying black holes in the ultraviolet band using space telescopes. We establish a data pipeline for generating simulated observations and present an ensemble neural network model for black hole detection and parameter estimation. The model achieves mean average precision [0.5] values of 0.9176 even when reaching the imaging FWHM ($\theta_c$) and maintains the detection ability until $0.54\theta_c$. The parameter estimation is also accurate. These results indicate that our methodology enables super-resolution recognition. Moreover, the model successfully detects the shadow of M87* from background noise and other celestial bodies and estimates its inclination and positional angle. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of detecting black holes in the ultraviolet band and provides a new method for black hole detection and further parameter estimation.</description>

Abstract: Gravitational waves with frequencies below 1~nHz are notoriously difficult to detect. With periods exceeding current experimental lifetimes, they induce slow drifts in observables rather than periodic correlations. Observables with well-known intrinsic contributions provide a means to probe this regime. In this work, we demonstrate the viability of using observed pulsar timing parameters to discover such "ultralow" frequency gravitational waves, presenting two complementary observables for which the systematic shift induced by ultralow-frequency gravitational waves can be extracted. Using existing data for these parameters, we search the ultralow frequency regime for continuous-wave signals, finding a sensitivity near the expected prediction from inspirals of supermassive black holes. We do not see an excess in the data, setting a limit on the strain of $ 1.3 \times 10 ^{ - 12} $ at $ 450~{\rm pHz} $ with a sensitivity dropping approximately quadratically with frequency until $ 10~{\rm pHz}$. Our search method opens a new frequency range for gravitational wave detection and has profound implications for astrophysics, cosmology, and particle physics.</description>

      <title>Application of Deep Learning Methods for Distinguishing Gamma-Ray Bursts from Fermi/GBM TTE Data</title>

Abstract: To investigate GRBs in depth, it is crucial to develop an effective method for identifying GRBs accurately. Current criteria, e.g., onboard blind search, ground blind search, and target search, are limited by manually set thresholds and perhaps miss GRBs, especially for sub-threshold events. We propose a novel approach that utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to distinguish GRBs and non-GRBs directly. We structured three CNN models, plain-CNN, ResNet, and ResNet-CBAM, and endeavored to exercise fusing strategy models. Count maps of NaI detectors onboard Fermi/GBM were employed as the input samples of datasets and models were implemented to evaluate their performance on different time scale data. The ResNet-CBAM model trained on 64 ms dataset achieves high accuracy overall, which includes residual and attention mechanism modules. The visualization methods of Grad-CAM and t-SNE explicitly displayed that the optimal model focuses on the key features of GRBs precisely. The model was applied to analyze one-year data, accurately identifying approximately 98% of GRBs listed in the Fermi burst catalog, 8 out of 9 sub-threshold GRBs, and 5 GRBs triggered by other satellites, which demonstrated the deep learning methods could effectively distinguish GRBs from observational data. Besides, thousands of unknown candidates were retrieved and compared with the bursts of SGR J1935+2154 for instance, which exemplified the potential scientific value of these candidates indeed. Detailed studies on integrating our model into real-time analysis pipelines thus may improve their accuracy of inspection, and provide valuable guidance for rapid follow-up observations of multi-band telescopes.</description>

      <title>Neural Simulation-Based Inference of the Neutron Star Equation of State directly from Telescope Spectra</title>

Abstract: Neutron stars provide a unique opportunity to study strongly interacting matter under extreme density conditions. The intricacies of matter inside neutron stars and their equation of state are not directly visible, but determine bulk properties, such as mass and radius, which affect the star's thermal X-ray emissions. However, the telescope spectra of these emissions are also affected by the stellar distance, hydrogen column, and effective surface temperature, which are not always well-constrained. Uncertainties on these nuisance parameters must be accounted for when making a robust estimation of the equation of state. In this study, we develop a novel methodology that, for the first time, can infer the full posterior distribution of both the equation of state and nuisance parameters directly from telescope observations. This method relies on the use of neural likelihood estimation, in which normalizing flows use samples of simulated telescope data to learn the likelihood of the neutron star spectra as a function of these parameters, coupled with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo methods to efficiently sample from the corresponding posterior distribution. Our approach surpasses the accuracy of previous methods, improves the interpretability of the results by providing access to the full posterior distribution, and naturally scales to a growing number of neutron star observations expected in the coming years.</description>
