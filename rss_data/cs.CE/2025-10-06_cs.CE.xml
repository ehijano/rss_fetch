      <title>Heterogeneous Graph Representation of Stiffened Panels with Non-Uniform Boundary Conditions and Loads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surrogate models are essential in structural analysis and optimization. We propose a heterogeneous graph representation of stiffened panels that accounts for geometrical variability, non-uniform boundary conditions, and diverse loading scenarios, using heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs). The structure is partitioned into multiple structural units, such as stiffeners and the plates between them, with each unit represented by three distinct node types: geometry, boundary, and loading nodes. Edge heterogeneity is introduced by incorporating local orientations and spatial relationships of the connecting nodes. Several heterogeneous graph representations, each with varying degrees of heterogeneity, are proposed and analyzed. These representations are implemented into a heterogeneous graph transformer (HGT) to predict von Mises stress and displacement fields across stiffened panels, based on loading and degrees of freedom at their boundaries. To assess the efficacy of our approach, we conducted numerical tests on panels subjected to patch loads and box beams composed of stiffened panels under various loading conditions. The heterogeneous graph representation was compared with a homogeneous counterpart, demonstrating superior performance. Additionally, an ablation analysis was performed to evaluate the impact of graph heterogeneity on HGT performance. The results show strong predictive accuracy for both displacement and von Mises stress, effectively capturing structural behavior patterns and maximum values.</description>

      <title>VisitHGNN: Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks for Modeling Point-of-Interest Visit Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how urban residents travel between neighborhoods and destinations is critical for transportation planning, mobility management, and public health. By mining historical origin-to-destination flow patterns with spatial, temporal, and functional relations among urban places, we estimate probabilities of visits from neighborhoods to specific destinations. These probabilities capture neighborhood-level contributions to citywide vehicular and foot traffic, supporting demand estimation, accessibility assessment, and multimodal planning. Particularly, we introduce VisitHGNN, a heterogeneous, relation-specific graph neural network designed to predict visit probabilities at individual Points of interest (POIs). POIs are characterized using numerical, JSON-derived, and textual attributes, augmented with fixed summaries of POI--POI spatial proximity, temporal co-activity, and brand affinity, while census block groups (CBGs) are described with 72 socio-demographic variables. CBGs are connected via spatial adjacency, and POIs and CBGs are linked through distance-annotated cross-type edges. Inference is constrained to a distance-based candidate set of plausible origin CBGs, and training minimizes a masked Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to yield probability distribution across the candidate set. Using weekly mobility data from Fulton County, Georgia, USA, VisitHGNN achieves strong predictive performance with mean KL divergence of 0.287, MAE of 0.008, Top-1 accuracy of 0.853, and R-square of 0.892, substantially outperforming pairwise MLP and distance-only baselines, and aligning closely with empirical visitation patterns (NDCG@50 = 0.966); Recall@5 = 0.611). The resulting distributions closely mirror observed travel behavior with high fidelity, highlighting the model's potential for decision support in urban planning, transportation policy, mobility system design, and public health.</description>

      <title>Can LLMs Hit Moving Targets? Tracking Evolving Signals in Corporate Disclosures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moving targets -- managers' strategic shifting of key performance metrics when the original targets become difficult to achieve -- have been shown to predict subsequent stock underperformance. However, our work reveals that the method employed in that study exhibits two key limitations that hinder the accuracy -- noise in the extracted targets and loss of contextual information -- both of which stem primarily from the use of a named entity recognition (NER). To address these two limitations, we propose an LLM-based target extraction} method with a newly defined metric that better captures semantic context. This approach preserves semantic context beyond simple entity recognition and yields consistently higher predictive power than the original approach. Overall, our approach enhances the granularity and accuracy of financial text-based performance prediction.</description>

      <title>Fully automated inverse co-optimization of templates and block copolymer blending recipes for DSA lithography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The directed self-assembly (DSA) of block copolymers (BCPs) offers a highly promising approach for the fabrication of contact holes or vertical interconnect access at sub-7nm technology nodes. To fabricate circular holes with precisely controlled size and positions, the self-assembly of block copolymers requires guidance from a properly designed template. Effectively parameterizing the template shape to enable efficient optimization remains a critical yet challenging problem. Moreover, the optimized template must possess excellent manufacturability for practical applications. In this work, we propose a Gaussian descriptor for characterizing the template shape with only two parameters. We further propose to use AB/AB binary blends instead of pure diblock copolymer to improve the adaptability of the block copolymer system to the template shape. The Bayesian optimization (BO) is applied to co-optimize the binary blend and the template shape. Our results demonstrate that BO based on the Gaussian descriptor can efficiently yield the optimal templates for diverse multi-hole patterns, all leading to highly matched self-assembled morphologies. Moreover, by imposing constraints on the variation of curvature of the template during optimization, superior manufacturability is ensured for each optimized template. It is noteworthy that each key parameter of the blend exhibits a relatively wide tunable window under the requirement of rather high precision. Our work provides valuable insights for advancing DSA technology, and thus potentially propels its practical applications forward.</description>

      <title>ReeMark: Reeb Graphs for Simulating Patterns of Life in Spatiotemporal Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately modeling human mobility is critical for urban planning, epidemiology, and traffic management. In this work, we introduce Markovian Reeb Graphs, a novel framework for simulating spatiotemporal trajectories that preserve Patterns of Life (PoLs) learned from baseline data. By combining individual- and population-level mobility structures within a probabilistic topological model, our approach generates realistic future trajectories that capture both consistency and variability in daily life. Evaluations on the Urban Anomalies dataset (Atlanta and Berlin subsets) using the Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) across population- and agent-level metrics demonstrate that the proposed method achieves strong fidelity while remaining data- and compute-efficient. These results position Markovian Reeb Graphs as a scalable framework for trajectory simulation with broad applicability across diverse urban environments.</description>

      <title>Elasto-acoustic wave propagation in geophysical media using hybrid high-order methods on general meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15771v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hybrid high-order (HHO) methods are numerical methods characterized by several interesting properties such as local conservativity, geometric flexibility and high-order accuracy. Here, HHO schemes are studied for the space semi-discretization of coupled elasto-acoustic waves in the time domain using a first-order formulation. Explicit and singly diagonal implicit Runge--Kutta (ERK &amp; SDIRK) schemes are used for the time discretization. We show that an efficient implementation of explicit (resp. implicit) time schemes calls for a static condensation of the face (resp. cell) unknowns. Crucially, both static condensation procedures only involve block-diagonal matrices. Then, we provide numerical estimates for the CFL stability limit of ERK schemes and present a comparative study on the efficiency of explicit versus implicit schemes. Our findings indicate that implicit time schemes remain competitive in many situations. Finally, simulations in a 2D realistic geophysical configuration are performed, illustrating the geometrical flexibility of the HHO method: both hybrid (triangular and quadrilateral) and nonconforming (with hanging nodes) meshes are easily handled, delivering results of comparable accuracy to a reference spectral element software based on tensorized elements.</description>

      <title>Accurate identification of communication between multiple interacting neural populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19094v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural recording technologies now enable simultaneous recording of population activity across many brain regions, motivating the development of data-driven models of communication between brain regions. However, existing models can struggle to disentangle the sources that influence recorded neural populations, leading to inaccurate portraits of inter-regional communication. Here, we introduce Multi-Region Latent Factor Analysis via Dynamical Systems (MR-LFADS), a sequential variational autoencoder designed to disentangle inter-regional communication, inputs from unobserved regions, and local neural population dynamics. We show that MR-LFADS outperforms existing approaches at identifying communication across dozens of simulations of task-trained multi-region networks. When applied to large-scale electrophysiology, MR-LFADS predicts brain-wide effects of circuit perturbations that were held out during model fitting. These validations on synthetic and real neural data position MR-LFADS as a promising tool for discovering principles of brain-wide information processing.</description>
