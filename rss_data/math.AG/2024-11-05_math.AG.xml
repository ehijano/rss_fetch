      <title>Modularity of d-elliptic loci with level structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the generating series of special cycles on $\mathcal{A}_1(N)\times \mathcal{A}_g(N)$, with full level $N$ structure, valued in the cohomology of degree $2g$. The modularity theorem of Kudla-Millson for locally symmetric spaces implies that these series are modular. When $N=1$, the images of these loci in $\mathcal{A}_g$ are the $d$-elliptic Noether-Lefschetz loci, which are conjectured to be modular. In the appendix, it is shown that the resulting modular forms are nonzero for $g=2$ when $N\geq 11$ and $N\neq 12$.</description>

      <title>Relative Stability Conditions on Triangulated Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of relative stability conditions on triangulated categories with respect to left admissible subcategories, based on arXiv:math/0212237, and demonstrate the deformation of relative stability conditions via the deformation of gluing stability conditions in arXiv:0902.0323. The motivation for this concept stems from the discussions in arXiv:2004.04831 concerning the relationship between Bridgeland stability and the existence of the deformed Hermitian-Yang-Mills metrics on line bundles.</description>

      <title>Exponential volumes of moduli spaces of hyperbolic surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A decorated surface S is an oriented topological surface with marked points on the boundary considered modulo the isotopy. We consider the moduli space of hyperbolic structures on S with geodesic boundary, such that the hyperbolic structure near each marked point is a cusp, equipped with a horocycle. This space carries a volume form. Let us fix the set K of distances between the horocycles at the adjacent cusps, and the set L of lengths of boundary circles without cusps. We get a subspace M(S; K,L) with the induced volume form Vol(K,L). However, if the cusps are present, the volume of the space M(S; K,L) is infinite.
  We introduce the exponential volume form exp(-W)Vol(K,L), where W is a positive function on the moduli space, given by the sum over cusps of the hyperbolic areas enclosed between the cusp and the horocycle at the cusp. We prove that the exponential volume, defined as the integral of the exponential volume form over the moduli space M(S; K,L), is always finite.
  We suggest that the moduli spaces M(S; K,L) with the exponential volume forms are the true analogs of the classical moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces, with the Weil-Petersson volume forms. In particular, they should be relevant to the open string theory.
  We support this by proving an unfolding formula for the integrals of measurable functions multiplied by the exponential volume form. It expresses them as finite sums of similar integrals over moduli spaces for simpler surfaces. They generalise Mirzakhani's recursions for the volumes of moduli spaces of hyperbolic surfaces.</description>

      <title>Family of curves, first slope, p-adic weight of support</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper uncovers a new link between the p-adic weight of the support \Supp(f) of f(x)=\sum_{i\ge 0} a_i x^i and the first slope of Artin-Schreier curve X_f: y^p-y=f. We prove that the family X_f has its first slope \ge 1/\max_{i\in\Supp(f)}s_p(i), where s_p(i) is the sum of p-adic digits of i. If the maximum is achieved at a unique i, we show that the lower bound is achieved if and only if \nu satisfies a combinatorial $p$-symmetric condition. As an application, we construct explicit families of curves in every characteristic p with first slope equal to 1/n for every n\ge 2.</description>

      <title>Twists of intermediate Jacobian fibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study the analytic relative Jacobian sheaf for a Lagrangian fibration of a hyperk\"ahler manifold. When the fibration has irreducible fibers in codimension 1 and a relative principal polarization, we show that it is isomorphic to the relative Albanese sheaf which acts on the Lagrangian fibration. We apply this to OG10 Lagrangian fibrations associated to a smooth cubic fourfold constructed by Laza-Sacc\`a-Voisin and Sacc\`a. For sufficiently general cubic fourfolds, we compute the Tate-Shafarevich group parametrizing twists of the original Lagrangian fibration in terms of certain degree twists and Brauer twists. Among the main tools we use are perverse sheaves, decomposition theorem, Hodge modules and Deligne cohomology.</description>

      <title>On the non-special divisors in algebraic function fields defined over $\mathbb{F}_q$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the theory of algebraic function fields and their applications to the information theory, the Riemann-Roch theorem plays a fundamental role. But its use, delicate in general, is efficient and practical for applications especially in the case of non-special divisors. So, in this paper, we give a survey of the known results concerning the non-special divisors in the algebraic function fields defined over finite fields, enriched with some new results about the existence of such divisors in curves of defect k. In particular, we have chosen to be self-contained by giving the full proofs of each result, the original proofs or shorter alternative proofs.</description>

      <title>Decomposition and framing of F-bundles and applications to quantum cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: F-bundle is a formal/non-archimedean version of variation of nc-Hodge structures which plays a crucial role in the theory of atoms as birational invariants from Gromov-Witten theory. In this paper, we establish the spectral decomposition theorem for F-bundles according to the generalized eigenspaces of the Euler vector field action. The proof relies on solving systems of partial differential equations recursively in terms of power series, and on estimating the size of the coefficients for non-archimedean convergence. The same technique allows us to establish the existence and uniqueness of the extension of framing for logarithmic F-bundles. As an application, we prove the uniqueness of the decomposition map for the A-model F-bundle (hence quantum D-module and quantum cohomology) associated to a projective bundle, as well as to a blowup of an algebraic variety. This complements the existence results by Iritani-Koto and Iritani.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial G\"ottsche-Schroeter invariants in any genus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: G\"ottsche-Schroeter invariants are a genus 0 extension of Block-G\"ottsche invariants. They interpolate between Welschinger invariants involving pairs of complex conjugated points and genus 0 descendant Gromov-Witten invariants. They can be computed by a floor diagram algorithm.
  In this paper, we show that this floor diagrams recipe actually leads to some invariants in any genus. This generalizes G\"ottsche-Schroter invariant in higher genus in a combinatorial way. We then prove some polynomiality result and establish a link with invariants defined by Shustin and Sinichkin. We provide many examples. In particular, we conjecture that these combinatorial invariants satisfy the Abramovich-Bertram formula.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A parameterizing space of ideal sheaves of involutive and formally integrable non-linear partial differential equations in the algebro-geometric setting is constructed. It provides a $\mathcal{D}$-geometric analog of Grothendieck's Quot (resp. Hilbert) functor and is proven to be represented by a $\mathcal{D}$-scheme which is suitably of finite type. A natural derived enhancement of the so-called $\mathcal{D}$-Quot (resp. $\mathcal{D}$-Hilbert) moduli functor is constructed and its representability by a differential graded $\mathcal{D}$-manifold with corresponding finiteness properties is studied.</description>

Abstract: We derive formulas for the number of points on the basic stratum of certain Kottwitz varieties in terms of automorphic representations and certain explicit polynomials, for which we present efficient algorithms for computation. We obtain our results using the trace formula, base change, representations of general linear groups over p-adic fields, and a truncation of the formula of Kottwitz for the number of points on Shimura varieties over finite fields.</description>

      <title>The Painlev\'e equivalence problem for a constrained 3D system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a geometric approach to study Painlev\'e equations appearing as constrained systems of three first-order ordinary differential equations. We illustrate this approach on a system of three first-order differential equations arising in the theory of semi-classical orthogonal polynomials. We show that it can be restricted to a system of two first-order differential equations in two different ways on an invariant hypersurface. We build the space of initial conditions for each of these restricted systems and verify that they exhibit the Painlev\'e property from a geometric perspective. Utilising the Painlev\'e identification algorithm we also relate this system to the Painlev\'e VI equation and we build its global Hamiltonian structure. Finally, we prove that the autonomous limit of the original system is Liouville integrable, and the level curves of its first integrals are elliptic curves, which leads us to conjecture that the 3D system itself also possesses the Painlev\'e property without the need to restrict it to the invariant hypersurface.</description>

Abstract: An equicritical stratum is the locus of univariate monic squarefree complex polynomials where the critical points have prescribed multiplicities. Tracking the positions of both roots and critical points, there is a natural ``monodromy map'' taking the fundamental group into a braid group. We show here that when there are exactly two critical points, this monodromy map is noninjective.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many (if not most) of convex polytopes, important for combinatorial and algebraic geometry, are closely related to secondary polytopes of point configurations, or base polytopes of submodular functions, or their numerous variations and generalizations.
  The aim of this text is to introduce the class of basecondary polytopes. This class includes (and allows to study uniformly) the aforementioned ones, as well as some others, e.g. appearing as Newton polytopes of important discriminant hypersurfaces.
  Most notably, this includes the discriminant of the Lyashko--Looijenga map, which is important for enumerative geometry of ramified coverings and cannot be reduced (by far) to Gelfand--Kapranov--Zelevinsky's A-discriminants and secondary polytopes.</description>

      <title>Repeated Lefschetz-like decompositions for flag doubly Cohen--Macaulay simplicial complexes and gamma vectors of flag spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We find decompositions of $h$-polynomials of flag doubly Cohen--Macaulay simplicial complex that yield a direct connection between gamma vectors of flag spheres and constructions used to build them geometrically. More specifically, they are determined by iterated double suspensions and a ``net nonnegative set of edge subdivisions'' taking it to the given flag doubly Cohen--Macaulay simplicial complex. By a ``net nonnegative set of edge subdivision'', we mean a collection of edge subdivisions and contractions where there are at least as many edge subdivisions as contractions.
  Returning to the flag spheres, these repeated decompositions involve links over collections of disjoint edges and give an analogue of a Lefschetz map that applies to each step of the decomposition. The constructions used also give a direct interpretation of the Boolean decompositions coming from links and those of the entire simplicial complex. Roughly speaking, the Boolean vs. non-Boolean distinction is used to measure how far a flag sphere is from being the boundary of a cross polytope. An analogue of this statement for flag doubly Cohen--Macaulay simplicial complexes would replace boundaries of cross polytopes by repeated suspensions of links over edges of the given simplicial complex.</description>

We consider also Kawaguchi-Silverman Conjecture (KSC) asserting that the (first) dynamical degree $d_1(f)$ of $f$ equals the arithmetic degree $\alpha_f(P)$ at a point $P$ having Zariski dense $f$-forward orbit. Assuming $X$ is a smooth affine surface, such that the log Kodaira dimension $\bar{\kappa}(X)$ is non-negative (resp. the \'etale fundamental group $\pi_1^{\text{\'et}}(X)$ is infinite), we confirm AZO, (hence) ZDO, and KSC (when $\operatorname{deg}(f)\geq 2$) (resp. AZO and hence ZDO). We also prove ZDO (resp. AZO and hence ZDO) for every surjective endomorphism on any projective variety with ''larger'' first dynamical degree (resp. every dominant endomorphism of any semiabelian variety).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.07712v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce multi-centered dilatations of rings, schemes and algebraic spaces, a basic algebraic concept. Dilatations of schemes endowed with a structure (e.g. monoid, group or Lie algebra) are in favorable cases schemes endowed with the same structure. As applications, we use our new formalism to contribute to the understanding of mono-centered dilatations, to formulate and deduce some multi-centered congruent isomorphisms and to interpret Rost double deformation space as a "double-centered" dilatation.</description>

Abstract: We compute the dimension of certain components of the family of smooth determinantal degree $d$ surfaces in $\mathbb{P}^3$, and show that each of them is the closure of a component of the Noether-Lefschetz locus $NL(d)$. Our computations exhibit that smooth determinantal surfaces in $\mathbb{P}^3$ of degree 4 form a divisor in $|\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^3}(4)|$ with 5 irreducible components. We will compute the degrees of each of these components: $320,2508,136512,38475$ and $320112$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.15814v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a smooth affine group scheme $G$ over the ring of $p$-adic integers $\mathbb{Z}_p$ and a cocharacter $\mu$ of $G$, we study $G$-$\mu$-displays over the prismatic site of Bhatt-Scholze. In particular, we obtain several descent results for them. If $G=\mathrm{GL}_n$, then our $G$-$\mu$-displays can be thought of as Breuil-Kisin modules with some additional conditions. The relation between our $G$-$\mu$-displays and prismatic $F$-gauges introduced by Drinfeld and Bhatt-Lurie is also discussed. In fact, our results are formulated and proved for smooth affine group schemes over the ring of integers $\mathcal{O}_E$ of any finite extension $E$ of $\mathbb{Q}_p$ by using $\mathcal{O}_E$-prisms, which are $\mathcal{O}_E$-analogues of prisms.</description>

Abstract: We prove that every K3 surface with automorphism group $(\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z})^2$ admits an explicit birational model as a double sextic surface. This model is canonical for Picard number greater than 10. For Picard number greater than 9, the K3 surfaces in question possess a second birational model, in the form of a projective quartic hypersurface, generalizing the Inose quartic.</description>

      <title>Bow varieties as symplectic reductions of $T^*(G/P)$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04696v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cherkis bow varieties were introduced as ADHM type description of moduli space of instantons on the Taub-NUT space equivariant under a cyclic group action. They are also models of Coulomb branches of quiver gauge theories of affine type A. In this paper, we realize each bow variety with torus fixed points as a symplectic reduction of a cotangent bundle of a partial flag variety by a unipotent group, and find a slice of this action. By this description, we calculate the equivariant cohomology (and ordinary cohomology) of some of them and answer some questions raisedbefore. This also uses a new result about circle-equivariant cohomology proven in an appendix. We also give an explicit generalized Mirkovic-Vybornov isomorphism for bow varieties in the appendix.</description>

      <title>Pl\"ucker Coordinates and the Rosenfeld Planes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07735v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The exceptional compact hermitian symmetric space EIII is the quotient $E_6/Spin(10)\times_{\mathbb{Z}_4}U(1)$. We introduce the Pl\"ucker coordinates which give an embedding of EIII into $\mathbb{C}P^{26}$ as a projective subvariety. The subvariety is cut out by 27 Pl\"ucker relations. We show that, using Clifford algebra, one can solve this over-determined system of relations, giving local coordinate charts to the space.
  Our motivation is to understand EIII as the complex projective octonion plane $(\mathbb{C}\otimes\mathbb{O})P^2$, whose construction is somewhat scattered across the literature. We will see that the EIII has an atlas whose transition functions have clear octonion interpretations, apart from those covering a sub-variety $X_{\infty}$ of dimension 10. This subvariety is itself a hermitian symmetric space known as DIII, with no apparent octonion interpretation. We give detailed analysis of the geometry in the neighbourhood of $X_{\infty}$.
  We further decompose $X={\rm EIII}$ into $F_4$-orbits: $X=Y_0\cup Y_{\infty}$, where $Y_0\sim(\mathbb{O}P^2)_{\mathbb{C}}$ is an open $F_4$-orbit and is the complexification of $\mathbb{O}P^2$, whereas $Y_{\infty}$ has co-dimension 1, thus EIII could be more appropriately denoted as $\overline{(\mathbb{O}P^2)_{\mathbb{C}}}$. This decomposition appears in the classification of equivariant completion of homogeneous algebraic varieties by Ahiezer \cite{Ahiezer}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the expressivity and learning process for polynomial neural networks (PNNs) with monomial activation functions. The weights of the network parametrize the neuromanifold. In this paper, we study certain neuromanifolds using tools from algebraic geometry: we give explicit descriptions as semialgebraic sets and characterize their Zariski closures, called neurovarieties. We study their dimension and associate an algebraic degree, the learning degree, to the neurovariety. The dimension serves as a geometric measure for the expressivity of the network, the learning degree is a measure for the complexity of training the network and provides upper bounds on the number of learnable functions. These theoretical results are accompanied with experiments.</description>

Abstract: We study the Pythagoras numbers $py(3,2d)$ of real ternary forms, defined for each degree $2d$ as the minimal number $r$ such that every degree $2d$ ternary form which is a sum of squares can be written as the sum of at most $r$ squares of degree $d$ forms. Scheiderer showed that $d+1\leq py(3,2d)\leq d+2$. We show that $py(3,2d) = d+1$ for $2d = 8,10,12$. The main technical tool is Diesel's characterization of height 3 Gorenstein algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2009.02774v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new approach to representation theory of finite groups that uses some basic algebraic geometry and allows to do all the theory without using characters. With this approach, to any finite group $G$ we associate a finite number of points and show that any field containing the coordinates of those points works fine as the ground field for the representations of $G$. We apply this point of view to the symmetric group $S_d$, finding easy equations for the different symmetries of functions in $d$ variables. As a byproduct, we give an easy proof of a recent result by Tocino that states that the hyperdeterminant of a $d$-dimensional matrix is zero for all but two types of symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.06792v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The `brane quantisation' is a quantisation procedure developed by Gukov and Witten \cite{Gukov:2008ve}.
  We implement this idea by combining it with the tilting theory and the minimal resolutions. This way, we can realistically compute the deformation quantisation on the space of observables acting on the Hilbert space. We apply this procedure to certain quantisation problems in the context of generalised K\"ahler structure on $\mathbb{P}^2$. Our approach differs from and complements that of Bischoff and Gualtieri \cite{Bischoff:2021ixy}.
  We also benefitted from an important technical tool: a combinatorial criterion for the Maurer-Cartan equation, developed in \cite{BarmeierWang} by Barmeier and Wang.</description>

Abstract: Given a covering of a quiver (with potential), we show that the associated Bridgeland stability scattering diagrams are related by a restriction operation under the assumption of admitting a nice grading. We apply this to quivers with potential associated to marked surfaces. In combination with recent results of the second and third authors, our findings imply that the bracelets basis for a once-punctured closed surface coincides with the theta basis for the associated stability scattering diagram, and these stability scattering diagrams agree with the corresponding cluster scattering diagrams of Gross-Hacking-Keel-Kontsevich except in the case of the once-punctured torus.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17343v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For each integer $d\geq 2$, let $M_d$ denote the moduli space of maps $f: \mathbb{P}^1\to \mathbb{P}^1$ of degree $d$. We study the geometric configurations of subsets of postcritically finite (or PCF) maps in $M_d$. A complex-algebraic subvariety $Y \subset M_d$ is said to be PCF-special if it contains a Zariski-dense set of PCF maps. Here we prove that there are only finitely many positive-dimensional irreducible PCF-special subvarieties in $M_d$ with degree $\leq D$. In addition, there exist constants $N = N(D,d)$ and $B = B(D,d)$ so that for any complex algebraic subvariety $X \subset M_d$ of degree $\leq D$, the Zariski closure $\overline{X\cap\mathrm{PCF}}~$ has at most $N$ irreducible components, each with degree $\leq B$. We also prove generalizations of these results for points with small critical height in $M_d(\bar{\mathbb{Q}})$.</description>

      <title>Deformation Families of Quasi-Projective Varieties and Symmetric Projective K3 Surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16208v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main aim of this paper is to construct a complex analytic family of symmetric projective K3 surfaces through a compactifiable deformation family of complete quasi-projective varieties from $\text{CP}^2 \text{$\#$9} \overline{\text{CP}}^2$. Firstly, for an elliptic curve $C_0$ embedded in $\text{CP}^2$, let $S \cong \text{CP}^2 \text{$\#$9} \overline{\text{CP}}^2$ be the blow up of $\text{CP}^2$ at nine points on the image of $C_0$ and $C$ be the strict transform of the image. Then if the normal bundle satisfies the Diophantine condition, a tubular neighborhood of the elliptic curve $C$ can be identified through a toroidal group. Fixing the Diophantine condition, a smooth compactifiable deformation of $S\backslash C$ over a 9-dimensional complex manifold is constructed. What's more, with an ample line bundle fixed on $S$, complete K\"ahler metrics can be constructed on the quasi-projective variety $S\backslash C$. So complete K\"ahler metrics are constructed on each quasi-projective variety fiber of the smooth compactifiable deformation family. Then a complex analytic family of symmetric projective K3 surfaces over a 10-dimensional complex manifold is constructed through the smooth compactifiable deformation family of complete quasi-projective varieties and an analogue deformation family.</description>

      <title>On the topological invariance of the algebraic multiplicity of holomorphic foliations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09306v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address one of the most basic and fundamental problems in the theory of foliations and ODEs, the topological invariance of the algebraic multiplicity of a holomorphic foliation. For instance, we prove an adapted version of A'Campo-L\^e's Theorem for foliations, i.e., the algebraic multiplicity equal to one is a topological invariant in dimension two. This result is further generalized to higher dimensions under mild conditions; as a consequence, we prove that saddle-nodes are topologically invariant. We prove that the algebraic multiplicity is a topological invariant in several classes of foliations that contain, for instance, the generalized curves and the foliations of second type. Additionally, we address a fundamental result by Rosas-Bazan, which states that the existence of a homeomorphism extending through a neighborhood of the exceptional divisor of the first blow-up implies the topological invariance of the algebraic multiplicity. We show that the result holds if the homeomorphism extends locally near a singularity, even if it does not extend over the entire divisor.</description>

      <title>Stability of ranks under field extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04034v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the stability of tensor ranks under field extensions. Our main contributions are fourfold: (1) We prove that the analytic rank is stable under field extensions. (2) We establish the equivalence between the partition rank vs. analytic rank conjecture and the stability conjecture for partition rank. We also prove that they are equivalent to other two important conjectures. (3) We resolve the Adiprasito-Kazhdan-Ziegler conjecture on the stability of the slice rank of linear subspaces under field extensions. (4) As an application of (1), we show that the geometric rank is equal to the analytic rank up to a constant factor.</description>

      <title>Rees Algebras and the reduced fiber cone of divisorial filtrations on two dimensional normal local rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22512v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal I=\{I_n\}$ be a divisorial filtration on a two dimensional normal excellent local ring $(R,m_R)$. Let $R[\mathcal I]=\oplus_{n\ge 0}I_n$ be the Rees algebra of $\mathcal I$ and $\tau:\mbox{Proj}R[\mathcal I])\rightarrow \mbox{Spec}(R)$ be the natural morphism. The reduced fiber cone of $\mathcal I$ is the $R$-algebra $R[\mathcal I]/\sqrt{m_RR[\mathcal I]}$, and the reduced exceptional fiber of $\tau$ is $\mbox{Proj}(R[\mathcal I]/\sqrt{m_RR[\mathcal I]})$. We give an explicit description of the scheme structure of $\mbox{Proj}(R[\mathcal I])$. As a corollary, we obtain a new proof of a theorem of F. Russo, showing that $\mbox{Proj}(R[\mathcal I])$ is always Noetherian and that $R[\mathcal I]$ is Noetherian if and only if $\mbox{Proj}(R[\mathcal I])$ is a proper $R$-scheme. We give an explicit description of the scheme structure of the reduced exceptional fiber $\mbox{Proj}(R[\mathcal I]/\sqrt{m_RR[\mathcal I]})$ of $\tau$, in terms of the possible values 0, 1 or 2 of the analytic spread $\ell(\mathcal I)=\dim R[\mathcal I]/m_RR[\mathcal I]$. In the case that $\ell(\mathcal I)=0$, $\tau^{-1}(m_R)$ is the emptyset; this case can only occur if $R[\mathcal I]$ is not Noetherian.</description>

      <title>Derived $q$-Hodge complexes and refined $\operatorname{TC}^-$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23115v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As a consequence of Efimov's proof of rigidity of the $\infty$-category of localising motives, Scholze and Efimov have constructed refinements of localising invariants such as $\operatorname{TC}^-$. In this article we compute the homotopy groups of the refined invariants $\operatorname{TC}^{-,\mathrm{ref}}(\mathrm{ku}\otimes\mathbb Q/\mathrm{ku})$ and $\operatorname{TC}^{-,\mathrm{ref}}(\mathrm{KU}\otimes\mathbb Q/\mathrm{KU})$. The computation involves a surprising connection to $q$-de Rham cohomology. In particular, it suggests a construction of a $q$-Hodge filtration on $q$-de Rham complexes in certain situations, which can be used to construct a functorial derived $q$-Hodge complex for many rings. This is in contrast to a no-go result by the second author, who showed that such a $q$-Hodge complex (and thus also a $q$-Hodge filtration) cannot exist in full generality.</description>
