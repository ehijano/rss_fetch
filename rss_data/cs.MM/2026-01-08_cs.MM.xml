      <title>Transforming Video Subjective Testing with Training, Engagement, and Real-Time Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subjective video quality assessment is crucial for optimizing streaming and compression, yet traditional protocols face limitations in capturing nuanced perceptual differences and ensuring reliable user input. We propose an integrated framework that enhances rater training, enforces attention through real-time scoring, and streamlines pairwise comparisons to recover quality scores with fewer comparisons. Participants first undergo an automated training quiz to learn key video quality indicators (e.g., compression artifacts) and verify their readiness. During the test, a real-time attention scoring mechanism, using "golden" video pairs, monitors and reinforces rater focus by applying penalties for lapses. An efficient chain-based pairwise comparison procedure is then employed, yielding quality scores in Just-Objectionable-Differences (JOD) units. Experiments comparing three groups (no training, training without feedback, and training with feedback) with 80 participants demonstrate that training-quiz significantly improves data quality in terms of golden unit accuracy and reduces tie rate, while real-time feedback further improves data quality and yields the most monotonic quality ratings. The new training, quiz, testing with feedback, 3-phase approach can significantly reduce the non-monotonic cases on the high quality part of the R-Q curve where normal viewer typically prefer the slightly compressed less-grainy content and help train a better objective video quality metric.</description>

      <title>Klear: Unified Multi-Task Audio-Video Joint Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio-video joint generation has progressed rapidly, yet substantial challenges still remain. Non-commercial approaches still suffer audio-visual asynchrony, poor lip-speech alignment, and unimodal degradation, which can be stemmed from weak audio-visual correspondence modeling, limited generalization, and scarce high-quality dense-caption data. To address these issues, we introduce Klear and delve into three axes--model architecture, training strategy, and data curation. Architecturally, we adopt a single-tower design with unified DiT blocks and an Omni-Full Attention mechanism, achieving tight audio-visual alignment and strong scalability. Training-wise, we adopt a progressive multitask regime--random modality masking to joint optimization across tasks, and a multistage curriculum, yielding robust representations, strengthening A-V aligned world knowledge, and preventing unimodal collapse. For datasets, we present the first large-scale audio-video dataset with dense captions, and introduce a novel automated data-construction pipeline which annotates and filters millions of diverse, high-quality, strictly aligned audio-video-caption triplets. Building on this, Klear scales to large datasets, delivering high-fidelity, semantically and temporally aligned, instruction-following generation in both joint and unimodal settings while generalizing robustly to out-of-distribution scenarios. Across tasks, it substantially outperforms prior methods by a large margin and achieves performance comparable to Veo 3, offering a unified, scalable path toward next-generation audio-video synthesis.</description>

      <title>Data relativistic uncertainty framework for low-illumination anime scenery image enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21944v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By contrast with the prevailing works of low-light enhancement in natural images and videos, this study copes with the low-illumination quality degradation in anime scenery images to bridge the domain gap. For such an underexplored enhancement task, we first curate images from various sources and construct an unpaired anime scenery dataset with diverse environments and illumination conditions to address the data scarcity. To exploit the power of uncertainty information inherent with the diverse illumination conditions, we propose a Data Relativistic Uncertainty (DRU) framework, motivated by the idea from Relativistic GAN. By analogy with the wave-particle duality of light, our framework interpretably defines and quantifies the illumination uncertainty of dark/bright samples, which is leveraged to dynamically adjust the objective functions to recalibrate the model learning under data uncertainty. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of DRU framework by training several versions of EnlightenGANs, yielding superior perceptual and aesthetic qualities beyond the state-of-the-art methods that are incapable of learning from data uncertainty perspective. We hope our framework can expose a novel paradigm of data-centric learning for potential visual and language domains. Code is available.</description>
