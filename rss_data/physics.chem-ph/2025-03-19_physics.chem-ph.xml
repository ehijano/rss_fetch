      <title>Highly efficient exciton-exciton annihilation in single conjugated polymer chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The number of excitons that conjugated polymers can support at any one time underpins their optoelectronic performance in light emitting diodes, concentrating photovoltaic cells and as laser gain media, as it sets a natural limit on exciton density. Here we have measured the time-resolved photon statistics of single chains of polyfluorene to extract the absolute number of independent emitting sites present and how this changes with respect to both the time in the excited state of the exciton and its energy. We find that after 100 ps each chain can only support 1 or 2 independent excitons, and that even at the earliest times this number only rises to 4, suggesting a high degree of electronic coupling between chromophoric units that facilitates highly efficient exciton-exciton annihilation. In circumstances where a low density of low-energy sites is present, annihilation between them still dominates. Our results indicate that achieving high exciton densities in conjugated polymers is naturally difficult, and in applications where it is desirable new strategies should be devised that control exciton-exciton annihilation.</description>

      <title>Collision-induced spectroscopy and radiative association in microcavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polariton chemistry has emerged as a new approach to directing molecular systems via strong light-matter interactions in confined photonic media. In this work, we implement a classical electrodynamics-molecular dynamics method to investigate collision-induced emission and radiative association in planar microcavities under variable light-matter coupling strength. We focus on the argon-xenon (Ar-Xe) gas mixture as a representative system, simulating collisions coupled to the confined multimode electromagnetic field. We find that while the effects of a microcavity on collision-induced emission spectra are subtle, even at extremely large coupling strengths, radiative association can be significantly enhanced in a microcavity. Our results also indicate that microcavities may be designed to induce changes in the statistical distribution of Ar-Xe complex lifetimes. These findings provide new insights into the control of intermolecular interactions and radiative kinetics with microcavities.</description>

      <title>Ehrenfest dynamics accelerated with SPEED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixed quantum-classical methods, such as surface hopping and Ehrenfest dynamics, have proven useful for describing molecular processes involving multiple electronic states. These methods require propagating many independent trajectories, which is computationally demanding. Therefore, we propose the single potential evaluation Ehrenfest dynamics (SPEED), a variation of Ehrenfest dynamics where all trajectories are propagated using a common local quadratic effective potential in the diabatic representation. This approach replaces the computational cost of propagating multiple trajectories with the evaluation of a single Hessian at each time step. We demonstrate the equivalence of standard Ehrenfest dynamics and SPEED in two realistic systems with (at most) quadratic diabatic potential energy surfaces and couplings: a quadratic vibronic coupling Hamiltonian model describing internal conversion in pyrazine and a model of atomic adsorption on a solid surface. The efficiency gain of our approach is particularly advantageous in on-the-fly ab initio applications. For this reason, we combined SPEED with the ALMO(MSDFT2) electronic structure method, which provides the diabatic potential describing charge transfer between two molecules. We find that SPEED qualitatively captures the temperature dependence of the hole transfer rate between two furan moieties and accurately predicts the final charge distribution after the collision. In contrast, but as expected, our approach is insufficient for describing photoisomerization of retinal due to the high anharmonicity of the potential energy surfaces.</description>

      <title>Estimating ionization states and continuum lowering from ab initio path integral Monte Carlo simulations for warm dense hydrogen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Warm dense matter (WDM) is an active field of research, with applications ranging from astrophysics to inertial confinement fusion. Ionization degree and continuum lowering are important quantities to understand how materials behave under these conditions, but can be difficult to diagnose since experimental campaigns are limited and often require model-dependent analysis. This is especially true for hydrogen, which has a comparably low scattering cross section, making high quality data particularly difficult to obtain. Consequently, building equation of state tables often relies on exact simulations in combination with untested approximations to extract properties from experiments. Here, we investigate an approach for extracting the ionization potential depression and ionization degree -- quantities which are otherwise not directly accessible from the physical model -- from exact ab initio path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulations utilizing a chemical model. In contrast to experimental measurements, where noise and non-equilibrium effects add to the uncertainty of the inferred parameters, PIMC simulations provide a clean signal with well-defined thermodynamic conditions. Comparisons against commonly used models show a qualitative agreement, but we find deviations primarily for the high density and high temperature cases. We also demonstrate the decreasing sensitivity of the dynamic structure factor with respect to both ionization and continuum lowering for increasing scattering angles in x-ray Thomson scattering experiments. Our work has important implications for the design of future experiments, but also offers qualitative understanding of structure factors and the imaginary-time correlation function obtained from exact quantum Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>Opportunities and Challenges in Unsupervised Learning: The Case of Aqueous Electrolyte Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool in atomistic simulations, enabling the identification of complex patterns in molecular systems limiting human intervention and bias. However, the practical implementation of these methods presents significant technical challenges, particularly in the selection of hyperparameters and in the physical interpretability of machine-learned descriptors. In this work, we systematically investigate these challenges by applying an unsupervised learning protocol to a fundamental problem in physical chemistry namely, how ions perturb the local structure of water. Using the Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions(SOAP) descriptors, we demonstrate how the intrinsic dimension (ID) serves as a guide for selecting hyperparameters and interpreting structural complexity. Furthermore, we construct a high-dimensional free energy landscape encompassing all water environments surrounding different ions. This analysis reveals how the physical properties of ions are intricately reflected in their hydration shells, shaping the landscape through specific connections between different minima. Our findings highlight the difficulty in balancing algorithmic automation with the need of employing both physical and chemical intuition, particularly for the construction of meaningful descriptors and for the interpretation of final results. By critically assessing the methodological hurdles associated with unsupervised learning, we provide a road map for researchers looking to harness these techniques for studying electrolyte and aqueous solutions in general.</description>

      <title>Excited state assignment and state-resolved photoelectron circular dichroism in chalcogen-substituted fenchones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excited electronic states of fenchone, thiofenchone, and selenofenchone are characterized and assigned with different gas-phase spectroscopic methods and \textit{ab initio} quantum chemical calculations. With an increasing atomic number of the chalcogen, we observe increasing bathochromic (red) shifts, which vary in strength for Rydberg states, valence-excited states, and ionization energies. The spectroscopic insight is used to state-resolve the contributions in multi-photon photoelectron circular dichroism with femtosecond laser pulses. This is shown to be a sensitive observable of molecular chirality in all studied chalcogenofenchones. Our work contributes new spectroscopic information, particularly on thiofenchone and selenofenchone. It may open a perspective for future coherent control experiments exploiting resonances in the visible and or near-ultraviolet spectral regions.</description>

      <title>Ensemble Knowledge Distillation for Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are a promising tool to accelerate atomistic simulations and molecular property prediction. The quality of MLIPs strongly depends on the quantity of available training data as well as the quantum chemistry (QC) level of theory used to generate that data. Datasets generated with high-fidelity QC methods, such as coupled cluster, are typically restricted to small molecules and may be missing energy gradients. With this limited quantity of data, it is often difficult to train good MLIP models. We present an ensemble knowledge distillation (EKD) method to improve MLIP accuracy when trained to energy-only datasets. In our EKD approach, first, multiple teacher models are trained to QC energies and then used to generate atomic forces for all configurations in the dataset. Next, a student MLIP is trained to both QC energies and to ensemble-averaged forces generated by the teacher models. We apply this workflow on the ANI-1ccx dataset which consists of organic molecules with configuration energies computed at the coupled cluster level of theory. The resulting student MLIPs achieve new state-of-the-art accuracy on the out-of-sample COMP6 benchmark and improved stability for molecular dynamics simulations. The EKD approach for MLIP is broadly applicable for chemical, biomolecular and materials science simulations.</description>

      <title>Role of symmetry-forbidden transitions in resonant inelastic X-ray scattering emission from materials with trapped molecular O$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oxygen resonant inelastic X-ray scattering has become a prominent tool for unveiling the electronic structure of solids, especially redox mechanisms in Li-rich cathode materials. A number of studies have observed a strong absorption feature at 531 eV associated with the anomalous capacity of Li-rich cathodes. The most prominent emission feature arising from absorption at 531 eV occurs at 523 eV and has been attributed to the $^3\Pi_\text{g}$ final state of molecular O$_2$. However, in many materials, this feature exhibits a secondary emission peak at a loss of 4.3 eV loss which is not seen in the spectrum of gas-phase oxygen. This study revisits the spectra of these materials and investigates transitions that are forbidden for an isolated O$_2$ molecule as a possible explanation for the secondary emission peak. A group theoretic analysis and simulation of RIXS cross-sections suggest that this feature is consistent with molecular oxygen in a low-symmetry environment owing to final states descending from the $^3\Sigma_\text{u}^+$ and $^3\Delta_\text{u}$ states of isolated O$_2$. Vibronic coupling and multi-molecule transitions are also discussed as possible mechanisms for enabling transitions to these final states even in a high-symmetry environment. These results support the assignment of the 531 eV absorption peak in these materials exclusively to molecular oxygen and suggest that in materials exhibiting the secondary emission peak, these molecules may reside in low-symmetry environments.</description>

      <title>Computation of Auger Electron Spectra in Organic Molecules with Multiconfiguration Pair-Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficiently and accurately computing molecular Auger electron spectra for larger systems is limited by the increasing complexity of the scaling in the number of doubly ionized final states with respect to the system size. In this work, we benchmark the application of multiconfiguration pair-density functional theory with a restricted active space (RAS) reference wave function, for computing the carbon K-edge decay spectra of 21 organic molecules, with decay rates computed within the one-center approximation. The performance of different basis sets and on-top functionals is evaluated and the results show that multiconfiguration pair-density functional theory is comparable in accuracy to RAS followed by second-order perturbation theory, but at a significantly reduced cost and both methods demonstrate good agreement with experiment.</description>

      <title>Precise Quantum Chemistry calculations with few Slater Determinants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Slater determinants have underpinned quantum chemistry for nearly a century, yet their full potential has remained challenging to exploit. In this work, we show that a variational wavefunction composed of a few hundred optimized non-orthogonal determinants can achieve energy accuracies comparable to state-of-the-art methods. Our approach exploits the quadratic dependence of the energy on selected parameters, permitting their exact optimization, and employs an efficient tensor contraction algorithm to compute the effective Hamiltonian with a computational cost scaling as the fourth power of the number of basis functions. We benchmark the accuracy of the proposed method with exact full-configuration interaction results where available, and we achieve lower variational energies than coupled cluster (CCSD(T)) for several molecules in the double-zeta basis. We conclude by discussing limitations and extensions of the technique, and the potential impact on other many-body methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that autocatalytic reactions, where a product catalyzes its own formation, can be significantly accelerated when the product molecules are indistinguishable from each other. This ``combinatorial enhancement," analogous to the driving force of osmotic pressure, arises from the increased multiplicity of microscopic configurations. We quantify this effect with a free-energy gain, Fgain, and validate our theoretical predictions using molecular dynamics simulations. We also propose an experiment to directly test this phenomenon, potentially providing new insights into self-assembly, biomolecular binding, and other cooperative processes.</description>

      <title>PET-MAD, a universal interatomic potential for advanced materials modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have greatly extended the reach of atomic-scale simulations, offering the accuracy of first-principles calculations at a fraction of the effort. Leveraging large quantum mechanical databases and expressive architectures, recent "universal" models deliver qualitative accuracy across the periodic table but are often biased toward low-energy configurations. We introduce PET-MAD, a generally applicable MLIP trained on a dataset combining stable inorganic and organic solids, systematically modified to enhance atomic diversity. Using a moderate but highly-consistent level of electronic-structure theory, we assess PET-MAD's accuracy on established benchmarks and advanced simulations of six materials. PET-MAD rivals state-of-the-art MLIPs for inorganic solids, while also being reliable for molecules, organic materials, and surfaces. It is stable and fast, enabling, out-of-the-box, the near-quantitative study of thermal and quantum mechanical fluctuations, functional properties, and phase transitions. It can be efficiently fine-tuned to deliver full quantum mechanical accuracy with a minimal number of targeted calculations.</description>

      <title>Ab initio machine learning simulation of calcium carbonate from aqueous solutions to the solid state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18562v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A first principles machine learning model has been developed aimed at studying the formation of calcium carbonate from aqueous solution using molecular dynamics simulations. The model, dubbed SCAN-ML, reproduces accurately the potential energy surface derived from ab initio density-functional theory within the SCAN approximation for the exchange and correlation functional. A broad range of properties have been calculated relevant to ions in solution, solid phases, and the calcite/water interface. Careful comparison with results from experiments and semi-empirical force fields shows that SCAN-ML provides an excellent description of this system, surpassing state-of-the-art force fields for many properties, while providing a benchmark for many quantities that are currently beyond the reach of direct ab initio molecular dynamics. A key feature of SCAN-ML is its ability to capture chemical reactions, which reveals that calcium carbonate ion pair formation occurs predominantly via binding of calcium to bicarbonate, with the subsequent loss of a proton to water, rather than by direct association. Our model thus paves the way for the study of reactive crystallization pathways in calcium carbonate, which are currently poorly understood.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07335v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the fast development of machine learning potentials (MLPs) and their widespread applications in chemistry, physics, and material science. By fitting discrete ab initio data faithfully to continuous and symmetry-preserving mathematical forms, MLPs have enabled accurate and efficient atomistic simulations in a large scale from first principles. In this review, we provide an overview of the evolution of MLPs in the past two decades and focus on the state-of-the-art MLPs proposed in the last a few years for molecules, reactions, and materials. We discuss some representative applications of MLPs and the trend of developing universal potentials across a variety of systems. Finally, we outline a list of open challenges and opportunities in the development and applications of MLPs.</description>

Abstract: The nuclear-electronic orbital (NEO) approach incorporates nuclear quantum effects into quantum chemistry calculations by treating specified nuclei quantum mechanically, equivalently to the electrons. Within the NEO framework, excited states are vibronic states representing electronic and nuclear vibrational excitations. The NEO multireference configuration interaction (MRCI) method presented herein provides accurate ground and excited vibronic states. The electronic and nuclear orbitals are optimized with a NEO multiconfigurational self-consistent field (NEO-MCSCF) procedure, thereby including both static and dynamic correlation and allowing the description of double and higher excitations. The accuracy of the NEO-MRCI method is illustrated by computing the ground state protonic densities and excitation energies of the vibronic states for four molecular systems with the hydrogen nucleus treated quantum mechanically. In addition, revised conventional electronic basis sets adapted for quantized nuclei are developed and shown to be essential for achieving this level of accuracy. The NEO-MRCI approach, as well as the strategy for revising electronic basis sets, will play a critical role in multicomponent quantum chemistry.</description>

      <title>Wavefunction optimization at the complete basis set limit with Multiwavelets and DMRG</title>

Abstract: The density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) is a powerful numerical technique to solve strongly correlated quantum systems: it deals well with systems which are not dominated by a single configuration (unlike Coupled Cluster) and it converges rapidly to the Full Configuration Interaction (FCI) limit (unlike truncated Configuration Interaction (CI) expansions). In this work, we develop an algorithm integrating DMRG within the multiwavelet-based multiresolution analysis (MRA). Unlike fixed basis sets, multiwavelets offer an adaptive and hierarchical representation of functions, approaching the complete basis set limit to a specified precision. As a result, this combined technique leverages the multireference capability of DMRG and the complete basis set limit of MRA and multiwavelets. More specifically, we adopt a pre-existing Lagrangian optimization algorithm for orbitals represented in the MRA domain and improve its computational efficiency by replacing the original CI calculations with DMRG. Additionally, we substitute the reduced density matrices computation with the direct extraction of energy gradients from the DMRG tensors. We apply our method to small systems such H2, He, HeH2, BeH2 and N2. The results demonstrate that our approach reduces the final energy while keeping the number of orbitals low compared to FCI calculations on an atomic orbital basis set.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulations of Chemical Reactions: Achieving Accuracy with NISQ Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12084</link>

Abstract: Quantum computing is viewed as a promising technology because of its potential for polynomial growth in complexity, in contrast to the exponential growth observed in its classical counterparts. In the current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), a hybrid variational algorithm, is utilized to simulate molecules using qubits and calculate molecular properties. However, simulating a chemical reaction to compute the reaction energy using VQE algorithm has not yet reached chemical accuracy relative to the benchmark computational chemistry methods due to limitations such as the number of qubits, circuit depth, and noise introduced within the model. To address this issue, we propose the definition of different active spaces for studying chemical reactions, incorporating irreducible representations of both the ground and excited states of the molecules. Our results demonstrate that this approach achieves chemical accuracy in predicting the reaction energy for various reactions. For all reactions studied, the difference in reaction energies between conventional computational chemistry methods and the quantum-classical hybrid VQE algorithm is less than 1 kcal/mol. Furthermore, our analysis simplifies the process of selecting active spaces and electrons for each reaction, reducing it to a single optimal combination that ensures the chemical accuracy for each reaction.</description>

      <title>On the Hidden Transient Interphase in Metal Anodes: Dynamic Precipitation Controls Electrochemical Interfaces in Batteries</title>

Abstract: The Solid-Electrolyte Interphase, SEI, formed on a battery electrode has been a central area of research for decades. This thin, complex layer profoundly impacts the electrochemical deposition morphology and stability of the metal in battery anodes. Departing from conventional approaches, we investigate metal dissolution, the reverse reaction of deposition, in battery environments using a state-of-the-art electroanalytical system combining a rotating-disk electrode and in-operando visualization. Our key finding is the presence of a Transient Solid-Electrolyte Interphase, T-SEI, that forms during fast discharging at high dissolution rates. We attribute T-SEI formation to transient local supersaturation and resultant electrolyte salt deposition. The T-SEI fundamentally alters the dissolution kinetics at the electrochemical interface, leading to a self-limiting morphological evolution and eventually yielding a flat, clean surface. Unlike a classical SEI formed due to electrolyte decomposition, the T-SEI is fully relaxable upon removal of the enforced dissolution current. The formation of T-SEI, surprisingly, plays a critical role in the subsequent electrodeposition. When the metal is redeposited on a fully relaxed T-SEI surface, the morphology is remarkably different from that deposited on pristine or low-rate discharged metal electrodes. Electron backscatter diffraction analysis suggests the deposition occurs via growth of the original grains. This is in stark contrast to the isolated, particulate nuclei seen on standard metal electrodes without T-SEI formation. Our findings provide important insights into the electrochemical kinetics at the metal-electrolyte interface, particularly in concentrated or water-in-salt electrolytes that are close to the salt saturation limit. The results suggest a new dimension for electrochemical engineering in batteries.</description>

      <title>Compactifying Electronic Wavefunctions I: Error-Mitigated Transcorrelated DMRG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transcorrelation (TC) techniques effectively enhance convergence rates in strongly correlated fermionic systems by embedding electron-electron cusp into the Jastrow factor of similarity transformations, yielding a non-Hermitian, yet iso-spectral, Hamiltonian. This non-Hermitian nature introduces significant challenges for variational methods such as the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG). To address these, existing approaches often rely on computationally expensive methods prone to errors, such as imaginary-time evolution. We introduce an Error-Mitigated Transcorrelated DMRG (EMTC-DMRG), a classical variational algorithm that overcomes these challenges by integrating existing techniques to achieve superior accuracy and efficiency. Key features of our algorithm include: (a) an analytical formulation of the transcorrelated Fermi-Hubbard Hamiltonian; (b) a numerically exact, uncompressed Matrix Product Operator (MPO) representation developed via symbolic optimization and the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm; and (c) a time-independent DMRG with a two-site sweep algorithm; (d) we use Davidson solver even for a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. Our method significantly enhances computational efficiency and accuracy in determining ground-state energies for the two-dimensional transcorrelated Fermi-Hubbard model with periodic boundary conditions. Additionally, it can be adapted to compute both ground and excited states in molecular systems.</description>
