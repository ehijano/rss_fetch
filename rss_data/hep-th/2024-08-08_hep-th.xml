      <title>Quantisation of type IIB superstring theory and the matrix model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the path-integral quantisation of perturbative string theory and show equivalence between the Polyakov-type, Schild-type and Nambu-Goto-type formulations of critical type II superstring theory. Remarkably, we also find that the Minkowskian path integral realises causality in the sense that a string does not propagate between points at space-like separation, by giving careful consideration to the measure of the world-sheet metric. We also discuss matrix regularisation of the path integral for type IIB perturbative superstring theory. The obtained matrix models are the Euclidean IKKT matrix model and a modified Minkowskian IKKT model, known as the NBI matrix model, depending on how the matrix regularisation is applied.</description>

      <title>Holographic Gubser flow: A combined analytic and numerical study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gubser flow is an evolution with cylindrical and boost symmetries, which can be best studied by mapping the future wedge of Minkowski space (R$^{3,1}$) to dS$_3$ $\times$ $\mathbb{R}$ in a conformal relativistic theory. Here, we sharpen our previous analytic results and validate them via the first numerical exploration of the Gubser flow in a holographic conformal field theory.
  Remarkably, the leading generic behavior at large de Sitter time is free-streaming in transverse directions and the sub-leading behavior is that of a color glass condensate. We also show that Gubser flow can be smoothly glued to the vacuum outside the future Minkowski wedge generically given that the energy density vanishes faster than any power when extrapolated to early proper time or to large distances from the central axis. We find that at intermediate times the ratio of both the transverse and longitudinal pressures to the energy density converge approximately to a fixed point which is hydrodynamic only for large initial energy densities. We argue that our results suggest that the Gubser flow is better applied to collective behavior in jets rather than the full medium in the phenomenology of heavy ion collisions and can reveal new clues to the mechanism of confinement.</description>

      <title>Modular invariance as completeness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review the physical meaning of modular invariance for unitary conformal quantum field theories in d=2. For QFT models, while T invariance is necessary for locality, S invariance is not mandatory. S invariance is a form of completeness of the theory that has a precise meaning as Haag duality for arbitrary multi-interval regions. We present a mathematical proof as well as derive this result from a physical standpoint using Renyi entropies and the replica trick. For rational CFT's, the failure of modular invariance or Haag duality can be measured by an index, related to the quantum dimensions of the model. We show how to compute this index from the modular transformation matrices. The index also appears in a limit of the Renyi mutual informations. Cases of infinite index are briefly discussed. Part of the argument can be extended to higher dimensions, where the lack of completeness can also be diagnosed using the CFT data through the thermal partition function and measured by an index.</description>

      <title>Subregion duality, wedge classification and no global symmetries in AdS/CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study various notions of `subregion duality' in the context of AdS/CFT. We highlight the differences between the `background wedge' and the `operator reconstruction wedges,' providing a resolution to the paradox raised in \cite{Bao:2019hwq}. Additionally, we elucidate the distinctions between four different `operator reconstruction wedges' and demonstrate how to enhance the proof for the absence of global symmetries in geometrical states in AdS/CFT \cite{Harlow:2018jwu, Harlow:2018tng} as an example of these distinctions.</description>

      <title>Making sense of ghosts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ghosts have been a stumbling block in the development of a UV complete quantum field theory for gravity. We discuss how difficulties associated with ghosts are overcome in the context of 0+1d QFT. Obtaining a probability interpretation is the key issue, and for this we discuss how an appropriate inner product can be constructed to define a sensible Born rule. Ghost theories are intrinsically unitary and perturbatively stable. They can also display nonperburbative stability even when the corresponding normal theory does not. The spectra and propagators are numerically obtained at both weak and strong coupling. Normalizable wave functions are obtained for the energy eigenstates and they show a violation of normal parity. We discuss connections to PT-symmetric quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Finite Temperature at Finite Places</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies AdS/CFT in its $p$-adic version (at the ``finite place") in the setting where the bulk geometry is made up of the Tate curve, a discrete quotient of the Bruhat-Tits tree. Generalizing a classic result due to Zabrodin, the boundary dual of the free massive bulk theory is explicitly derived. Introducing perturbative interactions, the Wittens diagrams for the two-point and three-point correlators are computed for generic scaling dimensions at one-loop and tree level respectively. The answers obtained demonstrate how $p$-adic AdS/CFT on the Tate curve provides a useful toy model for real CFTs at finite temperature.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation theorems, quantum channels and gravitational algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we study nonequilibrium fluctuations in gravitational algebras within de Sitter space. An essential aspect of this study is quantum measurement theory, which allows us to access the dynamical fluctuations of observables via a two-point measurement scheme. Using this formalism, we establish specific fluctuation theorems. Additionally, we demonstrate that quantum channels are represented by subfactors, using the relationship between measurement theory and quantum channels. We also comment on implementing a quantum channel using Jones' theory of subfactors.</description>

      <title>From squared amplitudes to energy correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The leading order $N$-point energy correlators of maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in the limit where the $N$ detectors are collinear can be expressed as an integral of the $1\to N$ splitting function, which is given by the $(N{+}3)$-point squared super-amplitudes at tree level. This provides yet another example that the integrand of certain physical observable -- $N$-point energy correlator -- is computed by the canonical form of a positive geometry -- the (tree-level) "squared amplituhedron". By extracting such squared amplitudes from the $f$-graph construction, we compute the integrand of energy correlators up to $N=11$ and reveal new structures to all $N$; we also show important properties of the integrand such as soft and multi-collinear limits. Finally, we take a first look at integrations by studying possible residues of the integrand: our analysis shows that while this gives prefactors in front of multiple polylogarithm functions of $N=3,4$, the first unknown case of $N=5$ already involves elliptic polylogarithmic functions with many distinct elliptic curves, and more complicated curves and higher-dimensional varieties appear for $N&gt;5$.</description>

      <title>Weyl-Einsteinian-Cubic Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a Weyl-gauging of strongly coupled Einsteinian-Cubic gravity (ECG) in Weyl's geometry via upgraded Weyl's curvature tensors, which include abelian gauge fields, and properly tuned compensating real scalar fields. The model is free from any dimensionful parameters. The bare ECG emerges as the lower energy limit of the Weyl-ECG in the local non-conformal-invariant vacua (i.e., broken phase) in the maximally symmetric spacetimes fixing the vacuum expectation value of the scalar field to the Planck mass scale. Here, the natural presence of (anti-) de Sitter backgrounds spontaneously breaks Weyl's local conformal symmetry akin to the Higgs mechanism, while it is radiatively broken at the renormalization scale at the one-loop level in flat vacua through the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism. The model allows anti-de Sitter and flat spaces but does not allow de Sitter to be vacuum spacetime solutions. The properties of the model deserve further exploration, specifically, those of nonperturbative (e.g., instantons and/or anti-instantons) contributions, for example, in the resurgence or tachyon condensation context requires detailed study.</description>

      <title>A supersymmetric spin current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the supersymmetric structure of the spin current in four dimensional $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric theories. By coupling the stress tensor multiplet to a vierbein multiplet we identify a spin current with the Hodge dual of the bottom component of the stress tensor multiplet in a wide range of theories. This implies that in holographic theories the Hodge dual of the $R$ current may serve as a spin current, paving the way for holographic studies of theories with background torsion.</description>

      <title>Localized RG flows on composite defects and $\mathcal{C}$-theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a composite defect system where a lower-dimensional defect (sub-defect) is embedded to a higher-dimensional one, and examine renormalization group (RG) flows localized on the defect. A composite defect is constructed in the $(3-\epsilon)$-dimensional free $\text{O}(N)$ vector model with line and surface interactions by triggering localized RG flows to non-trivial IR fixed points. Focusing on the case where the symmetry group $\text{O}(N)$ is broken to a subgroup $\text{O}(m)\times\text{O}(N-m)$ on the line defect, there is an $\text{O}(N)$ symmetric fixed point for all $N$, while two additional $\text{O}(N)$ symmetry breaking ones appear for $N\ge 23$. We also examine a $\mathcal{C}$-theorem for localized RG flows along the sub-defect and show that the $\mathcal{C}$-theorem holds in our model by perturbative calculations.</description>

      <title>Monopole-Fermion Scattering and the Solution to the Semiton/Unitarity Puzzle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Polchinski's "fermion-rotor system" as an accurate description of charged Weyl fermions scattering on a magnetic monopole core in the limit of zero gauge coupling. Traditionally it was thought such scattering could lead to fractional particle numbers ("semitons"). By direct calculations we show those semitonic processes are in fact free propagation, facilitated by composite fermion-rotor operators interpolating the "forbidden" states, effectively "recovering" both ingoing and outgoing states in every lowest partial wave. Non-semitonic Callan-Rubakov processes are unchanged.</description>

      <title>Higher derivative SVT theories from Kaluza-Klein reductions of Horndeski theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It was recently pointed out that some precise Photon-Galileon couplings in four dimensions (4D) -- inspired by a higher dimensional reduction -- are enough to obtain a Horndeski theory that is less constrained by the stringent experimental bounds on the speed of Gravitational Waves. They imply the constancy of the ratio of speed of gravity to light throughout cosmic evolution. This holds without fine tuning, even if one includes the general $G_4 (\pi,X)$ and $G_5 (\pi)$ scalar potentials. In this paper we go into the details of this 4D Luminal extension of Horndeski theory including its scalar sector. We also present the complete action including the general $G_5(\pi,X),\, G_6(\pi,X)$ scalar potentials. Thus we show all the $U(1)$ gauge invariant vector Galileons in 4D that result from a Kaluza-Klein dimensional reduction from 5D Galileons. They provide a consistent coupling of a higher derivative vector to scalar modifications of gravity - namely, without inducing Ostrogradsky ghosts and keeping gauge invariance- in the aim to explore more universal couplings of dark energy to other matter, such as vectors and in particular the Photon.</description>

      <title>Fundamental physical constants set the observability and operation of phase and other transitions and increase entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Approaching the challenge to understand fundamental physical constants (FPCs) started with understanding the role these constants play in high-energy nuclear physics and astrophysics. Condensed matter physics was relatively unexplored in this regard. More recently, it was realised that FPCs set lower or upper bounds on key condensed matter properties. In this Perspective, we discuss a wider role played by FPCs in condensed matter physics: at given environmental conditions, FPCs set the observability and operation of entire physical effects and phenomena. We discuss first and second-order phase transitions and emerging new states including long-lived metastable states. We also discuss transitions between metastable states, chemical reactions and their products. These examples show that different values of FPCs would disable these transitions, and new phases as a result of these transitions would not emerge. This suggests that the current values of FPCs, by enabling transitions which give rise to new states, act to increase the phase space and entropy.</description>

      <title>The Stability of Anisotropic Compact Stars Influenced by Dark Matter under Teleparallel Gravity: An Extended Gravitational Deformation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In our investigation, we pioneer the development of geometrically deformed strange stars within the framework of $f(\mathcal{T})$ gravity theory through gravitational decoupling via the complete geometric deformation (CGD) technique. The significant finding is the precise solution for deformed strange star (SS) models achieved through the vanishing complexity factor scenario. Further, we introduce the concept of space-time deformation caused by dark matter (DM) content in DM haloes, leading to perturbations in the metric potentials $g_{tt}$ and $g_{rr}$ components. Mathematically, this DM-induced deformation is achieved through the CGD method, where the decoupling parameter $\alpha$ governs the extent of DM influence. To validate our findings, we compare our model predictions with observational constraints, including GW190814 (with a mass range of $2.5-2.67 M_{\odot}$) and neutron stars (NSTRs) such as EXO 1785-248 [mass=$1.3_{-0.2}^{+0.2}~M_{\odot}$], 4U 1608-52 [mass=$1.74_{-0.14}^{+0.14}~M_{\odot}$], and PSR J0952-0607 [mass=$2.35_{-0.17}^{+0.17}~M_{\odot}$]. Our investigation delves into the stability of the model by considering causality conditions, Herrera's Cracking Method, the adiabatic index, and the Harrison-Zeldovich-Novikov criterion. We demonstrate that the developed model mimics a wide range of recently observed pulsars. To emphasize its compatibility, we highlight the predicted mass and radius in tabular form by varying both the parameters $\alpha$ and $\zeta_1$. Notably, our findings are consistent with the observation of gravitational waves from the first binary merger event. Furthermore, we compare our results with those obtained for a slow-rotating configuration. In addition to this, we discuss the moment of inertia using the Bejger-Haensel approach in this formulation.</description>

      <title>GUP corrected Casimir Wormholes with Electric Charge in $f(R,L_m)$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we study and investigate the effects of the Generalised Uncertainty Principle (GUP) and electric charge on Casimir wormhole geometry in the Curvature-Lagrangian coupled $f(R,L_m)$ gravity. The functional form of the considered model is $f(R,L_m)=\frac{R}{2\kappa}+L_m^{\,\,\alpha}$, corresponding to it the analytic shape function is found. For our analysis, we study the wormhole spacetimes for three particular models for the redshift function. We observe that the null energy condition is violated despite a positive contribution from the electromagnetic energy density. We also note that electric charges, GUP effects, and higher model parameter values increase the throat length. Further, we have studied the deflection of light using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, emphasizing the contribution from GUP by including higher-order terms.</description>

      <title>A Higher Spin Statistics Theorem for Invertible Quantum Field Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that every unitary invertible quantum field theory satisfies a generalization of the famous spin statistics theorem. To formulate this extension, we define a `higher spin' action of the stable orthogonal group $O$ on appropriate spacetime manifolds, which extends both the reflection involution and spin flip. On the algebraic side, we define a `higher statistics' action of $O$ on the universal target for invertible field theories, $I\mathbb{Z}$, which extends both complex conjugation and fermion parity $(-1)^F$. We prove that every unitary invertible quantum field theory intertwines these actions.</description>

      <title>Fractionalization as an alternate to charge ordering in electronic insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Incompressible insulating phases of electronic systems at partial filling of a lattice are often associated with charge ordering that breaks lattice symmetry. The resulting phases have an enlarged unit cell with an effective integer filling. Here we explore the possibility of insulating states - which we dub "Quantum Charge Liquids" (QCL) - at partial lattice filling that preserve lattice translation symmetry. Such QCL phases must necessarily either have gapped fractionally charged excitations and associated topological order or have gapless neutral excitations. We establish some general constraints on gapped fermionic QCL phases that restrict the nature of their topological order. We prove a number of results on the minimal topological order that is consistent with the lattice filling. In particular we show that at rational fillings $\nu = p/q$ with $q$ an even integer the minimal ground state degeneracy on a torus of the fermionic QCL is $4q^2$, 4 times larger than that of the bosonic QCL at the same filling. We comment on models and physical systems which may host fermionic QCL phases and discuss the phenomenology of these phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider chiral, generally nonlinear density waves in one dimension, modelling the bosonized edge modes of a two-dimensional fermionic topological insulator. Using the coincidence between bosonization and Lie-Poisson dynamics on an affine U(1) group, we show that wave profiles which are periodic in time produce Berry phases accumulated by the underlying fermionic field. These phases can be evaluated in closed form for any Hamiltonian, and they serve as a diagnostic of nonlinearity. As an explicit example, we discuss the Korteweg-de Vries equation, viewed as a model of nonlinear quantum Hall edge modes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how infinite derivative modifications of gravity impact on the stochastic background of Gravitational Waves from early Universe. The generic property of the ghost-free theory fixed on Minkowski space-time is the emergence of an infinite number of complex mass states when other classical backgrounds are considered. These additional states are shown to enhance the power spectrum of scalar perturbations generated during inflation. Current and future space-based and terrestrial interferometers offer indirect testing methods for the infinite derivative gravity action, enabling the exploration of new parameter spaces. In particular, we identify unconventional blue-tilted Gravitational Wave spectra, presenting a novel approach for testing infinite derivative quantum gravity in the future.</description>

      <title>Generalizations of Kitaev's honeycomb model from braided fusion categories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fusion surface models, as introduced by Inamura and Ohmori, extend the concept of anyon chains to 2+1 dimensions, taking fusion 2-categories as their input. In this work, we construct and analyze fusion surface models on the honeycomb lattice built from braided fusion 1-categories. These models preserve mutually commuting plaquette operators and anomalous 1-form symmetries. Their Hamiltonian is chosen to mimic the structure of Kitaev's honeycomb model, which is unitarily equivalent to the Ising fusion surface model. In the anisotropic limit, where one coupling constant is dominant, the fusion surface models reduce to Levin-Wen string-nets. In the isotropic limit, they are described by weakly coupled anyon chains and are likely to realize chiral topological order. We focus on three specific examples: (i) Kitaev's honeycomb model with a perturbation breaking time-reversal symmetry that realizes chiral Ising topological order, (ii) a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ generalization proposed by Barkeshli et al., which potentially realizes chiral parafermion topological order, and (iii) a novel Fibonacci honeycomb model featuring a non-invertible 1-form symmetry.</description>

      <title>Superradiant Interactions of the Cosmic Neutrino Background, Axions, Dark Matter, and Reactor Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we do three things. First, we outline the conditions under which the interaction rate of inelastic processes that change the internal state of a system of $N$ targets scales as $N^2$. This is an effect distinct from coherent elastic scattering, but with the same scaling. Second, we compute example rates for such processes for various weakly interacting particles. Finally, we point to potential quantum observables for these processes that go beyond traditional energy exchange.
  Maximal coherence in inelastic processes is achieved when the targets are placed in an equal superposition of the ground and excited states. These coherent inelastic processes are analogous to Dicke superradiance, and we thus refer to them as superradiant interactions.
  We compute the superradiant interaction rates for the C$\nu$B, dark matter scattering and absorption, and late-universe particles, such as reactor neutrinos, when the two-level system is realized by nuclear or electron spins in a magnetic field. The rates we find can be quite sizable on macroscopic yet small targets. For example, the C$\nu$B interacts with a rate of $\mathcal{O}(\text{Hz})$ when scattering off a 10~cm liquid or solid-state density spin-polarized sphere. For QCD axion dark matter, similar rates can be achieved with much smaller samples, $N \sim \mathcal{O}(10^{15})\left(\frac{m}{2\times 10^{-8}~\text{eV}}\right)^{-1/2}$, where $m$ is the axion mass.
  Using the Lindblad formalism for open quantum systems, we show that these superradiant interactions can manifest as a source of noise on the system. This points to new observables, sensitive to the sum of the excitation and de-excitation rates, and can be viewed as introducing diffusion and decoherence to the system. The effects presented in this paper may point to a new class of ultra-low threshold detectors.</description>

      <title>Out-of-time-order Correlators and Chaos in Quantum Billiards</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine three billiard systems -- the cardioid, diamond (Superman), and Sinai billiards -- all of which are known to be classically chaotic. We compute their classical Lyapunov exponents, and using out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) in the semi-classical regime, we also derive their quantum Lyapunov exponents. We observe that the classical and quantum Lyapunov exponents are in agreement, strengthening the role of OTOCs as a diagnostic for quantum chaos in billiard systems. At very low temperatures, the OTOC of the Sinai billiard shows sharp growth, a phenomenon absent in the other two billiards. We identify the source of this anomalous behaviour in the geometry of the ground state wave function of the Sinai billiard, which is more sensitive to the curvature of the billiard compared to the other billiards. We also remark on the late-time behaviour of the OTOCs and how the scrambling/Ehrenfest time is related to the temperature of quantum billiards.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this thesis, we re-assess some aspects of axionic electrodynamics by coupling non-linear electromagnetic effects to axion physics. We present a number of motivations to justify the coupling of the axion to the photon in terms of a general non-linear extension of the electromagnetic sector. Our emphasis in the paper relies on the investigation of the constitutive permittivity and permeability tensors, for which the axion contribution introduces a dependence on the frequency and wave vector of the propagating radiation. Also, we point out how the axion mass and the axion-photon coupling constant contribute to a dispersive behavior of the electromagnetic waves, in contrast to what happens in the case of non-linear extensions, when effective refractive indices appear which depend only on the direction of the propagation with respect to the external fields. The axion changes this picture by yielding refractive indices with dependence on the wavelength. We apply our results to the special case of the Born-Infeld Electrodynamics and we show that it becomes birefringent whenever the axion is coupled. We also include in our analysis the Lorentz violation phenomenon through a Carroll-Field-Jackiw term, where we investigate the influence of this sector on the dispersion relations, and consequently, on the optical phenomena.</description>

Abstract: The quantum integrable system associated with the $G_2$ exceptional Lie algebra is studied. By using the fusion technique, we obtain the closed recursive relations among the fused transfer matrices. Based on the polynomial analysis, we obtain the exact energy spectrum and the associated Bethe ansatz equations of the system. Both the periodic and the non-diagonal open boundary conditions are studied in a unified way. For the later case, we also obtain the crossing symmetries of the transfer matrix and the fused ones.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main aim of this paper is to simplify and popularise the construction from the 2013 paper by Apostolov, Calderbank, and Gauduchon, which (among other things) derives the Plebanski-Demianski family of solutions of GR using ideas of complex geometry. The starting point of this construction is the observation that the Euclidean versions of these metrics should have two different commuting complex structures, as well as two commuting Killing vector fields. After some linear algebra, this leads to an ansatz for the metrics, which is half-way to their complete determination. Kerr metric is a special 2-parameter subfamily in this class, which makes these considerations directly relevant to Kerr as well. This results in a derivation of the Kerr metric that is self-contained and elementary.</description>

      <title>Edge modes of topologically ordered systems as emergent integrable flows: Robustness of algebraic structures in nonlinear quantum fluid dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In these decades, it has been gradually established that edge modes of a wide class of topologically ordered systems are governed by the bulk-edge correspondence and anyon condensation. The former has been studied many times because it can be summarized as the correspondence between conformal field theory and topological quantum field theory, but the latter has captured attention more recently because it suggests that one can deform the theories from one to another condensable or Witt equivalent. We reinterpret this phenomenon as the appearance of integrable flow at the edges of a topologically ordered system. By revisiting the existing phenomena from this view, one can relate the anyon condensation to the existing formalism of integrable models and their renormalization group flow. Moreover, we observe the robustness of the bulk-edge correspondence even under the existence of irrelevant perturbations at the edges. This formulation can enable one to analyze edge modes at the level of quantum fluid (non-linear) dynamics, or mixed state topological order even in non-Hermitian systems. Moreover, especially in the study of a class of non-Hermitian systems, we show a fundamental necessity to revisit Rogers-Ramanujan type identities as an appearance of the hidden (fractional) supersymmetric model which has a close relation to string field theories. Our view can give a unified paradigm to study edge modes of topologically ordered systems at the level of their dynamics potentially in both Hermitian and non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>A new quantization scheme of black holes in effective loop quantum gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Loop quantum cosmology has achieved great successes, in which the polymerization plays a crucial role. In particular, the phase-space-variable dependent polymerization turns out to be the unique one that leads to consistent quantization of the homogeneous and isotropic universe. However, when applying the same scheme to the quantization of black holes, it meets resistances. In this paper, we continue to study the quantum effects of the polymerization near the location that a classical black hole horizon used to exist, from the point of view of effective loop quantum gravity. In particular, we find a phase-space-variable dependent polymerization scheme that leads to negligible quantum effects near the location of the classical black hole horizon, but significantly alters the spacetime structure near the origin, so that the classical singularity is finally replaced by a finite and regular transition surface. The final geodesically-complete spacetime consists of a regular transition surface that connects a black hole in one side and an anti-trapped region in the other side. In the anti-trapped region, no white hole horizons are found and the spacetime is extended to infinity, at which the geometric radius of the two-spheres becomes infinitely large.</description>

Abstract: Following the work of H. Ellis, we study warp drives in the gravitational field of a Schwarzschild black hole. We find that as long as the warp drive crosses the black hole horizon at a subluminal speed, the horizon would be effectively absent inside the warp bubble. Moreover, we discover that the black hole's gravitational field can alleviate the violations of the weak energy condition (WEC) and the null energy condition (NEC) and therefore decrease the amount of negative energy required to sustain a warp drive, which may be instrumental for creating microscopic warp drives in lab experiments. We also consider the thermodynamics of a warp bubble interacting with a black hole and point out some paradoxes that may indicate a gap in our understanding of them from the thermodynamic point of view.</description>

      <title>Diffusive hydrodynamics from long-range correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the hydrodynamic theory, the non-equilibrium dynamics of a many-body system is approximated, at large scales of space and time, by irreversible relaxation to local entropy maximisation. This results in a convective equation corrected by viscous or diffusive terms in a gradient expansion, such as the Navier-Stokes equations. Diffusive terms are evaluated using the Kubo formula, and possibly arising from an emergent noise due to discarded microscopic degrees of freedom. In one dimension of space, diffusive scaling is often broken as noise leads to super-diffusion. But in linearly degenerate hydrodynamics, such as that of integrable models, diffusive behaviors are observed, and it has long be thought that the standard diffusive picture remains valid. In this letter, we show that in such systems, the Navier-Stokes equation breaks down beyond linear response. We demonstrate that diffusive-order corrections do not take the form of a gradient expansion. Instead, they are completely determined by ballistic transport of initial-state fluctuations, and obtained from the non-local two-point correlations recently predicted by the ballistic macroscopic fluctuation theory (BMFT); the resulting hydrodynamic equations are reversible. To do so, we establish a regularised fluctuation theory, putting on a firm basis the recent idea that ballistic transport of initial-state fluctuations determines fluctuations and correlations beyond the Euler scale. This extends the idea of "diffusion from convection" previously developed to explain the Kubo formula in integrable systems, to generic non-equilibrium settings.</description>

Abstract: We consider $N$ two-dimensional Ising models coupled in presence of quenched disorder and use scale invariant scattering theory to exactly show the presence of a line of renormalization group fixed points for any fixed value of $N$ other than 1. We show how this result relates to perturbative studies and sheds light on numerical simulations. We also observe that the limit $N\to 1$ may be of interest for the Ising spin glass, and point out potential relevance for nonuniversality in other contexts of random criticality.</description>

      <title>Spectra of fermions produced by a time-dependent axion in the radiation- and matter-dominated Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axion-like degrees of freedom generally interact with fermions through a shift symmetric coupling. As a consequence, a time-dependent axion will lead to the generation of fermions by amplifying their vacuum fluctuations. We provide the formulae that allow one to determine the spectra of produced fermions in a generic Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker Universe with flat spatial slices. Then we derive simple approximate formulae for the spectra of the produced fermions, as a function of the model parameters, in the specific cases of a radiation- and a matter-dominated Universe, in the regime in which the backreaction of the produced fermions on the axionic background can be neglected.</description>

      <title>On the interactions and equilibrium between Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the interactions and the conditions for the equilibrium of forces between generic non-rotating black holes of the Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton (EMD) theory. We study known (and some new) solutions of the time-symmetric initial-data problem escribing an arbitrary number of those black holes, some of them with primary scalar hair. We show how one can distinguish between initial data corresponding to dynamical situations in which the black holes (one or many) are not in equilibrium and initial data which are just constant-time slices of a static solution of the full equations of motion describing static black holes using (self-)interaction energies. For a single black hole, non-vanishing self-interaction energy is always related to primary scalar hair and to a dynamical black hole. Removing the self-interaction energies in multi-center solutions we get interaction energies related to the attractive and repulsive forces acting on the black holes. As shown by Brill and Lindquist, for widely separated black holes, these take the standard Newtonian and Coulombian forms plus an additional interaction term associated with the scalar charges which is attractive for like charges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07440v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tunneling processes in de Sitter spacetime are studied by using the stochastic approach. We exploit the Martin-Siggia-Rose-Janssen-de Dominicis (MSRJD) functional integral to obtain the tunneling rate. The applicability conditions of this method are clarified using the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism. In the case of a shallow potential barrier, we reproduce the Hawking-Moss (HM) tunneling rate. Remarkably, in contrast to HM picture, the configuration derived from the MSRJD functional integral satisfies physically natural boundary conditions. We also discuss the case of a steep potential barrier and find an interesting Coleman-de Luccia (CDL) bubble-like configuration. Our results demonstrate how the bubble nucleation process could be described in the stochastic approach. Our method turns out to be useful for investigating various tunneling processes during inflation.</description>

      <title>Surgery and Matter for 3d Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We try to give a geometric construction for 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ gauge theories using three-manifolds and Dehn surgeries. We follow the story that wrapping M5-branes on plumbing three-manifolds leads to 3d theories with mixed Chern-Simons levels. This construction can be decorated by adding non-compact Lagrangian submanifolds in the cotangent bundles of three-manifolds. The M5-branes wrapping on these submanifolds through M-theory/IIB string duality lead to flavor D5-branes that engineer chiral multiplets. In this note, we only consider unknotted matter circles, which are intersections between these non-compact M5-branes and plumbing manifolds. Then various dualities of 3d theories can be interpreted as Kirby moves and equivalent surgeries. We also find the dictionary between geometric structures of three-manifolds and physical aspects of gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Chaotic and Thermal Aspects in the Highly Excited String S-Matrix</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02127v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute tree level scattering amplitudes involving more than one highly excited states and tachyons in bosonic string theory. We use these amplitudes to understand chaotic and thermal aspects of the excited string states lending support to the Susskind-Horowitz-Polchinski correspondence principle. The unaveraged amplitudes exhibit chaos in the resonance distribution as a function of kinematic parameters, which can be described by random matrix theory. Upon coarse-graining these amplitudes are shown to exponentiate, and capture various thermal features, including features of a stringy version of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis as well as notions of typicality. Further, we compute the effective string form factor corresponding to the highly excited states, and argue for the random walk behaviour of the long strings.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the spatially inhomogeneous condensates in the $(1 + 1)$-dimensional chiral Gross-Neveu model via the bosonic two-point function in the infinite-$N$ limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work shows that the known phase boundary between the phase with chiral symmetry and the phase of spatially inhomogeneous chiral symmetry breaking in the phase diagram of the $(1 + 1)$-dimensional chiral Gross-Neveu model can be detected from the bosonic two-point function alone and thereby confirms and extends previous results arXiv:hep-th/0008175, arXiv:0807.2571, arXiv:0909.3714, arXiv:1810.03921, arXiv:2203.08503. The analysis is referred to as the stability analysis of the symmetric phase and does not require knowledge about spatial modulations of condensates. We perform this analysis in the infinite-$N$ limit at nonzero temperature and nonzero quark and chiral chemical potentials also inside the inhomogeneous phase. Thereby we observe an interesting relation between the bosonic $1$-particle irreducible two-point vertex function of the chiral Gross-Neveu model and the spinodal line of the Gross-Neveu model.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Production of Completely Dark Photons with Nonminimal Couplings to Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dark photons are a theorized massive spin-1 particle which can be produced via various mechanisms, including cosmological gravitational particle production (GPP) in the early universe. In this work, we extend previous results for GPP of dark photons to include nonminimal couplings to gravity. We find that nonminimal couplings can induce a ghost instability or lead to runaway particle production at high momentum and discuss the constraints on the parameter space such that the theory is free of instabilities. Within the instability-free regime we numerically calculate the particle production and find that the inclusion of nonminimal couplings can lead to an enhancement of the particle number. As a result, GPP of nonminimally coupled dark photons can open the parameter space for production of a cosmological relevant relic density (constituting all or part of the dark matter) as compared to the minimally-coupled theory. These results are independent of the choice of inflation model, which we demonstrate by repeating the analysis for a class of rapid-turn multi-field inflation models.</description>

Abstract: By simply applying the Local Potential Approximation (LPA) on the Polchinski's Exact Renormalization Group (ERG) flow equation for single Bosonic and spinless Fermionic fields, and initially considering only the coarse-graining (blocking) aspect of Wilson's Renormalization Group program. Within the LPA limit the Polchinski's ERG flow equation simplifies into a heat differential equation for both Bosonic and Fermionic fields. Solving the differential equations leads to logarithmic interactions (logarithmic vertex function) in both Bosonic and Fermionic fields at their fixed points.</description>

Abstract: We construct the elliptic Miura transformation and use it to obtain the expression of the currents of elliptic corner VOA. We subsequently prove a novel combinatorial formula that is essential for deriving the quadratic relations of the currents. In addition, we give a conjecture that relates the correlation function of the currents of elliptic corner VOA to a certain family of partially symmetric polynomials. The elliptic Macdonald polynomials, constructed recently by Awata-Kanno-Mironov-Morozov-Zenkevich, and Fukuda-Ohkubo-Shiraishi, can be obtained as a particular case of this family.</description>

      <title>Do holographic CFT states have unique semiclassical bulk duals?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss a situation where a holographic CFT state has multiple semiclassical bulk duals. In our example, a given holographic state has two simple, semiclassical descriptions, one with a closed universe, constructed using the gravitational path integral, and one without a closed universe, constructed using the extrapolate dictionary. This highlights an ambiguity in the AdS/CFT dictionary. We propose various options for resolving this tension although none are perfectly satisfactory. We also discuss what this implies for the black hole interior and the gravitational path integral.</description>

      <title>Atom-Field-Medium Interactions I: Graded Influence Actions for $N$ Harmonic Atoms in a Dielectric-Altered Quantum Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03580v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This series of papers has two broader aims: 1) Construct a theory for multi-partite open quantum systems comprising several layers of structure with self-consistent back-actions. Develop the graded influence action formalism \cite{BehHu10,BH11} to account for the influences of successive sub-layers on the dynamics of the variables of interest. 2) Apply these methods to the study of atom-field-medium interactions and highlight their merits over conventional methods. We consider a system of $N$ harmonic oscillators, modeling the internal degrees of freedom (idf) of $N$ neutral atoms (A), interacting with a quantum field (F), scalar here, for simplicity, altered by the presence of a dielectric medium (M). In this paper we use the coarse-grained and stochastic effective actions in the influence functional formalism to derive the stochastic equations for the reduced density matrices of the dynamical variables in the successive layers of structure. The word `graded' refers to the specific ordering of the coarse-graining procedures. Three layers of coarse-graining are performed, firstly, integrating over the common bath of the dielectric oscillators results not only in the appearance of necessary dissipative properties of the dielectric but also essential nuanced features such as nonMarkovian spatial correlations in the dielectric. Secondly, integrating over the medium variables as a whole results in a dielectric-modified quantum field, the influence of the medium on the quantum field manifesting through a frequency-dependent permittivity function. Finally, integrating over this dielectric-altered quantum field which interacts with the idfs of the atoms yields an influence action. From it we obtain the stochastic equation of motion which describes the nonequilibrium stochastic dynamics of the idf of the atoms interacting with a dielectric medium-modified quantum field.</description>

      <title>Modelling the Accelerating Universe with $f(Q)$ Gravity: Observational Consistency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.01985v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a cosmological model within the framework of symmetric teleparallel gravity, focusing on $f(Q)$ gravity, where $Q$ represents the non-metricity scalar. Utilizing cosmological datasets, we derive an accelerating cosmological model by constraining its free parameters. To achieve this, we determine the parametric form of the Hubble parameter using a well-motivated $f(Q)$ function. Remarkably, all obtained values fall within the range suggested by cosmological observations. By employing the best-fit parameters, we calculate the present geometrical parameters and demonstrate the accelerating behaviour of the Universe. Furthermore, we thoroughly examine the evolutionary behaviours of the Universe, noting that our model converges to the $\Lambda$CDM model at late times. Finally, we investigate the energy conditions and find a violation of the strong energy condition, which could provide a valuable understanding of the nature of dark energy.</description>

      <title>Cosmology in $R^2$-gravity: Effects of a Higher Derivative Scalar Condensate Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.03803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A well known extension of Einstein General Relativity is the addition of an $R^2$-term, which is free of ghost excitations and in the linearized framework, reduces Einstein General Relativity and an additional higher derivative scalar. According to \cite{Chakraborty:2020ktp}, the above scalar sector can sustain a Time Crystal-like minimum energy state, with non-trivial time dependence. Exploiting previous result that the scalar can sustain modes with periodic time dependence in its lowest energy, we consider this condensate as a source and study the Friedmann-Lema\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) cosmology in this background. The effect of the $R^2$-term is interpreted as a back reaction. A remarkable consequence of the condensate is that, irrespective of open or close geometry of the Universe, for an appropriate choice of parameter window, the condensate can induce a decelerating phase before the accelerated expansion starts and again, in some cases, it can help to avoid the singularity in the deceleration parameter (that is present in conventional FLRW Cosmology).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09555v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The low-energy subspace of a conformal field theory (CFT) can serve as a quantum error correcting code, with important consequences in holography and quantum gravity. We consider generic 1+1D CFT codes under extensive local dephasing channels and analyze their error correctability in the thermodynamic limit. We show that (i) there is a finite decoding threshold if and only if the minimal nonzero scaling dimension in the fusion algebra generated by the jump operator of the channel is larger than $1/2$ and (ii) the number of protected logical qubits $k \geq \Omega( \log \log n)$, where $n$ is the number of physical qubits. As an application, we show that the one-dimensional quantum critical Ising model has a finite threshold for certain types of dephasing noise. Our general results also imply that a CFT code with continuous symmetry saturates a bound on the recovery fidelity for covariant codes.</description>

      <title>Lectures on the quantum phase transitions of metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15919v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum phase transitions of metals involve changes in the Fermi surface, and can be divided into three categories. The first two categories involve symmetry breaking, and lead to a deformation or reconstruction of the Fermi surface. The third category involves a change in the volume enclosed by the Fermi surface without any symmetry breaking: one phase is a Fermi liquid (FL) with the conventional Luttinger volume, while the other phase is a `fractionalized Fermi liquid' (FL*), which has a non-Luttinger volume Fermi surface accompanied by a spin liquid with fractionalized excitations. It is a relatively simple matter to obtain a FL*-FL transition in Kondo lattice models. However, the FL*-FL transition can also be present in single-band Hubbard-like models: this is efficiently described by the `ancilla' method, which shows that the transition is a `flipped' Kondo lattice transition. This single-band FL*-FL transition is argued to apply to the metallic states of the hole-doped cuprates. In the clean limit, the critical properties of the quantum transitions in the three categories are distinct, but all lead to perfect metal transport in the quantum-critical regime. Impurity-induced `Harris disorder', with spatial fluctuations in the local position of the quantum critical point, is a relevant perturbation to the clean critical points. In the presence of Harris disorder, all three categories exhibit strange metal behavior, which can be described by a universal two-dimensional Yukawa-Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model.</description>
