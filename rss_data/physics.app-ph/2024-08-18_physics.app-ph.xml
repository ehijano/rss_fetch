      <title>Formation of a lateral p-n junction light-emitting diode on an n-type high-mobility GaAs/Al$_{0.33}$Ga$_{0.67}$As heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have fabricated a device which includes two lateral p-n junctions on an n-type GaAs/Al$_{0.33}$Ga$_{0.67}$As heterostructure. A section of the n-type material has been converted to p-type by removing dopants and applying a voltage to a gate placed in this region. Controlled electroluminescence from both of the p-n junctions has been demonstrated by varying the applied bias voltages. An emission peak with a width of ~8 nm is observed around 812 nm. The electroluminescence seen from both junctions is considered to originate from the GaAs quantum well layer in the device. The lithographic techniques that we have developed are compatible for further integration of gated quantum devices such as single-electron pumps to build on-demand single-photon sources.</description>

      <title>Phononic materials with effectively scale-separated hierarchical features using interpretable machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Manipulating the dispersive characteristics of vibrational waves is beneficial for many applications, e.g., high-precision instruments. architected hierarchical phononic materials have sparked promise tunability of elastodynamic waves and vibrations over multiple frequency ranges. In this article, hierarchical unit-cells are obtained, where features at each length scale result in a band gap within a targeted frequency range. Our novel approach, the ``hierarchical unit-cell template method,'' is an interpretable machine-learning approach that uncovers global unit-cell shape/topology patterns corresponding to predefined band-gap objectives. A scale-separation effect is observed where the coarse-scale band-gap objective is mostly unaffected by the fine-scale features despite the closeness of their length scales, thus enabling an efficient hierarchical algorithm. Moreover, the hierarchical patterns revealed are not predefined or self-similar hierarchies as common in current hierarchical phononic materials. Thus, our approach offers a flexible and efficient method for the exploration of new regions in the hierarchical design space, extracting minimal effective patterns for inverse design in applications targeting multiple frequency ranges.</description>

      <title>AlGaAs/GeSn p-i-n diode interfaced with ultrathin Al$_2$O$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents the fabrication and characterizations of an Al$_{0.3}$Ga$_{0.7}$As/Ge$_{0.87}$Sn$_{0.13}$/GeSn p-i-n double heterostructure (DHS) diode following the grafting approach for enhanced optoelectronic applications. By integrating ultra-thin Al$_2$O$_3$ as a quantum tunneling layer and enhancing interfacial double-side passivation, we achieved a heterostructure with a substantial 1.186 eV conduction band barrier between AlGaAs and GeSn, along with a low interfacial density of states. The diode demonstrated impressive electrical characteristics with high uniformity, including a mean ideality factor of 1.47 and a mean rectification ratio of 2.95E103 at +/-2 V across 326 devices, indicating high-quality device fabrication. Comprehensive electrical characterizations, including C-V and I-V profiling, affirm the diode's capability to provide robust electrical confinement and efficient carrier injection. These properties make the Al$_{0.3}$Ga$_{0.7}$As/Ge$_{0.87}$Sn$_{0.13}$/GeSn DHS a promising candidate for next-generation electrically pumped GeSn lasers, potentially operable at higher temperatures. Our results provide a viable pathway for further advancements in various GeSn-based devices.</description>

      <title>Multifunctional Bistable Ultrathin Composite Booms with Flexible Electronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small satellites such as CubeSats pose demanding requirements on the weight, size, and multifunctionality of their structures due to extreme constraints on the payload mass and volume. To address this challenge, we introduce a concept of multifunctional deployable space structures for CubeSats based on ultrathin, elastically foldable, and self-deployable bistable composite structures integrated with flexible electronics. The multifunctional bistable booms can be stored in a coiled configuration and self-deploy into a long structure upon initiation by releasing the stored strain energy. The boom demonstrates the capabilities of delivering power and transmitting data from the CubeSat to the flexible devices on the boom tip. The boom also shows the ability to monitor the dynamics and vibration during and after the deployment. A payload boom has been installed in a 3U CubeSat as flight hardware for in-space testing and demonstration. This effort combines morphable ultrathin composite structures with flexible electronics.</description>

      <title>Leaky-Integrate-Fire Neuron via Synthetic Antiferromagnetic Coupling and Spin-Orbit Torque</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuromorphic computing (NC) is a promising candidate for artificial intelligence applications. To realize NC, electronic analogues of brain components, such as synapses and neurons, must be designed. In spintronics, domain wall (DW) based magnetic tunnel junctions - which offer both synaptic and neuronal functionalities - are one of the promising candidates. An electronic neuron should exhibit leaky-integrate-fire functions similar to their biological counterparts. However, most experimental studies focused only on the integrate-and-fire functions, overlooking the leaky function. Here, we report on a domain wall neuron device that achieves integration using spin-orbit torque-induced domain wall motion and a leaky function via synthetic antiferromagnetic coupling. By fabricating Hall bar devices in a special geometry, we could achieve these two functionalities. During the leaky process, the maximum DW velocity achieved was 2500 {\mu}m/s. The proposed design utilizes materials used in STT-MRAM fabrication and is compatible with CMOS fabrication. Therefore, this neuron can be readily integrated into NC.</description>

      <title>Accurate wave velocity measurement from diffuse wave fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Directional wave speeds variations in anisotropic elastic solids enables material characterisation capabilities, such as determination of elastic constants and volumetric measurement of crystallographic texture. However, achieving such measurements is challenging especially on samples with complex geometries. Here we propose the use of Green's Function reconstruction from diffuse ultrasonic wave fields for accurate velocity measurements on components with arbitrary geometries. Strategies for accurate reconstruction, including averaging over an increased number of different source locations, using longer window lengths of diffuse fields, and accurately deconvolving a source-dependent factor, were implemented to achieve satisfactory convergence towards Green's Function. Additionally, low signal intensity challenges from laser interferometers were overcome to enable non-contact measurement of the wave speeds, by making use of simultaneous excitation of sources to increase signal-to-noise ratio and signal normalisation to account for energy dissipation of diffuse fields. With successful demonstration using both phased array and laser receivers, this advancement fundamentally broadens acoustic wave velocity measurement capabilities to a wider range of environments and holds promise for future material characterisation of complex-shaped components.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Gas Sensor Performance Using Bilayer Surface Plasmon System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sensitivity of a gold-silver bilayer system for gas detection was investigated using angle-fixed reflectance measurements and numerical calculations based on the transfer-matrix method. Two configurations of bilayer systems were analyzed: gold on silver and silver on gold. According to calculations, the best sensitivity values were achieved with a total thickness of approximately 55 nm for the gold on silver system and approximately 65 nm for the silver on gold system. These calculations were supported by experimental results in a Kretschmann configuration for ethanol gas sensing. The bilayer systems showed a huge advantage compared to the widely used single gold thin film, however, special attention should be paid to the silver on gold configuration, as corrosion plays an important role in decreasing sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Spin Hall Nano-Antenna</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spin Hall effect is a celebrated phenomenon in spintronics and magnetism that has found numerous applications in digital electronics (memory and logic), but very few in analog electronics. Practically, the only analog application in widespread use is the spin Hall nano-oscillator (SHNO) that delivers a high frequency alternating current or voltage to a load. Here, we report its analogue - a spin Hall nano-antenna (SHNA) that radiates a high frequency electromagnetic wave (alternating electric/magnetic fields) into the surrounding medium. It can also radiate an acoustic wave in an underlying substrate if the nanomagnets are made of a magnetostrictive material. That makes it a dual electromagnetic/acoustic antenna. The SHNA is made of an array of ledged magnetostrictive nanomagnets deposited on a substrate, with a heavy metal nanostrip underlying/overlying the ledges. An alternating charge current passed through the nanostrip generates an alternating spin-orbit torque in the nanomagnets via the spin Hall effect which makes their magnetizations oscillate in time with the frequency of the current, producing confined spin waves (magnons), which radiate electromagnetic waves (photons) in space with the same frequency as the ac current. Despite being much smaller than the radiated wavelength, the SHNA surprisingly does not act as a point source which would radiate isotropically. Instead, there is clear directionality (anisotropy) in the radiation pattern, which is frequency-dependent. This is due to the (frequency-dependent) intrinsic anisotropy in the confined spin wave patterns generated within the nanomagnets, which effectively endows the "point source" with internal anisotropy.</description>

      <title>A topological Hund nodal line antiferromagnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay of topology, magnetism, and correlations gives rise to intriguing phases of matter. In this study, through state-of-the-art angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, density functional theory and dynamical mean-field theory calculations, we visualize a fourfold degenerate Dirac nodal line at the boundary of the bulk Brillouin zone in the antiferromagnet YMn2Ge2. We further demonstrate that this gapless, antiferromagnetic Dirac nodal line is enforced by the combination of magnetism, space-time inversion symmetry and nonsymmorphic lattice symmetry. The corresponding drumhead surface states traverse the whole surface Brillouin zone. YMn2Ge2 thus serves as a platform to exhibit the interplay of multiple degenerate nodal physics and antiferromagnetism. Interestingly, the magnetic nodal line displays a d-orbital dependent renormalization along its trajectory in momentum space, thereby manifesting Hund coupling. Our findings offer insights into the effect of electronic correlations on magnetic Dirac nodal lines, leading to an antiferromagnetic Hund nodal line.</description>

      <title>Fundamental scaling laws of water window X-rays from free electron-driven van der Waals structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Water-window X-rays are crucial in medical and biological applications, enabling natural contrast imaging of biological cells in their near-native states without external staining. However, water-window X-ray sources whose output photon energy can be arbitrarily specified - a crucial feature in many high-contrast imaging applications - are still challenging to obtain except at large synchrotron facilities. Here, we present a solution to this challenge by demonstrating table-top, water-window X-ray generation from free electron-driven van der Waals materials, resulting in output photon energies that can be continuously tuned across the entire water window regime. In addition, we present a truly predictive theoretical framework that combines first-principles electromagnetism with Monte Carlo simulations to accurately predict the photon flux and brightness in absolute numbers. Using this framework, we theoretically obtain fundamental scaling laws for the tunable photon flux, showing good agreement with experimental results and providing a path to the design of powerful emitters based on free electron-driven quantum materials. We show that we can achieve photon fluxes needed for imaging and spectroscopy applications (over 1E8 photons per second on sample) where compactness is important, and the ultrahigh fluxes of synchrotron sources are not needed. Importantly, our theory highlights the critical role played by the large mean free paths and interlayer atomic spacings unique to van der Waals structures, showing the latter's advantages over other materials in generating water window X-rays. Our results should pave the way to advanced techniques and new modalities in water-window X-ray generation and high-resolution biological imaging.</description>

      <title>Alternating Bias Assisted Annealing of Amorphous Oxide Tunnel Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07415v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate a transformational technique for controllably tuning the electrical properties of fabricated thermally oxidized amorphous aluminum-oxide tunnel junctions. Using conventional test equipment to apply an alternating bias to a heated tunnel barrier, giant increases in the room temperature resistance, greater than 70%, can be achieved. The rate of resistance change is shown to be strongly temperature-dependent, and is independent of junction size in the sub-micron regime. In order to measure their tunneling properties at mK temperatures, we characterized transmon qubit junctions treated with this alternating-bias assisted annealing (ABAA) technique. The measured frequencies follow the Ambegaokar-Baratoff relation between the shifted resistance and critical current. Further, these studies show a reduction of junction-contributed loss on the order of $\approx 2 \times10^{-6}$, along with a significant reduction in resonant- and off-resonant-two level system defects when compared to untreated samples. Imaging with high-resolution TEM shows that the barrier is still predominantly amorphous with a more uniform distribution of aluminum coordination across the barrier relative to untreated junctions. This new approach is expected to be widely applicable to a broad range of devices that rely on amorphous aluminum oxide, as well as the many other metal-insulator-metal structures used in modern electronics.</description>

      <title>Microscale Fiber-Integrated Vector Magnetometer with On-Tip Field Biasing using NV Ensembles in Diamond Microcystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In quantum sensing of magnetic fields, ensembles of nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond offer high sensitivity, high bandwidth and outstanding spatial resolution while operating in harsh environments. Moreover, the orientation of defect centers along four crystal axes forms an intrinsic coordinate system, enabling vector magnetometry within a single diamond crystal. While most vector magnetometers rely on a known bias magnetic field for full recovery of three-dimensional field information, employing external 3D Helmholtz coils or permanent magnets results in bulky, laboratory-bound setups, impeding miniaturization of the device. Here, a novel approach is presented that utilizes a fiber-integrated microscale coil at the fiber tip to generate a localized uniaxial magnetic field. The same fiber-tip coil is used in parallel for spin control by combining DC and microwave signals in a bias tee. To implement vector magnetometry using a uniaxial bias field, we preselect the orientation of the diamond crystal and then fully characterize it by rotating a static magnetic field in three planes of rotation. We demonstrate the measurement of vector magnetic fields in the full solid angle with a shot-noise limited sensitivity of $19.4\:\textrm{nT/Hz}^{1/2}$ and microscale spatial resolution while achieving a cross section of the fiber sensor head below $1\:\textrm{mm}^2.$</description>

      <title>Ultra-fast Digital DPC Yielding High Spatio-Temporal Resolution for Low-Dose Phase Characterisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the scanning transmission electron microscope, both phase imaging of beam-sensitive materials and characterisation of a material's functional properties using in-situ experiments are becoming more widely available. As the practicable scan speed of 4D-STEM detectors improves, so too does the temporal resolution achievable for both differential phase contrast (DPC) and ptychography. However, the read-out burden of pixelated detectors, and the size of the gigabyte to terabyte sized data sets, remain a challenge for both temporal resolution and their practical adoption. In this work, we show that a high-fidelity DPC phase reconstruction can be achieved from both annular segmented detectors or pixelated arrays with relatively few elements using signal digitisation. Unlike conventional analog data, even at the fastest scan speeds, phase reconstructions from digitised DPC-segment images yield reliable data. Finally, dose fractionation by fast scanning and multi-framing allows for post-process binning of frame streams to balance signal-to-noise ratio and temporal resolution for low-dose phase imaging for in-situ experiments.</description>
