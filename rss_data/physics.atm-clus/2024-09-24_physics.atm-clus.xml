      <title>Smallest [5,6]fullerene as building blocks for 2D networks with superior stability and enhanced photocatalytic performance</title>

Abstract: The assembly of molecules with covalent networks can form varied lattice structures with distinct physical and chemical properties from conventional atomic lattices. Using the smallest stable [5,6]fullerene units as building blocks, various 2D C$_{24}$ networks can be formed with superior stability and strength compared to the recently synthesised monolayer polymeric C$_{60}$. Monolayer C$_{24}$ harnesses the properties of both carbon crystals and fullerene molecules, such as stable chemical bonds, suitable band gaps and large surface area, facilitating photocatalytic water splitting. The electronic band gaps of C$_{24}$ are comparable to TiO$_2$, providing appropriate band edges with sufficient external potential for overall water splitting over the acidic and neutral pH range. Upon photoexcitation, strong solar absorption enabled by strongly bound bright excitons can generate carriers effectively, while the type-II band alignment between C$_{24}$ and other 2D monolayers can separate electrons and holes in individual layers simultaneously. Additionally, the number of surface active sites of C$_{24}$ monolayers are three times more than that of their C$_{60}$ counterparts in a much wider pH range, providing spontaneous reaction pathways for hydrogen evolution reaction. Our work provides insights into materials design using tunable building blocks of fullerene units with tailored functions for energy generation, conversion and storage.</description>

      <title>Strong-field effects in the photo-induced dissociation of the hydrogen molecule on a silver nanoshell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03850v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Plasmonic catalysis is a rapidly growing field of research, both from experimental and computational perspectives. Experimental observations demonstrate an enhanced dissociation rate for molecules in the presence of plasmonic nanoparticles under low-intensity visible light. The hot-carrier transfer from the nanoparticle to the molecule is often claimed as the mechanism for dissociation. However, the charge transfer time scale is on the order of few femtoseconds and cannot be resolved experimentally. In this situation, ab initio non-adiabatic calculations can provide a solution. Such simulations, however, have their own limitations related to the computational cost. To accelerate plasmonic catalysis simulations, many researchers resort to applying high-intensity external fields to nanoparticle-molecule systems. Here, we show why such an approach can be problematic and emphasize the importance of considering strong-field effects when interpreting the results of time-dependent density functional theory simulations of plasmonic catalysis. By studying the hydrogen molecule dissociation on the surface of a silver nanoshell and analyzing the electron transfer at different field frequencies and high intensities, we demonstrate that the molecule dissociates due to multiphoton absorption and subsequent ionization.</description>
