      <title>Covering the set of $p$-elements in finite groups by Sylow $p$-subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G_p$ be the set of $p$-elements of a finite group $G$. Do we need all the Sylow $p$-subgroups of $G$ to cover $G_p$? Although this question does not have an affirmative answer in general, our work indicates that the answer is yes more often than one could perhaps expect.</description>

      <title>On the existence of weakly malnormal quasiconvex subgroups of hyperbolic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this short note, we prove the existence of weakly malnormal, virtually free, quasiconvex subgroups in any nonelementary hyperbolic group. This extends a result of Ilya Kapovich, where he proved the existence of malnormal quasiconvex subgroups in torsion-free hyperbolic groups.</description>

      <title>An Application of Maximality to Nilpotent and Finitely Generated L-Subgroups of an L-Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is a continuation of the study on maximal and Frattini L-subgroups of an L-group. The normality of the maximal L-subgroups of a nilpotent L-group is explored. Then, the concept of finitely generated L-subgroup is introduced and its relation with maximal condition on L-subgroups is established. Thereafter, several results pertaining to the notions of Frattini L-subgroup and finitely generated L-subgroups have been investigated.</description>

      <title>Homology and cohomology of crossed products by inverse monoid actions and Steinberg algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a unital action $\theta $ of an inverse monoid $S$ on an algebra $A$ over a filed $K$ we produce (co)homology spectral sequences which converge to the Hochschild (co)homology of the crossed product $A\rtimes_\theta S$ with values in a bimodule over $A\rtimes_\theta S$. The spectral sequences involve a new kind of (co)homology of the inverse monoid $S,$ which is based on $KS$-modules. The spectral sequences take especially nice form, when $(A\rtimes_\theta S)^e $ is flat as a left (homology case) or right (cohomology case) $A^e$-module, involving also the Hochschild (co)homology of $A.$ Same nice spectral sequences are also obtained if $K$ is a commutative ring, over which $A$ is projective, and $S$ is $E$-unitary. We apply our results to the Steinberg algebra $A_K(\mathscr{G})$ over a field $K$ of an ample groupoid $\mathscr{G},$ whose unit space $\mathscr{G} ^{(0)}$ is compact. In the homology case our spectral sequence collapses on the $p$-axis, resulting in an isomorphism between the Hochschild homology of $A_K(\mathscr{G})$ with values in an $A_K(\mathscr{G})$-bimodule $M$ and the homology of the inverse semigroup of the compact open bisections of $\mathscr{G}$ with values in the invariant submodule of $M.$</description>

      <title>(Non-)Recognizing Spaces for Stable Subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15187v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we consider the notion of what we call recognizing spaces for stable subgroups of a given group. When a group $G$ is a mapping class group or right-angled Artin group, it is known that a subgroup is stable exactly when the largest acylindrical action $G \curvearrowright X$ provides a quasi-isometric embedding of the subgroup into $X$ via the orbit map. In this sense the largest acylindrical action for mapping class groups and right-angled Artin groups provides a recognizing space for all stable subgroups. In contrast, we construct an acylindrically hyperbolic group (relatively hyperbolic, in fact) whose largest acylindrical action does not recognize all stable subgroups.</description>

      <title>Subgroups of word hyperbolic groups in dimension 2 over arbitrary rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19866v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1996, Gersten proved that finitely presented subgroups of a word hyperbolic group of integral cohomological dimension 2 are hyperbolic. We use isoperimetric inequalities over arbitrary rings to extend this result to any ring. In particular, we study the discrete isoperimetric function and show that its linearity is equivalent to hyperbolicity, which is also equivalent to it being subquadratic. We further use these ideas to obtain conditions for subgroups of higher rank hyperbolic groups to be again higher rank hyperbolic of the same rank. The appendix discusses the equivalence between isoperimetric inequalities and coning inequalities in the simplicial setting and the general setting, leading to combinatorial definitions of higher rank hyperbolicity in the setting of simplicial complexes and allowing us to give elementary definitions of higher rank hyperbolic groups.</description>

      <title>Acylindrical hyperbolicity and the centers of Artin groups that are not free of infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09432v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Charney and Morris-Wright showed acylindrical hyperbolicity of Artin groups of infinite type associated with graphs that are not joins, by studying clique-cube complexes and the actions on them. The authors developed their study and clarified when acylindrical hyperbolicity holds for Artin groups of infinite type associated with graphs that are not cones. In this paper, we introduce reduced clique-cube complexes. By using them, we show acylindrical hyperbolicity of irreducible Artin groups associated with graphs that are not cliques, that is, irreducible Artin groups that are not free of infinity. Such Artin groups contain infinite type Artin groups of type FC. As an application, we see that the centers of such Artin groups are finite, and that actually they are trivial in many cases.</description>

      <title>Groups of $\mathrm{I}_G$-type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we address a question posed by Dehornoy et al. in the book "Foundations of Garside Theory" that asks for a theory of groups of $\mathrm{I}_G$-type when $G$ is a Garside group. In this article, we introduce a broader notion than the one suggested by Dehornoy et al.: given a left-ordered group $G$, we define a group of $\mathrm{I}_G$-type as a left-ordered group whose partial order is isomorphic to those of $G$. Furthermore, we develop methods to give a characterization of groups of $\mathrm{I}_{\Gamma}$-type in terms of skew braces when $\Gamma$ is an Artin-Tits group of spherical type and classify all groups of $\mathrm{I}_{\Gamma}$-type where $\Gamma$ is an irreducible spherical Artin-Tits group, therefore providing an answer to another question of Dehornoy et al. concerning $\mathrm{I}_{B_n}$ structures where $B_n$ is the braid group on $n$ strands with its canonical Garside structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a fixed-point theorem for the face maps that consist in deleting the $i$th entry of an ordered set. Furthermore, we show that there exists random finite sets of integers that are almost invariant under such deletions. Consequences for various monoids of order-preserving transformations of $\mathbf{N}$ are discussed in an appendix.</description>

Abstract: We prove sign-alternation of the product structure constants in the basis dual to the basis consisting of the structure sheaves of Schubert varieties in the torus-equivariant Grothendieck group of coherent sheaves on the partial flag varieties $G/P$ associated to an arbitrary symmetrizable Kac-Moody group $G$, where $P$ is any parabolic subgroup of finite type. This extends the previous work of Kumar from $G/B$ to $G/P$. When $G$ is of finite type, i.e., it is a semisimple group, then it was proved by Anderson-Griffeth-Miller.</description>

      <title>Almost unimodular groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that a locally compact group has open unimodular part if and only if the Plancherel weight on its group von Neumann algebra is almost periodic. We call such groups almost unimodular. The almost periodicity of the Plancherel weight allows one to define a Murray-von Neumann dimension for certain Hilbert space modules over the group von Neumann algebra, and we show that for finite covolume subgroups this dimension scales according to the covolume. Using this we obtain a generalization of the Atiyah-Schmid formula in the setting of second countable almost unimodular groups with finite covolume subgroups. Additionally, for the class of almost unimodular groups we present many examples, establish a number of permanence properties, and show that the formal degrees of irreducible and factorial square integrable representations are well behaved.</description>

      <title>Endocabling of involutive solutions to the Yang-Baxter equation, with an application to solutions whose diagonal is a cyclic permutation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14339v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce endocabling as a technique to deform involutive, non-degenerate set-theoretic solutions to the Yang-Baxter equation (``solutions'', for short) by means of $\lambda$-endomorphisms of their associated permutation brace, thus generalizing the cabling method by Lebed, Vendramin and Ram\'{i}rez. In the first part of the article, we define endocabling and investigate the behaviour of solutions and their invariants under endocabling. In the second part, we apply our findings to solutions of size $n$ whose diagonal map is an $n$-cycle: we will prove that solutions with this property whose size is an odd prime power, are of finite multipermutation level. Furthermore, solutions with this property whose size is a power of $2$, will be proven either to be of finite multipermutation level or to admit an iterated retraction onto a unique solution of size $4$.
  We formulate our results in the language of cycle sets.</description>
