      <title>Decentralized Intelligence Network (DIN)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decentralized Intelligence Network (DIN) addresses the significant challenges of data sovereignty and AI utilization caused by the fragmentation and siloing of data across providers and institutions. This comprehensive framework overcomes access barriers to scalable data sources previously hindered by silos by leveraging: 1) personal data stores as a prerequisite for data sovereignty; 2) a scalable federated learning protocol implemented on a public blockchain for decentralized AI training, where data remains with participants and only model parameter updates are shared; and 3) a scalable, trustless rewards mechanism to incentivize participation and ensure fair reward distribution. This framework ensures that no entity can prevent or control access to training on data offered by participants or determine financial benefits, as these processes operate on a public blockchain with an immutable record and without a third party. It supports effective AI training, allowing participants to maintain control over their data, benefit financially, and contribute to a decentralized, scalable ecosystem that leverages collective AI to develop beneficial algorithms.</description>

      <title>Lattice-Based Quantum Advantage from Rotated Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.10143v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Trapdoor claw-free functions (TCFs) are immensely valuable in cryptographic interactions between a classical client and a quantum server. Typically, a protocol has the quantum server prepare a superposition of two-bit strings of a claw and then measure it using Pauli-$X$ or $Z$ measurements. In this paper, we demonstrate a new technique that uses the entire range of qubit measurements from the $XY$-plane. We show the advantage of this approach in two applications. First, building on (Brakerski et al. 2018, Kalai et al. 2022), we show an optimized two-round proof of quantumness whose security can be expressed directly in terms of the hardness of the LWE (learning with errors) problem. Second, we construct a one-round protocol for blind remote preparation of an arbitrary state on the $XY$-plane up to a Pauli-$Z$ correction.</description>

      <title>Compiling Quantum Circuits for Dynamically Field-Programmable Neutral Atoms Array Processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03487v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamically field-programmable qubit arrays (DPQA) have recently emerged as a promising platform for quantum information processing. In DPQA, atomic qubits are selectively loaded into arrays of optical traps that can be reconfigured during the computation itself. Leveraging qubit transport and parallel, entangling quantum operations, different pairs of qubits, even those initially far away, can be entangled at different stages of the quantum program execution. Such reconfigurability and non-local connectivity present new challenges for compilation, especially in the layout synthesis step which places and routes the qubits and schedules the gates. In this paper, we consider a DPQA architecture that contains multiple arrays and supports 2D array movements, representing cutting-edge experimental platforms. Within this architecture, we discretize the state space and formulate layout synthesis as a satisfiability modulo theories problem, which can be solved by existing solvers optimally in terms of circuit depth. For a set of benchmark circuits generated by random graphs with complex connectivities, our compiler OLSQ-DPQA reduces the number of two-qubit entangling gates on small problem instances by 1.7x compared to optimal compilation results on a fixed planar architecture. To further improve scalability and practicality of the method, we introduce a greedy heuristic inspired by the iterative peeling approach in classical integrated circuit routing. Using a hybrid approach that combined the greedy and optimal methods, we demonstrate that our DPQA-based compiled circuits feature reduced scaling overhead compared to a grid fixed architecture, resulting in 5.1X less two-qubit gates for 90 qubit quantum circuits. These methods enable programmable, complex quantum circuits with neutral atom quantum computers, as well as informing both future compilers and future hardware choices.</description>

      <title>Extracting Equations of Motion from Superconducting Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01926v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Alternative computing paradigms open the door to exploiting recent innovations in computational hardware to probe the fundamental thermodynamic limits of information processing. One such paradigm employs superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) to execute classical computations. This, though, requires constructing sufficiently complex superconducting circuits that support a suite of useful information processing tasks and storage operations, as well as understanding these circuits' energetics. First-principle circuit design, though, leads to prohibitive algebraic complications when deriving the effective equations of motion -- complications that to date have precluded achieving these goals, let alone doing so efficiently. We circumvent these complications by (i) specializing our class of circuits and physical operating regimes, (ii) synthesizing existing derivation techniques to suit these specializations, and (iii) implementing solution-finding optimizations which facilitate physically interpreting circuit degrees of freedom that respect physically-grounded constraints. This leads to efficient, practical circuit prototyping and access to scalable circuit architectures. The analytical efficiency is demonstrated by reproducing the potential energy landscape generated by the quantum flux parametron (QFP). We then show how inductively coupling two QFPs produces a device that is capable of executing 2-bit computations via its composite potential energy landscape. More generally, the synthesis methods detailed here provide a basis for constructing universal logic gates and investigating their thermodynamic performance.</description>

      <title>Impact of unreliable devices on stability of quantum computations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06833v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices are valuable platforms for testing the tenets of quantum computing, but these devices are susceptible to errors arising from de-coherence, leakage, cross-talk and other sources of noise. This raises concerns regarding the stability of results when using NISQ devices since strategies for mitigating errors generally require well-characterized and stationary error models. Here, we quantify the reliability of NISQ devices by assessing the necessary conditions for generating stable results within a given tolerance. We use similarity metrics derived from device characterization data to derive and validate bounds on the stability of a 5-qubit implementation of the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm. Simulation experiments conducted with noise data from IBM Washington, spanning January 2022 to April 2023, revealed that the reliability metric fluctuated between 41% and 92%. This variation significantly surpasses the maximum allowable threshold of 2.2% needed for stable outcomes. Consequently, the device proved unreliable for consistently reproducing the statistical mean in the context of the Bernstein-Vazirani circuit.</description>

      <title>Photonics for Neuromorphic Computing: Fundamentals, Devices, and Opportunities</title>

Abstract: In the dynamic landscape of Artificial Intelligence (AI), two notable phenomena are becoming predominant: the exponential growth of large AI model sizes and the explosion of massive amount of data. Meanwhile, scientific research such as quantum computing and protein synthesis increasingly demand higher computing capacities. Neuromorphic computing, inspired by the mechanism and functionality of human brains, uses physical artificial neurons to do computations and is drawing widespread attention. Conventional electronic computing has experienced certain difficulties, particularly concerning the latency, crosstalk, and energy consumption of digital processors. As the Moore's law approaches its terminus, there is a urgent need for alternative computing architectures that can satisfy this growing computing demand and break through the von Neumann model. Recently, the expansion of optoelectronic devices on photonic integration platforms has led to significant growth in photonic computing, where photonic integrated circuits (PICs) have enabled ultrafast artificial neural networks (ANN) with sub-nanosecond latencies, low heat dissipation, and high parallelism. Such non-von Neumann photonic computing systems hold the promise to cater to the escalating requirements of AI and scientific computing. In this review, we study recent advancements in integrated photonic neuromorphic systems, and from the perspective of materials and device engineering, we lay out the scientific and technological breakthroughs necessary to advance the state-of-the-art. In particular, we examine various technologies and devices employed in neuromorphic photonic AI accelerators, spanning from traditional optics to PICs. We evaluate the performances of different designs by energy efficiency in operations per joule (OP/J) and compute density in operations per squared millimeter per ...</description>
