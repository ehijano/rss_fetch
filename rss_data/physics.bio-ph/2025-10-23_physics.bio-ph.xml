      <title>Learning noisy tissue dynamics across time scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tissue dynamics play a crucial role in biological processes ranging from wound healing to morphogenesis. However, these noisy multicellular dynamics are notoriously hard to predict. Here, we introduce a biomimetic machine learning framework capable of inferring noisy multicellular dynamics directly from experimental movies. This generative model combines graph neural networks, normalizing flows and WaveNet algorithms to represent tissues as neural stochastic differential equations where cells are edges of an evolving graph. This machine learning architecture reflects the architecture of the underlying biological tissues, substantially reducing the amount of data needed to train it compared to convolutional or fully-connected neural networks. Taking epithelial tissue experiments as a case study, we show that our model not only captures stochastic cell motion but also predicts the evolution of cell states in their division cycle. Finally, we demonstrate that our method can accurately generate the experimental dynamics of developmental systems, such as the fly wing, and cell signaling processes mediated by stochastic ERK waves, paving the way for its use as a digital twin in bioengineering and clinical contexts.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional formulation of curved nematic shells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In soft matter, the phase of nematic liquid crystals can be made from anisotropic molecules in single component materials, or as a suspension of mesoscopic nematogens. The later offers more versatility in the experimental design of complex shapes, in particular thin curved shells, and is often found in biological systems at multiple scales from cells to tissues. Here, we investigate theoretically the transition from three-dimensional nematics to a two-dimensional description restricted to a tangent plane, using a mean-field approach. We identify a transition from first to second order isotropic-nematic transition in presence of weak tangential anchoring. Then, we clarify the conditions under which a two-dimensional description of thin nematic shells is relevant. Nonetheless, using the example of active nematic stress, we identify physical differences between two- and three-dimensional descriptions in curved geometry. Finally, we construct a thin film approximation of nematohydrodynamics for a nematic shell in contact with a curved substrate. All together, those results show that a tangential restriction of nematic orientation must be used with care in presence of curvature, activity, or weak anchoring boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>FP-IRL: Fokker-Planck Inverse Reinforcement Learning -- A Physics-Constrained Approach to Markov Decision Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.10407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) is a powerful paradigm for uncovering the incentive structure that drives agent behavior, by inferring an unknown reward function from observed trajectories within a Markov decision process (MDP). However, most existing IRL methods require access to the transition function, either prescribed or estimated \textit{a priori}, which poses significant challenges when the underlying dynamics are unknown, unobservable, or not easily sampled.
  We propose Fokker--Planck inverse reinforcement learning (FP-IRL), a novel physics-constrained IRL framework tailored for systems governed by Fokker--Planck (FP) dynamics. FP-IRL simultaneously infers both the reward and transition functions directly from trajectory data, without requiring access to sampled transitions. Our method leverages a conjectured equivalence between MDPs and the FP equation, linking reward maximization in MDPs with free energy minimization in FP dynamics. This connection enables inference of the potential function using our inference approach of variational system identification, from which the full set of MDP components -- reward, transition, and policy -- can be recovered using analytic expressions.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of FP-IRL through experiments on synthetic benchmarks and a modified version of the Mountain Car problem. Our results show that FP-IRL achieves accurate recovery of agent incentives while preserving computational efficiency and physical interpretability.</description>

      <title>Lineage topology, replication kinetics and cell cycle synchronization reveal regulated growth dynamics in human bone marrow stromal cell colonies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) -- which include skeletal stem cells -- are a promising tool in regenerative medicine. However, their heterogeneous and unpredictable in vivo behaviour remains a critical barrier preventing the development of standardized therapeutic approaches for skeletal tissue regeneration. Several studies have attempted to identify in vitro features that could correlate with the in vivo differentiation properties, yet the mechanisms ruling BMSC heterogeneity remain poorly understood. Here, using time-lapse imaging, we lineage-trace 32 single-cell-derived BMSC colonies through seven generations. We observe significant inter-colony and intra-colony heterogeneity in lineage topology (determined by the number of senescent or apoptotic cells) and in replicative kinetics (measured from proliferating cells only). Interestingly, topology and kinetics result strongly correlated, suggesting the existence of regulatory factors linking the non-dividing/apoptotic subpopulations with proliferating cells. Furthermore, BMSCs display highly synchronized cell cycles during early generations, indicating stage-specific regulatory mechanisms through which cells influence each other. By employing a non-interacting population growth model, we demonstrate that the observed synchronisation cannot be explained by an uncorrelated branching process; instead, cell-to-cell correlation of division times must exist. Our findings reveal fundamental mechanisms governing BMSC heterogeneity and growth dynamics that may inform strategies to control their regenerative potential.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of literature T1 mapping methods to the underlying magnetization transfer parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13644v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Purpose: Magnetization transfer (MT) has been identified as the principal source of $T_1$ variability in the MRI literature. This study assesses the sensitivity of established $T_1$ mapping techniques to variations in the underlying MT parameters.
  Methods: For each $T_1$-mapping method, the observed $T_1$ was simulated as a function of the underlying MT parameters $p_i^\text{MT}$, corresponding to different brain regions of interest (ROIs) at 3T. As measures of sensitivity, the derivatives $\partial T_1^\text{observed} / \partial p_i^\text{MT}$ were computed and analyzed with a linear mixed-effects model as a function of $p_i^\text{MT}$, ROI, pulse sequence type (e.g., inversion recovery, variable flip angle), and the individual sequences.
  Results: The analyzed $T_1$-mapping sequences have a considerable sensitivity to changes in the semi-solid spin pool size $m_0^\text{s}$, $T_1^\text{f}$ of the free, $T_1^\text{s}$ of the semi-solid spin pool, and the (inverse) exchange rate $T_\text{x}$. All derivatives vary considerably with the underlying MT parameters and between pulse sequences. The derivatives can, in general, not be determined by the sequence type, but rather depend on implementation details of the sequence. One notable exception is that variable-flip-angle methods are, in general, more sensitive to the exchange rate than inversion-recovery methods.
  Conclusion: Variations in $T_1$ measurements can be caused by several underlying MT parameters, and the sensitivity to each parameter depends on both the underlying MT parameters and the sequence.</description>
