      <title>Localized risk perception triggers early behavioral adaptations in epidemics on networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The contact structure of the population shapes the progression of epidemics. Nonetheless, the joint evolution of individual behavioral adaptations and disease dynamics on networks remains poorly understood. We use a behavioral-epidemiological model to study the joint evolution of human behavior and epidemic dynamics on networks. Our results reveal how the adaptation of local social structures, influenced by risk-benefit trade-offs, affects the dynamics of epidemics. We allow the epidemic and population-level behavior dynamics to emerge from the heterogeneous behavioral responses of individuals. Our framework assumes that individuals adjust their contact structure by temporarily dropping or maintaining connections based on perceived benefits and risks. Our results show that behavioral responses induced by localized risk perceptions lead to premature population-level responses relative to epidemic dynamics. Specifically, individual efforts peak at the epidemic maximum, while population-level efforts remain modest. We explore the robustness and extensions incorporating heterogeneous subpopulations.</description>

      <title>Computational Redistricting of Iowa's Congressional Districts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article expands on the redistricting algorithm proposed by Chen and Rodden (2015) for states with fewer than eight congressional districts, populations highly concentrated in urban areas, or state laws that require preservation of county lines. We used the updated algorithm to redistrict Iowa's four congressional districts. Non-partisan, randomly drawn maps were used to evaluate the fairness of the enacted congressional map. Notably, the evidence suggests that the first proposed map drawn by the Iowa Legislative Bureau was rejected due to partisan bias. This article also analyzes Iowa's 2024 election results for partisan gerrymandering.</description>

      <title>Order-disorder-order transitions and winning margins' scaling in kinetic exchange opinion model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The kinetic exchange opinion model shows a well-studied order disorder transition as the noise parameter, representing discord between interacting agents, is increased. A further increase in the noise drives the model, in low dimensions, to an extreme segregation ordering through a transition of similar nature. The scaling behavior of the winning margins have distinct features in the ordered and disordered phases that are similar to the observations noted recently in election data in various countries, explaining the qualitative differences in such scaling between tightly contested and land-slide election victories.</description>

      <title>Epidemic threshold and localization of the SIS model on directed complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model on directed complex networks within the quenched mean-field approximation. Combining results from random matrix theory with an analytic approach to the distribution of fixed-point infection probabilities, we derive the phase diagram and show that the model exhibits a nonequilibrium phase transition between the absorbing and endemic phases for $c \geq \lambda^{-1}$, where $c$ is the mean degree and $\lambda$ the average infection rate. Interestingly, the critical line is independent of the degree distribution but is highly sensitive to the form of the infection-rate distribution. We further show that the inverse participation ratio of infection probabilities diverges near the epidemic threshold, indicating that the disease may become localized on a small fraction of nodes. These results provide a comprehensive picture of how network heterogeneities shape epidemic spreading on directed contact networks.</description>

      <title>Intuition emerges in Maximum Caliber models at criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whether large predictive models merely parrot their training data or produce genuine insight lacks a physical explanation. This work reports a primitive form of intuition that emerges as a metastable phase of learning that critically balances next-token prediction against future path-entropy. The intuition mechanism is discovered via mind-tuning, the minimal principle that imposes Maximum Caliber in predictive models with a control temperature-like parameter $\lambda$. Training on random walks in deterministic mazes reveals a rich phase diagram: imitation (low $\lambda$), rule-breaking hallucination (high $\lambda$), and a fragile in-between window exhibiting strong protocol-dependence (hysteresis) and multistability, where models spontaneously discover novel goal-directed strategies. These results are captured by an effective low-dimensional theory and frame intuition as an emergent property at the critical balance between memorizing what is and wondering what could be.</description>

      <title>Task complexity shapes internal representations and robustness in neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural networks excel across a wide range of tasks, yet remain black boxes. In particular, how their internal representations are shaped by the complexity of the input data and the problems they solve remains obscure. In this work, we introduce a suite of five data-agnostic probes-pruning, binarization, noise injection, sign flipping, and bipartite network randomization-to quantify how task difficulty influences the topology and robustness of representations in multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). MLPs are represented as signed, weighted bipartite graphs from a network science perspective. We contrast easy and hard classification tasks on the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets. We show that binarizing weights in hard-task models collapses accuracy to chance, whereas easy-task models remain robust. We also find that pruning low-magnitude edges in binarized hard-task models reveals a sharp phase-transition in performance. Moreover, moderate noise injection can enhance accuracy, resembling a stochastic-resonance effect linked to optimal sign flips of small-magnitude weights. Finally, preserving only the sign structure-instead of precise weight magnitudes-through bipartite network randomizations suffices to maintain high accuracy. These phenomena define a model- and modality-agnostic measure of task complexity: the performance gap between full-precision and binarized or shuffled neural network performance. Our findings highlight the crucial role of signed bipartite topology in learned representations and suggest practical strategies for model compression and interpretability that align with task complexity.</description>

      <title>Don't Trust A Single Gerrymandering Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17186v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, in an effort to promote fairness in the election process, a wide variety of techniques and metrics have been proposed to determine whether a map is a partisan gerrymander. The most accessible measures, requiring easily obtained data, are metrics such as the Mean-Median Difference, Efficiency Gap, Declination, and GEO metric. But for most of these metrics, researchers have struggled to describe, given no additional information, how a value of that metric on a single map indicates the presence or absence of gerrymandering.
  Our main result is that each of these metrics is gameable when used as a single, isolated quantity to detect gerrymandering (or the lack thereof). That is, for each of the four metrics, we can find district plans for a given state with an extremely large number of Democratic-won (or Republican-won) districts while the metric value of that plan falls within a reasonable, predetermined bound. We do this by using a hill-climbing method to generate district plans that are constrained by the bounds on the metric but also maximize or nearly maximize the number of districts won by a party.
  In addition, extreme values of the Mean-Median Difference do not necessarily correspond to maps with an extreme number of districts won. Thus, the Mean- Median Difference metric is particularly misleading, as it cannot distinguish more extreme maps from less extreme maps. The other metrics are more nuanced, but when assessed on an ensemble, none perform substantially differently from simply measuring number of districts won by a fixed party.
  One clear consequence of these results is that they demonstrate the folly of specifying a priori bounds on a metric that a redistricting commission must meet in order to avoid gerrymandering.</description>

      <title>Nested economies of scale in global city mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03960v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A longstanding puzzle in urban science is whether there's an intrinsic match between human populations and the mass of their built environments. Previous findings have revealed various urban properties scaling nonlinearly with population, yet existing models of city built mass are still dominated by per-capita linear thinking. Our analysis of &gt;3,000 cities globally reveals universal sublinear scaling of city mass with population at both the city (\{beta}=0.90) and neighborhood levels ({\delta}=0.75). This means that larger cities and denser neighborhoods achieve economies of scale with less per-capita built mass. Our theoretical framework further shows that city-level scaling emerges naturally from within-city disparities. This multi-scale understanding redefines "over-built" and "under-built" conditions as deviations from expected scaling patterns, implying either excessive environmental impacts or inadequate living standards. Effective urban policy thus requires moving beyond simple per-capita assumptions, adopting scale-adjusted metrics and managing cities as nested, complex systems.</description>
