      <title>Newman-Penrose formalism and exact vacuum solutions to conformal Weyl gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the exterior solution for a static, spherically symmetric source in Weyl conformal gravity in terms of the Newman--Penrose formalism. We first show that both the static, uncharged black hole solution of Mannheim and Kazanas and the static, charged Reissner--Nordstr\"{o}m-like solution can be found more easily in this formalism than in the traditional coordinate-basis approach, where the metric tensor components are taken as the basic variables. Second, we show that the Newman-Penrose formalism offers a particularly convenient framework that is well suited for the discussion of conformal gravity solutions corresponding to Petrov ''type-D'' spacetimes. This is illustrated with a two-parameter class of wormhole solutions that includes the Ellis--Bronnikov wormhole solution of Einstein's gravity as a limiting case. Other salient issues, such as the gauge equivalence of solutions and the inclusion of the electromagnetic field are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Pure Gauss-Bonnet NUT Black Hole Solution: II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present article, we have obtained an exact analytical solution of six-dimensional pure Gauss-Bonnet gravity in the presence of both NUT and Maxwell charges. The topology of the horizon is chosen to be the product of two 2-spheres. Upon evaluating the solution, we study the spacetime properties, such as event horizon and singularity, and obtain the ranges of parameter space where the solution is valid. We discuss how the presence of Maxwell charges may impact the solution's asymptotic expansion and what distinctive effects it will bring to the geometry. The thermodynamic properties of the solution are also discussed, emphasizing the interplay between NUT and Maxwell charges.</description>

      <title>$SU(\infty)$ Quantum Gravity and Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter we highlight the structure and main properties of an abstract approach to quantum cosmology and gravity dubbed $SU(\infty)$-QGR. Beginning from the concept of the Universe as an isolated quantum system, the main axiom of the model is the existence of infinite number of mutually commuting observables. Consequently, the Hilbert space of the Universe represents $SU(\infty)$ symmetry. This Universe as a whole is static and topological. Nonetheless, quantum fluctuations induce local clustering in its quantum state and divide it to approximately isolated subsystems representing $G \times SU(\infty)$ symmetry, where $G$ is a generic finite rank internal symmetry for each subsystem that is entangled to the rest of the Universe by the global $SU(\infty)$ symmetry. In addition to parameters characterizing representation of $G$ by subsystems, their states depend on 4 continuous parameters: two of them characterize the representation of $SU(\infty)$, a dimensionful parameter arises from the possibility of comparing representations of $SU(\infty)$ by different subsystems, and the forth parameter is a measurable used as time registered by an arbitrary subsystem chosen as a quantum clock. They introduce a relative dynamics for subsystem formulated by a symmetry invariant effective Lagrangian defined on the (3+1)D parameter space. At lowest quantum order it is a Yang-Mills field theory for both $SU(\infty)$ and internal symmetries. We identify the common $SU(\infty)$ symmetry and its interaction with gravity. Thus, $SU(\infty)$-QGR predicts a spin-1 mediator for quantum gravity. Apparently this is in contradiction with classical gravity. Nonetheless, we show that an observer unable to detect the quantumness of gravity perceives its effect as the curvature of the space of average values of aforementioned parameters. We prove that emergent spacetime has a Lorentzian geometry.</description>

      <title>Existence of the Chapman-Enskog solution and its relation with first-order dissipative fluid theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conditions for the existence of the Chapman-Enskog first-order solution to the Boltzmann equation for a dilute gas are examined from two points of view. The traditional procedure is contrasted with a somehow more formal approach based on the properties of the linearized collision operator. It is shown that both methods lead to the same integral equation in the non-relativistic scenario. Meanwhile, for relativistic systems, the source term in the integral equation adopts two different forms. However, as we explain, this does not lead to an inconsistency. In fact, the constitutive equations that are obtained from both methods are shown to be equivalent within relativistic first-order theories. The importance of stating invariant definitions for the transport coefficients in this context is emphasized.</description>

      <title>Relational Dynamics with Periodic Clocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss a systematic way in which a relational dynamics can be established relative to periodic clocks both in the classical and quantum theories, emphasising the parallels between them. We show that: (1) classical and quantum relational observables that encode the value of a quantity relative to a periodic clock are only invariant along the gauge orbits generated by the Hamiltonian constraint if the quantity itself is periodic, and otherwise the observables are only transiently invariant per clock cycle (this implies, in particular, that counting winding numbers does not lead to invariant observables relative to the periodic clock); (2) the quantum relational observables can be obtained from a partial group averaging procedure over a single clock cycle; (3) there is an equivalence ('trinity') between the quantum theories based on the quantum relational observables of the clock-neutral picture of Dirac quantisation, the relational Schr\"odinger picture of the Page-Wootters formalism, and the relational Heisenberg picture that follows from quantum deparametrisation, all three taken relative to periodic clocks (implying that the dynamics in all three is necessarily periodic); (4) in the context of periodic clocks, the original Page-Wootters definition of conditional probabilities fails for systems that have a continuous energy spectrum and, using the equivalence between the Page-Wootters and the clock-neutral, gauge-invariant formalism, must be suitably updated. Finally, we show how a system evolving periodically with respect to a periodic clock can evolve monotonically with respect to an aperiodic clock, without inconsistency. The presentation is illustrated by several examples, and we conclude with a brief comparison to other approaches in the literature that also deal with relational descriptions of periodic clocks.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves from a Gauge Field Non-minimally Coupled to Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An axion-like spectator during inflation can trigger a tachyonic instability which amplifies the modes of one of the helicities of the gauge field, resulting in the production of parity-violating gravitational waves (GWs). In this paper we investigate the impact of the coupling $RFF$ of the gauge field to gravity on the production of GWs. We find that such a coupling introduces a multiplicative factor to the tachyonic mass, which effectively enhances the amplitude of the gauge field modes. Produced GWs are expected to be observed by future space-based GW detectors. Additionally, we find that the strong backreaction due to particle production leads to multiple peaks in the energy spectrum of GWs.</description>

      <title>Constant-roll inflation with tachyon field in the holographic braneworld</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study inflation driven by the tachyon field in the holographic braneworld by assuming the second slow-roll parameter $\eta$ is constant. The parameter $\eta$ can be either defined by the tachyon scalar field and the Hubble parameter or by the Hubble parameter only. By assuming a constant $\eta$, we derive and numerically solve a differential equation for the Hubble expansion rate. We calculate numerically the scalar spectral index and the tensor-to-scalar ratio. We confront the results with the observational data and find some constraints on the free model parameters. The swampland conjectures are discussed in the context of the constant-roll inflation, with some accent on the holographic model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14431v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Primordial black hole formation has been discussed widely, when density perturbations in the early universe cause matter to collapse gravitationally, giving rise to these ultra-compact objects. We propose that such a gravitational collapse also gives rise to primordial naked singularities, that would play an important role in the observable features of present universe. We consider two types of collapse scenarios that give rise to event-like and object-like visible singularities within a cosmological background. We briefly discuss implications of primordial naked singularities, including those for dark matter, vis-a-vis primordial black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02019v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to extend some basic results about marginally outer trapped surfaces to the context of surfaces having general null expansion. Motivated in part by recent work of Chai-Wan, we introduce the notion of $\mathfrak{g}$-stability for a general closed hypersurface $\Sigma$ in an ambient initial data set and prove that, under natural energy conditions, $\Sigma$ has positive Yamabe type, that is, $\Sigma$ admits a metric of positive scalar curvature, provided $\Sigma$ is $\mathfrak{g}$-stable. A similar result is obtained when $\Sigma$ is embedded in a null hypersurface of a spacetime satisfying the dominant energy condition. Area bounds under similar conditions are obtained in the case where $\Sigma$ is $2$-dimensional. Conditions implying $\mathfrak{g}$-stability are also discussed. Finally, we obtain a spacetime positive mass theorem for initial data sets with compact boundary $\Sigma$ of positive null expansion, assuming that the dominant energy condition is sufficiently strict near $\Sigma$. This extends recent results of Galloway-Lee and Lee-Lesourd-Unger.</description>

Abstract: Toric Ricci--flat metrics in dimension four correspond to certain holomorphic vector bundles over a twistor space. We construct these bundles explicitly, by exhibiting and characterising their patching matrices, for the five--parameter family of Riemannian ALF metrics constructed by Chen and Teo. The Chen--Teo family contains a two--parameter family of asymptotically flat gravitational instantons. The patching matrices for these instantons take a simple rational form.</description>

      <title>Mergers of hairy black holes: Constraining topological couplings from entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10127v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hairy black-holes are a unique prediction of certain theories that extend General Relativity (GR) with a scalar field. The presence of scalar hair is reflected non-trivially in the entropy of the black hole along with any topological coupling that may be present in the action. Demanding that a system of two merging black holes obeys the global second law of thermodynamics imposes a bound on this topological coupling coefficient. In this work we study how this bound is pushed from its GR value by the presence of scalar hair by considering estimates of binary black-hole merger parameters through inference studies of both mock and real gravitational-wave (GW) events. Although the scalar charge may produce a statistically significant deviation of the change in entropy over the GR prediction, we find no evidence of this happening in the data from real GW events taken from GWTC-1. We also find the entropy change to be susceptible to biases arising out of GW inferences which ends up being two orders of magnitude larger, therefore overwhelming any change, if at all, induced by the scalar hair.</description>

      <title>Quantum gravitational corrections to the Schwarzschild spacetime and quasinormal frequencies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum gravitational corrections to the entropy of the Schwarzschild black hole, derived using the Wald entropy formula within an effective field theory framework, were presented in [X. Calmet, F. Kuipers Phys.Rev.D 104 (2021) 6, 066012]. These corrections result in a Schwarzschild spacetime that is deformed by the quantum correction. However, it is observed that the proposed quantum-corrected metric describes not a black hole, but a wormhole. Nevertheless, further expansion of the metric function in terms of the quantum correction parameter yields a well-defined black hole metric whose geometry closely resembles that of a wormhole. We also explore methods for distinguishing between these quantum-corrected spacetimes based on the quasinormal frequencies they emit. We show that while the fundamental mode deviates from the Schwarzschild limit only mildly, the first few overtones deviate at a strongly increasing rate, creating a characteristic ``sound'' of the event horizon.</description>

      <title>Correspondence between grey-body factors and quasinormal modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quasinormal modes and grey-body factors are spectral characteristics corresponding to different boundary conditions: the former imply purely outgoing waves to the event horizon and infinity, while the latter allow for an incoming wave from the horizon, thus describing a scattering problem. Nevertheless, we show that there is a link between these two characteristics. We establish an approximate correspondence between the quasinormal modes and grey-body factors, which becomes exact in the high-frequency (eikonal) regime. We show that, in the eikonal regime, the grey-body factors of spherically symmetric black holes can be remarkably simply expressed via the fundamental quasinormal mode, while at smaller $\ell$, the correction terms include values of the overtones. This might be interesting in the context of the recently observed connection between grey-body factors and the amplitudes of gravitational waves from black holes. The correspondence might explain why grey-body factors are more stable, i.e. less sensitive, than higher overtones to small deformation of the effective potential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the capabilities of space-based gravitational-wave detector networks, specifically Taiji and LISA, to measure the anisotropies in stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB), which are characterized by the angular power spectrum. We find that a detector network can improve the measurement precision of anisotropies by at most fourteen orders of magnitude, depending on the angular multipoles. By doing so, we can enhance our understanding of the physical origins of SGWB, both in astrophysical and cosmological contexts. We assess the prospects of the detector networks for measuring the parameters of angular power spectrum. We further find an inevitable effect of cosmic variance, which can be suppressed by a better angular resolution, strengthening the importance of configuring detector networks. Our findings also suggest a potential detection of the kinematic dipole due to Doppler boosting of SGWB.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00971v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the black hole perturbation theory framework, two different physical pictures for echoes in compact objects have been proposed. The first mechanism interprets echoes as repeated reflections of gravitational waves within a potential well, where the echo period is defined by twice the distance related to the spatial displacement operator that separates two local maxima of the effective potential. The second mechanism associates echoes with a discontinuity in the effective potential, potentially associated with specific accretion processes, without necessarily introducing a second local maximum in the effective potential. This discontinuity leads to echo signals that are typically attenuated over time more quickly, with their period dictated by the characteristics of the transfer amplitudes. In both scenarios, the echoes correspond to a new category of quasinormal modes with minor real parts, with their period connected to the spacing between successive modes in the frequency domain. This work elaborates on a unified framework in compact stars that encompasses both echo mechanisms. It suggests that these two types of echoes derive from different physical origins and can be independently triggered. The occurrence and interplay between these two types of echoes are demonstrated through numerical simulations. %The observational relevance of this study is also addressed.</description>

      <title>Gravitational radiation from binary systems in Unimodular gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02909v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unimodular gravity (UG) is classically considered identical to General Relativity (GR). However, due to restricted diffeomorphism symmetry, the Bianchi identites do not lead to the conservation of energy-momentum tensor. Thus, the conservation of energy-momentum tensor needs to be separately assumed in order to reconcile with GR. Relaxing this assumption, one finds that the conservation violation can lead to differences with GR, which can be subsequently examined in astrophysical and cosmological scenarios. To this end, we examine the predictions of UG in the context of binary systems emitting gravitational radiation. Primarily, we show how the field equations involve a diffusion function which quantifies the measure of non-conservation. Due to this violation, the dispersion relation is modified. Incorporating these changes, we provide an expression for the energy loss by the binaries, which reduces to Peters-Mathews result in the GR limit. Using binary pulsar data, we constrain the theory parameter $\zeta$ (which signifies non-conservation) by determining the rate of orbital decay. The strongest constrain on $\zeta$ comes out to be $\vert \zeta \vert \leq 5\times 10^{-4}$ which is better by an order of magnitude than an existing equivalent constraint coming from the tidal deformability of the neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Signatures from the observed jet power and the radiative efficiency for rotating black holes in loop quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the radiative efficiency and the jet power in the spacetime of the rotating black hole in loop quantum gravity (LQG), which has an extra LQG parameter. It is shown that with the increase of the LQG parameter, the conversion efficiency decreases for the slowly rotating black hole, but increases for the rapidly rotating black hole, the jet power increases for different black hole spins. With the observed data from the well-known sources A0620-00, H1743-322, XTE J1550-564, GRS1124-683, GRO J1655-40, and GRS1915+105, we make some constraints on the black hole spin parameter and the LQG parameter. The presence of the LQG parameter broadens the allowed range of the black hole spin parameter for sources A0620-00, H1743-322, XTE J1550-564 and GRO J1655-40. However, for the source GRS 1915+105, there is no overlap between observational constrain parameter regions, which implies that the rotating LQG black hole cannot simultaneously account for the observed jet power and the radiative efficiency as in other black hole spacetimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2102.04192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The hyperbolic Lie algebras with symmetrizable Cartan matrix are classified, there are 142 of them some of which can be ``superized'' to an almost affine Lie superalgebra. We list all 97 pairs (a hyperbolic Lie algebra $H$, its superized almost affine Lie superalgebra $S(H)$). Several (18 of the total 66) superizable hyperbolic Lie algebras have multiple superizations. The tracks of cosmological billiards corresponding to both terms of these pairs ($H\leftrightarrow S(H)$) are the same since the Weyl chambers of $H$ and of $S(H)$ differ only by a~scale.
  We also classified ``superizations'' of hyperbolic Lie algebras with non-symmetrizable Cartan matrix. No interpretations of these Lie (super)algebras are known to us.</description>

      <title>Complexity = Anything Can Grow Forever in de Sitter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.11280v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in anti-de Sitter holography point towards the association of an infinite class of covariant objects, the simplest one being codimension-one extremal volumes, with quantum computational complexity in the microscopic description. One of the defining features of these gravitational complexity proposals is describing the persistent growth of black hole interior in classical gravity. It is tempting to assume that the gravitational complexity proposals apply also to gravity outside their native anti-de Sitter setting in which case they may reveal new truths about these cases with much less understood microscopics. Recent first steps in this direction in de Sitter static patch demonstrated a very different behavior from anti-de Sitter holography deemed hyperfast growth: diverging complexification rate after a finite time. We show that this feature is not a necessity and among gravitational complexity proposals there are ones, which predict linear or exponential late-time growth behaviors for complexity in de Sitter static patches persisting classically forever.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10497v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The observation of the Sagnac effect for massive material particles offers a significant enhancement in sensitivity when compared to optical interferometers with equal area and angular rotation velocity. For this reason, there have been suggestions to employ solid-state interferometers that rely on semiconductors and graphene. We investigate the Sagnac effect in Dirac materials governed by the relativisticlike quasiparticle dispersion law and show that the fringe shift is still determined by the mass of a free electron. This confirms that graphene is indeed a promising material for creating solid-state Sagnac interferometers. Considering monolayer graphene with its linear dispersion law and comparing it with light provides a deeper understanding of the Sagnac effect.</description>

Abstract: Modifications of Dirac operators in supergravity flux backgrounds are considered. Modified spin curvature operators and squares of modified Dirac operators corresponding to Schr\"odinger-Lichnerowicz-like formulas are obtained for different types of flux modifications. Symmetry operators of modified massless and massive Dirac equations are found in terms of modified Killing-Yano and modified conformal Killing-Yano forms. Extra constraints for symmetry operators in terms of different types of fluxes and modified Killing-Yano forms are determined.</description>

      <title>Generalized holographic complexity of rotating black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08571v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the generalized holographic complexity of odd-dimensional Myers-Perry asymptotically Anti-de Sitter (MP-AdS) black holes with equal angular momenta within the ``complexity equals anything'' proposal. We begin by determining the codimension-one generalized volume complexity by finding the extremum of the generally covariant volume functional. Locally, we show that its late-time growth rate aligns with the critical momenta associated with the extremal hypersurfaces. Globally, we discover diverse phase transitions for the complexity at early times, including first-order, second-order, and multi-critical transitions. An area law and a phase diagram are proposed to adapt to these phase behaviours, highlighting the effects of the black hole's angular momentum. At zero time, we define the generalized holographic complexity of formation and examine its scaling relations for both large near-extremal MP-AdS black holes and static charged black holes. We find that the scaling behaviours of the generalized volume complexity of formation maintain uniformity with those of the original holographic complexity formulations, except in cases where the scalar functional defining the generalized holographic complexity is infinite in the vacuum limit or at spatial infinity. Additionally, we show that these findings can be applied to codimension-zero observables.</description>

      <title>Developing a Theoretical Model for the Resummation of Infrared Effects in the Post-Reconstruction Power Spectrum (an explanatory video is available in the comments section)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06142v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since galaxy distribution reconstruction effectively reduces non-Gaussian terms in the power spectrum covariance matrix, it has attracted interest not only for Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) signals but also for various cosmological signal analyses. To this end, this paper presents a novel theoretical model that addresses infrared (IR) effects in the post-reconstruction galaxy power spectrum, including 1-loop corrections. In particular, we discuss the importance of incorporating non-perturbative effects arising from IR contributions into the displacement vector $\vec{s}$ used for reconstruction. Consequently, post-reconstruction nonlinear damping of BAO can be described by a single two-dimensional Gaussian function. This is a phenomenon not observed when $\vec{s}$ is considered to at a linear order in the Zel'dovich approximation. Furthermore, we confirm that the cross-power spectrum of the pre- and post-reconstruction density fluctuations lacks IR effect cancellations, and shows an exponential decay in both the cross-power spectrum and the associated shot-noise term.

      <title>Large Eddy Simulations of Magnetized Mergers of Black Holes and Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09770v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The LIGO-Virgo-Kagra collaboration has observed gravitational waves consistent with the mergers of a black hole and a neutron star, namely GW200105 and GW200115, providing evidence for such cataclysmic events. Although no electromagnetic counterpart was reported for either of these two events, under certain conditions black hole--neutron star mergers are expected to form a significant accretion disk and to produce both a short gamma ray burst and a kilonova, much as observed in the binary neutron star merger GW170817. Here, we extend our publicly available code $\texttt{MHDuet}$ to study numerically the merger of a magnetized neutron star with a black hole. $\texttt{MHDuet}$ employs Large Eddy Simulation (LES) techniques to help capture the magnetic field amplification resulting from turbulence and other sub-grid scale dynamics in the post-merger stage. In particular, we simulate a merger with parameters favorable to producing an accretion disk, focusing on the formation and dynamics of the turbulent disk and the resulting magnetic field amplification. Following the tidal disruption and during the formation of the accretion disk, the magnetic field undergoes significant amplification driven by the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, reaching strengths of more than $10^{14}\,\rm{G}$ from a realistic initial strength of $10^{11}\,\rm{G}$ in short timescales of approximately $20\,\rm{ms}$. Despite employing LES techniques with a finest resolution of $120\,\text{m}$ that is among the highest in black hole-neutron star mergers, it is still insufficient to demonstrate convergence of the magnetic field growth. Although the effects of the LES are here rather modest, we expect them to be more significant at higher resolution, as observed in binary neutron star merger simulations.</description>

      <title>Solar chameleons: Novel channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01691v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the flux of chameleons (light scalar particles which could play a role in the dark energy phenomenon) produced in the interior of the Sun. Our novel analysis incorporates various important details and new processes that have previously been overlooked, including the impact of the bulk magnetic field profile, as well as Primakoff production of chameleons in the electric fields of electrons and ions. In this paper we consider only the contributions of transverse photons. The production of chameleons from longitudinal electromagnetic excitations will be presented in a dedicated follow-up work. Demanding that the total flux of chameleons does not exceed 3% of the solar luminosity leads to the stringent upper limit on the chameleon-photon conformal coupling $\beta_\gamma \lesssim 10^{10}$, assuming that the height of the chameleon potential is set to the dark energy scale $\Lambda = 2.4$ meV, and independently of other couplings to matter. Although this bound is tighter than current upper limits on $\beta_{\gamma}$ from the CAST helioscope, these limits will have to be reassessed in terms of the updated solar chameleon flux we have computed. We argue that solar chameleons, potentially detectable in next-generation helioscopes such as IAXO, can be used to probe a region of chameleon parameter space that has yet to be covered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a realization of the inflationary scenario where the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry is spontaneously broken during inflation, facilitated by its non-minimal coupling to gravity. This results in effectively two-field inflation: the early stage is driven by an inflaton field with the PQ symmetry intact, and the later stage is driven by the PQ scalar after its effective mass becomes tachyonic, causing destabilization from the origin. The non-minimal coupling serves the dual purpose of restoring the PQ symmetry during early inflation and flattening the PQ potential post-tachyonic shift, allowing for continued slow roll. We analyze the inflationary background solutions and scalar perturbations, which are amplified at small scales via significant isocurvature perturbations generated near the symmetry-breaking epoch. These perturbations lead to second-order gravitational waves, detectable by next-generation space-based experiments.</description>

      <title>Parity-violating primordial gravitational waves from null energy condition violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16549v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the parity-violating effects in primordial gravitational waves (GWs) due to null energy condition (NEC) violation in two very early universe scenarios: bounce-inflation and intermediate NEC violation during inflation. In both scenarios, we numerically solve the power spectra of parity-violating primordial GWs generated by coupling the background field and the spectator field with the Nieh-Yan term, respectively. We find that the background field can significantly enhance parity-violating effects at scales corresponding to the maximum of the GW power spectra. In contrast, the parity-violating effects produced by the spectator show significantly weaker observability even if the coupling constant is large. Therefore, in NEC-violating scenarios, the significant observable parity-violating effects in primordial GWs primarily arise from the physics directly related to NEC violation. This result highlights the potential of primordial GWs as crucial tools for exploring NEC-violating and parity-violating physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using universal predictions provided by classical soft theorems, we revisit the energy emission spectrum for gravitational scatterings of compact objects in the low-frequency expansion. We calculate this observable beyond the zero-frequency limit, retaining an exact dependence on the kinematics of the massive objects. This allows us to study independently the ultrarelativistic or massless limit, where we find agreement with the literature, and the small-deflection or post-Minkowskian (PM) limit, where we provide explicit results up to $\mathcal{O}(G^5)$. These confirm that the high-velocity limit of a given PM order is smoothly connected to the corresponding massless result whenever the latter is analytic in the Newton constant $G$. We also provide explicit expressions for the waveforms to order $\omega^{-1}$, $\log\omega$, $\omega(\log\omega)^2$ in the soft limit, $\omega\to0$, expanded up to sub-subleading PM order, as well as a conjecture for the logarithmic soft terms of the type $\omega^{n-1}(\log\omega)^{n}$ with $n\ge 3$.</description>

Abstract: Open system dynamics of an electron is studied in the presence of radiation field, confined between two parallel conducting pates. It has been suggested in previous works that the quantized zero-point modes of this field lead to finite decoherence effects, possibly due to the Casimir force. However, in this work it is shown that the off-diagonal elements of the reduced density matrix of the electron are suppressed due to the sudden switching on of the interaction with the environment, and would not be observationally relevant in typical scenarios. The work clarifies important theoretical aspects of the setup and argues that any irreversible loss of coherence, in general, should not be ascribed to vacuum fluctuations. It can only originate from emission of bremsstrahlung by the electron, due to the acceleration caused by the effective Coulomb potential of all the infinite image charges.</description>
