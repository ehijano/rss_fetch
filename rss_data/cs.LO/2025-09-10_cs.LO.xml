      <title>Contradictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trustworthy AI requires reasoning systems that are not only powerful but also transparent and reliable. Automated Theorem Proving (ATP) is central to formal reasoning, yet classical binary resolution remains limited, as each step involves only two clauses and eliminates at most two literals. To overcome this bottleneck, the concept of standard contradiction and the theory of contradiction-separation-based deduction were introduced in 2018. This paper advances that framework by focusing on the systematic construction of standard contradictions. Specially, this study investigates construction methods for two principal forms of standard contradiction: the maximum triangular standard contradiction and the triangular-type standard contradiction. Building on these structures, we propose a procedure for determining the satisfiability and unsatisfiability of clause sets via maximum standard contradiction. Furthermore, we derive formulas for computing the number of standard sub-contradictions embedded within both the maximum triangular standard contradiction and the triangular-type standard contradiction. The results presented herein furnish the methodological basis for advancing contradiction-separation-based dynamic multi-clause automated deduction, thereby extending the expressive and deductive capabilities of automated reasoning systems beyond the classical binary paradigm.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Code Evolution Meets NP-Completeness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown strong coding abilities, enabling not only static code generation but also iterative code self-evolving through agentic frameworks. Recently, AlphaEvolve \cite{novikov2025alphaevolve} demonstrated that LLM-based coding agents can autonomously improve algorithms and surpass human experts, with scopes limited to isolated kernels spanning hundreds of lines of code. Inspired by AlphaEvolve, we present SATLUTION, the first framework to extend LLM-based code evolution to the full repository scale, encompassing hundreds of files and tens of thousands of lines of C/C++ code. Targeting Boolean Satisfiability (SAT), the canonical NP-complete problem and a cornerstone of both theory and applications. SATLUTION orchestrates LLM agents to directly evolve solver repositories under strict correctness guarantees and distributed runtime feedback, while simultaneously self-evolving its own evolution policies and rules. Starting from SAT Competition 2024 codebases and benchmark, SATLUTION evolved solvers that decisively outperformed the human-designed winners of the SAT Competition 2025, and also surpassed both 2024 and 2025 champions on the 2024 benchmarks.</description>

      <title>On the Unprovability of Circuit Size Bounds in Intuitionistic $\mathsf{S}^1_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11841v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that there is a constant $k$ such that Buss's intuitionistic theory $\mathsf{IS}^1_2$ does not prove that SAT requires co-nondeterministic circuits of size at least $n^k$. To our knowledge, this is the first unconditional unprovability result in bounded arithmetic in the context of worst-case fixed-polynomial size circuit lower bounds. We complement this result by showing that the upper bound $\mathsf{NP} \subseteq \mathsf{coNSIZE}[n^k]$ is unprovable in $\mathsf{IS}^1_2$.

In order to establish our main result, we obtain new unconditional lower bounds against refuters that might be of independent interest. In particular, we show that there is no efficient refuter for the lower bound $\mathsf{NP} \nsubseteq \mathsf{i.o.}\text{-}\mathsf{coNP}/\mathsf{poly}$, addressing in part a question raised by Atserias (2006).</description>
