      <title>Merton model and Poisson process with Log Normal intensity function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study considers the Merton model with temporal correlation. We show the Merton model becomes Poisson process with the log-normal distributed intensity function in the limit. We discuss the relation between this model and Hawkes process. In this model we confirm the super-normal transition when the temporal correlation is power case. The phase transition is same as seen before the limit. We apply this model to the default portfolios and find that the power decay model provides better generalization performance for the long term data.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot Forecasting Mortality Rates: A Global Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the potential of zero-shot time series forecasting, an innovative approach leveraging pre-trained foundation models, to forecast mortality rates without task-specific fine-tuning. We evaluate two state-of-the-art foundation models, TimesFM and CHRONOS, alongside traditional and machine learning-based methods across three forecasting horizons (5, 10, and 20 years) using data from 50 countries and 111 age groups. In our investigations, zero-shot models showed varying results: while CHRONOS delivered competitive shorter-term forecasts, outperforming traditional methods like ARIMA and the Lee-Carter model, TimesFM consistently underperformed. Fine-tuning CHRONOS on mortality data significantly improved long-term accuracy. A Random Forest model, trained on mortality data, achieved the best overall performance. These findings underscore the potential of zero-shot forecasting while highlighting the need for careful model selection and domain-specific adaptation.</description>

      <title>Beating the Correlation Breakdown: Robust Inference, Flexible Scenarios, and Stress Testing for Financial Portfolios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15268v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We live in a multivariate world, and effective modeling of financial portfolios, including their construction, allocation, forecasting, and risk analysis, simply is not possible without explicitly modeling the dependence structure of their assets. Dependence structure can drive portfolio results more than the combined effects of other parameters in investment and risk models, but the literature provides relatively little to define the finite-sample distributions of dependence measures in useable and useful ways under challenging, real-world financial data conditions. Yet this is exactly what is needed to make valid inferences about their estimates, and to use these inferences for essential purposes such as hypothesis testing, dynamic monitoring, realistic and granular scenario and reverse scenario analyses, and mitigating the effects of correlation breakdowns during market upheavals. This work develops a new and straightforward method, Nonparametric Angles-based Correlation (NAbC), for defining the finite-sample distributions of any dependence measure whose matrix of pairwise associations is positive definite (e.g. Pearsons, Kendalls, Spearmans, Tail Dependence Matrix, and others). The solution remains valid under marginal asset distributions characterized by notably different and varying degrees of serial correlation, non-stationarity, heavy-tailedness, and asymmetry. Importantly, NAbCs p-values and confidence intervals remain analytically consistent at both the matrix level and the pairwise cell level. Finally, NAbC maintains validity even when selected cells in the matrix are frozen for a given scenario or stress test, thus enabling flexible, granular, and realistic scenarios. NAbC stands alone in providing all of these capabilities simultaneously, and should prove to be a very useful means by which we can better understand and manage financial portfolios in our multivariate world.</description>
