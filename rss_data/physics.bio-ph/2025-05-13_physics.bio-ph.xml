      <title>Lipidation-induced bacterial cell membrane translocation of star-peptides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria demands development of novel and effective antimicrobial agents. Structurally Nanoengineered Antimicrobial Peptide Polymers (SNAPPs), characterized by their unique star-shaped architecture and potent multivalent interactions, represent a promising solution. This study leverages molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the impact of lipidation on SNAPPs' structural stability, membrane interactions, and antibacterial efficacy. We show that lipidation with hexanoic acid (C6), lauric acid (C12), and stearic acid (C18) enhances the {\alpha}-helical stability of SNAPP arms, facilitating deeper insertion into the hydrophobic core of bacterial membranes. Among the variants, C12-SNAPP exhibits the most significant bilayer disruption, followed by C6-SNAPP, whereas the excessive hydrophobicity of C18-SNAPP leads to pronounced arm back-folding towards the core, reducing its effective interaction with the bilayer and limiting its bactericidal performance. Additionally, potential of mean force (PMF) analysis reveals that lipidation reduces the free energy barrier for translocation through the bilipid membrane compared to non-lipidated SNAPPs. These findings underscore the critical role of lipidation in optimizing SNAPPs for combating MDR pathogens. By fine-tuning lipid chain lengths, this study provides a framework for designing next-generation antimicrobial agents to address the global antibiotic resistance crisis, advancing modern therapeutic strategies.</description>

      <title>Local stabilizability implies global controllability in catalytic reaction systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling complex reaction networks is a fundamental challenge in the fields of physics, biology, and systems engineering. Here, we prove a general principle for catalytic reaction systems with kinetics where the reaction order and the stoichiometric coefficient match: the local stabilizability of a given state implies global controllability within its stoichiometric compatibility class. In other words, if a target state can be maintained against small perturbations, the system can be controlled from any initial condition to that state. This result highlights a tight link between the local and global dynamics of nonlinear chemical reaction systems, providing a mathematical criterion for global reachability that is often elusive in high-dimensional systems. The finding illuminate the robustness of biochemical systems and offers a way to control catalytic reaction systems in a generic framework.</description>

      <title>Weak transcription factor clustering at binding sites can facilitate information transfer from molecular signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transcription factor concentrations provide signals to cells that allow them to regulate gene expression to make correct cell fate decisions. Calculations for noise bounds in gene regulation suggest that clustering or cooperative binding of transcription factors decreases signal-to-noise ratios at binding sites. However, clustering of transcription factor molecules around binding sites is frequently observed. We develop two complementary models for clustering transcription factors at binding site sensors that allow us to study information transfer from a signal to a variable relevant to development, namely future cell fates, on the example of the signal morphogen Bicoid in early fly development. We find that weak cooperativity or clustering can allow for maximal information transfer, especially about the relevant variable. Why clustering is beneficial for transfer depends on how long the binding site sensor measures the signal before affecting downstream gene expression: for short measurements, clustering allows for the implementation of a switch, while for long measurements, weak clustering allows the sensor to access maximal developmental information provided in a nonlinear signal. Finally, we find that clustering can facilitate binding site sensors to achieve an optimal bound to molecular sensing, the information bottleneck (IB) bound. This IB optimality appears consistent with a biologically intuitive optimization.</description>

      <title>Unfitted finite element modelling of surface-bulk viscous flows in animal cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a novel unfitted finite element framework to simulate coupled surface-bulk problems in time-dependent domains, focusing on fluid-fluid interactions in animal cells between the actomyosin cortex and the cytoplasm. The cortex, a thin layer beneath the plasma membrane, provides structural integrity and drives shape changes by generating surface contractile forces akin to tension. Cortical contractions generate Marangoni-like surface flows and induce intracellular cytoplasmic flows that are essential for processes such as cell division, migration, and polarization, particularly in large animal cells. Despite its importance, the spatiotemporal regulation of cortex-cytoplasm interactions remains poorly understood and computational modelling can be very challenging because surface-bulk dynamics often lead to large cell deformations. To address these challenges, we propose a sharp-interface framework that uniquely combines the trace finite element method for surface flows with the aggregated finite element method for bulk flows. This approach enables accurate and stable simulations on fixed Cartesian grids without remeshing. The model also incorporates mechanochemical feedback through the surface transport of a molecular regulator of active tension. We solve the resulting mixed-dimensional system on a fixed Cartesian grid using a level-set-based method to track the evolving surface. Numerical experiments validate the accuracy and stability of the method, capturing phenomena such as self-organised pattern formation, curvature-driven relaxation, and cell cleavage. This novel framework offers a powerful and extendable tool for investigating increasingly complex morphogenetic processes in animal cells.</description>

      <title>Antagonistic coinfection in rock-paper-scissors models during concurrent epidemics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of dual disease epidemics within the spatial rock-paper-scissors model. In this framework, individuals from all species are equally susceptible to infection by two distinct pathogens transmitted via person-to-person contact. We assume antagonistic mortality, where the simultaneous occurrence of coinfection reduces the probability of host mortality due to complications arising from either coexisting disease. Specifically, we explore two scenarios: global antagonism, where the presence of one pathogen inhibits the progression of the other in coinfected hosts, and uneven antagonism, where only one pathogen affects the development of the other. Using stochastic simulations, we show that the characteristic length scale of the spatial patterns emerging from random initial conditions diminishes as antagonism becomes more significant. We find that antagonism enhances species population growth and reduces the average probability of healthy organisms becoming infected. Additionally, introducing individuals' mobility restrictions significantly decreases both organisms' infection risk and selection pressures. Our results demonstrate that combining mobility restrictions with antagonistic coinfection can increase organisms' life expectancy by up to $54\%$. Our findings show that integrating antagonistic coinfection and mobility restriction strategies into ecological models may provide insights into designing interventions for managing concurrent epidemics in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Spiral defect chaos with intermittency increases mean termination time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cardiac models are examples of excitable systems and can support stable spiral waves. For certain parameter values, however, these spiral waves can become unstable, resulting in spiral defect chaos (SDC), characterized by the continuous creation and annihilation of spiral waves and thought to underlie atrial fibrillation. During SDC, the number of spiral waves fluctuates and eventually drops to zero, marking the termination of activity. In this work, we demonstrate that varying a single parameter allows the system to transition from SDC to a single spiral wave, passing through an intermediate regime of intermittency. In this intermittent dynamics, intervals of SDC are sandwiched between non-SDC intervals during which the number of spiral waves remains small and constant. We quantify this intermittency and show that the mean termination time increases significantly as the control parameter approaches values for which a single spiral wave is stable. In addition, we find that it is also possible to have intermittently present quasi-stable spiral waves in part of the computational domain while the remainder of the domain exhibits SDC. Our results may have implications for clinical atrial fibrillation, which often shows intermittency, switching back-and-forth between fibrillation and normal sinus rhythm.</description>

      <title>The Dynamics of Inducible Genetic Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Genes are connected in complex networks of interactions where often the product of one gene is a transcription factor that alters the expression of another. Many of these networks are based on a few fundamental motifs leading to switches and oscillators of various kinds. And yet, there is more to the story than which transcription factors control these various circuits. These transcription factors are often themselves under the control of effector molecules that bind them and alter their level of activity. Traditionally, much beautiful work has shown how to think about the stability of the different states achieved by these fundamental regulatory architectures by examining how parameters such as transcription rates, degradation rates and dissociation constants tune the circuit, giving rise to behavior such as bistability. However, such studies explore dynamics without asking how these quantities are altered in real time in living cells as opposed to at the fingertips of the synthetic biologist's pipette or on the computational biologist's computer screen. In this paper, we make a departure from the conventional dynamical systems view of these regulatory motifs by using statistical mechanical models to focus on endogenous signaling knobs such as effector concentrations rather than on the convenient but more experimentally remote knobs such as dissociation constants, transcription rates and degradation rates that are often considered. We also contrast the traditional use of Hill functions to describe transcription factor binding with more detailed thermodynamic models. This approach provides insights into how biological parameters are tuned to control the stability of regulatory motifs in living cells, sometimes revealing quite a different picture than is found by using Hill functions and tuning circuit parameters by hand.</description>

      <title>Compression, Regularity, Randomness and Emergent Structure: Rethinking Physical Complexity in the Data-Driven Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complexity science offers a wide range of measures for quantifying unpredictability, structure, and information. Yet, a systematic conceptual organization of these measures is still missing.
  We present a unified framework that locates statistical, algorithmic, and dynamical measures along three axes (regularity, randomness, and complexity) and situates them in a common conceptual space. We map statistical, algorithmic, and dynamical measures into this conceptual space, discussing their computational accessibility and approximability.
  This taxonomy reveals the deep challenges posed by uncomputability and highlights the emergence of modern data-driven methods (including autoencoders, latent dynamical models, symbolic regression, and physics-informed neural networks) as pragmatic approximations to classical complexity ideals. Latent spaces emerge as operational arenas where regularity extraction, noise management, and structured compression converge, bridging theoretical foundations with practical modeling in high-dimensional systems.
  We close by outlining implications for physics-informed AI and AI-guided discovery in complex physical systems, arguing that classical questions of complexity remain central to next-generation scientific modeling.</description>

      <title>CVTree for 16S rRNA: Constructing Taxonomy-Compatible All-Species Living Tree Effectively and Efficiently</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Composition Vector Tree (CVTree) method, developed under the leadership of Professor Hao Bailin, is an alignment-free algorithm for constructing phylogenetic trees. Although initially designed for studying prokaryotic evolution based on whole-genome, it has demonstrated broad applicability across diverse biological systems and gene sequences. In this study, we employed two methods, InterList and Hao, of CVTree to investigate the phylogeny and taxonomy of prokaryote based on the 16S rRNA sequences from All-Species Living Tree Project. We have established a comprehensive phylogenetic tree that incorporates the majority of species documented in human scientific knowledge and compared it with the taxonomy of prokaryotes. And the performance of CVTree were also compared with multiple sequence alignment-based approaches. Our results revealed that CVTree methods achieve computational speeds 1-3 orders of magnitude faster than conventional alignment methods while maintaining high consistency with established taxonomic relationships, even outperforming some multiple sequence alignment methods. These findings confirm CVTree's effectiveness and efficiency not only for whole-genome evolutionary studies but also for phylogenetic and taxonomic investigations based on genes.</description>

      <title>Full simulation on the dynamics of auditory synaptic fusion: Strong clustering of calcium channel might be the origin of the coherent release in the auditory hair cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The precise timing of synaptic transmission in auditory hair cells is important to hearing and speech recognition. Neurotransmitter release is an underlying step in translating sound. Thus, understanding nature of the synaptic fusion is key to understand the hearing mechanism. Extraordinary large excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) have been observed in the auditory hair cell synapse, and its origin has been controversial. It is not known yet whether the size and shape of the EPSCs are results of a big vesicle or many small vesicles. We report our numerical simulation of the vesicular fusion process from calcium channel process to the generation of EPSC currents. Our numerical experiments indicate that the origin of the large EPSC with its mysterious form is close to the scenario of the multivesicular release. The large EPSCs might be triggered by strong calcium channeling of the calcium channel clusters.</description>

      <title>Inverse Bauschinger Effect in Active Ultrastable Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Memory effects in amorphous materials have been widely studied because of their possible widespread future applications. We show here that ultrastable glasses can exhibit a transient reversible memory effect when subjected to both a local driving force via Run-and-tumble active particles and global shear. We investigate the system's response across different yielding regimes by selectively switching the shear direction at different strains. We analyze how changes in shear direction influence yielding, post-yield behavior, and structural evolution in active amorphous solids. Our model active system exhibits an enhanced anisotropic response, displaying both conventional and inverse Bauschinger effects, depending on the deformation history. The results indicate that activity-induced shear band networks create structural memory, enabling the system to heal upon shear reversal due to the transient nature of this phenomenon. Additionally, we observe that shear softening under cyclic loading produces an irreversible, stable, and less branched network structure with increasing cycles. These findings provide novel insights into how activity and shear collectively contribute to mechanical response, including memory formation in ultrastable disordered systems.</description>

      <title>Growing length and time scales in activity-mediated glassy dynamics in confluent cell monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Activity-mediated unjamming of a confluent glassy system is crucial for several biological processes, such as embryogenesis and cancer metastasis. During these processes, the cells progressively change their junction properties, characterized by an interaction parameter $p_0$, and become motile. Here, we study the effect of nonequilibrium active fluctuations, in the form of self-propulsion, on the glassy dynamics in a confluent system. We simulate the active Vertex model and use the analytical mode-coupling theory (MCT) to show that the nature of the transition in the presence of activity remains similar to that in a thermal system where the fluctuations are temperature-like. The agreement of the simulation results with the MCT predictions demonstrates that the structure-dynamics feedback mechanism controls the relaxation dynamics. In addition, we present the first computation of a dynamic length scale, $\xi_d$, in confluent systems using finite-size scaling, and show that the growing relaxation time exhibita a power-law dependence on $\xi_d$. Furthermore, unlike particulate glasses, the static length that governs the finite-size scaling of the relaxation time is proportional to $\xi_d$, revealing the unique nature of the glassy dynamics in confluent systems.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Analysis of Relative Pressure Estimation Methods Utilizing 4D Flow MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02847v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can estimate three-dimensional (3D) time-resolved relative pressure fields using 4D-flow MRI, thereby providing rich pressure field information. Clinical alternatives include catheterization and Doppler echocardiography, which only provide one-dimensional pressure drops. The accuracy of one-dimensional pressure drops derived from 4D-flow has been explored previously, but additional work is needed to evaluate the accuracy of 3D relative pressure field estimates. This work presents an analysis of three state-of-the-art relative pressure estimators: virtual Work-Energy Relative Pressure (vWERP), the Pressure Poisson Estimator (PPE), and the Stokes Estimator (STE). The spatiotemporal characteristics and sensitivity to noise were determined in silico. Estimators were then validated using a type B aortic dissection (TBAD) flow phantom with varying tear geometry and twelve catheter pressure measurements. Finally, the performance of each estimator was evaluated across eight patient cases. In silico pressure field errors were lower in STE compared to PPE, although PPE pressures were less noise sensitive. High velocity gradients and low spatial resolution contributed most significantly to local variations in 3D pressure field errors. Low temporal resolution lead to systematic underestimation of highly transient peak pressure events. In the flow phantom analysis, vWERP was the most accurate method, followed by STE and PPE. Each pressure estimator was strongly correlated with ground truth pressure values, despite the tendency to underestimate peak pressures. Patient case results demonstrated that each pressure estimator could be feasibly integrated into a clinical workflow.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of rotating helices in viscous fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09231v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of a pair of rigid rotating helices in a viscous fluid, as a model for bacterial flagellar bundle and a prototype of microfluidic pumps. Combining experiments with hydrodynamic modeling, we examine how spacing and phase difference between the two helices affect their torque, flow field and fluid transport capacity at low Reynolds numbers. Hydrodynamic coupling reduces the torque when the helices rotate in phase at constant angular speed, but increases the torque when they rotate out of phase. We identify a critical phase difference, at which the hydrodynamic coupling vanishes despite the close spacing between the helices. A simple model, based on the flow characteristics and positioning of a single helix, is constructed, which quantitatively predicts the torque of the helical pair in both unbounded and confined systems. Lastly, we show the influence of spacing and phase difference on the axial flux and the pump efficiency of the helices. Our findings shed light on the function of bacterial flagella and provide design principles for efficient low-Reynolds-number pumps.</description>
