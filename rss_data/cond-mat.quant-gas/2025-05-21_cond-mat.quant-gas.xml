      <title>Large, ultra-flat optical traps for uniform quantum gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultracold atomic gases with uniform density can be created by flat-bottom optical traps. These gases provide an ideal platform to study many-body physics in a system that allows for simple connections with theoretical models and emulation of numerous effects from a wide range of fields of physics. In Earth-bound laboratories the trap sizes, number of species and states, as well as the range of physical effects are largely restricted by the adopted levitation technique. Homogeneous ultracold gases in microgravity simulators and space however offer an interesting perspective which is actively being pursued. To exploit the full potential of any gravity-compensated laboratory the box potentials created need to be as large as possible. By using two orthogonally aligned acousto-optic deflectors, we create large time-averaged optical potentials with trapping volumes a thousandfold larger than conventional setups, described by power-law scalings with exponents of up to $152$. We verify the performance of our setup by simulating the mean-field behaviour of a quantum gas ground state in conjunction with dynamical excitations due to the realistic time-dependent painting potentials. The implementation of this setup may open new directions at the interface with condensed matter, few-body Efimov physics or the exploration of critical, non-equilibrium phenomena.</description>

      <title>Engineering the Kondo impurity problem with alkaline-earth atom arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose quantum simulation experiments of the Kondo impurity problem using cold alkaline-earth(-like) atoms (AEAs) in a combination of optical lattice and optical tweezer potentials. Within an ab initio model for atomic interactions in the optical potentials, we analyze hallmark signatures of the Kondo effect in a variety of observables accessible in cold-atom quantum simulators. We identify additional terms not part of the textbook Kondo problem, mostly ignored in previous works and giving rise to a direct competition between spin and charge correlations--strongly suppressing Kondo physics. Crucially, we show that the Kondo effect can be restored by locally adjusting the chemical potential on the impurity site. We identify realistic parameter regimes and preparation protocols suited to current experiments with AEA arrays. Our work paves the way for novel quantum simulations of the Kondo problem and offers new insights into Kondo physics in unconventional regimes.</description>

      <title>Dynamic correlations of frustrated quantum spins from high-temperature expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For quantum spin systems in equilibrium, the dynamic structure factor (DSF) is among the most feature-packed experimental observables. However, from a theory perspective it is often hard to simulate in an unbiased and accurate way, especially for frustrated and high-dimensional models at intermediate temperature. We address this challenge by introducing a dynamic extension of the high-temperature expansion as an efficient numerical approach to the DSF for arbitrary lattices. We focus on the nearest-neighbor Heisenberg model and spin-lengths S=1/2 and 1. We present a user-friendly numerical implementation and provide comprehensive benchmarks on spin chains. As applications we treat a variety of frustrated two- and three dimensional antiferromagnets. In particular we shed new light on the anomalous intermediate temperature regime of the S=1/2 triangular lattice model and reproduce the DSF measured recently for a S=1 pyrochlore material.</description>

      <title>Tailoring Synthetic Gauge Fields in Ultracold Atoms via Spatially Engineered Vector Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15479v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultracold atoms, typically manipulated by scalar beams with uniform polarization, have propelled advances in quantum simulation, computation, and metrology. Yet, vector beams (VBs) -- structured light with spatially varying polarization -- remain unexplored in this context, despite their enhanced tunability and broad optical applications. Here, we demonstrate a novel scheme to generate synthetic gauge fields in ultracold atoms via VB-mediated coupling of internal states. This approach enables angular stripe phases across an expanded parameter range, achieving a three-order-of-magnitude enhancement in the phase diagram and facilitating experimental observation. We further present an all-optical method to create topologically nontrivial giant skyrmions in spin space, with tunable topology governed by VB parameters. Our findings establish VBs as powerful tools for quantum control and the exploration of exotic quantum states and phases.</description>

      <title>Excitonic topology and quantum geometry in organic semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11951v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Excitons drive the optoelectronic properties of organic semiconductors which underpin devices including solar cells and light-emitting diodes. Here we show that excitons can exhibit topologically non-trivial states protected by inversion symmetry and identify a family of organic semiconductors realising the predicted excitonic topological phases. We also demonstrate that the topological phase can be controlled through experimentally realisable strains and chemical functionalisation of the material. Appealing to quantum Riemannian geometry, we predict that topologically non-trivial excitons have a lower bound on their centre-of-mass spatial spread, which can significantly exceed the size of a unit cell. Furthermore, we show that the dielectric environment allows control over the excitonic quantum geometry. The discovery of excitonic topology and excitonic Riemannian geometry in organic materials brings together two mature fields and suggests many new possibilities for a range of future optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>Quantum thermal machine regimes in the transverse-field Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23710v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We identify and interpret the possible quantum thermal machine regimes with a transverse-field Ising model as the working substance. In general, understanding the emergence of such regimes in a many-body quantum system is challenging due to the dependence on the many energy levels in the system. By considering infinitesimal work strokes, we can understand the operation from equilibrium properties of the system. We find that infinitesimal work strokes enable both heat engine and accelerator operation, with the output and boundaries of operation described by macroscopic properties of the system, in particular the net transverse magnetization. At low temperatures, the regimes of operation and performance can be understood from quasiparticles in the system, while at high temperatures an expansion of the free energy in powers of inverse temperature describes the operation. The understanding generalises to larger work strokes when the temperature difference between the hot and cold reservoirs is large. For hot and cold reservoirs close in temperature, a sufficiently large work stroke can enable refrigerator and heater regimes. Our results and method of analysis will prove useful in understanding the possible regimes of operation of quantum many-body thermal machines more generally.</description>
