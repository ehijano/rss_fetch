      <title>The fixed probe storage ring magnetometer for the Muon g-2 experiment at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of the FNAL E989 experiment is to measure the muon magnetic anomaly to unprecedented accuracy and precision at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. To meet this goal, the time and space averaged magnetic environment in the muon storage volume must be known to better than 70 ppb. A new pulsed proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) magnetometer was designed and built at the University of Washington, Seattle to track the temporal stability of the 1.45T magnetic field in the muon storage ring at this precision. It consists of an array of 378 petroleum jelly based NMR probes that are embedded in the walls of muon storage ring vacuum chambers and custom electronics built with readily available modular radio frequency (RF) components. We give NMR probe construction details and describe the functions of the custom electronic subsystems. The excellent performance metrics of the magnetometer are discussed where after 8 years of operation, the median single shot resolution of the array of probes remains at 11 ppb.</description>

      <title>Hole in the Deuteron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new observable, $A_{node}$, that allows to isolate the node in the S-partial wave distribution of the deuteron in high $Q^2$ electro-disintegration processes with tensor polarized target. The node is a signature of nuclear repulsive core and represents a crucial test of its strength, size as well as the role of the relativistic and non-nucleonic effects in a deeply bound state. Within plane wave impulse approximation the node immitates a ``hole" through which incoming probe passes through without interaction. It is demonstrated that high $Q^2$ electro-disintegration processes due to their strong anisotropy of final state interaction effects, allow to gain an unprecedented access to the node, opening up a new venue in probing elusive dynamics of the nuclear repulsive core.</description>

      <title>Entanglement and coherence of the wobbling mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The entanglement and coherence of the wobbling mode are studied in the framework of the particle plus triaxial rotor model for the one-quasiparticle nucleus $^{135}$Pr and the two-quasiparticles nucleus $^{130}$Ba. The focus lies on the coupling between the total and the particle angular momenta. Using the Schmidt decomposing, it is quantified in terms of the von Neumann entropy of the respective sub-systems, which measures their mutual entanglement. The entropy and the entanglement increase with spin $I$ and number of wobbling quanta $n$. The coherence of the wobbling mode is studied by means of the eigenstate decomposition of its reduced density matrix. To a good approximation, the probability distributions of the total angular momentum can be interpreted as the incoherent combination of the coherent contributions from the first two pairs of eigenvectors with the largest weight of the reduced density matrix. Decoherence measures are defined, which, in accordance, scatter between 0.1 to 0.2 at low spin and between 0.1 and 0.3 at high spin. Entanglement in the framework of the adiabatic approximation is further analyzed. In general, the coherent eigenstates of the effective collective Hamiltonian approximate the reduced density matrix with the limited accuracy of its pair of eigenstates with the largest weight. As the adiabatic approximation becomes more accurate with decreasing excitation energy, the probability distribution of the angle of the total angular momentum around a principal axis approaches the one of the full reduced density matrix. The $E2$ transition probabilities and spectroscopic quadrupole moments reflect this trend.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic observables of open-shell nuclei from coupled-cluster theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05608v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a new method to describe electromagnetic observables of open-shell nuclei with two nucleons outside a closed shell. This approach combines the equation-of-motion coupled-cluster method for such systems and the Lorentz integral transform technique, expanding the applicability of coupled-cluster theory for these properties beyond closed-shell nuclei. To validate this new approach, we compute the non-energy-weighted dipole sum rule and the dipole polarizability of $^{16,24}$O in both the closed-shell and the new equation-of-motion coupled-cluster frameworks, finding agreement within error bars. We then analyze the evolution of the dipole polarizability along the oxygen and calcium isotopic chains. Our predictions agree well with available experimental data and other available theoretical calculations for the closed-shell $^{16,22}$O and the open-shell $^{18}$O. In the calcium isotopes, we observe that our dipole polarizability predictions for open-shell nuclei are lower than those of closed-shell nuclei. Our predictions for $^{24}$O and $^{54,56}$Ca will motivate future experimental studies at the dripline.</description>

      <title>In-medium changes of nucleon cross sections tested in neutrino-induced reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05921v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Historically studied in the context of heavy-ion collisions, the extent to which free nucleon-nucleon cross sections are modified in-medium remains undetermined by these data sets. Therefore, we investigate the impact of NN in-medium modifications on neutrino-nucleus cross section predictions using the GiBUU transport model. We find that including an in-medium lowering of the NN cross section and density dependence on $\Delta$ excitation improves agreement with MicroBooNE neutrino-argon scattering data. This is observed for both proton and neutral pion spectra in charged-current muon neutrino and neutral-current single pion production datasets. The impact of collision broadening of the $\Delta$ resonance is also investigated. The absence of $\Delta$ broadening is slightly favored, but the larger uncertainties on the pion production data prevent definitive conclusions.</description>

      <title>Four-dimensional QCD equation of state with multiple chemical potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11610v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a four-dimensional version of the equation of state (EoS) model NEOS, NEOS-4D, as a function of the temperature and chemical potentials of baryon, electric charge, and strangeness for the hot and dense QCD matter created in relativistic nuclear collisions. This EoS enables multiple conserved charge current evolution in a relativistic fluid. Input from Lattice QCD simulations and a hadron resonance gas model is considered for constructing the equation of state. We investigate its applicability to the relativistic hydrodynamic description of nuclear collisions and present a method for efficient numerical implementation.</description>
