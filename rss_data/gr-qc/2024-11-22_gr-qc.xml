      <title>Renormalization group flow of projectable Ho\v{r}ava gravity in (3+1) dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a comprehensive numerical study of the renormalization group flow of marginal couplings in $(3+1)$-dimensional projectable Ho\v{r}ava gravity. First, we classify all fixed points of the flow and analyze their stability matrices. We find that some of the stability matrices possess complex eigenvalues and discuss why this does not contradict unitarity. Next, we scan over the renormalization group trajectories emanating from all asymptotically free fixed points. We identify a unique fixed point giving rise to a set of trajectories spanning the whole range of the kinetic coupling $\lambda$ compatible with unitarity. This includes the region $0&lt;\lambda-1\ll 1$ assumed in previous phenomenological applications. The respective trajectories closely follow a single universal trajectory, differing only by the running of the gravitational coupling. The latter exhibits non-monotonic behavior along the flow, vanishing both in the ultraviolet and the infrared limits. The requirement that the theory remains weakly coupled along the renormalization group trajectory implies a natural hierarchy between the scale of Lorentz invariance violation and a much larger value of the Planck mass inferred from low-energy interactions.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-wave signatures of non-violent non-locality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurement of gravitational waves can give precision tests of the nature of black holes and compact objects. In this work, we test Giddings' non-violent non-locality proposal, which posits that quantum information is transferred via a nonlocal interaction that generates metric perturbations around black holes. In contrast to firewalls, these quantum fluctuations would be spread out over a larger distance range up to a Schwarzschild radius away. In this letter, we model the modification to the gravitational waveform from non-violent non-locality. We modify the nonspinning EOBNRv2 effective one body waveform to include metric perturbations that are due to a random Gaussian process. We find that the waveform exhibits random deviations which are particularly important in the late inspiral-plunge phase. We find an optimal dephasing parameter for detecting this effect with a principal component analysis. This is particularly intriguing because it predicts random phase deviations across different gravitational wave events, providing theoretical support for hierarchical tests of general relativity. We estimate the constraint on the perturbations in non-violent non-locality with events for the LIGO-Virgo network and for a third generation network.</description>

      <title>Unique and Universal Effects of Oscillation in Eccentric Orbital Binary Black Hole Mergers beyond Orbital Averaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze 192 sets of binary black hole merger data in eccentric orbits obtained from RIT, decomposing the radiation energy into three distinct phases through time: inspiral, late inspiral to merger, and ringdown. Our investigation reveals a universal oscillatory behavior in radiation energy across these phases, influenced by varying initial eccentricities. From a post-Newtonian perspective, we compare the orbital average of radiation energy with the non-orbital average during the inspiral phase. Our findings indicate that the oscillatory patterns arise from non-orbital average effects, which disappear when orbital averaging is applied. This orbital effect significantly impacts the mass, spin, and recoil velocity of the merger remnant, with its influence increasing as the initial eccentricity rises. Specifically, in the post-Newtonian framework, the amplitudes of oscillations for mass, spin, and recoil velocity at ${e_t}_0 = 0.5$ (initial temporal eccentricity of PN) are enhanced by approximately 10, 5, and 7 times, respectively, compared to those at ${e_t}_0 = 0.1$. For a circular orbit, where ${e_t}_0 = 0.0$, the oscillations vanish entirely. These findings have important implications for waveform modeling, numerical relativity simulations, and the characterization of binary black hole formation channels.</description>

      <title>Prepare inflationary universe via the Euclidean charged wormhole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a wavefunction of the universe, which correspond to an Euclidean charged wineglass (half)-wormholes semiclassically, as a possible creation for our inflationary universe. We calculate the Euclidean action of the charged wormhole, and find that the initial state of universe brought by such an Euclidean charged wormhole can exhibit a high probability weight for a long period of inflation. We compare our result with that of axion wormholes, and evaluate the potential of other corresponding Euclidean configurations as the pre-inflationary initial states.</description>

      <title>Charged Fuzzy Dark Matter Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of fuzzy dark matter (FDM) on supermassive black holes (SMBHs) characterized by a spherical charge distribution. This work introduces a new class of spherically symmetric, self-gravitational relativistic charged models for FDM haloes, using the Einasto density model. This study enables the dark matter (DM) to appear as the matter ingredient, which constructs the black hole and extends the non-commutative mini black hole stellar solutions. By considering the charged anisotropic energy-momentum tensor with an equation of state (EoS) $p_{r}=-\rho$, we explore various black hole solutions for different values of the Einasto index and mass parameter. Our approach suggests that the central density of the resulting black hole model mimics the usual de Sitter core. Furthermore, we discuss the possibility of constructing a charged self-gravitational droplet by replacing the above-mentioned EoS with a non-local one. However, under these circumstances, the radial pressure is observed to be negative. Ultimately, we consider various possibilities of constructing DM black holes, featuring intermediate masses that could evolve into galaxies. Consequently, some of these theoretical models have the potential to replace the usual black hole solutions of the galactic core. Simultaneously, these models are physically beneficial for being comprised of the fundamental matter component of the cosmos. Due to the outcomes of this paper, we would be able to study the connection between BH and DM by formulating stable stellar structures featuring fuzzy mass distributions derived from the Einasto distribution of DM halos.</description>

      <title>Observing the eye of the storm I: testing regular black holes with LVK and EHT observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to the celebrated singularity theorems, space-time singularities in general relativity are inevitable. However, it is generally believed that singularities do not exist in nature, and their existence suggests the necessity of a new theory of gravity. In this paper, we investigated a regular astrophysically viable space-time (regular in the sense that it is singularity-free) from the observational point of view using observations from the LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA (LVK), and the event horizon telescope (EHT) collaborations. This black hole solution depends on a free parameter $\ell$ in addition to the mass, $M$, and the spin, $a$, violating, in this way, the non-hair theorem/conjecture. In the case of gravitational wave observations, we use the catalogs GWTC-1, 2, and 3 to constrain the free parameter. In the case of the EHT, we use the values of the angular diameter reported for SgrA* and M87*. We also investigated the photon ring structure by considering scenarios such as static spherical accretion, infalling spherical accretion, and thin accretion disk. Our results show that the EHT observations constrain the free parameter $\ell$ to the intervals $0\leq \ell \leq 0.148$ and $0\leq \ell \leq 0.212$ obtained for SgrA* and M87*, respectively. On the other hand, GW observations constrain the free parameter with values that satisfy the theoretical limit, particularly those events for which $\ell&lt;&lt;1$. Our results show that the most stringent constraints on $\ell$ correspond to the events GW191204-171526 ($\ell=0.041^{+0.106}_{-0.041}$) and GW190924-021846 ($\ell=0.050^{+0.165}_{-0.050}$) for the SEOB model.</description>

      <title>Dissecting Buchdahl's limit: A surgeon's guide to compact objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the theoretical motivations behind the belief that black holes as described by general relativity exist in nature is that it is hard to find matter configurations that mimic their properties, especially their compactness. One of the classic results that goes in this direction is the so-called Buchdahl limit: a bound for the maximum compactness that, under a few assumptions, static fluid spheres in hydrostatic equilibrium can possibly have. We highlight two of the main assumptions that could be violated in physically realistic situations: i) isotropy and ii) an outward-decreasing monotonicity of the density profile, which, as we discuss in detail, can be understood as a form of energy condition. We construct a pair of toy models that exemplify how the Buchdahl limit can be overcome if any of these two assumptions is individually relaxed. In particular, we show that relaxing the monotonicity assumption alone yields a new, less restrictive compactness limit as long as the energy density is not allowed to become negative. If negative energies are permitted, the compactness of these toy models can be as close to the black hole limit as desired. We also discuss how these toy models represent some of the main features of realistic systems, and how they could be extended to find more refined models.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Effective Field Theories and Black Hole Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This PhD thesis is submitted to arXiv as a pedagogical resource on gravitational effective field theories and the laws of black hole mechanics. It begins with an introduction to the mathematics and intuition behind effective field theory (EFT) corrections to General Relativity (GR) pitched at the level of a first year postgraduate course. Chapter 3 contains a similarly accessible discussion of the laws of black hole mechanics, their derivation in GR, and why they are a particularly interesting setting in which to apply EFT.
  The novel research is contained in Chapters 2 and 4-7. The first of these studies the well-posedness of gravitational EFTs. Specifically, we show that a "modified harmonic" gauge produces a strongly hyperbolic formulation of the leading order Einstein-Maxwell EFT so long as the higher derivative terms are small. The latter Chapters are concerned with proving the validity of the laws of black hole mechanics in EFTs of gravity and broad classes of matter fields. We demonstrate that the zeroth law can be proved for EFTs of gravity, electromagnetism and a charged or uncharged scalar field. We find we must modify the statements of the first and second laws by generalizing the formula of black hole entropy from the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy used in GR. For stationary black holes, the Wald entropy is a sufficient definition to satisfy the first law in EFT. For dynamical black holes we show that with further corrections we can prove a non-perturbative second law. We discuss the gauge dependence of this definition of dynamical black hole entropy and provide explicit constructions for specific EFTs.</description>

      <title>Dynamical friction can flip the hierarchical three-body system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the long-term effects of non-linear perturbations were found to be important for the evolution of the hierarchical triple system, which, for the central third body of a larger mass, can significantly suppress the occurrences of orbital flip that changes the sign of angular momentum of inner binary. However, as the third-body mass increases significantly, the ambient dark matter spike becomes much more dense, rendering the effect of dynamical friction non-negligible. In this work, we take the dynamical friction into account for the first time in the hierarchical triple system up to the octupole order and find that the suppressed occurrences of orbital flip could be recovered, making the detection of orbital flip a potential probe of the dark matter via observations of either electromagnetic waves or gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Probing dark matter halo profiles with multi-band observations of gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we evaluate the potential of multiband gravitational wave observations to constrain the properties of static dark matter spikes around intermediate-mass ratio inspirals. The influence of dark matter on the orbital evolution of the compact binary is incorporated as a correction to the inspiral Newtonian gravitational waveform. We show that the observations from the proposed space-based detector GWSat, sensitive within the deci-Hz frequency band, when combined with that of the third-generation ground-based detectors like the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, will produce significantly improved error estimates for all parameters. In particular, our results demonstrate that the joint multiband approach substantially refines the bounds on the dark matter spike parameters-namely, the power-law index and spike density-by factors of approximately $10^6$ and $10^3$, respectively, compared to observations employing only third-generation gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Is there any Trinity of Gravity, to start with?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, it has been rather fashionable to talk about geometric trinity of gravity. The main idea is that one can formally present the gravity equations in different terms, those of either torsion or nonmetricity instead of curvature. It starts from a very erroneous claim that the Levi-Civita connection, and therefore the (pseudo-)Riemannian geometry itself, are nothing but an arbitrary choice. The point is that, as long as we admit the need of having a metric for describing gravity, the standard approach does not involve any additional independent geometric structures on top of that. At the same time, any other metric-affine model does go for genuinely new stuff. In particular, the celebrated teleparallel framework introduces a notion of yet another parallel transport which is flat. It gives us curious new ways of modifying gravity, even though very often quite problematic. However, in GR-equivalent models, we only get a new language for describing the same physics, in terms of absolutely unobservable and unpredictable geometrical inventions. For sure, one can always safely create novel constructions which do not influence the physical equations of motion, but in itself it does not make much sense and blatantly goes against the Occam's razor.</description>

      <title>The Black Hole Singularity as a Thermodynamic System being the Seat of BH Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We argue in this paper that the entropy of the BH is located in the BH singularity and that the localization around the event horizon is perhaps a secondary effect. We show in particular that the dependence of the entropy located in the singularity is also proportional to $M^2$. We furthermore show that our analysis leads in a natural way to information loss as the micro structure of the BH singularity is of a completely different character compared to ordinary quantum space time underlying our classical space time manifold.</description>

      <title>Dark universe inspired by the Kaluza-Klein gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the potential implications of Kaluza-Klein (KK) gravity in unifying the dark sector of the Universe. Through dimensional reduction in KK gravity, the 5D spacetime framework can be reformulated in terms of a 4D spacetime metric, along with additional scalar and vector fields. From the 4D perspective, this suggests the existence of a tower of particle states, including KK gravitons with massive spin-0 and spin-1 states, in addition to the massless spin-2 gravitons of general relativity (GR). By assuming a minimal coupling between the self-interacting scalar field and the gauge field, a "mass" term emerges for the spin-1 gravitons. This, in turn, leads to long-range gravitational effects that could modify Newton's law of gravity through Yukawa-type corrections. We draw an analogy with superconductivity theory, where the condensation of a scalar field results in the emergence of massive spin-1 particles producing repulsive forces, along with an increase of the gravitational force due the correction to Newton's constant. Assuming an environment-dependent mass for the spin-1 graviton, near the galactic center the repulsive force from this spin-1 graviton is suppressed by an additional attractive component from Newton's constant corrections, resulting in a Newtonian-like, attraction-dominated effect. In the galaxy's outer regions, the repulsive force fades due to its short range, making dark matter appear only as an effective outcome of the dominant attractive corrections. This approach also explains dark matter's emergence as an apparent effects on cosmological scales while our model is equivalent to the scalar-vector-tensor gravity theory. Finally, we examine the impact of dark matter on the primordial gravitational wave (PGW) spectrum and show that it is sensitive to dark matter effects, providing an opportunity to test this theory through future GW observatories.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave signatures from reheating in Chern-Simons running-vacuum cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the context of a Chern-Simons running-vacuum-model (RVM) cosmology, one expects an early-matter dominated (eMD) reheating period after RVM inflation driven by the axion field. Treating thus in this work Chern-Simons RVM cosmology as an effective $f(R)$ gravity theory characterized by logarithmic corrections of the spacetime curvature, we study the gravitational-wave (GW) signal induced by the nearly-scale invariant inflationary adiabatic curvature perturbations during the transition from the eMD era driven by the axion to the late radiation-dominated era. Remarkably, by accounting for the extra GW scalaron polarization present within $f(R)$ gravity theories, we find regions in the parameter space of the theory where one is met with a distinctive induced GW signal with a universal $f^6$ high-frequency scaling compared to the $f^7$ scaling present in general relativity (GR). Interestingly enough, for axion masses $m_a$ higher than 1 GeV and axion gauge couplings $f_a$ above $10^{-3}$ Planck mass, one can produce induced GW spectra within the sensitivity bands of future GW observatories such as the Einstein Telescope (ET), the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), the Big Bang Observer (BBO) and the Square Kilometer Arrays (SKA).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we use the solution phase space approach based on the covariant phase space formalism to compute the conserved charges of the BTZ black hole, namely mass, angular momentum, and entropy. Furthermore, we discuss the first law of the BTZ black hole and the Smarr relation. For completeness, outer horizon and inner horizon cases have been all included. Additionally, the results of the three-dimensional Kerr-dS spacetime have also been obtained. Our results are consistent with previous investigations. Considering the simplicity of the circumstances, we have presented the most detailed possible information, with the aim of facilitating research in related fields.</description>

      <title>General Relativistic Center-of-Mass Coordinates for Composite Quantum Particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent proposals suggested quantum clock interferometry for tests of the Einstein equivalence principle. However, atom interferometric models often include relativistic effects only in an ad hoc fashion. Here, instead, we start from the multi-particle nature of quantum-delocalizable atoms in curved spacetime and generalize the special-relativistic center of mass (COM) and relative coordinates that have previously been studied for Minkowski spacetime to obtain the light-matter dynamics in curved spacetime. In particular, for a local Schwarzschild observer located at the surface of the Earth using Fermi-Walker coordinates, we find gravitational correction terms for the Poincar\'e symmetry generators and use them to derive general relativistic COM and relative coordinates. In these coordinates we obtain the Hamiltonian of a fully first-quantized two-particle atom interacting with the electromagnetic field in curved spacetime that naturally incorporates special and general relativistic effects.</description>

      <title>Modified gravity from Weyl connection and the $f(R,\cal{A})$ extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use Weyl connection and Weyl geometry in order to construct novel modified gravitational theories. In the simplest case where one uses only the Weyl-connection Ricci scalar as a Lagrangian, the theory recovers general relativity. However, by upgrading the Weyl field to a dynamical field with a general potential and/or general couplings constructed from its trace, leads to new modified gravity theories, where the extra degree of freedom is the Weyl field. Additionally, since the Weyl-connection Ricci scalar differs from the Levi-Civita Ricci scalar by terms up to first derivatives of the Weyl field, the resulting field equations for both the metric and the Weyl field are of second order, and thus the theory is free from Ostrogradsky ghosts. Finally, we construct the most general theory, namely the $f(\tilde{R},\cal{A})$ gravity, which is also ghost free and has $2+2$ degrees of freedom. Applying the above classes of theories at a cosmological framework we obtain an effective dark energy sector of geometrical origin. In the simplest class of theories we are able to obtain an effective cosmological constant, and thus we recover $\Lambda$CDM paradigm, nevertheless in more general cases we acquire a dynamical dark energy. These theories can reproduce the thermal history of the Universe, and the corresponding dark energy equation-of-state parameter presents a rich behavior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider quantum gravity with zero cosmological constant in three dimensions. First, we show that pure quantum gravity can be written as a magnetic Carrollian theory living on null infinity, described by Schwarzian-like degrees of freedom. Next, we couple quantum gravity to massless matter. Transition amplitudes exhibit several features that resemble soft graviton physics in four dimensions, despite the absence of a propagating graviton. As in four dimensions, we find three equivalent results: a soft graviton theorem, an infinite-dimensional BMS asymptotic symmetry, and a gravitational memory effect. We also resolve some extant puzzles concerning the partition function and Hilbert space of pure 3d gravity with zero cosmological constant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In light of recent observations, we study evidence for thawing quintessence over a cosmological constant as dark energy, with emphasis on the effect of the choice of priors. Working with a parametrization for the equation of state parameter motivated by the theory, we find a preference for thawing quintessence compared to a bare cosmological constant {\it only} if we use priors which are heavily informed by the data itself. If we extend the priors to physically better motivated ranges, the evidence for thawing quintessence disappears.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we extend the study of soft limits to (Anti) de Sitter spaces, investigating the analytic structure of holographic gluon correlators as part of a broader effort to reveal new symmetries and fundamental structures in gauge theories. By reorganizing perturbation theory in AdS to align with flat space unitarity, we analyze the contributions intrinsic to curved spacetime and their behavior in the soft limit. Our analysis uncovers schematic relations between $(n+1)$-point amplitude and $n$-point transition amplitudes in arbitrary-dimensional AdS, with explicit results derived for $n=4$ in AdS$_{d+1}$.</description>

      <title>Quantum gravity corrections to the spontaneous excitation of an accelerated atom interacting with a quantum scalar field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) extends the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle by suggesting a minimum observable scale that includes the effects of quantum gravity, which is supposed to potentially result in observable effects far below the Planck energy scale, providing us the opportunity to explore the theory of quantum gravity through physical processes at low energy scale. In present work, we study the corrections induced by the GUP to the spontaneous radiation properties of a two-level atom interacting with a real massless scalar quantum field based on the DDC formalism. The GUP alters the correlation function of the scalar field, consequently affecting the radiative properties of atoms. We compute the rate of change in the mean atomic energy for an atom undergoing inertial motion, uniform acceleration, and uniform circular motion. We show that the GUP can enhance the spontaneous emission rate of an excited state atom in inertial motion; however, it does not alter the stability of the ground-state atom in vacuum. For an atom in uniformly accelerated and uniformly circular motion, the GUP can change both its spontaneous emission and spontaneous excitation rates, and the proper acceleration $a$ can significantly amplify the effect of the GUP on the spontaneous transition rates of the atom.</description>

      <title>Exploration of new experimental strategies for the detection of ultralight dark matter : laboratory searches on ground and in space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultralight dark matter (ULDM), as a class of low mass (&lt; 1 eV) dark matter (DM) candidates, is a compelling alternative to historically dominant models such as WIMPs and has recently gained significant attention in the scientific community. In this thesis, we study various experimental schemes for the direct detection of ULDM, both on ground and in space. More precisely, we propose a theoretical modeling of current and futuristic experiments, and we derive an estimation of their respective sensitivity. We mainly concentrate on three distinct phenomenologies. The first one is the coupling between a DM U(1) field, known as the dark photon (DP), and electromagnetism, which induces a small electric field oscillating at the DP Compton frequency. We study how to detect this electric field using atoms inside a cavity and through dish antennas. The second main phenomenology considered in this thesis is the oscillation of rest mass and transition frequencies of atoms and test masses. These oscillations could be produced by the non-universal coupling of standard matter with a scalar ULDM candidate (dilaton or axion-like particle). We study how to detect such couplings in classical tests of the universality of free fall (UFF), atom interferometry and using LISA. Finally, we study the effect of vacuum birefringence and dichroism induced by the coupling between axions and photons, and how it could be detected with optical cavities, fibers, and LISA.</description>

      <title>Post-processing subtraction of tilt-to-length noise in LISA in the presence of gravitational wave signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will be the first space-based gravitational wave (GW) observatory. It will measure gravitational wave signals in the frequency regime from 0.1 mHz to 1 Hz. The success of these measurements will depend on the suppression of the various instrument noises. One important noise source in LISA will be tilt-to-length (TTL) coupling. Here, it is understood as the coupling of angular jitter, predominantly from the spacecraft, into the interferometric length readout. The current plan is to subtract this noise in-flight in post-processing as part of a noise minimization strategy. It is crucial to distinguish TTL coupling well from the GW signals in the same readout to ensure that the noise will be properly modeled. Furthermore, it is important that the subtraction of TTL noise will not degrade the GW signals. In the present manuscript, we show on simulated LISA data and for four different GW signal types that the GW responses have little effect on the quality of the TTL coupling fit and subtraction. Also, the GW signal characteristics were not altered by the TTL coupling subtraction.</description>

      <title>On the Morphology of Relativistically Broadened Line Emission from Axisymmetric Equatorial Accretion Disks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-frequency emission from an accretion disk around a black hole is broadened into a line profile due to gravitational redshift and the motion of the disk's particles relative to the observer. The ensemble of relativistically broadened emission frequencies from the disk elements forms the spectrum viewed by an observer. Over the past decades, the broadened spectra of accreting systems have been used to constrain the spin of the black hole, the observer's inclination, and the astrophysical model parameters of the system. These inferences are usually made under the assumption that the accretion disk consists of particles orbiting around the black hole on stable circular orbits in the equatorial plane. Under this Standard disk model, in this work, we revisit line profile morphology, i.e., its extent, kinks, and fall-off. We provide a unified analytical explanation for these line profile morphological features, which encode the black hole spin, viewing inclination, and locations of the disk's inner and outer edges. We then show that these features, however, are model-dependent, by parametrically relaxing some of the astrophysical assumptions. In particular, we explore how allowing the disk particles to deviate from stable circular orbits rapidly degenerates the characteristic features of the line profile under the Standard disk model. Our results further demonstrate how sensitive our understanding of black hole and system properties can be to assumptions we make when interpreting these types of measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dirac $\delta-$ distributionally sourced differential equations emerge in many dynamical physical systems from machine learning, finance, neuroscience, and seismology to black hole perturbation theory. These systems lack exact analytical solutions and are thus best tackled numerically. We describe a generic numerical algorithm which constructs discontinuous spatial and temporal discretisations by operating on discontinuous Lagrange and Hermite interpolation formulae, respectively. By solving the distributionally sourced wave equation, possessing analytical solutions, we demonstrate that numerical weak-form solutions can be recovered to high-order accuracy by solving a first-order reduced system of ODEs. The method-of-lines framework is applied to the \texttt{DiscoTEX} algorithm i.e. through \underline{dis}continuous \underline{co}llocation with implicit\underline{-turned-explicit} integration methods which are symmetric and conserve symplectic structure. Furthermore, the main application of the algorithm is proved by calculating the amplitude at any desired location within the numerical grid, including at the position (and at its right and left limit) where the wave- (or wave-like) equation is discontinuous via interpolation using \texttt{DiscoTEX}. This is demonstrated, firstly by solving the wave- (or wave-like) equation and comparing the numerical weak-form solution to the exact solution. We further demonstrate how to reconstruct the gravitational metric perturbations from weak-form numerical solutions of a non-rotating black hole, which do not have known exact analytical solutions, and compare them against state-of-the-art frequency domain results. We conclude by motivating how \texttt{DiscoTEX}, and related numerical algorithms, both open a promising new alternative waveform generation route for modelling highly asymmetric binaries and complement current frequency domain methods.</description>

Abstract: In this research, we have reconstructed the extended $f(\mathcal{P})$ cubic gravity and symmetric $f(\mathcal{Q})$ teleparallel gravity from the $(m,n)$-type Barrow Holographic Dark Energy (BHDE) model. We have derived the unknown functions $f(\mathcal{P})$ and $f(\mathcal{Q})$ in terms of $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{Q}$, assuming a flat, homogeneous, and isotropic universe. To constrain our model parameters, we employed cosmic chronometer datasets and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation datasets, utilizing Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. We analysed the behaviour and stability of each model throughout the universe's evolution by studying crucial parameters such as the deceleration parameter, equation of state (EoS) parameter $\omega_{DE}$, density parameter $\Omega(z)$ and the square of the speed of sound $v_s^2$. Additionally, we explored the cosmographic behaviour by plotting the jerk parameter, snap parameter, and lerk parameter against the redshift. Furthermore, we examined the $\omega'_{DE}-\omega_{DE}$ phase plane, the $(r,s^*)$, $(r,q)$ statefinder parameters, and the $Om(z)$ parameter offers profound revelations about the dynamics of the universe and the distinctive features of dark energy. Our analyses indicated that our model could produce a universe undergoing accelerated expansion with quintessence-type dark energy. These findings contribute to our understanding of the nature of dark energy and the evolution of the cosmos.</description>

      <title>A GPU-accelerated semi-coherent hierarchical search for stellar-mass binary inspiral signals in LISA</title>

Abstract: Searching for gravitational waves from stellar-mass binary black holes with LISA remains a challenging open problem. Conventional template-bank approaches to the search are impossible due to the prohibitive number of templates that would be required. This paper continues the development of a hierarchical semi-coherent stochastic search, extending it to a full end-to-end pipeline that is then applied to multiple mock LISA data streams which include simulated noise. Particle swarm optimization is used as a stochastic search algorithm, tracking multiple maxima of a semi-coherent search statistic defined over source parameter space. The pipeline is accelerated by the use of graphical processing units (GPUs). No prior information from observations by ground-based detectors is used; this is necessary in order to provide advance warning of the merger. We find that the pipeline is able to detect sources with signal-to-noise ratios as low as $\rho\sim 17$, we demonstrate that these searches can directly seed coarse parameter estimation in cases where the search trigger is loud. An example of how the false-alarm probability can be estimated for this type of GW search is also included.</description>

      <title>Dynamical and thermodynamical stability of a charged thin-shell wormhole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A study of the dynamical and thermodynamical stability of a charged thin-shell wormhole built by gluing two Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m geometries is presented. The charge on the shell is linearly related to the matter content. For the dynamical stability, a concise inequality is obtained, valid for any barotropic equation of state that relates the pressure with the energy density at the throat. A thermodynamical description of the system is introduced, which leads to the temperature and the electric potentials. Adopting a linear equation of state for the pressure and a definite form for the entropy function, the set of equilibrium configurations that are both dynamically and thermodynamically stable is found.</description>

      <title>A Study of stable wormhole solution with non-commutative geometry in the framework of $f(R,\mathcal{L}_m, T)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04172v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This research delves into the potential existence of traversable wormholes (WHs) within the framework of $f(R,\mathcal{L}_m, T)$ gravity, a modification that includes the matter Lagrangian and the trace of the energy-momentum tensor with specific coupling strengths $\alpha$ and $\beta$. A thorough examination of WH solutions is undertaken using a constant redshift function in tandem with a linear $f(R,\mathcal{L}_m, T)$ model. The analysis involves deriving WH shape functions based on non-commutative geometry, with a particular focus on Gaussian and Lorentzian matter distributions $\rho$. Constraints on the coupling parameters are developed so that the shape function satisfies both the flaring-out and asymptotic flatness conditions. Moreover, for positive coupling parameters, violating the null energy condition (NEC) at the WH throat $r_0$ demands the presence of exotic matter. For negative couplings, however, we find that exotic matter can be avoided by establishing the upper bound $\beta+\alpha/2&lt;-\frac{1}{\rho r_0^2}-8\pi$. Additionally, the effects of gravitational lensing are explored, revealing the repulsive force of our modified gravity for large negative couplings. Lastly, the stability of the derived WH solutions is verified using the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) formalism.</description>

      <title>A speed limit on tachyon fields from cosmological and fine-structure data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15238v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rolling tachyon is a non-canonical scalar field model well motivated in string theory which naturally predicts variations of the fine-structure constant. Such variations can in principle lead to interesting observable consequences, but they can also lead to extremely tight constraints on these kinds of models. In this work we subject the rolling tachyon model evolving in a variety of potentials to current data and show that most cosmologically interesting evolutions are already strongly excluded. We find $|1+w_0| &lt; 10^{-3}$ from cosmological data and $|1+w_0| &lt; 10^{-9}$ from fine-structure data, leaving the rolling tachyon to either play a role almost entirely equivalent to a cosmological constant or that of a test field. We also find that in most of the allowed parameter space the field evolves very slowly, allowing its evolution to be approximated as an equivalent canonical scalar field.</description>

      <title>Direct Limits on Stochastic Length Fluctuations at Radio Frequencies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09175v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Quantum-Enhanced Space-Time (QUEST) experiment consists of a pair of co-located Power Recycled Michelson Interferometers, each designed to have a broadband, shot-noise limited displacement sensitivity of $2\times10^{-19}$ $\mathrm{m/\sqrt{Hz}}$ from 1 to 200 MHz. Here we present the first results of QUEST that set new upper limits on correlated length fluctuations from 13 to 80 MHz, constituting the first broadband constraints for a stochastic gravitational wave background at these frequencies. In a coincident observing run of $10^{4}$ s the averaging of the cross-correlation spectra between the two interferometer signals resulted in a strain sensitivity of $3\times10^{-20}$ $\mathrm{1/\sqrt{Hz}}$ at 40 MHz, making QUEST the most sensitive table-top interferometric system to date.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07692v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a scalar field theory with a Minkowski false vacuum and an unbounded (or very deep) true vacuum. We show compelling evidence that an AdS bubble of vanishing total energy, embedded in asymptotically flat spacetime, generically undergoes a spherical collapse which leads to a space-like curvature singularity after the formation of trapped surfaces and apparent horizons. The crunch singularity, which is hided behind an apparent horizon, occurs before the true vacuum is reached, and the existence of a lower bound of the scalar field potential is not a necessary condition for its formation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.08751v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quasinormal modes and frequencies are the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of a non-Hermitian differential operator. They hold crucial significance in the physics of black holes. The analysis of quasinormal modes of black holes in asymptotically Anti-de Sitter geometries plays also a key role in the study of strongly coupled quantum many-body systems via gauge/gravity duality. In contrast to normal Sturm-Liouville operators, the eigenvalues of non-Hermitian (and non-normal) operators generally exhibit instability under small perturbations. This research focuses on the stability analysis of quasinormal frequencies pertaining to asymptotically planar AdS black holes, employing pseudospectrum analysis. Specifically, we concentrate on the pseudospectra of scalar and transverse gauge fields, shedding light on their relevance within the framework of gauge/gravity duality.</description>

      <title>Binary vision: The merging black hole binary mass distribution via iterative density estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.12092v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Binary black hole (BBH) systems detected via gravitational-wave (GW) emission are a recently opened astrophysical frontier with many unknowns and uncertainties. Accurate reconstruction of the binary distribution with as few assumptions as possible is desirable for inference on formation channels and environments. Most population analyses have, though, assumed a power law in binary mass ratio $q$, and/or assumed a universal $q$ distribution regardless of primary mass. Kernel density estimation (KDE)-based methods allow us to dispense with such assumptions and directly estimate the joint binary mass distribution. We deploy a self-consistent iterative method to estimate this full BBH mass distribution, finding local maxima in primary mass consistent with previous investigations and a secondary mass distribution with a partly independent structure, inconsistent with both power laws and with a constant function of $q$. We find a weaker preference for near-equal mass binaries than in most previous investigations; instead, the secondary mass has its own "spectral lines" at slightly lower values than the primary, and we observe an anti-correlation between primary and secondary masses around the ~$10M_\odot$ peak.</description>

      <title>Aspects of $T\bar{T}+J\bar{T }$ deformed Schwarzian: From gravity partition function to late-time spectral form factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16658v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate different thermodynamic properties of $T\bar{T}+J\bar{T}$ deformed Schwarzian theory and its different gravitational perspectives. First, we compute the partition function of $U(1)$ coupled 2D-gravity with fixed chemical potential, obtained from the dimensional reduction of the four-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell theory. Then, we compute the partition function of the gravity theory which is the dual to the deformed Schwarzian living on its boundary and study the genus expansion of the one and two-point correlation function of the partition function of the theory. Subsequently, we use the one-point function to compute the "Annealed" and "Quenched" free energy in low-temperature limits and make a qualitative comparison with the undeformed theory. Then, using the two-point function, we compute the Spectral Form Factor of the deformed theory in early and late time. We find a dip and ramp structure in early and late time, respectively. We also get a plateau structure in the $\tau$-scaling limit. Last but not least, we comment on the late-time topology change to give a physical interpretation of the ramp of the Spectral Form Factor for our theory.</description>

      <title>Black hole-neutron star mergers with massive neutron stars in numerical relativity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18714v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the merger of black hole-neutron star (BH-NS) binaries in numerical relativity, focusing on the properties of the remnant disk and the ejecta, varying the mass of compactness of the NS and the mass and spin of the BH. We find that within the precision of our numerical simulations, the remnant disk mass and ejecta mass normalized by the NS baryon mass ($\hat{M}_{\rm{rem}}$ and $\hat{M}_{\rm{eje}}$, respectively), and the cutoff frequency $f_{\rm{cut}}$ normalized by the initial total gravitational mass of the system at infinite separation approximately agree among the models with the same NS compactness $C_{\rm{NS}}=M_{\rm{NS}}/R_{\rm{NS}}$, mass ratio $Q=M_{\rm{BH}}/M_{\rm{NS}}$, and dimensionless BH spin $\chi_{\rm{BH}}$ irrespective of the NS mass $M_{\rm{NS}}$ in the range of $1.092$--$1.691\,M_\odot$. This result shows that the merger outcome depends sensitively on $Q$, $\chi_{\rm BH}$, and $C_{\rm{NS}}$ but only weekly on $M_{\rm{NS}}$. This justifies the approach of studying the dependence of NS tidal disruptions on the NS compactness by fixing the NS mass but changing the EOS. We further perform simulations with massive NSs of $M_{\rm{NS}}=1.8M_{\odot}$, and compare our results of $\hat{M}_{\rm{rem}}$ and $\hat{M}_{\rm{eje}}$ with those given by existing fitting formulas to test their robustness for more compact NSs. We find that the fitting formulas obtained in the previous studies are accurate within the numerical errors assumed, while our results also suggest that further improvement is possible by systematically performing more precise numerical simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00776v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finsler geometry is a natural generalization of (pseudo-)Riemannian geometry, where the line element is not the square root of a quadratic form but a more general homogeneous function. Parameterizing this in terms of symmetric tensors suggests a possible interpretation in terms of higher-spin fields. We will see here that, at linear level in these fields, the Finsler version of the Ricci tensor leads to the curved-space Fronsdal equation for all spins, plus a Stueckelberg-like coupling. Nonlinear terms can also be systematically analyzed, suggesting a possible interacting structure. No particular choice of spacetime dimension is needed. The Stueckelberg mechanism breaks gauge transformations to a redundancy that does not change the geometry. This creates a serious issue: non-transverse modes are not eliminated, at least for the versions of Finsler dynamics examined in this paper.</description>

      <title>Detecting kHz gravitons from a neutron star merger with a multi-mode resonant mass detector</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a multi-mode bar consisting of mass elements of decreasing size for the implementation of a gravitational version of the photo-electric effect through the stimulated absorption of up to kHz gravitons from a binary neutron star merger and post-merger. We find that the multi-mode detector has normal modes that retain the coupling strength to the gravitational wave of the largest mass-element, while only having an effective mass comparable to the mass of the smallest element. This allows the normal modes to have graviton absorption rates due to the tonne-scale largest mass, while the single graviton absorption process in the normal mode could be resolved through energy measurements of a mass-element in-principle smaller than pico-gram scale. We argue the feasibility of directly counting gravito-phonons in the bar through energy measurements of the end mass. This improves the transduction of the single-graviton signal, enhancing the feasibility of detecting single gravitons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04372v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The holographic duality (also known as AdS/CFT correspondence or gauge/gravity duality) postulates that strongly coupled quantum field theories can be described in a dual way in asymptotically Anti-de Sitter space. One of the cornerstones of this duality is the description of thermal states as black holes with asymptotically Anti-de Sitter boundary conditions. This idea has led to valuable insights into such fields as transport theory and relativistic hydrodynamics. In this context, the quasinormal modes of such black holes play a decisive role and therefore their stability properties are of upmost interest for the holographic duality. We review recent results using the method of pseudospectra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04756v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend a previously successful discussion of the constrained Schr\"{o}dinger system through the Dirac--Bergmann algorithm to the case of the Dirac field. In order to follow the analogy, first we discuss the classical Dirac field as a spinorial variable, by introducing properly defined momenta and a suitably modified, factor ordered Poisson bracket. According to the Dirac--Bergmann algorithm two second class Hamiltonian constraints emerge, leading to a factor ordered Dirac bracket on the full phase space. This becomes the Poisson bracket on the reduced phase space in the canonical chart adapted to the shell. The Dirac equation is recovered both as consistency condition on the full phase space and as canonical equation on the reduced phase space. Alternatively, considering the Dirac field as odd Grassmann variable, we present the details of the Dirac--Bergmann algorithm (with either left and righ derivatives acting on Grassmann valued superfunctions and involving a different type of generalized Poisson and Dirac brackets). We propose a recipe for the canonical second quantization of all three versions of the generalized Dirac brackets, yielding the correct fundamental anticommutator.</description>

Abstract: A variety of high-energy events can take place in the seconds leading up to a binary neutron-star merger. Mechanisms involving tidal resonances, electrodynamic interactions, or shocks in mass-loaded wakes have been proposed as instigators of these precursors. With a view of gravitational-wave and multimessenger astrophysics more broadly, premerger observations and theory are reviewed emphasising how gamma-ray precursors and dynamical tides can constrain the neutron-star equation of state, thermodynamic microphysics, and evolutionary pathways. Connections to post-merger phenomena, notably gamma-ray bursts, are discussed together with how magnetic fields, spin and misalignment, crustal elasticity, and stratification gradients impact observables.</description>

      <title>Discrete Spectrum of Interior Length and Timeshift in Two-sided Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20662v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the spectrum of the interior length and the horizon timeshift of a two-sided black hole by constructing non-perturbative length and timeshift operators in Jackiew-Teitelboim gravity. We first construct projection operators onto the fixed length or fixed horizon timeshift subspaces using the replica trick. We calculate the densities of state for the length and the timeshift, which are found to be finite. This finiteness implies the discreteness in the spectrum of these quantities. We then construct the non-perturbative length and timeshift operators, and apply them to study the time evolution of the two-sided black hole. We find that at early time, the probability distribution of the interior length and the timeshift are sharply peaked at the classical values, while after the Heisenberg time, the distribution is completely uniform over all possible values of the length and the timeshift, indicating maximal uncertainty. In particular, the probability of having the negative timeshift states, which corresponds to the white hole probability, is $O(1)$ after the Heisenberg time.</description>

      <title>Hyper-Hermitian Weyl Double Copy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21610v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The self-dual double copy is further explored. In previous work, it has been shown that hyper-Hermitian manifolds also have associated the self-dual gauge theories via Kerr-Schild double copy. The self-dual double copy is generalized in the structure of the kinematic algebra by replacing the area-preserving diffeomorphisms algebra with the diffeomorphisms on a surface algebra. This gave rise to the hyper-Hermitian double copy in the Kerr-Schild approach. In the present article, we further study the hyper-Hermitian case using the Weyl double copy formalism. In particular, we have found solutions within this formalism for different hyper-Hermitian metrics. One of the main features is that there will be two Maxwell spinors and one of them is source-free while the other has a source current. This is compatible with the fact that, in general, the hyper-Hermitian spaces are not Ricci-flat.</description>

      <title>Classification of the trajectories of uncharged particles in the Schwarzschild-Melvin metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the trajectories of neutral particles in the Schwarzschild-Melvin spacetime. After reduction by cyclic coordinates this problem reduces to investigating a two-degree-of-freedom Hamiltonian system that has no additional integral. A classification of regions of possible motion of a particle is performed according to the values of the momentum and energy integrals. Bifurcations of periodic solutions of the reduced system are analyzed using a Poincare map.</description>
