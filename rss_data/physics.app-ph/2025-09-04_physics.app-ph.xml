      <title>Challenges in Scaling ScAlN Bulk Acoustic Wave Filters toward Ku-Band Frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper reports an 11.7 GHz compact filter based on Scandium Aluminum Nitride (ScAlN) Film Bulk Acoustic Resonators (FBARs) and provides a detailed analysis of the fundamental challenges that limit performance when scaling to higher frequencies. A 50 {\Omega} ladder filter based on single-layer thin film ScAlN with Platinum (Pt) electrodes was demonstrated at 11.7 GHz with a 3 dB fractional bandwidth (FBW) of 4.0% and an out of band rejection greater than 23.1 dB. However, the filter exhibits a moderate insertion loss (IL) of 6.8 dB, which is attributed to a limited Quality (Q) factor in the constituent resonators. Consequently, we identify and analyze three primary challenges in frequency scaling ScAlN FBARs with thinner film stacks: 1) degradation of piezoelectric thin-film crystal quality, 2) increased series resistance in ultra-thin electrodes, and 3) residual film stress that limits device size and structural integrity. By establishing a clear relationship between these fabrication-level challenges and the resulting device performance, this work provides critical insights for the future development of low-loss acoustic filters for millimeter-wave applications.</description>

      <title>Polarization control via artificial optical nonlinearity in dielectric metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear optical phenomena are generally governed by geometry in matter systems, as they depend on the spatial arrangement of atoms within materials or molecules. Metasurfaces, through precisely designed geometries on a subwavelength scale, allow tailoring the optical response of a material far beyond its natural properties. Therefore, metasurfaces are highly appealing to enable the engineering of nonlinear optical interactions at an unprecedented level. Current studies on nonlinear metasurfaces predominantly focus on the phase control of the generated light. Nonetheless, investigating the tensorial nature of the nonlinearity of metasurfaces and its effect on the polarization of the generated light is critical to fully unlock a range of applications, such as nonlinear vector beam generation and nonlinear polarization imaging. Here, we study the artificial optical nonlinearity of a dielectric metasurface originating from its meta-atom symmetry and describe the third-order nonlinear behavior by considering the polarization degree of freedom. We establish an effective nonlinear medium model that serves as a design toolbox for developing amorphous silicon-based geometric metasurfaces with customizable features in third harmonic generation. We further extract quantitative values of the artificial nonlinear susceptibility tensor elements related to the investigated nonlinear process and geometry. The implemented functional devices demonstrate the versatility of dielectric metasurfaces in shaping the emitted light in terms of amplitude, phase, and polarization, for the precise engineering of novel nonlinear architectures targeting applications in nonlinear imaging and complex light generation.</description>

      <title>Active Dual-Gated Graphene Transistors for Low-Noise, Drift-Stable, and Tunable Chemical Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphene field-effect transistors (GFETs) are among the most promising platforms for ultrasensitive chemical and biological sensing due to their high carrier mobility, large surface area, and low intrinsic noise. However, conventional single-gate GFET sensors in liquid environments suffer from severe limitations, including signal drift, charge trapping, and insufficient signal amplification. Here, we introduce a dual-gate GFET architecture that integrates a high-k hafnium dioxide local back gate with an electrolyte top gate, coupled with real-time feedback biasing. This design enables capacitive signal amplification while simultaneously suppressing gate leakage and low-frequency noise. By systematically evaluating seven distinct operational modes, we identify the Dual Mode Fixed configuration as optimal, achieving up to 20x signal gain, &gt; 15x lower drift compared with gate-swept methods, and up to 7x higher signal to noise ratio across a diverse range of analytes, including neurotransmitters, volatile organic compounds, environmental contaminants, and proteins. We further demonstrate robust, multiplexed detection using a PCB-integrated GFET sensor array, underscoring the scalability and practicality of the platform for portable, high-throughput sensing in complex environments. Together, these advances establish a versatile and stable sensing technology capable of real-time, label-free detection of molecular targets under ambient and physiological conditions, with broad applicability in health monitoring, food safety, agriculture, and environmental screening.</description>

      <title>Making neural networks understand internal heat transfer using Fourier-transformed thermal diffusion wave fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heat propagation is governed by phonon interactions and mathematically described by partial differential equations (PDEs), which link thermal transport to the intrinsic properties of materials. Conventional experimental techniques infer thermal responses based on surface emissions, limiting their ability to fully resolve subsurface structures and internal heat distribution. Additionally, existing thermal tomographic techniques can only shoot one frame from each layer. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have recently emerged as powerful tools for solving inverse problems in heat transfer by integrating observational data with physical constraints. However, standard PINNs are primarily focused on fitting the given external temperature data, without explicit knowledge of the unknown internal temperature distribution. In this study, we introduce a Helmholtz-informed neural network (HINN) to predict internal temperature distributions without requiring internal measurements. The time-domain heat diffusion equation was converted to the frequency-domain and becomes the pseudo-Helmholtz equation. HINN embeds this pseudo-Helmholtz equation into the learning framework, leveraging both real and imaginary components of the thermal field. Finally, an inverse Fourier transform brings real-part and imagery-part back to the time-domain and can be used to map 3D thermal fields with interior defects. Furthermore, a truncated operation was conducted to improve computational efficiency, and the principle of conjugate symmetry was employed for repairing the discarded data. This approach significantly enhances predictive accuracy and computational efficiency. Our results demonstrate that HINN outperforms state-of-the-art PINNs and inverse heat solvers, offering a novel solution for non-invasive thermography in applications spanning materials science, biomedical diagnostics, and nondestructive evaluation.</description>

      <title>Thermal diffusivity measurement based on evaporative cryocooling excitation: Theory and experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photo-thermal methods for measuring thermal diffusivity inherently pose an ill-posed inverse problem, affected by factors such as sample thickness, heating or cooling time, and excitation energy. Measurement accuracy becomes particularly challenging under non-impulsive pulsed excitation when the observation timescale is comparable to the pulse duration. This is often due to poorly defined pulse shapes, broadened thermal responses, and the absence of clear boundary conditions, especially under significant interfacial temperature gradients where natural convection dominates. The classic Parker solution, while widely used, is physically unrealistic as it assumes adiabatic heat flux and shallow-region heat absorption. In this study, we prove that Parker's assumption is equivalent to the Dirac pulse boundary condition in mathematics. Then, we present comprehensive analytical solutions for thermal/cooling responses under Dirac and rectangular pulse excitations. By comparing with eigenfunction-based solutions for well-posed boundary conditions, we show that Parker's solution is only valid before the thermal peak. Through dimensionless processing, we further demonstrate that Parker's solution can be regarded as a limiting case of the rectangular pulse solution as the heating duration approaches zero. Furthermore, we propose a novel excitation approach, evaporative cryocooling, for thermal diffusivity measurement. This method offers a compact, low-cost, and easy-to-implement alternative to conventional excitation schemes. The theoretical model was further validated through comparison with experimental results.</description>

      <title>Ultrasound-Triggered Release of Anticancer Nanoparticles from Electrospun Fabrics Integrated with Soft Robotic Tentacles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The prompt identification of pancreatic cancer symptoms is an ongoing clinical challenge, often leading to late diagnosis and poor prognosis. Tumor 'hijacking' of the pancreatic stromal structure limits the uptake of systemic chemotherapeutics. Localized drug delivery systems (DDS) using endoluminal techniques are widely utilized, with positive early results for improved control over tumor growth. There is a need for technologies that integrate endoluminal resources and intelligent material systems to better control the spatiotemporal delivery of chemotherapeutics. We demonstrate the ultrasound (US)-triggered localized release of therapeutics through the design of solvent traceless drug-loaded vinylbenzyl-functionalized gelatin (gel4vbc) nanoparticles (NPs) integrated with an electrospun fabric. Albumin-loaded NPs encapsulated into a poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) coating of a poly(epsilon-caprolactone) fabric evidence tunable triggered NP delivery controlled by regulating PVA concentration (0-1 wt.%) and US intensity (0-3 W/cm2). The fixation of the NP-coated fabric to a magnetic tentacle robot (MTR) enables the automated manipulation into a phantom pancreatic duct before the US-triggered release of NP-loaded albumin and MTR retraction. Albumin release is controlled by varying the surface area of the NP-loaded MTR-coating fabric. Herein we have designed a novel DDS capable of facile integration into soft robotics and US-triggered delivery of therapeutic-loaded NPs.</description>

      <title>Accurate and scalable deep Maxwell solvers using multilevel iterative methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural networks have promise as surrogate partial differential equation (PDE) solvers, but it remains a challenge to use these concepts to solve problems with high accuracy and scalability. In this work, we show that neural network surrogates can combine with iterative algorithms to accurately solve PDE problems featuring different scales, resolutions, and boundary conditions. We develop a subdomain neural operator model that supports arbitrary Robin-type boundary condition inputs, and we show that it can be utilized as a flexible preconditioner to iteratively solve subdomain problems with bounded accuracy. We further show that our subdomain models can facilitate the construction of global coarse spaces to enable accelerated, large scale PDE problem solving based on iterative multilevel domain decomposition. With two-dimensional Maxwell's equations as a model system, we train a single network to simulate large scale problems with different sizes, resolutions, wavelengths, and dielectric media distribution. We further demonstrate the utility of our platform in performing the accurate inverse design of multi-wavelength nanophotonic devices. Our work presents a promising path to building accurate and scalable multi-physics surrogate solvers for large practical problems.</description>

      <title>Optically-Trapped Particle Tracking Velocimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a microflow velocimetry based on particle tracking with the aid of the optical trapping of tracers, namely, optically-trapped particle tracking velocimetry (ot-PTV). The ot-PTV has two phases: a trap phase, in which individual tracers are trapped by an optical force and held at a measurement position; a release phase, in which the tracer is released and advected by the fluid flow, without interference from the optical force. The released tracer is subsequently trapped again by the optical force. By repeating the set of trap and release phases, we can accumulate the sequential images of the tracer that have the same initial position. In this way, we can reduce the effect of statistical noise inherent in the Brownian motion of small tracers, thereby achieving both high spatial resolution and a high signal-to-noise ratio, which are necessary for the analysis of extremely slow microflows, such as near-wall creeping flows. The concept of ot-PTV is validated using a benchmark experiment, i.e., a pressure-driven flow in a straight microchannel with a square cross-section.</description>

      <title>An analog-electronic implementation of a harmonic oscillator recurrent neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Oscillatory recurrent networks, such as the Harmonic Oscillator Recurrent Network (HORN) model, offer advantages in parameter efficiency, learning speed, and robustness relative to traditional non-oscillating architectures. Yet, while many implementations of physical neural networks exploiting attractor dynamics have been studied, implementations of oscillatory models in analog-electronic hardware that utilize the networks' transient dynamics so far are lacking. This study explores the feasibility of implementing HORNs in analog-electronic hardware while maintaining the computational performance of the digital counterpart. Using a digital twin approach, we trained a four-node HORN in silico for sequential MNIST classification and transferred the trained parameters to an analog electronic implementation. A set of custom error metrics indicated that the analog system is able to successfully replicate the dynamics of the digital model in most test cases. However, despite the overall well-matching dynamics, when using the readout layer of the digital model on the data generated by the analog system, we only observed $28.39\%$ agreement with the predictions of the digital model. An analysis shows that this mismatch is due to a precision difference between the analog hardware and the floating-point representation exploited by the digital model to perform classification tasks. When the analog system was utilized as a reservoir with a re-trained linear readout, its classification performance could be recovered to that of the digital twin, indicating preserved information content within the analog dynamics. This proof-of-concept establishes that analog electronic circuits can effectively implement oscillatory neural networks for computation, providing a demonstration of energy-efficient analog systems that exploit brain-inspired transient dynamics for computation.</description>

      <title>Enhanced intraband absorption in two-step photon upconversion solar cells with a double-tunnel-junction structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-step photon upconversion solar cells (TPU-SCs) belong to the class of solar cells that in principle can exceed the Shockley--Queisser limit for single-junction solar cells. A TPU-SC basically consists of a wide-gap and a narrow-gap semiconductor layer, where intraband absorption of infrared (IR) photons by electrons accumulated at the conduction-band-edge discontinuity leads to an increase in the output current and voltage. This IR-induced upconversion process enables a better utilization of the broad solar spectrum, and quantum dots (QDs) can be added to improve the intraband transition rates in actual devices. In this study, we added an n--p--n double-tunnel-junction structure to an $\mathrm{Al_{0.3}Ga_{0.7}As}$/GaAs TPU-SC including a QD layer to further enhance the contribution of intraband absorption to the output current. The double-tunnel-junction structure should suppress carrier recombination at the heterointerface and improve the extraction efficiency of electrons after intraband absorption. We performed two-color excitation experiments using IR and 784-nm light, and we particularly found that 784-nm light causes a significant amount of intraband transitions in this device. By employing rate equations, we clarify that this result demonstrates a higher intraband absorption efficiency due to the double-tunnel-junction structure. This highlights the potential of double-tunnel-junction structures for the realization of high-efficiency TPU-SCs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our work is concerned with simplicial complexes that describe higher-order interactions in real complex systems. This description allows to go beyond the pairwise node-to-node representation that simple networks provide and to capture a hierarchy of interactions of different orders. The prime contribution of this work is the introduction of geometric measures for these simplicial complexes. We do so by noting the non-commutativity of the algebra associated with their matrix representations and consequently we bring to bear the spectral triplet formalism of Connes on these structures and then notions of associated dimensions, curvature, and distance can be computed to serve as characterizing features in addition to known topological metrics.</description>

      <title>A Polarimetry-based Field-deployable Non-interruptive Mirror Soiling Detection Method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01643v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The soiling level of heliostat mirrors in Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) fields is one of the key factors that significantly influences optical efficiency. State-of-the-art methods of monitoring heliostats soiling levels still face various challenges, including slow speed, labor-intensive operations, resolution and accuracy constraints or interruptions to solar field operations. We present a rapid, cost-effective, and non-intrusive method for mirror soiling detection based on polarimetric imaging, referred to as Polarimetric Imaging-based Mirror Soiling (PIMS). The compact PIMS device is designed for integration with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), enabling rapid, large-area assessments of heliostat mirrors for efficient soiling detection. Our method utilizes the correlation between the Degree of Linear Polarization (DoLP) and surface soiling level based on Mie scattering theory and Monte Carlo simulations. Field deployment of the PIMS method requires minimal device installation, and its UAV-based operation allows for soiling detection without interrupting plant activities. The PIMS method holds the potential for mirror soiling detection across various concentrated solar power (CSP) plants and can be further adapted for other types of solar fields, such as parabolic trough systems.</description>

      <title>Heliostat Optical Error Inspection with Polarimetric Imaging Drone</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On a Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) field, optical errors have significant impacts on the collection efficiency of heliostats. Fast, cost-effective, labor-efficient, and non-intrusive autonomous field inspection remains a challenge. Approaches using imaging drone, i.e., Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) system integrated with high resolution visible imaging sensors, have been developed to address these challenges; however, these approaches are often limited by insufficient imaging contrast. Here we report a polarimetry-based method with a polarization imaging system integrated on UAV to enhance imaging contrast for in-situ detection of heliostat mirrors without interrupting field operation. We developed an optical model for skylight polarization pattern to simulate the polarization images of heliostat mirrors and obtained optimized waypoints for polarimetric imaging drone flight path to capture images with enhanced contrast. The polarimetric imaging-based method improved the success rate of edge detections in scenarios which were challenging for mirror edge detection with conventional imaging sensors. We have performed field tests to achieve significantly enhanced heliostat edge detection success rate and investigate the feasibility of integrating polarimetric imaging method with existing imaging-based heliostat inspection methods, i.e., Polarimetric Imaging Heliostat Inspection Method (PIHIM). Our preliminary field test results suggest that the PIHIM hold the promise to enable sufficient imaging contrast for real-time autonomous imaging and detection of heliostat field, thus suitable for non-interruptive fast CSP field inspection during its operation.</description>

Abstract: We bring attention to the fact that the claim of Brambilla et.al. [Extreme Mechanics Letters 74 (2025) 102267; arXiv:2406.14502] of discovering a novel design for pentamode materials is incorrect. Back in 2016 Briane, Harutyunyan and myself [Mathematics and Mechanics of Complex Systems 5 (2016) 41--94; arXiv:1606.03305] designed a class of stiff pentamodes, that include the high bulk modulus pentamodes of Brambilla et.al. Our design generalized to three-dimensions, and to full anisotropy, the main aspects of a two-dimensional construction of Sigmund [Journal of the Mechanics and Physics of Solids 48 (2000) 397--428]. It is emphasized that the in depth analysis of Brambilla et.al. goes well beyond our brief treatment.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of excitonic transitions to temperature in monolayers of TMD alloys</title>

Abstract: Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) offer tunable optical and electronic properties, making them highly promising for next-generation optoelectronic devices. One effective approach to engineering these properties is through alloying, which enables continuous control over the bandgap energy and excitonic transitions. In this study, we perform temperature-dependent transmission spectroscopy on monolayers of Mo1-xWxS2 and Mo(S1-xSex)2 alloys, transferred onto the core of an optical fiber and measured within a cryostat over a temperature range of 20-320 K. The use of an all-fiber configuration allowed us to probe interband transitions A, B, and C with high stability and precision. We observe a systematic redshift of excitonic transitions with increasing Se content, and a blueshift when Mo is replaced with W. These spectral shifts correlate with alloy composition and enable the tuning of bandgap energies between 1.6 eV and 2.0 eV at room temperature. Furthermore, we analyze the temperature sensitivity of the excitonic transitions, revealing that Se incorporation enhances thermal response in a non-monotonic manner, while W substitution results in a more monotonic and stronger temperature dependence. The splitting between A and B transitions, associated with spin-orbit coupling, also varies with composition. Our findings underscore the potential of compositional engineering in 2D TMD alloys to achieve both spectral and thermal control of optical properties, relevant for the design of robust and tunable optoelectronic systems.</description>

      <title>Spin-NeuroMem: A Low-Power Neuromorphic Associative Memory Design Based on Spintronic Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02463v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biologically-inspired computing models have made significant progress in recent years, but the conventional von Neumann architecture is inefficient for the large-scale matrix operations and massive parallelism required by these models. This paper presents Spin-NeuroMem, a low-power circuit design of Hopfield network for the function of associative memory. Spin-NeuroMem is equipped with energy-efficient spintronic synapses which utilize magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) to store weight matrices of multiple associative memories. The proposed synapse design achieves as low as 17.4% power consumption compared to the state-of-the-art synapse designs. Spin-NeuroMem also encompasses a novel voltage converter with a 53.3% reduction in transistor usage for effective Hopfield network computation. In addition, we propose an associative memory simulator for the first time, which achieves a 5Mx speedup with a comparable associative memory effect. By harnessing the potential of spintronic devices, this work paves the way for the development of energy-efficient and scalable neuromorphic computing systems.</description>

      <title>Theory of terahertz pulse transmission through ferroelectric nanomembranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00370v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An analytical model is developed to predict the temporal evolution of the lattice polarization in ferroelectric nanomembranes upon the excitation by a terahertz (THz) electromagnetic pulse of an arbitrary waveform, and the concurrent transmission of the THz pulse in both the linear and the nonlinear regimes. It involves the use of the perturbation method to solve the equation of motion for the lattice polarization in both unclamped and strained ferroelectric nanomembranes within the framework of Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire theory. The model is applicable to perovskite oxides such as BaTiO3 and SrTiO3, wurtzite Al1-xScxN, and trigonal LiNbO3. Our analytical model provides a theoretical basis for determining the thermodynamic and kinetic parameters of ferroelectric materials through THz transmission experiment. The calculation results also suggest an approach to reversing the chirality of a circularly polarized THz pulse by harnessing the resonant polarization-photon coupling in ferroelectrics. This capability of chirality reversal, along with the high tunability from a strain applied along any arbitrarily oriented in-plane axis, provides new opportunities for THz wave modulation without relying on complex metasurface designs.</description>
