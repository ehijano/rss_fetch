      <title>Maze-Bubble Pattern Magnetic Domain Simulation Based on the Lengyel-Epstein Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study is based on the Lengyel-Epstein (LE) model, governed by a system of nonlinear partial differential equations, to simulate the maze-bubble pattern magnetic domains in magnetic thin films with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA). Through numerical simulations, we successfully reproduce the maze, bubble, and intermediate-state magnetic domains observed in PMA multilayer films under the influence of material thickness and external magnetic fields. The topological structures of the magnetic domains shown in the simulation closely resemble those observed under a microscope, demonstrating the effectiveness of the LE model in simulating changes in the magnetic domain topology of magnetic thin films. This study also innovatively applies the concept of reaction-diffusion, commonly used in biochemistry, by drawing an analogy to electromagnetism. This approach holds significant implications for the study of magnetic domains.</description>

      <title>Micromagnetic-atomistic hybrid modeling of defect-induced magnetization dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a multiscale approach for investigating magnetization dynamics in multiscale, hybrid micromagnetic-atomistic simulations. We considered the dynamics of spin waves, domain walls, as well as three-dimensional (3D) skyrmions, in the presence of defects. Two primary defect configurations are examined: (i) a double-slit structure, which enables the study of domain wall and spin wave interference, and (ii) a tetrahedron shaped cluster of atoms with tunable anisotropy, which provides insights into how localized anisotropic perturbations influence domain wall pinning and skyrmion stability. The magnonic double-slit experiment demonstrates interference patterns analogous to electronic wave phenomena, offering potential applications in wave-based computing. Additionally, the results reveal the impact of the local anisotropy that leads to distinct transformations, including domain wall deformations, tubular and spherical structures, skyrmion annihilation, and breathing mode. The findings underscore the critical role of defect-induced anisotropic interactions in controlling domain wall motion, skyrmion topology, and spin wave propagation.</description>

      <title>Kinetic analysis of phase transformations during continuous heating: Crystallization of glass-forming liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase transformations are widely studied using continuous-heating experiments. In isothermal studies, their kinetics are often described using the Johnson-Mehl-Avrami-Kolmogorov (JMAK) rate equation. For continuous-heating studies, the same analysis has only been applied numerically. Here, a JMAK rate equation for phase transformations during continuous heating is derived. The equation is applied to the crystallization of glass-forming liquids with different kinetic behaviors and validated by comparison to experimental data and numerical simulations for the crystallization of glassy $\rm Fe_{80}B_{20}$ (at.%). Kissinger's method of analyzing crystallization kinetics is subsequently justified, and it is shown that the non-Arrhenius temperature dependence of crystal growth rates in glass-forming liquids can be better determined by using the present model to fit the peak position, shape and height for a series of crystallization exotherms. The implications of these analytical expressions for the design and development of glass-forming systems for a broad range of applications are considered, and the application of this JMAK rate equation to other transformations during continuous heating is explored.</description>

      <title>Modulation doping and control the carrier concentration in 2-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have attracted interest as post-Si channel candidates in transistor technology. However, despite their potential benefits, controllably doping TMDs has proven difficult. In this work, we proposed a list of candidate elements that can induce p-type and n-type doping in the TMD channel when they are doped onto conventional gate-dielectric oxides. To verify the screened modulation doping candidates, we demonstrate using first-principles calculations the p-doping of monolayer WSe$_2$ by doping Ni int\textbf{}o the interface dielectric HfO$_2$ layer. The induced hole concentration in the WSe$_2$ can be tuned to values compatible with electrostatic gate control of the channel by changing the Ni doping rate. The results of this study will have essential implications for the commercial viability of TMD-based transistors.</description>

      <title>Interfacial Effects and Negative Capacitance State in P(VDF-TrFE) Films with BaTiO3 Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the temperature dependences of the effective dielectric permittivity of P(VDF-TrFE) films with BaTiO3 nanoparticles (with the average size 24 nm). Transition from a weak to a strong nonlinear temperature dependence of the dielectric permittivity is observed near the freezing temperature (near -50 {\deg}C) of P(VDF-TrFE). The transition is followed by a diffuse step-like change in the temperature range (0 - 40){\deg}C, and a subsequent maximum of the dielectric permittivity in the P(VDF-TrFE) films with a lower content (~20-40 vol.%) of BaTiO3 nanoparticles; or by a quasi-plateau of the dielectric permittivity in the P(VDF-TrFE) films with a higher content (~ 50-70 vol.%) of BaTiO3 nanoparticles. The frequency dispersion of the dielectric permittivity is significant in the vicinity of its maxima. The temperature-frequency shift of the permittivity region with a strong temperature dependence is positive. The temperature-frequency shift of the maxima is insignificant (or negative) for the P(VDF-TrFE) films with lower content of BaTiO3 nanoparticles. Increasing the content of BaTiO3 nanoparticles leads to a significant increase in the relative dielectric permittivity of the P(VDF-TrFE)-BaTiO3 films compared to pure P(VDF-TrFE) films (from 8 to 50 at 25 {\deg}C). At the same time, the voltage response of the studied P(VDF-TrFE)/BaTiO3 films to the frequency-modulated IR radiation flux has rather photoelectric than pyroelectric nature. A phenomenological model, which considers the screening charges at the interfaces, as well as dipole-dipole cross-interaction effects between the ferroelectric nanoparticles, is proposed to describe the temperature and frequency behavior of the effective dielectric permittivity. The negative capacitance state, which originates due to the interfacial effects, is predicted in the P(VDF-TrFE) films with a high content of BaTiO3 nanoparticles.</description>

      <title>System of Agentic AI for the Discovery of Metal-Organic Frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative models and machine learning promise accelerated material discovery in MOFs for CO2 capture and water harvesting but face significant challenges navigating vast chemical spaces while ensuring synthetizability. Here, we present MOFGen, a system of Agentic AI comprising interconnected agents: a large language model that proposes novel MOF compositions, a diffusion model that generates crystal structures, quantum mechanical agents that optimize and filter candidates, and synthetic-feasibility agents guided by expert rules and machine learning. Trained on all experimentally reported MOFs and computational databases, MOFGen generated hundreds of thousands of novel MOF structures and synthesizable organic linkers. Our methodology was validated through high-throughput experiments and the successful synthesis of five "AI-dreamt" MOFs, representing a major step toward automated synthesizable material discovery.</description>

      <title>Charge Densities in Crystals and Triply-Periodic Minimal Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relationship between surfaces of constant charge density and triply-periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS) has been the subject of considerable speculation over many years. Zero-potential surfaces generated in crystals by an electrostatic field from a distribution of point charges provide an approximate description of the TPMS for that crystal. We have recently provided a first-principles alternative to such phenomenological comparisons based on the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP). We showed that the surfaces of a zero charge density calculated for the crystal structure of a material converges to the TPMS of the corresponding crystalline material. The exchange-correlation potentials are chosen for the particular material based on the benchmarking of various approximations for these potentials carried out by others. Here, we report an extension of our previous work by giving additional examples of our theory that shows the zero electron density of an equilibrium structure corresponds to a TPMS for a variety of materials and crystalline structures. We study the ground states of elemental materials that differ electronically and structurally, Na, Cu, Al, Zr, and a compound, NiTi, as well as different phases of the elemental solids that are observed under different thermodynamic conditions.</description>

      <title>General Phase Segregation and Phase Pinning Effects in Ln-doped Lead Halide Perovskite with Dual-wavelength Lasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lead halide perovskites (LHPs) exhibit outstanding optoelectronic properties, making them highly promising for applications in various optoelectronics devices. However, rapid ion migration in LHPs not only undermines device stability but also hinders the development of multi-band composite structures, which are crucial to advancing perovskite bandgap engineering and unlocking novel applications. Here, we introduce a novel and general strategy involving both phase segregation and phase pinning by doping Er$^{3+}$ into CsPb(X$_x$Y$_{1-x}$)$_3$ (X, Y = Cl, Br, I) microplates via a simple one-step chemical vapor deposition method. The ion migration is effectively suppressed and a variety of stable multi-band composite structures are demonstrated, with diverse dual-band photoluminescence emissions covering the red, green, and blue spectral bands. The corresponding high-performance dual-wavelength lasers have also been fabricated, confirming the stability and high crystalline quality of these multi-band composite structures. In addition, this strategy is extended to the doping of various lanthanide ion and the incorporation of different mixed halides into LHPs. As a result, a series of multi-band composite structures based on LHPs and corresponding dual-wavelength lasers are developed, thereby validating the generality of this strategy. Theoretical calculations clarify the phase segregation and phase pinning mechanism in these LHPs. Our work not only facilitates the stability design of LHPs but also significantly advances the bandgap engineering, thereby contributing to the expansion of their potential applications in the optoelectronic future.</description>

      <title>Fabrication and characterization of boron-terminated tetravacancies in monolayer hBN using STEM, EELS and electron ptychography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tetravacancies in monolayer hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) with consistent edge termination (boron or nitrogen) form triangular nanopores with electrostatic potentials that can be leveraged for applications such as selective ion transport and neuromorphic computing. In order to quantitatively predict the properties of these structures, an atomic-level understanding of their local electronic and chemical environments is required. Moreover, robust methods for their precision manufacture are needed. Here were use electron irradiation in a scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) at high dose rate to drive the formation of boron-terminated tetravacancies in monolayer hBN. Characterization of the defects is achieved using aberration-corrected STEM, monochromated electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS), and electron ptychography. Z-contrast in STEM and chemical fingerprinting by core-loss EELS enable identification of the edge terminations, while electron ptychography gives insight into structural relaxation of the tetravacancies and provides evidence of enhanced electron density around the defect perimeters indicative of bonding effects.</description>

      <title>Bulk photogalvanic current control and gap spectroscopy in 2D hexagonal materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) hexagonal materials have been intensively explored for multiple optoelectronic applications such as spin current generation, all-optical valleytronics, and topological electronics. In the realm of strong-field and ultrafast light-driven phenomena, it was shown that tailored laser driving such as polychromatic or few-cycle pulses can drive robust bulk photogalvanic (BPG) currents originating from the K/K' valleys. We here explore the BPG effect in 2D systems in the strong-field regime and show that monochromatic elliptical pulses also generically generate such photocurrents. The resultant photocurrents exhibit both parallel and transverse (Hall-like) components, both highly sensitive to the laser parameters, providing photocurrent control knobs. Interestingly, we show that the photocurrent amplitude has a distinct behavior vs. the driving ellipticity that can be indicative of material properties such as the gap size at K/K', which should prove useful for novel forms of BPG-based spectroscopies. We demonstrate these effects also in benchmark ab-initio simulations in monolayer hexagonal boron-nitride. Our work establishes new paths for controlling photocurrent responses in 2D systems that can also be used for multi-dimensional spectroscopy of ultrafast material properties through photocurrent measurements.</description>

      <title>The Role of Flexoelectric Coupling and Chemical Strains in the Emergence of Polar Chiral Nano-Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This review examines the conditions that lead to the formation of flexo-sensitive chiral polar structures in thin films and core-shell ferroelectric nanoparticles. It also analyzes possible mechanisms by which the flexoelectric effect impacts the polarization structure in core-shell ferroelectric nanoparticles. Special attention is given to the role of the anisotropic flexoelectric effect in forming a unique type of polarization states with distinct chiral properties, referred to as "flexons". In the first part of the review, we study the influence of the flexoelectric coupling on the polarity, chirality and branching of metastable labyrinthine domain structures in uniaxial ferroelectric core-shell nanoparticles. We reveal that the transition from sinuous branched domain stripes to spiral-like domains occurs gradually as the flexoelectric coupling strength is increased. Our findings indicate that the joint action of flexoelectric effect and chemical strains, termed as "flexo-chemical" coupling, can significantly influence the effective Curie temperature, polarization distribution, domain morphology, and chirality in multiaxial ferroelectric core-shell nanoparticles. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the combination of flexo-chemical coupling and screening effects leads to the appearance and stabilization of a chiral polarization morphology in nanoflakes of van der Waals ferrielectrics. In the second part of the review, we discuss several advanced applications of flexo-sensitive chiral polar structures in core-shell ferroelectric nanoparticles for nanoelectronics elements and cryptography. We underline the possibilities of the flexoelectric control of multiple-degenerated labyrinthine states, which may correspond to a differential negative capacitance (NC) state stabilized in the uniaxial ferroelectric core by the presence of a screening shell.</description>

      <title>Mechanical properties of B12-based orthorhombic metal carboborides. A first principle study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structural and mechanical properties of B12-based orthorhombic metal carboborides are studied on the basis of first principle DFT approach. The simulations predict the existence of a new family of phases of the composition MeC2B12 (Me=Mg, Ca, Sr, Sc, Y) with similar structure and space symmetry Imma. It has been found that the predicted phases are thermally (dynamically) stable and have considerably better mechanical properties as compared to the reference compound AlMgB14. The respective calculated isotropic elastic moduli and Vickers hardness are significantly higher (G~ 230-250, E~530-550, and Hv~35-55 GPa). These conclusions were confirmed by direct calculations of shear strength for the above phases, which demonstrated the increase of 30-50% in different directions. The enhanced mechanical characteristics of the MgC2B12 -based phases make them promising for creating novel superhard materials</description>

      <title>Real Space Visualization of Order-Disorder Transition in BaTiO3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferroelectricity in BaTiO3 was observed nearly eighty years ago, but the mechanism underlying its ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transition remains elusive. The order-disorder transition has been recognized as playing a critical role, however, the precise nature of the order parameter still remains under scrutiny, including the local dipole direction and the correlations above and below the Curie temperature. Using in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy, we directly map polar displacements in BaTiO3 across the ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transition, providing atomistic insights into a order-disorder mechanism. Atomic tracking reveals finite polar Ti displacements in the paraelectric phase where they manifest as random polar nanoregions. The displacements align along &lt;111&gt; direction in both the ferroelectric and paraelectric phases. The paraelectric-ferroelectric transition emerges from real-space correlations of the &lt;111&gt; polar Ti displacements. Our direct visualizations provides atomic insights into the order-disorder mechanism in the ferroelectric-paraelectric transition of BaTiO3.</description>

Abstract: Atom probe tomography (APT) is a burgeoning characterization technique that provides compositional mapping of materials in three-dimensions at near-atomic scale. Since its significant expansion in the past 30 years, we estimate that one million APT datasets have been collected, each containing millions to billions of individual ions. Their analysis and the extraction of microstructural information has largely relied upon individual users whose varied level of expertise causes clear and documented bias. Current practices hinder efficient data processing, and make challenging standardization and the deployment of data analysis workflows that would be compliant with FAIR data principles. Over the past decade, building upon the long-standing expertise of the APT community in the development of advanced data processing or data mining techniques, there has been a surge of novel machine learning (ML) approaches aiming for user-independence, and that are efficient, reproducible, and robust from a statistics perspective. Here, we provide a snapshot review of this rapidly evolving field. We begin with a brief introduction to APT and the nature of the APT data. This is followed by an overview of relevant ML algorithms and a comprehensive review of their applications to APT. We also discuss how ML can enable discoveries beyond human capability, offering new insights into the mechanisms within materials. Finally, we provide guidance for future directions in this domain.</description>

      <title>Manipulation of anisotropic Zhang-Rice exciton in van der Waals antiferromagnets NiPS3-xSex by anion substitution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-entangled excitons have emerged as intriguing quasi-particle excitations in van der Waals magnets. Among them, the recently observed Zhang-Rice (ZR) exciton in NiPS3 has garnered significant research interest due to its strong correlation with magnetic ordering and its exceptionally long-lived coherence. Herein, we present our in-depth temperature- and polarization-dependent photoluminescence (PL) study of anion-substituted NiPS3-xSex (x=0.008,0.03,0.06 and 0.09 ) to explore the nature and dynamics of the ZR exciton. Our results reveal that, similar to the cation substitution, a small percentage of anion substitution effectively destroys and modulates the ZR exciton, as evidenced by the emergence of a weaker, lower-energy PL peak in addition to the primary ZR peak. The primary and secondary PL peaks exhibit the same anisotropic polarization but differ in their peak energy shift and intensity evolution with Se substitution, suggesting varying charge transfers of p-orbitals. Notably, the ZR exciton undergoes rapid thermal destabilization at much lower temperatures than two-magnon excitations, highlighting that p-orbital inhomogeneity beyond the magnetic ordering structure is a decisive factor in driving its thermal quenching.</description>

      <title>Bulk nanocrystalline Al-Mg-Y alloys with amorphous grain boundary complexions display high strength and compressive plasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although nanocrystalline alloys regularly exhibit high strengths, their use in structural applications often face challenges due to sample size limitations, unstable microstructures, and the limited ability to plastically deform. The incorporation of amorphous grain boundary complexions has been proposed to address these issues, by simultaneously stabilizing nanocrystalline grain structures for scale-up processing and improving alloy toughness. In the present study, the mechanical behavior of bulk nanocrystalline Al-Mg-Y is examined with macroscale compression testing, probing a length scale that is relevant to real-world structural applications. Bulk samples were fabricated via a simple powder metallurgy approach, with different pressing temperatures and times employed for consolidation in order to investigate microstructural and property evolution. All of the specimens contained primary face-centered cubic Al and secondary Al4C3 and Al3Y phases, with the Al3Y particles exhibiting two populations of small equiaxed and larger elongated particles. Appreciable plasticity was measured along with high ultimate stresses over 800 MPa due to the presence of amorphous grain boundary complexions. Microstructural characterization of fracture surfaces revealed that the area fraction of dimpled regions increased with longer hot-pressing time. Most importantly, the elongated Al3Y particles formed regular cellular patterns with increasing hot-pressing time, delaying shear localization and significantly enhancing plasticity. The hierarchy present in the microstructure of the Al-Mg-Y alloy, from amorphous grain boundary complexions to secondary phases, gives rise to excellent bulk mechanical properties, which are attractive for structural applications.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Fine Structure and Energy-driven Transition of Photoelectron Kikuchi Diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intricate fine structure of Kikuchi diffraction plays a vital role in probing phase transformations and strain distributions in functional materials, particularly in electron microscopy. Beyond these applications, it also proves essential in photoemission spectroscopy (PES) at high photon energies, aiding in the disentanglement of complex angle-resolved PES data and enabling emitter-site-specific studies. However, the detection and analysis of these rich faint structures in photoelectron diffraction (PED), especially in the hard X-ray regime, remain highly challenging, with only a limited number of simulations successfully reproducing these patterns. The strong energy dependence of Kikuchi patterns further complicates their interpretation, necessitating advanced theoretical approaches. To enhance structural analysis, we present a comprehensive theoretical study of fine diffraction patterns and their evolution with energy by simulating core-level emissions from Ge(100) and Si(100). Using multiple-scattering theory and the fully relativistic one-step photoemission model, we simulate faint pattern networks for various core levels across different kinetic energies (106 eV - 4174 eV), avoiding cluster size convergence issues inherent in cluster-based methods. Broadening in patterns is discussed via the inelastic scattering treatment. For the first time, circular dichroism has been observed and successfully reproduced in the angular distribution of Si (100) 1s, revealing detailed features and asymmetries up to 31%. Notably, we successfully replicate experimental bulk and more "surface-sensitivity" diffraction features, further validating the robustness of our simulations. The results show remarkable agreement with the experimental data obtained using circularly polarized radiations, demonstrating the potential of this methodology for advancing high-energy PES investigations.</description>

      <title>Band-spin-valley coupled exciton physics in antiferromagnetic MnPS$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The introduction of intrinsic magnetic order in two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors offers great opportunities for investigating correlated excitonic phenomena. Here, we employ full-spinor GW plus Bethe-Salpeter equation methodology to reveal rich exciton physics in a prototypical 2D N\'{e}el-type antiferromagnetic semiconductor MnPS$_3$, enabled by the interplay among inverted dispersion of the second valence band, spin-valley coupling and magnetic order. The negative hole mass increases the reduced mass of the lowest-energy bright exciton, leading to exchange splitting enhancement of the bright exciton relative to band-edge dark exciton. Notably, such splitting couples with spontaneous valley polarization to generate distinct excitonic fine structure between $K$ and $-K$ valleys, which dictate distinct relaxation behaviors. Crucially, magnetic order transition from N\'{e}el antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic state induces significant quasiparticle band structure reconstruction and excitonic transitions modification, with low-energy optical excitations being exclusively contributed by majority-spin channel. These findings establish 2D antiferromagnetic semiconductors as an intriguing platform to study band-spin-valley coupled exciton physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Significant advancements have been made in one of the most critical branches of artificial intelligence: natural language processing (NLP). These advancements are exemplified by the remarkable success of OpenAI's GPT-3.5/4 and the recent release of GPT-4.5, which have sparked a global surge of interest akin to an NLP gold rush. In this article, we offer our perspective on the development and application of NLP and large language models (LLMs) in materials science. We begin by presenting an overview of recent advancements in NLP within the broader scientific landscape, with a particular focus on their relevance to materials science. Next, we examine how NLP can facilitate the understanding and design of novel materials and its potential integration with other methodologies. To highlight key challenges and opportunities, we delve into three specific topics: (i) the limitations of LLMs and their implications for materials science applications, (ii) the creation of a fully automated materials discovery pipeline, and (iii) the potential of GPT-like tools to synthesize existing knowledge and aid in the design of sustainable materials.</description>

      <title>Highly Stable Silicon Anodes Enabled by Sub-10 nm Pores and Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon anodes offer high energy densities for next-generation lithium-ion batteries; however, their application is limited by severe volume expansion during cycling. Making silicon porous or nanostructured mitigates this expansion but often increases lithium inventory losses due to the inherent high surface area of nanomaterials. This study introduces a simple bottom-up process that overcomes this limitation. The approach relies on small silicon particles (&lt;10 nm) produced using an efficient low-temperature plasma approach. These small building blocks are assembled into micron-scale superstructures characterized by uniformly dispersed sub-10 nm pores. This structure addresses both volume expansion and lithium-inventory issues while achieving tap densities exceeding those of commercial graphite (~1.2 g/cm3), all while maintaining good processability. The resulting silicon-dominant anodes achieve remarkable stability in full pouch cells with NMC811 and LFP cathodes, retaining ~80% capacity for more than 400 cycles without pre-lithiation, graphite blending, or pre-cycling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The underlying symmetry of the crystal, electronic structure, and magnetic structure manifests itself in the anisotropy of materials' properties, which is a central topic of the present condensed matter research. However, it demands such a considerable effort to fill the explorable space that only a small part has been conquered. We report a vector pulse magnet (VPM) as an alternative experimental technique to control the direction of applied magnetic fields, which may complement the conventional methods with its characteristic features. The VPM combines a conventional pulse magnet and a vector magnet. The VPM can create vector pulsed magnetic fields and swiftly rotating pulsed magnetic fields. As a demonstration, the three-dimensional magnetoresistance measurement of a highly oriented pyrolytic graphite is carried out using the AC four-probe method at 4.5 K and 6 T. The two-dimensional electronic structure of graphite is visualized in the three-dimensional magnetoresistance data. One can uncover the rotational and time-reversal symmetry of materials using a VPM and a variety of measurement techniques.</description>

      <title>Extending Collinear Density Functionals to Noncollinear Cases under Periodic Boundary Condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate modeling of spin-orbit coupling and noncollinear magnetism in materials requires noncollinear density functionals within the two-component generalized Kohn-Sham (GKS) framework, yet constructing and implementing noncollinear functionals remains challenging. Recently, a methodology was proposed to extend collinear functionals into noncollinear ones, successfully defining noncollinear functionals and their derivatives. However, the initial implementation involved a systematic approach to differentiate energy over density matrix elements rather than the derivatives of the energy functional with respect to density, presenting challenges for integration with periodic boundary condition-density functional theory (PBC-DFT) software. We have derived a novel set of working equations based on the original methodology, which provides noncollinear energy functionals and their derivatives. These working equations have been implemented in our noncollinear functional ensemble named NCXC, ensuring numerical stability and transferability without the need for incorporating derivatives of basis functions. This implementation is expected to facilitate compatibility with most DFT software packages. We demonstrate some preliminary applications in periodic systems, including noncollinear magnetism in spin spirals, band structures in topological insulators, and band gaps in semiconducting inorganic materials, using NCXC.</description>

      <title>Predicting Methane Adsorption in Metal-Substituted MOFs: A Comparative Study between Density Functional Theory and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising materials for methane capture due to their high surface area and tunable properties. Metal substitution represents a powerful strategy to enhance MOF performance, yet systematic exploration of the vast chemical space remains challenging. In this work, we compare density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning (ML) in predicting methane adsorption properties in metal-substituted variants of three high-performing MOFs: M-HKUST-1, M-ATC, and M-ZIF-8 (M = Cu, Zn). DFT calculations reveal significant differences in methane binding energetics between Cu and Zn variants of all three MOFs. On the other hand, we fine-tuned a pretrained multimodal ML model, PMTransformer, on a curated subset of hypothetical MOF (hMOF) structures to predict macroscopic adsorption properties. While the model qualitatively predicts adsorption properties for the original unaltered MOFs, it fails to distinguish between metal variants despite their different binding energetics identified by DFT. We trace this limitation to the hMOF training data generated using Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations based on classical force fields (UFF/TraPPE). Our study highlights a key challenge in ML-based MOF screening: ML models inherit the limitations of their training data, particularly when electronic effects significantly impact adsorption behavior. Our findings emphasize the need for improved force fields or hybrid GCMC/DFT datasets to incorporate both geometric and electronic factors for accurate prediction of adsorption properties in metal-substituted MOFs.</description>

      <title>Improving efficiency and stability for perovskite solar cell with diethylene glycol dimethacrylate modification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The humidity resistance is the key challenges that hinder the commercial application of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, we propose an ultra-thin acrylate polymer (diethylene glycol dimethacrylate, DGDMA) into perovskite films to investigate the influence of polymerized networks on stability. The monomer molecules containing acrylate and carbonyl groups were selected, and the effects of the polymerized were quantified with different concentration. The experimental results show that, when the concentration of DGDMA is 1 mg/ml, the PCE increases from 18.06% to 21.82%, which is optimum. The monomer molecules with carbonyl groups polymerize, they can chelate with uncoordinated Pb2+ in perovskite films to improve the film quality, reduce the surface defect density to decrease non-radiative recombination, and also significantly enhance the humidity stability of PSCs.</description>

      <title>The preparation and properties of polycrystalline Bi$_2$O$_2$Se -- pitfalls and difficulties with reproducibility and charge transport limiting parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermoelectric materials allow the direct conversion of waste heat into electricity, and novel materials are being investigated for this purpose. Recently, doped Bi$_2$O$_2$Se has shown high application potential. In this study, we discuss causes for large variation in reported transport properties of pure Bi$_2$O$_2$Se and present a preparation method that improves the reproducibility of undoped polycrystalline samples and improves their stability under thermal cycling. Key steps of this method include calcination of the Bi$_2$O$_3$ precursor, purification of the synthesized material in a temperature gradient, use of a coarse particle fraction and compaction of the powders in a Si3N4 die instead of a graphite die. The resulting polycrystalline material exhibits improved reproducibility and enhanced resistance to thermal cycling. It has room temperature electrical conductivity {\sigma}RT ~ 500 S.m-1 and Seebeck coefficient S ~ -300 $\mu$V.K$^{-1}$. These properties make it suitable as a reference material for future doping studies. The presented synthesis approach may provide a more reliable platform for investigating the intrinsic behavior and doping response of Bi$_2$O$_2$Se in thermoelectric applications.</description>

Abstract: The primary consideration in developing new material platforms for quantum applications is to optimize coherence. Despite its importance, decoherence processes remains challenging to experimentally interrogate and quantify. In this Perspective, we first introduce the concept of decoherence in quantum systems and conventional techniques to assess decoherence at optical frequencies. We then introduce multidimensional coherent spectroscopy as a unique probe capable of revealing the full complexity of decoherence dynamics in realistic circumstances. To contextualize the techniques discussed here, demonstrative examples in two prototypical quantum systems, namely colloidal nanocrystals and vacancy centers in diamond, are provided.</description>

      <title>Probing Loop Currents and Collective Modes of Charge Density Waves in Kagome Materials with NV Centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the unconventional charge density wave (CDW) order with loop currents has attracted considerable attention in the Kagome material family AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A = K, Rb, Cs). However, experimental signatures of loop current order remain elusive. In this work, based on the mean-field free energy, we analyze the collective modes of unconventional CDW order in a Kagome lattice model. Furthermore, we point out that phase modes in the imaginary CDW (iCDW) order with loop current orders result in time-dependent stray fields. We thus propose using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers to detect these time-dependent stray fields, providing a potential experimental approach to identifying loop current order.</description>

      <title>Retrieval of fundamental material parameters of monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides from experimental exciton energies: An analytical approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a straightforward and highly accurate method for determining material parameters such as screening length, bandgap energy, exciton reduced mass, and dielectric constant of the surrounding medium using experimental magnetoexciton energies available for monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs). Our approach is based on analytical formulations that allow us to calculate the screening length $r_0$ and bandgap energy $E_g$ directly from the experimental $s$-state exciton energies $E_{1s}$, $E_{2s}$, and $E_{3s}$. We also establish a relationship between the surrounding dielectric constant $\kappa$ and the exciton reduced mass $\mu$. This relationship simplifies the Schr{\"o}dinger equation for a magnetoexciton in a TMDC monolayer, transforming it into a one-parameter equation that depends only on a single material parameter, $\mu$. Therefore, the fitting method is easy to implement, as it compares calculated magnetoexciton energies with experimental data to determine the true exciton reduced mass, the best-fit value of $\mu$. By applying this method, we extract material parameters $E_g$, $r_0$, $\mu$, and $\kappa$ from the magnetoexciton energies of monolayer TMDCs (WSe$_2$, WS$_2$, MoSe$_2$, and MoS$_2$) encapsulated by hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) slabs in various current experiments. Additionally, we provide key material properties such as diamagnetic coefficients and exciton radii, which are calculated using the extracted parameters.</description>

      <title>Long-lived Zone-boundary Magnons in an Antiferromagnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic (AFM) insulators exhibit many desirable features for spintronic applications such as fast dynamics in the THz range and robustness to fluctuating external fields. However, large damping typically associated with THz magnons presents a serious challenge for THz magnonic applications. Here, we report long-lived short-wavelength zone boundary magnons in the honeycomb AFM insulator CoTiO3, recently found to host topological magnons. We find that its zone-boundary THz magnons exhibit longer lifetimes than its zone-center magnons. This unusual momentum-dependent long magnon lifetime originates from several factors including the antiferromagnetic order, exchange anisotropy, a finite magnon gap, and magnon band dispersion. Our work suggests that magnon-magnon interaction may not be detrimental to magnon lifetimes and should be included in future searches for topological magnons.</description>

      <title>Novel Concept-Oriented Synthetic Data approach for Training Generative AI-Driven Crystal Grain Analysis Using Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The traditional techniques for extracting polycrystalline grain structures from microscopy images, such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), are labour-intensive, subjective, and time-consuming, limiting their scalability for high-throughput analysis. In this study, we present an automated methodology integrating edge detection with generative diffusion models to effectively identify grains, eliminate noise, and connect broken segments in alignment with predicted grain boundaries. Due to the limited availability of adequate images preventing the training of deep machine learning models, a new seven-stage methodology is employed to generate synthetic TEM images for training. This concept-oriented synthetic data approach can be extended to any field of interest where the scarcity of data is a challenge. The presented model was applied to various metals with average grain sizes down to the nanoscale, producing grain morphologies from low-resolution TEM images that are comparable to those obtained from advanced and demanding experimental techniques with an average accuracy of 97.23%.</description>

      <title>Metamorphic quantum dot arrays in twisted trilayer hexagonal boron nitride</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A large set of controlled quantum states with tunable spacing and interactions is crucial in understanding and engineering novel quantum materials for quantum information processing. Such achievements have been mostly confined to atomic physics, exemplified by ordered arrays of neutral atoms or trapped ions. In solid-state systems, well-ordered quantum dots (QDs), in particular, also have significant potential for these applications. However, their precise large-scale fabrication and on-demand reconfigurations remain important challenges. Here, we predict that twisted trilayer hexagonal boron nitride hosts well-defined QD arrays with spatial precision and symmetry control as well as exceptional dynamic repositioning. These arrays emerge naturally at ultrasmall twist angles, forming diverse domain configurations including triangular, kagome and hexagram arrangements. The quantum states within each dot exhibit high fidelity to quantum harmonic oscillator wavefunctions, realizing uniform dot states as long as the moire-of-moire lattice is well ordered. Uniquely, we demonstrate that these arrays can be dynamically reconfigured via external electric fields coupled to local electric polarizations, allowing continuous tuning between regimes of strong coupling and complete isolation, and offering a pathway to long-ranged quantum information shuttling. This tunability and uniformity distinguish our platform from conventional implementations and suggest substantial potential for quantum applications, from array-based single-photon sources to scalable quantum processors, establishing twisted van der Waals systems as a promising platform for programmable quantum architectures with spatial and energetic control.</description>

      <title>Gapless behavior in a two-leg spin ladder with bond randomness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We successfully synthesized [Cu$_2$(AcO)$_4$($p$-Py-V-$p$-F)$_2$]$\cdot$4CHCl$_3$, a verdazyl-based complex with a paddlewheel structure comprising two Cu atoms, which induces strong antiferromagnetic (AF) exchange interactions between Cu spins, generating a nonmagnetic singlet state at low temperatures. Two primary exchange interactions between radical spins generate a spin-1/2 AF two-leg ladder. In addition, two possible positional configurations of the F atom in the complex create four different overlap patterns of molecular orbitals, introducing bond randomness in the spin ladder. The observed experimental behaviors, such as the Curie tail in the magnetic susceptibility and the gapless gradual increase in the magnetization curve, are attributed to a broad distribution of excitation energies and a few orphan spins in the random-singlet (RS) state that are stabilized by bond randomness. The low-temperature specific heat exhibits a temperature dependence with $\propto 1/|{\rm{ln}}T|^3$, demonstrating the formation of the RS state in unfrustrated systems. We also consider the effect of restricted patterns of exchange interactions and one-dimensional nature of the system on the RS state.</description>

      <title>Layered semiconductors integrated with polyimide thin films for high-quality valleytronic and quantum-photonic systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dielectric integration of layered semiconductors is a prerequisite for fabricating high-quality optoelectronic, valleytronic, and quantum-photonic devices. While hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is the current benchmark dielectric, exploration of the most suitable dielectric materials covering the complete substrates continues to expand. This work demonstrates the formation of high optical-quality excitons in two widely explored layered semiconductors, WSe$_2$ and WS$_2$, integrated into polyimide (PI) thin films of thicknesses $\approx$500 nm. The photoluminescence (PL) studies at $T$ = 296 K show the formation of neutral excitons $\left(X^0\right)$ and trions in fully-PI-encapsulated 1L-WSe$_2$ with 2-sigma ($2\sigma$) spatial-inhomogeneity of 4.5 (3.4) meV in $X^0$ emission energy (linewidth), which is $\approx$1/3rd (1/5th), respectively, that of inhomogeneity measured in fully-hBN-encapsulated 1L-WSe$_2$. A smaller $2\sigma$ of 2.1 (2.3) meV in $X^0$ emission energy (linewidth) has been shown for fully-PI-encapsulated 1L-WS$_2$. Polarization-resolved and excitation power-dependent PL measurements of PI-isolated 1L-TMDs at $T$ = 4 K further reveal formations of high-quality neutral-biexcitons and negatively-charged biexcitons, with degrees of valley-polarization up to 21$\%$ under non-resonant excitation. Furthermore, the fully-PI-encapsulated 1L-WSe$_2$ also hosts single quantum emitters with narrow linewidths and high-spectral stability. This work indicates that PI thin films may serve the purpose of high-quality dielectric material for integrating the layered materials on a wafer scale.</description>

Abstract: Bismuth (Bi) films hold potential for spintronic devices and topological one-dimensional edge transport. Large-area high-quality (111) Bi ultrathin films are grown on InSb (111)B substrates. Strong film-substrate interactions epitaxially stabilize the (111) orientation and lead to inversion symmetry breaking. We resolve the longstanding controversy over the Z_2 topological assignment of bismuth and show that the surface states are topologically trivial. Our results demonstrate that interfacial bonds prevent the semimetal-to-semiconductor transition predicted for freestanding bismuth layers, highlighting the importance of controlled functionalization and surface passivation in two-dimensional materials.</description>

Abstract: Antiferromagnetic spintronics offers the potential for higher-frequency operations and improved insensitivity to magnetic fields compared to ferromagnetic spintronics. However, previous electrical techniques to detect antiferromagnetic dynamics have utilized large, millimeter-scale bulk crystals. Here we demonstrate direct electrical detection of antiferromagnetic resonance in structures on the few-micrometer scale using spin-filter tunneling in PtTe$_2$/bilayer CrSBr/graphite junctions in which the tunnel barrier is the van der Waals antiferromagnet CrSBr. This sample geometry allows not only efficient detection, but also electrical control of the antiferromagnetic resonance through spin-orbit torque from the PtTe$_2$ electrode. The ability to efficiently detect and control antiferromagnetic resonance enables detailed studies of the physics governing these high frequency dynamics.</description>

      <title>Origin of unexpected weak Gilbert damping in the LSMO/Pt bilayer system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigated the Gilbert damping in $La_{0.7}Sr_{0.3}MnO_3$ (LSMO) and $La_{0.7}Sr_{0.3}MnO_3/Pt$ (LSMO/Pt) heterostructures using first-principles calculations and Wannier interpolation techniques. Our work is motivated by recent experimental observations showing smaller Gilbert damping in LSMO/Pt films compared to their reference single-layer LSMO films, despite expectations of enhanced spin-pumping effects in the former. We analyze the electronic structures and transport behaviors, finding that LSMO thin films have a high spin Hall angle ($|\theta_{\mathrm{SH}}|$). However, in LSMO/Pt, the presence of platinum significantly increases longitudinal conductivity, reducing $|\theta_{\mathrm{SH}}|$. Despite the lower $|\theta_{\mathrm{SH}}|$, LSMO/Pt shows a notable anti-damping contribution to Gilbert damping due to a larger spin diffusion length. In contrast, pure LSMO films with large $|\theta_{\mathrm{SH}}|$ exhibit higher damping due to efficient spin-to-charge conversion via a self-induced inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE), as reported in a recent experiment. Finally, this work demonstrates that by fine-tuning the ratio of spin Hall conductivity to longitudinal charge conductivity, it is possible to engineer heterostructures with desired spin-to-charge or charge-to-spin conversion efficiencies even with weaker spin-orbit couplings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04433v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transverse electron transport in magnetic materials - manifested in effects such as the anomalous Hall and Nernst effects - holds promise for spintronic and thermoelectric applications. While recent advances have focused on enhancing such transport through topological single crystals via intrinsic mechanisms linked to Berry curvature, practical limitations remain due to their mechanical fragility and narrow material scope. Here, we demonstrate a distinct approach for transverse transport enhancement based on composite formation. Using both theoretical modeling and experiments, we show that disordered mixtures of two ferromagnetic materials can exhibit significantly stronger transverse electron deflection than either constituent alone. This enhancement originates from meandering electron pathways created by the disordered mixture of two materials and does not rely on long-range crystalline order. The identified requirements for this mechanism can be broadly satisfied across different material systems, offering a universal and tunable strategy to engineer large transverse responses in structurally robust platforms.</description>

      <title>Deformation and adiabatic heating of single crystalline and nanocrystalline Ni micropillars at high strain rates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14136v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The deformation behavior of single crystal and nanocrystalline nickel were studied using in situ micropillar compression experiments from quasi-static to high strain rates up to 10^3 s-1. Deformation occurred by dislocation slip activity in single crystal nickel whereas extensive grain boundary sliding was observed in nanocrystalline nickel, with a shift towards more inhomogeneous, localized deformation above 1 s-1. The strain rate sensitivity exponent was found to change at higher strain rates for both single crystal and nanocrystalline nickel, while the overall strain rate sensitivity was observed to be of the same value for both. With increasing high strain rate micropillar compression tests being reported, the issue of adiabatic heating in micropillars becomes important. We report crystal plasticity based finite element modeling to estimate the adiabatic heating, spatially resolved within the pillar, at the highest tested strain rates. The simulations predicted a significant temperature rise of up to 200 K in nanocrystalline Ni at the grain boundaries, and 20 K in single crystalline Ni due to strain localization. Transmission Kikuchi Diffraction analysis of nanocrystalline nickel pillar post compression at 10^3 s-1 did not show any grain growth.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00484v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the long-standing question of whether water molecules dissociate on the Ru(0001) surface through nanosecond-scale path-integral molecular dynamics simulations on a sizable supercell. This is made possible through the development of an efficient and reliable machine-learning potential with near first-principles accuracy, overcoming the limitations of previous ab initio studies. We show that the quantum delocalization associated with nuclear quantum effects enables rapid and frequent proton transfers between water molecules, thereby facilitating the water dissociation on Ru(0001). This work provides the direct theoretical evidence of water dissociation on Ru(0001), resolving the enduring issue in surface sciences and offering crucial atomistic insights into water-metal interfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecular nanomagnets are systems with a vast phenomenology and are very promising for a variety of technological applications, most notably spintronics and quantum information. Their low-energy spectrum and magnetic properties can be modeled using effective spin Hamiltonians, once the exchange coupling parameters between the localized magnetic moments are determined. In this work we employ density functional theory (DFT) to compute the exchange parameters between the atomic spins for two representative ring-shaped molecules containing eight transition-metal magnetic ions: Cr$_8$ and V$_8$. Considering a set of properly chosen spin configurations and mapping their DFT energies on the corresponding expressions from a Heisenberg Hamiltonian, we compute the exchange couplings between magnetic ions which are first, second and further neighbors on the rings. In spite of their chemical and structural similarities the two systems exhibit very different ground states: antiferromagnetic for Cr$_8$, ferromagnetic for V$_8$, which also features non-negligible couplings between second nearest neighbors. A rationalization of these results is proposed that is based on a multi-band Hubbard model with less-than-half filled shells on magnetic ions.</description>

Abstract: Several authors have suggested that the surfaces of vanishing potential generated by the electrostatic fields from a distribution of point charges resemble triply periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS) corresponding to the positions of the point charges. We provide a theoretical basis for this phenomenological comparison by starting with the Boltzmann equation to show that the surface corresponding to zero charge density is a minimal surface. We then use density-functional calculations for elemental materials that differ electronically and structurally, Na, Cu, and Al, to show that surfaces of vanishing charge density converge to the corresponding TPMS.</description>

Abstract: Diamond lattice magnets, formed by a framework of corner-sharing tetrahedra of magnetic cations, offer unique opportunities to realize novel states of matter for potential utility in information technology. However, research has mostly focused on AB2X4 spinels with Td magnetic ions. This hinders the atomically enabled tunability of competing interactions at different energy scales and the ability to harness many-body electronic states in quantum materials, making the discovery of quantum fluctuations and spin dynamics less accessible. We discover a new material CaCo2TeO6 featuring a diamond lattice of two distinct Oh-Co2+ sites. This material displays strong quantum fluctuations, increased competing magnetic exchange interactions, and field-induced tunability of magnetic structures. The results demonstrate how simple, fundamental refinements in ligand fields can profoundly influence the phase space of quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Resistive switching and charge accumulation in Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 nanoparticles</title>

Abstract: We revealed the resistive switching, negative differential resistance and charge accumulation effects in Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 nanopowders sintered by the auto-combustion sol-gel method and annealed at temperatures from 500{\deg}C to 800{\deg}C. The fraction of the orthorhombic phase, determined by the X-ray diffraction (XRD), decreases from 91 vol.% to 7 vol.% with an increase in the annealing temperature from 600{\deg}C to 800{\deg}C. The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra reveal the great amount of oxygen vacancies in the annealed samples, at that the decrease of the orthorhombic phase fraction (observed with an increase in the annealing temperature) correlates with a decrease in the intensity of EPR spectral lines associated with the oxygen vacancies and impurities. This indicates the participation of oxygen vacancies and other defects in the formation of the orthorhombic phase in the Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 powders. To explain the results of electrophysical measurements, we compare the features of the current-voltage characteristics with the phase composition of the Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 powders and with the peculiarities of their EPR spectra. The analysis allows us to relate the resistive switching and charge accumulation observed in Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 nanopowders with the appearance of the ferroelectric-like polar regions in the orthorhombic phase of the nanoparticles, which agrees with the calculations performed in the framework of Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire approach and density functional theory.</description>

      <title>Parsimonious inertial cavitation rheometry via bubble collapse time</title>

Abstract: The rapid and accurate characterization of soft, viscoelastic materials at high strain rates is of interest in biological and engineering applications. Examples include assessing the extent of tissue ablation during histotripsy procedures and developing injury criteria for the mitigation of blast injuries. The inertial microcavitation rheometry technique (IMR, Estrada et al., 2018) allows for the characterization of local viscoelastic properties at strain rates up to 1E8 per second. However, IMR now typically relies on bright-field videography of a sufficiently translucent sample at &gt;1 million frames per second and a simulation-dependent fit optimization process that can require hours of post-processing. Here, we present an improved IMR-style technique, called parsimonious inertial microcavitation rheometry (pIMR), that parsimoniously characterizes surrounding viscoelastic materials. The pIMR approach uses experimental advancements to estimate the time to first collapse of the laser-induced cavity within approximately 20 ns and a theoretical energy balance analysis that yields an approximate collapse time based on the material viscoelasticity parameters. The pIMR method closely matches the accuracy of the original IMR procedure while decreasing the computational cost from hours to seconds while potentially reducing reliance on ultra-high-speed videography. This technique can enable nearly real-time characterization of soft, viscoelastic hydrogels and biological materials with a numerical criterion assessing the correct choice of model. We illustrate the efficacy of the technique on batches of tens of experiments for both soft hydrogels and fluids.</description>

      <title>Universal term of Entanglement Entropy in the $\pi$-flux Hubbard model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.10602v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Researchers in physical science aim to uncover universal features in strongly interacting many-body systems, often hidden in complicated observables like entanglement entropy (EE). The non-local nature of EE makes it challenging to compute numerically, necessitating the development of an unbiased and convenient algorithm. In this paper, we use quantum Monte Carlo to reveal that the coefficient of variation in direct EE calculations increases exponentially with system size, leading to inaccuracies. To address this issue, we develop a power incremental algorithm and a technique for straightforwardly calculating the universal term of EE, successfully evaluating the EE of a 2D Hubbard model. Our numerical results demonstrate the consistency of the universal coefficient of EE from sharp corners at the Gross-Neveu quantum critical point and for free Dirac fermions. Our method can also be applied to other unstable observables, such as partition functions, entanglement spectra, and negativity, thereby fostering computational and theoretical progress.</description>

      <title>Origin of magic angles in twisted bilayer graphene: The magic ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10026v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The unexpected discovery of superconductivity and strong electron correlation in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG), a system containing only sp electrons, is considered as one of the most intriguing developments in two-dimensional materials in recent years. The key feature is the emergent flat energy bands near the Fermi level, a favorable condition for novel many-body phases, at the so-called "magic angles". The physical origin of these interesting flat bands has been elusive to date, hindering the construction of an effective theory for the unconventional electron correlation. In this work, we have identified the importance of charge accumulation in the AA region of the moire supercell and the most critical role of the Fermi ring in AA-stacked bilayer graphene. We show that the magic angles can be predicted by the moire periodicity determined by the size of this Fermi ring. The resonant criterion in momentum space makes it possible to coherently combine states on the Fermi ring through scattering by the moire potential, leading to flat bands near the Fermi level. We thus establish the physical origin of the magic angles in TBG and identify the characteristics of one-particle states associated with the flat bands for further many-body investigations.</description>

      <title>Magnetic nutation: transient separation of magnetization from its angular momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01334v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For nearly 90 years, precession and relaxation processes have been thought to dominate magnetization dynamics. Only recently has it been considered that, on short time scales, an inertia-driven magnetization dynamics should become relevant, leading to additional nutation of the magnetization vector. Here, we trigger magnetic nutation via a sudden excitation of a thin Ni80Fe20 (Permalloy) film with an ultrashort optical pulse, that leads to an abrupt tilting of the effective field acting on the magnetic moments, separating the dynamics of the magnetization from that of its angular momentum. We investigate the resulting magnetization dynamics in the inertial regime experimentally by the time-resolved magneto optical Kerr effect. We find a characteristic oscillation in the Kerr signal in the range of about 0.1 THz superimposed on the precessional oscillations with GHz frequencies. By comparison with atomistic spin dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that this observation cannot be explained by the well-known Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation of motion but can be attributed to inertial contributions leading to nutation of the magnetization vector around its angular momentum. Hence, an optical and non-resonant excitation of inertial magnetization dynamics can trigger and control different magnetic processes, ranging from demagnetization via nutation to precession in a single device. These findings will have profound implications for the understanding of ultrafast spin dynamics and magnetization switching.</description>
