      <title>Evaluating noises of boson sampling with statistical benchmark methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The lack of self-correcting codes hiders the development of boson sampling to be large-scale and robust. Therefore, it is important to know the noise levels in order to cautiously demonstrate the quantum computational advantage or realize certain tasks. Based on those statistical benchmark methods such as the correlators and the clouds, which are initially proposed to discriminate boson sampling and other mockups, we quantificationally evaluate noises of photon partial distinguishability and photon loss compensated by dark counts. This is feasible owing to the fact that the output distribution unbalances are suppressed by noises, which are actually results of multi-photon interferences. This is why the evaluation performance is better when high order correlators or corresponding clouds are employed. Our results indicate that the statistical benchmark methods can also work in the task of evaluating noises of boson sampling.</description>

      <title>Operator algebra of the information-disturbance tradeoff in quantum measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum measurements can be described by operators that assign conditional probabilities to different outcomes while also describing unavoidable physical changes to the system. Here, we point out that operators describing information gain at minimal disturbance can be expanded into a set of unitary operators representing experimentally distinguishable patterns of disturbance. The observable statistics of disturbance defines a tight upper bound on the information gain of the measurement.</description>

      <title>Passive detection of Schwinger boson dynamics via a qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum sensing landscape has been revolutionized by advanced technologies like superconducting circuits and qubit-based systems which have furthered the ability to probe and understand fundamental properties of quantum matter. Here, we propose an integrated photonic device where a transmon qubit capacitively couples to a microwave cross-resonator, and the setup is employed for sensing of time reversal broken order in materials. In this sensing scheme, the transmon qubit plays a dual role as both a control element and a passive detector, while the photonic cross-resonator serves as the host for the sample, enabling a contact-free spectroscopic method suitable for studying materials where reliable electrical contacts are challenging to obtain, e.g., in van der Waal 2D heterostructures. We show that by tuning the coupling strength and phase between the transmon and the cross-resonator, the system allows selective control over the interaction dynamics and leads to a highly sensitive detection method that can be compactly understood in terms of evolution of excited state population and quantum metric of the resonator-transmon hybrid state. This architecture has the potential to host a wide range of quantum phenomena that can be precisely encoded in the dynamics of the transmon qubit and, in this way, potentially allows access to elusive aspects of correlated materials.</description>

      <title>Complexity and hardness of random peaked circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near-term feasibility, classical hardness, and verifiability are the three requirements for demonstrating quantum advantage; most existing quantum advantage proposals achieve at most two. A promising candidate recently proposed is through randomly generated peaked circuits. In this work, we study an explicit construction for random peaked circuits: first selecting a random circuit $C$ of polynomial size, which forms a $k$-design. Subsequently, a second random circuit $C'$ is chosen from the same architecture, subject to a postselection criterion: $C'$ must exhibit a high overlap with $C$ in one of their rows. Utilizing unitary design properties, we demonstrate that the circuits generated by this method are non-trivial; specifically, $C'$ is provably far from $C^\dagger$. Indeed, with overwhelmingly high probability, a random peaked circuit generated this way is non-compressible and is of circuit complexity $\tilde \Omega(nk)$. This resolves an open problem posed by Aaronson in 2022. Secondly, we analytically establish that estimating the peakedness of a random peaked circuit to within a $2^{-\text{poly}(n)}$ additive error, is average-case \#P-hard. When the additive error is relaxed to $1/\text{poly}(n)$, we note that the worst-case scenario for this problem is BQP-complete. Under widely accepted assumptions on random quantum circuits, we identify a regime where no classical polynomial-time sequential simulator attains inverse-polynomial additive accuracy on the peak on a non-negligible fraction of instances. Thirdly, we study using peaked circuits as a practical attempt for a verifiable quantum advantage protocol. While the postselection method for generating peaked circuits could be costly, we demonstrate that numerical search for $C'$ with randomized initialization successfully returns a random peaked circuit, achieving the properties as theoretically predicted.</description>

      <title>Approximate Quantum State Preparation with Tree-Based Bayesian Optimization Surrogates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00145v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of approximate state preparation on near-term quantum computers, where the goal is to construct a parameterized circuit that reproduces the output distribution of a target quantum state while minimizing resource overhead. This task is especially relevant for near-term algorithms where distributional matching suffices, but it is challenging due to stochastic outputs, limited circuit depth, and a high-dimensional, non-smooth parameter space. We propose CircuitTree, a surrogate-guided optimization framework based on Bayesian Optimization with tree-based models, which avoids the scalability and smoothness assumptions of Gaussian Process surrogates. Our framework introduces a structured layerwise decomposition strategy that partitions parameters into blocks aligned with variational circuit architecture, enabling distributed and sample-efficient optimization with theoretical convergence guarantees. Empirical evaluations on synthetic benchmarks and variational tasks validate our theoretical insights, showing that CircuitTree achieves low total variation distance and high fidelity while requiring significantly shallower circuits than existing approaches.</description>

      <title>The non-stabilizerness cost of quantum state estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the non-stabilizer resources required to achieve informational completeness in single-setting quantum state estimation scenarios. We consider fixed-basis projective measurements preceded by quantum circuits acting on $n$-qubit input states, allowing ancillary qubits to increase retrievable information. We prove that when only stabilizer resources are allowed, these strategies are always informationally equivalent to projective measurements in a stabilizer basis, and therefore never informationally complete, regardless of the number of ancillas. We then show that incorporating $T$ gates enlarges the accessible information. Specifically, we prove that at least ${2n}/{\log_2 3}$ such gates are necessary for informational completeness, and that $2n$ suffice. We conjecture that $2n$ gates are indeed both necessary and sufficient. Finally, we unveil a tight connection between entanglement structure and informational power of measurements implemented with $t$-doped Clifford circuits. Our results recast notions of "magic" and stabilizerness - typically framed in computational terms - into the setting of quantum metrology.</description>

      <title>Query-Optimal Estimation of Unitary Channels via Pauli Dimensionality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study process tomography of unitary channels whose Pauli spectrum is supported on a small subgroup. Given query access to an unknown unitary channel whose Pauli spectrum is supported on a subgroup of size $2^k$, our goal is to output a classical description that is $\epsilon$-close to the unknown unitary in diamond distance. We present an algorithm that achieves this using $O(2^k/\epsilon)$ queries, and we prove matching lower bounds, establishing query optimality of our algorithm. When $k = 2n$, so that the support is the full Pauli group, our result recovers the query-optimal $O(4^n/\epsilon)$-query algorithm of Haah, Kothari, O'Donnell, and Tang [FOCS '23].
  Our result has two notable consequences. First, we give a query-optimal $O(4^k/\epsilon)$-query algorithm for learning quantum $k$-juntas -- unitary channels that act non-trivially on only $k$ of the $n$ qubits -- to accuracy $\epsilon$ in diamond distance. This represents an exponential improvement in both query and time complexity over prior work.
  Second, we give a computationally efficient algorithm for learning compositions of depth-$O(\log \log n)$ circuits with near-Clifford circuits, where "near-Clifford" means a Clifford circuit augmented with at most $O(\log n)$ non-Clifford single-qubit gates. This unifies prior work, which could handle only constant-depth circuits or near-Clifford circuits, but not their composition.</description>

      <title>Quantum reservoir computing using Jaynes-Cummings model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate quantum reservoir computing (QRC) using a hybrid qubit-boson system described by the Jaynes-Cummings (JC) Hamiltonian and its dispersive limit (DJC). These models provide high-dimensional Hilbert spaces and intrinsic nonlinear dynamics, making them powerful substrates for temporal information processing. We systematically benchmark both reservoirs through linear and nonlinear memory tasks, demonstrating that they exhibit an unusual superior nonlinear over linear memory capacity. We further test their predictive performance on the Mackey-Glass time series, a widely used benchmark for chaotic dynamics and show comparable forecasting ability. We also investigate how memory and prediction accuracy vary with reservoir parameters, and show the role of higher-order bosonic observables and time multiplexing in enhancing expressivity, even in minimal spin-boson configurations. Our results establish JC- and DJC-based reservoirs as versatile platforms for time-series processing and as elementary units that overcome the setting of equivalent qubit pairs and offer pathways towards tunable, high-performance quantum machine learning architectures.</description>

      <title>Practical Quantum Clock Synchronization Using Weak Coherent Pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Establishing and maintaining a common time reference across spatially separated devices is a prerequisite for networked quantum experiments and secure communications. Classical two-way timing protocols such as Network Time Protocol (NTP) or Precision Time Protocol (PTP) are vulnerable to asymmetric channel delays and cannot provide the picosecond-level precision demanded by quantum repeater networks. We propose and numerically evaluate a quantum-enhanced clock synchronization protocol based on attenuated weak coherent pulses (WCPs) and bidirectional Hong--Ou--Mandel (HOM) interferometry. Our simulations assume telecom-band photons ($1550\,\mathrm{nm}$) with a temporal width of $10.0\,\mathrm{ns}$, a repetition rate of $f = 10\,\mathrm{MHz}$, effective mean photon number $\mu = 1.0$, detector efficiency $\eta = 85\%$, detector timing jitter of $150\,\mathrm{ps}$, and channel loss of $0.2\,\mathrm{dB/km}$. We simulate that sub-nanosecond clock-offset accuracy and precision can be achieved under these operating conditions. This work demonstrates that high-repetition-rate WCPs combined with HOM interference can provide flexible and secure quantum clock synchronization at sub-nanosecond precision.</description>

      <title>A Review of Software for Designing and Operating Quantum Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum network protocol development is crucial to realizing a production-grade network that can support distributed sensing, secure communication, and utility-scale quantum computation. However, the transition from laboratory demonstration to deployable networks requires software implementations of architectures and protocols tailored to the unique constraints of quantum systems. This paper reviews the current state of software implementations for quantum networks, organized around the three-plane abstraction of infrastructure, logical, and control/service planes. We cover software for both designing quantum network protocols (e.g., SeQUeNCe, QuISP, and NetSquid) and operating them, with a focus on essential control/service plane functions such as entanglement, topology, and resource management, in a proposed taxonomy. Our review highlights a persistent gap between theoretical protocol proposals and their realization in simulators or testbeds, particularly in dynamic topology and network management. We conclude by outlining open challenges and proposing a roadmap for developing scalable software architectures to enable hybrid, large-scale quantum networks.</description>

      <title>SPAM Tolerance for Pauli Error Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Pauli channel is a fundamental model of noise in quantum systems, motivating the task of Pauli error estimation. We present an algorithm that builds on the reduction to Population Recovery introduced in [FO21]. Addressing an open question from that work, our algorithm has the key advantage of robustness against even severe state preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors. To tolerate SPAM, we must analyze Population Recovery on a combined erasure/bit-flip channel, which necessitates extending the complex analysis techniques from [PSW17, DOS17]. For $n$-qubit channels, our Pauli error estimation algorithm requires only $\exp(n^{1/3})$ unentangled state preparations and measurements, improving on previous SPAM-tolerant algorithms that had $2^n$-dependence even for restricted families of Pauli channels. We also give evidence that no SPAM-tolerant method can make asymptotically fewer than $\exp(n^{1/3})$ uses of the channel.</description>

      <title>Double-Bracket Algorithmic Cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Algorithmic cooling shows that it is possible to locally reduce the entropy of a qubit belonging to an isolated ensemble such as nuclear spins in molecules or nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamonds. In the same physical setting, we introduce double-bracket algorithmic cooling (DBAC), a protocol that systematically suppresses quantum coherence of pure states. DBAC achieves this by simulating quantum imaginary-time evolution through recursive unitary synthesis of Riemannian steepest-descent flows and it utilizes density-matrix exponentiation as a subroutine. This subroutine makes DBAC a concrete instance of a dynamic quantum algorithm that operates using quantum information stored in copies of the input states. Thus, the circuits of DBAC are independent of the input state, enabling the extension of algorithmic cooling from targeting entropy to quantum coherence without resorting to measurements. Akin to Nernst principle, DBAC increases the cooling performance when including more input qubits which serve as quantum instructions. Our work demonstrates that dynamic quantum algorithms are a promising route toward new protocols for foundational tasks in quantum thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>QSearchNet: A Quantum Walk Search Framework for Link Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Link prediction is one of the fundamental problems in graph theory, critical for understanding and forecasting the evolution of complex systems like social and biological networks. While classical heuristics capture certain aspects of graph topology, they often struggle to optimally integrate local and global structural information or adapt to complex dependencies. Quantum computing offers a powerful alternative by leveraging superposition for simultaneous multi-path exploration and interference-driven integration of both local and global graph features. In this work, we introduce QSearchNet, a quantum-inspired framework based on Discrete-Time Quantum Walk (DTQW) dynamics and Grover's amplitude amplification. QSearchNet simulates a topology-aware quantum evolution to propagate amplitudes across multiple nodes simultaneously. By aligning interference patterns through quantum reflection and oracle-like phase-flip operation, it adaptively prioritizes multi-hop dependencies and amplifies structurally relevant paths corresponding to potential connections. Experiments on diverse real-world networks demonstrate competitive performance, particularly with hard negative samples under realistic evaluation conditions.</description>

      <title>Low Depth Color Code Circuits with CXSWAP gate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present two new types of syndrome extraction circuits for the color code. Our first construction, which after [M. McEwen, D. Bacon, and C. Gidney, Quantum 7, 1172 (2023)] we call the semi-wiggling color code, promises to mitigate leakage errors by periodically interchanging the roles of bulk data and measurement qubits. The second construction reduces circuit depth relative to [C. Gidney and C. Jones, arXiv:2312.08813 (2023)] by employing the CXSWAP gate instead of CNOT. This optimization leads to $\sim 10\%$ improvement in teraquop footprint under the uniform error model with the physical error rate $p=0.1\%$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum signal processing (QSP) provides a representation of scalar polynomials of degree $d$ as products of matrices in $\mathrm{SU}(2)$, parameterized by $(d+1)$ real numbers known as phase factors. QSP is the mathematical foundation of quantum singular value transformation (QSVT), which is often regarded as one of the most important quantum algorithms of the past decade, with a wide range of applications in scientific computing, from Hamiltonian simulation to solving linear systems of equations and eigenvalue problems. In this article we survey recent advances in the mathematical and numerical analysis of QSP. In particular, we focus on its generalization beyond polynomials, the computational complexity of algorithms for phase factor evaluation, and the numerical stability of such algorithms. The resolution to some of these problems relies on an unexpected interplay between QSP, nonlinear Fourier analysis on $\mathrm{SU}(2)$, fast polynomial multiplications, and Gaussian elimination for matrices with displacement structure.</description>

Abstract: Squeezed cat quantum error correction (QEC) codes have garnered attention because of their robustness against photon-loss and excitation errors while maintaining the biased-noise property of cat codes. In this work, we reveal the utility of the unexplored translational symmetry of the squeezed cat codes, with applications to autonomous QEC, reliable logical operations, and readout in a non-orthogonal basis. Using the basis under subsystem decomposition spanned by squeezed displaced Fock states, we analytically show that our autonomous QEC protocol allows for correcting logical errors due to photon loss, although the translational symmetry in one direction does not uniquely specify the code space. We also introduce the implementation methods of reliable logical operations by repeated alternation of a small-step unitary operation with a subsequent step of QEC onto the code space. Finally, by appropriately treating the non-Hermitian nature of the logical $Z$ operator, we also propose a circuit for precisely reading out the squeezed cat code in a non-orthogonal basis.</description>

      <title>Quantum Probabilistic Label Refining: Enhancing Label Quality for Robust Image Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning with softmax cross-entropy on one-hot labels often leads to overconfident predictions and poor robustness under noise or perturbations. Label smoothing mitigates this by redistributing some confidence uniformly, but treats all samples equally, ignoring intra-class variability. We propose a hybrid quantum-classical framework that leverages quantum non-determinism to refine data labels into probabilistic ones, offering more nuanced, human-like uncertainty representations than label smoothing or Bayesian approaches. A variational quantum circuit (VQC) encodes inputs into multi-qubit quantum states, using entanglement and superposition to capture subtle feature correlations. Measurement via the Born rule extracts probabilistic soft labels that reflect input-specific uncertainty. These labels are then used to train a classical convolutional neural network (CNN) with soft-target cross-entropy loss. On MNIST and Fashion-MNIST, our method improves robustness, achieving up to 50% higher accuracy under noise while maintaining competitive accuracy on clean data. It also enhances model calibration and interpretability, as CNN outputs better reflect quantum-derived uncertainty. This work introduces Quantum Probabilistic Label Refining, bridging quantum measurement and classical deep learning for robust training via refined, correlation-aware labels without architectural changes or adversarial techniques.</description>

Abstract: Photons are a ubiquitous carrier of quantum information: they are fast, suffer minimal decoherence, and do not require huge cryogenic facilities. Nevertheless, their intrinsically weak photon-photon interactions remain a key obstacle to scalable quantum computing. This review surveys hybrid photonic quantum computing, which exploits multiple photonic degrees of freedom to combine the complementary strengths of discrete and bosonic encodings, thereby significantly mitigating the challenge of weak photon-photon interactions. We first outline the basic principles of discrete-variable, native continuous-variable, and bosonic-encoding paradigms. We then summarise recent theoretical advances and state-of-the-art experimental demonstrations with particular emphasis on the hybrid approach. Its unique advantages, such as efficient generation of resource states and nearly ballistic (active-feedforward-free) operations, are highlighted alongside remaining technical challenges. To facilitate a clear comparison, we explicitly present the error thresholds and resource overheads required for fault-tolerant quantum computing. Our work offers a focused overview that clarifies how the hybrid approach enables scalable and compatible architectures for quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Phase Transitions and Noise Robustness of Quantum Graph States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph states are entangled states that are essential for quantum information processing, including measurement-based quantum computation. As experimental advances enable the realization of large-scale graph states, efficient fidelity estimation methods are crucial for assessing their robustness against noise. However, calculations of exact fidelity become intractable for large systems due to the exponential growth in the number of stabilizers. In this work, we show that the fidelity between any ideal graph state and its noisy counterpart under IID Pauli noise can be mapped to the partition function of a classical spin system, enabling efficient computation via statistical mechanical techniques, including transfer matrix methods and Monte Carlo simulations. Using this approach, we analyze the fidelity for regular graph states under depolarizing noise and uncover the emergence of phase transitions in fidelity between the pure-state regime and the noise-dominated regime governed by both the connectivity (degree) and spatial dimensionality of the graph state. Specifically, in 2D, phase transitions occur only when the degree satisfies $d\ge 6$, while in 3D they already appear at $d\ge 5$. However, for graph states with excessively high degree, such as fully connected graphs, the phase transition disappears, suggesting that extreme connectivity suppresses critical behavior. These findings reveal that robustness of graph states against noise is determined by their connectivity and spatial dimensionality. Graph states with lower degree and/or dimensionality, which exhibit a smooth crossover rather than a sharp transition, demonstrate greater robustness, while highly connected or higher-dimensional graph states are more fragile. Extreme connectivity, as the fully connected graph state possesses, restores robustness.</description>

      <title>Linear-Size QAC0 Channels: Learning, Testing and Hardness</title>

Abstract: Shallow quantum circuits have attracted increasing attention in recent years, due to the fact that current noisy quantum hardware can only perform faithful quantum computation for a short amount of time. The constant-depth quantum circuits $\mathbf{QAC}^0$, a quantum counterpart of $\mathbf{AC}^0$ circuits, are the polynomial-size and constant-depth quantum circuits composed of only single-qubit unitaries and polynomial-size generalized Toffoli gates. The computational power of $\mathbf{QAC}^0$ has been extensively investigated in recent years. In this paper, we are concerned with $\mathbf{QLC}^0$ circuits, which are linear-size $\mathbf{QAC}^0$ circuits, a quantum counterpart of $\mathbf{LC}^0$.
  * We show that depth-$d$ $\mathbf{QAC}^0$ circuits working on $n$ input qubits and $a$ ancilla qubits have approximate degree at most $\tilde{O}((n+a)^{1-2^{-d}})$, improving the $\tilde{O}((n+a)^{1-3^{-d}})$ degree upper bound of previous works. Consequently, this directly implies that to compute the parity function, $\mathbf{QAC}^0$ circuits need at least $\tilde{O}(n^{1+2^{-d}})$ circuit size.
  * We present the first agnostic learning algorithm for $\mathbf{QLC}^0$ channels using subexponential running time and queries. Moreover, we also establish exponential lower bounds on the query complexity of learning $\mathbf{QAC}^0$ channels under both the spectral norm distance of the Choi matrix and the diamond norm distance.
  * We present a tolerant testing algorithm which determines whether an unknown quantum channel is a $\mathbf{QLC}^0$ channel. This tolerant testing algorithm is based on our agnostic learning algorithm.
  Our approach leverages low-degree approximations of $\mathbf{QAC}^0$ circuits and Pauli analysis as key technical tools. Collectively, these results advance our understanding of agnostic learning for shallow quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>On the Relativity of Quantumness as Implied by Relativity of Arithmetic and Probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A hierarchical structure of isomorphic arithmetics is defined by a bijection $g_\mathbb{R}:\mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}$. It entails a hierarchy of probabilistic models, with probabilities $p_k=g^k(p)$, where $g$ is the restriction of $g_\mathbb{R}$ to the interval $[0,1]$, $g^k$ is the $k$th iterate of $g$, and $k$ is an arbitrary integer (positive, negative, or zero; $g^0(x)=x$). The relation between $p$ and $g^k(p)$, $k&gt;0$, is analogous to the one between probability and neural activation function. For \mbox{$k\ll -1$}, $g^k(p)$ is essentially white noise (all processes are equally probable). The choice of $k=0$ is physically as arbitrary as the choice of origin of a line in space, hence what we regard as experimental binary probabilities, $p_{\rm exp}$, can be given by any $k$, $p_{\rm exp}=g^k(p)$. Quantum binary probabilities are defined by $g(p)=\sin^2\frac{\pi}{2}p$. With this concrete form of $g$, one finds that any two neighboring levels of the hierarchy are related to each other in a quantum--subquantum relation. In this sense, any model in the hierarchy is probabilistically quantum in appropriate arithmetic and calculus. And the other way around: any model is subquantum in appropriate arithmetic and calculus. Probabilities involving more than two events are constructed by means of trees of binary conditional probabilities. We discuss from this perspective singlet-state probabilities and Bell inequalities. We find that singlet state probabilities involve simultaneously three levels of the hierarchy: quantum, hidden, and macroscopic. As a by-product of the analysis, we discover a new (arithmetic) interpretation of the Fubini--Study geodesic distance.</description>

      <title>Provably Optimal Quantum Circuits with Mixed-Integer Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a depth-aware optimization framework for quantum circuit compilation that unifies provable optimality with scalable heuristics. For exact synthesis of a target unitary, we formulate a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) that linearly handles global-phase equivalence and uses explicit parallel scheduling variables to certify depth-optimal solutions for small-to-medium circuits. Domain-specific valid constraints, including identity ordering, commuting-gate pruning, short-sequence redundancy cuts, and Hermitian-conjugate linkages, significantly accelerate branch-and-bound, yielding speedups up to 43x on standard benchmarks. The framework supports hardware-aware objectives, enabling fault-tolerant (e.g. T-count) and NISQ-era (e.g. entangling gates) devices. For approximate synthesis, we propose 3 objectives: (i) exact, but non-convex, phase-invariant fidelity maximization; (ii) a linear surrogate that maximizes the real trace overlap, yielding a tight lower bound to fidelity; and (iii) a convex quadratic function that minimizes the circuit's Frobenius error.
  To scale beyond exact MILP, we propose a novel rolling-horizon optimization (RHO) that rolls primarily in time, caps the active-qubits, and enforces per-qubit closure while globally optimizing windowed segments. This preserves local context, reduces the Hilbert-space dimension, and enables iterative improvements without ancillas. On a 142-gate seed circuit, RHO yields 116 gates, an 18.3% reduction from the seed, while avoiding the trade-off between myopic passes and long run times. Empirically, our exact compilation framework achieves certified depth-optimal circuits on standard targets, high-fidelity Fibonacci-anyon weaves, and a 36% gate-count reduction on multi-body parity circuits. All methods are in the open-source QuantumCircuitOpt, providing a single framework that bridges exact certification and scalable synthesis.</description>

      <title>Practical considerations for assignment of photon numbers with SNSPDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) can enable photon-number resolution (PNR) based on accurate measurements of the detector's response time to few-photon optical pulses. In this work we investigate the impact of the optical pulse shape and duration on the accuracy of this method. We find that Gaussian temporal pulse shapes yield cleaner arrival-time histograms, and thus more accurate PNR, compared to bandpass-filtered pulses of equal bandwidth. For low system jitter and an optical pulse duration comparable to the other jitter contributions, photon numbers can be discriminated in our system with a commercial SNSPD. At 60 ps optical pulse duration, photon-number discrimination is significantly reduced. Furthermore, we highlight the importance of using the correct arrival-time histogram model when analyzing photon-number assignment. Using exponentially-modified Gaussian (EMG) distributions, instead of the commonly used Gaussian distributions, we can more accurately determine photon-number misidentification probabilities. Finally, we reconstruct the positive operator-valued measures (POVMs) of the detector, revealing sharp features which indicate the intrinsic PNR capabilities.</description>

      <title>On Estimating the Quantum Tsallis Relative Entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relative entropy between quantum states quantifies their distinguishability. The estimation of certain relative entropies has been investigated in the literature, e.g., the von Neumann relative entropy and sandwiched R\'enyi relative entropy. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of the estimation of the quantum Tsallis relative entropy. We show that for any constant $\alpha \in (0, 1)$, the $\alpha$-Tsallis relative entropy between two quantum states of rank $r$ can be estimated with sample complexity $\operatorname{poly}(r)$, which can be made more efficient if we know their state-preparation circuits. As an application, we obtain an approach to tolerant quantum state certification with respect to the quantum Hellinger distance with sample complexity $\widetilde{O}(r^{3.5})$, which exponentially outperforms the folklore approach based on quantum state tomography when $r$ is polynomial in the number of qubits. In addition, we show that the quantum state distinguishability problems with respect to the quantum $\alpha$-Tsallis relative entropy and quantum Hellinger distance are $\mathsf{QSZK}$-complete in a certain regime, and they are $\mathsf{BQP}$-complete in the low-rank case.</description>

      <title>Computational Monogamy of Entanglement and Non-Interactive Quantum Key Distribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) enables Alice and Bob to exchange a secret key over a public, untrusted quantum channel. Compared to classical key exchange, QKD achieves everlasting security: after the protocol execution the key is secure against adversaries that can do unbounded computations. On the flip side, while classical key exchange can be achieved non-interactively (with two simultaneous messages between Alice and Bob), no non-interactive protocol is known that provides everlasting security, even using quantum information.
  In this work, we make progress on this problem. Our main technical contribution is a computational variant of the celebrated monogamy of entanglement game, where the secret is only computationally hidden from the players, rather than information-theoretically. In these settings, we prove a negligible bound on the maximal winning probability over all strategies. As a direct application, we obtain a non-interactive (simultaneous message) QKD protocol from any post-quantum classical non-interactive key exchange, which satisfies everlastingly secure assuming Alice and Bob agree on the same key. The protocol only uses EPR pairs and standard and Hadamard basis measurements, making it suitable for near-term quantum hardware. We also propose how to convert this protocol into a two-round protocol that satisfies the standard notion of everlasting security.
  Finally, we prove a no-go theorem which establishes that (in contrast to the case of ordinary multi-round QKD) entanglement is necessary for non-interactive QKD, i.e., the messages sent by Alice and Bob cannot both be unentangled with their respective quantum memories if the protocol is to be everlastingly secure.</description>

      <title>Pre-Distillation of Magic States via Composite Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magic state distillation (MSD) is a cornerstone of fault-tolerant quantum computing, enabling non-Clifford gates via state injection into stabilizer circuits. However, the substantial overhead of current MSD protocols remains a major obstacle to scalable implementations. We propose a general framework for pre-distillation, based on composite pulse sequences that suppress systematic errors in the generation of magic states. Unlike typical composite designs that target simple gates such as $X$, $Z$, or Hadamard, our schemes directly implement the non-Clifford $\mathcal{T}$ gate with enhanced robustness. We develop composite sequences tailored to the dominant control imperfections in superconducting, trapped-ion, neutral-atom, and integrated photonic platforms. To quantify improvement in the implementation, we introduce an operationally motivated fidelity measure specifically tailored to the $\mathcal{T}$ gate: the T-magic error, which captures the gate's effectiveness in preparing high-fidelity magic states. We further show that the error in the channel arising from the injection of faulty magic states scales linearly with the leading-order error of the states. Across all platforms, our approach yields high-fidelity $\mathcal{T}$ gates with reduced noise, lowering the number of distillation levels by up to three. This translates to exponential savings in qubit overhead and offers a practical path toward more resource-efficient universal quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Diffraction by Circular and Triangular Apertures as a Diagnostic Tool of Twisted Matter Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study diffraction of twisted matter waves (electrons and light ions carrying orbital angular momentum $\ell/\hbar=0,\pm1,\pm2,\ldots$ by circular and triangular apertures. Within the scalar Kirchhoff-Fresnel framework, circular apertures preserve cylindrical symmetry and produce ringlike far-field profiles whose radii and widths depend on $|\ell|$ but are insensitive to its sign. In contrast, equilateral triangles break axial symmetry and yield structured patterns that encode both the magnitude and the sign of $\ell$. A transparent Fraunhofer mapping links detector coordinates to the Fourier plane, explaining the $(|\ell|+1)$-lobe rule and the sign-dependent rotation of the pattern. We validate these results for both ideal Bessel beams and localized Laguerre-Gaussian packets, and we cross-check them by split-step Fourier propagation of the time-dependent Schr"odinger equation. From these analyses we extract practical design rules (Fraunhofer distance, lattice pitch, detector sampling) relevant to OAM diagnostics with moderately relativistic electrons with $E_{\rm kin}\sim0.1$ to $5$ MeV and light ions with $E_{\rm kin}\sim0.1$ to $1$ MeV/u. Our results establish triangular diffraction as a simple, passive, and robust method for reading out the OAM content of structured quantum beams.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is motivated by two key observations. First, Toffoli ladders can be implemented in three distinct ways: with linear or polylogarithmic depth using no ancilla, or with logarithmic depth using ancilla qubits. Second, two fundamental structural approaches to designing addition algorithms can be identified in several well-known quantum adders. At their core is the Toffoli ladder, and both provide a clear and simple connection between ripple-carry and carry-lookahead adder designs. Combining these two structures with the three Toffoli ladder implementations yields six quantum adders: four are well-known and two novel. Notably, one of the novel designs is a carry-lookahead adder that outperforms previous approaches.</description>

      <title>Perfect Quantum State Revivals: Designing Arbitrary Potentials with Specified Energy Levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that there exist a limited number of analytic potentials with the unusual property that any bound quantum state therein will be periodic in time. This is known as a perfect quantum state revival. Examples of such potentials are the infinite well, quantum harmonic oscillator and the P\"oschl-Teller potentials; here, we present a general method of designing such potentials. A key requirement is that their energy eigenvalues have integer spacings (up to a prefactor). We first analyze the required conditions which permit quantum state revivals for potentials in general, and then we use techniques of iterated Hamiltonian intertwining to construct potentials exhibiting perfect quantum revivals. Our method can readily be extended to multiple dimensions.</description>

      <title>Visualizing Quantum Circuits: State Vector Difference Highlighting and the Half-Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing graphical user interfaces for circuit simulators often show small visual summaries of the reduced state of each qubit, showing the probability, phase, purity, and/or Bloch sphere coordinates associated with each qubit. These necessarily provide an incomplete picture of the quantum state of the qubits, and can sometimes be confusing for students or newcomers to quantum computing. We contribute two novel visual approaches to provide more complete information about small circuits. First, to complement information about each qubit, we show the complete state vector, and illustrate the way that amplitudes change from layer-to-layer under the effect of different gates, by using a small set of colors, arrows, and symbols. We call this ``state vector difference highlighting'', and show how it elucidates the effect of Hadamard, X, Y, Z, S, T, Phase, and SWAP gates, where each gate may have an arbitrary combination of control and anticontrol qubits. Second, we display pairwise information about qubits (such as concurrence and correlation) in a triangular ``half-matrix'' visualization. Our open source software implementation, called MuqcsCraft, is available as a live online demonstration that runs in a web browser without installing any additional software, allowing a user to define a circuit through drag-and-drop actions, and then simulate and visualize it.</description>

      <title>Optimal Untelegraphable Encryption and Implications for Uncloneable Encryption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the notion of untelegraphable encryption (UTE), a quantum encryption primitive that is a special case of uncloneable encryption (UE), where the adversary's capabilities are restricted to producing purely classical information rather than arbitrary quantum states. We present an unconditionally secure construction of UTE that achieves untelegraphable-indistinguishability security, together with natural multi-ciphertext and bounded collusion-resistant extensions, without requiring any additional assumptions. We also extend this to the unbounded case, assuming pseudo-random unitaries, yielding everlasting security. Furthermore, we derive results on UE using approaches from UTE in the following ways: first, we provide new lower bounds on UTE, which give new lower bounds on UE; second, we prove an asymptotic equivalence between UTE and UE in the regime where the number of adversaries in UE grows. These results suggest that UTE may provide a new path toward achieving a central open problem in the area: indistinguishability security for UE in the plain model.</description>

      <title>Triple-Tone Microwave Control for Sensitivity Optimization in Compact Ensemble Nitrogen-Vacancy Magnetometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensembles of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are a well-established platform for quantum magnetometry under ambient conditions. One challenge arises from the hyperfine structure of the NV, which, for the common $^{14}$N isotope, results in a threefold reduction of contrast and thus sensitivity. By addressing each of the NV hyperfine transitions individually, triple-tone microwave (MW) control can mitigate this sensitivity loss. Here, we experimentally and theoretically investigate the regimes in which triple-tone excitation offers an advantage over standard single-tone MW control for two DC magnetometry protocols: pulsed optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) and Ramsey interferometry. We validate a master equation model of the NV dynamics against ensemble NV measurements, and use the model to explore triple-tone vs single-tone sensitivity for different MW powers and NV dephasing rates. For pulsed ODMR, triple-tone driving improves sensitivity by up to a factor of three in the low-dephasing regime, with diminishing gains when dephasing rates approach the hyperfine splitting. In contrast, for Ramsey interferometry, triple-tone excitation only improves sensitivity if MW power is limited. Our results delineate the operating regimes where triple-tone control provides a practical strategy for enhancing NV ensemble magnetometry in portable and power-limited sensors.</description>

      <title>Probing quantum advantage for solving the Fermi-Hubbard model with entropy benchmarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We developed a practical quantum advantage benchmarking framework that connects the accumulation of entropy in a quantum processing unit and the degradation of the solution to a target optimization problem. The benchmark is based on approximating from below the Gibbs states boundary in the energy-entropy space for the application of interest. We believe the proposed benchmarking technique creates a powerful bridge between hardware benchmarking and application benchmarking, while remaining hardware-agnostic. It can be extended to fault-tolerant scenarios and relies on computationally tractable numerics. We demonstrate its applicability on the problem of finding the ground state of the two-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard.</description>

      <title>Block-Encoding Tensor Networks and QUBO Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give an algorithm that converts any tensor network (TN) into a sequence of local unitaries whose composition block-encodes the network contraction, suitable for Quantum Eigenvalue / Singularvalue Transformation (QET/QSVT). The construction embeds each TN as a local isometry and dilates it to a unitary. Performing this step for every site of the tensor, allows the full network to be block-encoded. The theory is agnostic to virtual-bond sizes; for qubit resource counts and examples we assume global power-of-two padding. Further, we present a deterministic sweep that maps Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) / Ising Hamiltonians into Matrix Product Operators (MPOs) and general TN. We provide formal statements, pseudo-code, resource formulae, and a discussion of the use for state preparation and learning of general quantum operators.</description>

      <title>A hypersphere-like non-Abelian Yang monopole and its topological characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00941v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthetic monopoles, which correspond to degeneracies of Hamiltonians, play a central role in understanding exotic topological phenomena. Dissipation-induced non-Herminicity (NH), extending the eigenspectra of Hamiltonians from the real to complex domain, largely enriches the topological physics associated with synthetic monopoles. We here investigate exceptional points (EPs) in a four-dimensional NH system, finding a hypersphere-like non-Abelian Yang monopole in a five-dimensional parameter space, formed by EP2 pairs. Such an exotic structure enables the NH Yang monopole to exhibit a unique topological transition, which is inaccessible with the point-like counterpart. We characterize such a topological phenomenon with the second Chern number.</description>

      <title>Cumulant expansion approach to the decay dynamics of interacting M\"ossbauer nuclei after strong impulsive excitation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent progress in accelerator-based x-ray sources brings higher excitation of ensembles of M\"ossbauer nuclei closer to experimental feasibility. Yet, a theoretical modeling of the decay dynamics of the interacting nuclear ensemble after the impulsive excitation is still an open challenge. Here, we derive a set of nonlinear equations which is capable of efficiently modeling large nuclear ensembles for arbitrary degrees of excitation. As key signature for higher excitation, we identify a non-linear time-evolution of the nuclear dipole phase, which can be tuned via the scattering geometry, and interferometrically be measured. Furthermore, we identify interesting finite-size effects in the nuclear dynamics of small ensembles. Our results provide important guidance for future experiments aiming at the non-linear excitation of nuclei. We further envision the exploration of finite size-effects in M\"ossbauer spectroscopy with highest spatial resolution, i.e., small sample volumes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum information and computation, a central challenge is to determine which quantum states can be transformed into one another under restricted sets of free operations. While many transformations are impossible directly, catalytic processes can enable otherwise forbidden conversions: an auxiliary quantum state (the catalyst) facilitates the transformation while remaining unchanged. In this work, we introduce flexible catalysis, a generalization in which the catalyst is allowed to transform into a different auxiliary state, provided it remains a valid catalyst. We show that this framework subsumes both standard catalytic and multicopy transformations, and we analyze its advantages across several classes of free operations. In particular, we prove that when the free operations are local unitaries or permutation matrices, flexible catalysis enables state extractions that are unattainable with standard catalysis alone.</description>

      <title>Probability-Phase Mutual Information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on the geometric formulation of quantum mechanics, we develop a coherence theory for ensembles that exploits the probability-phase structure of the quantum state space. Standard coherence measures quantify superposition within density matrices but cannot distinguish ensembles that produce the same mixed state through different distributions of pure states. First, we introduce the probability-phase mutual information $I(P;\Phi)$, which measures statistical correlations between measurement-accessible probabilities and measurement-inaccessible phases across an ensemble. Then, we prove this satisfies the axioms of a coherence monotone, establishing it as a bona-fide measure of ensemble-level coherence. Eventually, through the definition of the \emph{coherence surplus} $\delta_{\mathcal{C}} \geq 0$, we show how ensemble coherence relates to, but exceeds, density-matrix coherence, thus quantifying structure lost in statistical averaging.</description>

      <title>From Bell Products to GHZ: Quantum Memories via Emergent Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advent of exquisite quantum emulators, storing highly entangled many-body states becomes essential. While entanglement typically builds over time when evolving a quantum system initialized in a product state, freezing that information at any given instant requires quenching to a Hamiltonian with the time-evolved state as an eigenstate, a concept we realize via an Emergent Hamiltonian framework. While the Emergent Hamiltonian is generically non-local and may lack a closed form, we show examples where it is exact and local, thereby enabling, in principle, indefinite state storage limited only by experimental imperfections. Unlike other phenomena, such as many-body localization, our method preserves both local and global properties of the quantum state. In some of our examples, we demonstrate that this protocol can be used to store maximally entangled multi-qubit states, such as tensor products of Bell states, or fragile, globally distributed entangled states, in the form of GHZ states, which are often challenging to initialize in actual devices.</description>

      <title>A Contextual Seven-Valued Logic (\emph{Saptabhang\=inaya}) for Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum measurement problem is often presented as a conflict between unitary evolution and non-unitary collapse. Drawing on Wittgenstein's later philosophy of language and Bohr's principle of complementarity, we argue that this conflict is a grammatical illusion arising from cross-context conflations. To address this, we introduce a contextual seven-valued logic modeled on the Jaina doctrine of \emph{saptabhang\=inaya} (sevenfold predication). In one formulation, each proposition is assigned a triplet $(t,f,u)$ indicating its status as true, false, or unsayable within a given context, with paraconsistent rules blocking triviality. In another, contexts are explicitly formalized through quantified conditionals, aligning directly with Bohr's view that meaning derives from experimental arrangements. By comparing these two complementary approaches, we show how canonical paradoxes--including Schr\"odinger's cat and Wigner's friend--dissolve once context is made explicit. The result is a flexible logical framework that reconciles Wittgensteinian conceptual therapy, Bohr's complementarity, and the Jaina pluralistic tradition, offering a coherent semantics for quantum discourse.</description>

      <title>Credit Default Prediction with Projected Quantum Feature Models and Ensembles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of future loan defaults is a critical capability for financial institutions that provide lines of credit. For institutions that issue and manage extensive loan volumes, even a slight improvement in default prediction precision can significantly enhance financial stability and regulatory adherence, resulting in better customer experience and satisfaction. Datasets associated with credit default prediction often exhibit temporal correlations and high dimensionality. These attributes can lead to accuracy degradation and performance issues when scaling classical predictive algorithms tailored for these datasets. Given these limitations, quantum algorithms, leveraging their innate ability to handle high-dimensionality problems, emerge as a promising new avenue alongside classical approaches. To assess the viability and effectiveness of quantum methodologies, we investigate a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm, utilizing a publicly available "Default Prediction Dataset" released as part of a third-party data science competition. Specifically, we employ hybrid quantum-classical machine learning models based on projected quantum feature maps and their ensemble integration with classical models to examine the problem of credit card default prediction. Our results indicate that the ensemble models based on the projected quantum features were capable of slightly improving the purely classical results expressed via a "Composite Default Risk" (CDR) metric. Furthermore, we discuss the practical applicability of the studied quantum-classical machine learning techniques and address open questions concerning their implementation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relative power of quantum algorithms, using an adaptive access to quantum devices, versus classical post-processing methods that rely only on an initial quantum data set, remains the subject of active debate. Here, we present evidence for an exponential separation between adaptive and non-adaptive strategies in a quantum circuit recompilation task. Our construction features compilation problems with loss landscapes for discrete optimization that are unimodal yet non-separable, a structure known in classical optimization to confer exponential advantages to adaptive search. Numerical experiments show that optimization can efficiently uncover hidden circuit structure operating in the regime of volume-law entanglement and high-magic, while non-adaptive approaches are seemingly limited to exhaustive search requiring exponential resources. These results indicate that adaptive access to quantum hardware provides a fundamental advantage.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalise the Gaussian formalism of Continuous Variable (CV) systems to describe their interactions with qubits/qudits that result in quantum superpositions of Gaussian processes. To this end, we derive a new set of equations in closed form, which allows us to treat hybrid systems' unitary and open dynamics exactly (without truncation), as well as measurements (ideal and noisy). The $N$-qubits $n$-modes entangled states arising during such processes are named Gaussian-Branched Cat States (GCSs). They are fully characterised by their superposed phase-space quantities: sets of generalised complex first moments and covariance matrices, along with the qubit reduced density matrix (QRDM). We showcase our general formalism with two paradigmatic examples: i) measurement-based entanglement of two qubits via a squeezed, leaking, and measured resonator; ii) the generation of the Wigner negativity of a levitated nanoparticle undergoing Stern-Gerlach interferometry in a diffusive environment.</description>

      <title>Combining Error Detection and Mitigation: A Hybrid Protocol for Near-Term Quantum Simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Practical implementation of quantum error correction is currently limited by near-term quantum hardware. In contrast, quantum error mitigation has demonstrated strong promise for improving the performance of noisy quantum circuits without the requirement of full fault tolerance. In this work, we develop a hybrid error suppression protocol that integrates Pauli twirling, probabilistic error cancellation, and the $[[n, n-2, 2]]$ quantum error detecting code. In addition, to reduce overhead from error mitigation components of our method, we modify Pauli twirling by lowering the number of Pauli operators in the twirling set, and apply probabilistic error cancellation at the end of the encoded circuit to remove undetectable errors. Finally, we demonstrate our protocol on a non-Clifford variational quantum eigensolver circuit that estimates the ground state energy of $\rm H_2$ using both \texttt{qiskit} AerSimulator and the IBM quantum processor \texttt{ibm\_brussels}.</description>

      <title>Defect mediated quantum melting of charge ordered insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2d) electronic systems on a lattice at fractional filling $\nu = p/q$ exhibit a competition between charge ordered insulators, called Wigner-Mott insulators (WMIs), at large Coulomb repulsion and Fermi-liquid metals at large electronic kinetic energy. When those two energy scales are roughly equal, insulating states that restore the lattice translation symmetry, which we call quantum charge liquids (QCLs), may emerge. When gapped, these QCLs must exhibit topological order. In this work, we show that the allowed topological ordered phases that are proximate to the WMI strongly depend on the charge ordering in the WMI. In particular, we show that when $q$ is even, no direct transition exists between a WMI with the smallest allowed unit cell size from filling constraints, i.e., the "minimal" WMI, and the topological order with the smallest ground state degeneracy on a torus allowed by filling constraints, i.e., the "minimal" TO. Furthermore, we describe the quantum melting transition of the WMIs to the proximate QCLs in terms of the proliferation of the topological defects of the WMIs. The field theory of this transition in terms of the topological defects reveals their role as precursors to the anyon excitations in the QCLs.</description>

      <title>Continuum Fractons: Quantization and the Many Body Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate a continuum quantum mechanics for non-relativistic, dipole-conserving fractons. Imposing symmetries and locality results in novel phenomena absent in ordinary quantum mechanical systems. A single fracton has a vanishing Hamiltonian, and thus its spectrum is entirely composed of zero modes. For the two-body problem, the Hamiltonian is perfectly described by Sturm--Liouville (SL) theory. The effective two-body Hamiltonian is an SL operator on $(-1,1)$ whose spectral type is set by the edge behavior of the pair inertia function $K(x)\sim \lvert x -x_\mathrm{edge} \rvert^{\theta}$. We identify a sharp transition at $\theta=2$: for $\theta&lt;2$ the spectrum is discrete and wavepackets reflect from the edges, whereas for $\theta&gt;2$ the spectrum is continuous and wavepackets slow down and, dominantly, squeeze into asymptotically narrow regions at the edges. For three particles, the differential operator corresponding to the Hamiltonian is piecewise defined, requiring several "matching conditions" which cannot be analyzed as easily. We proceed with a lattice regularization that preserves dipole conservation, and implicitly selects a particular continuum Hamiltonian that we analyze numerically. We find a spectral transition in the three-body spectrum, and find evidence for quantum analogs of fracton attractors in both eigenstates and in the time evolution of wavepackets. We provide intuition for these results which suggests that the lack of ergodicity of classical continuum fractons will survive their quantization for large systems.</description>

      <title>Neutrino backgrounds in matter-wave interferometry: implications for dark matter searches and beyond-Standard Model physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical analysis of neutrino-induced decoherence in macroscopic matter-wave interferometry experiments designed to search for dark matter and beyond-Standard Model physics. Our calculation includes contributions from the cosmic neutrino background (C$\nu$B), solar neutrinos, and reactor antineutrinos, accounting for coherent scattering processes across nuclear, atomic, and macroscopic length scales. Within the Standard Model, we find negligible decoherence rates for planned experiments such as MAQRO ($s/\sigma_s \sim 10^{-27}$) and terrestrial interferometers like Pino ($s/\sigma_s \sim 10^{-22}$). However, these experiments achieve competitive sensitivity to beyond-Standard Model physics through light vector mediator interactions, with C$\nu$B constraining coupling products to $g_\nu g_n \lesssim 10^{-17}$ for $Z'$ masses below 1 eV. Our results provide a theoretical framework for interpreting matter-wave interferometry measurements in terms of neutrino interaction physics and for deriving constraints on BSM models from experimental data.</description>

      <title>Generalized Time-Coarse Graining via an Operator Cumulant Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a general framework for deriving effective dynamics from arbitrary time-dependent generators, based on a systematic operator cumulant expansion. Unlike traditional approaches, which typically assume periodic or adiabatic driving, our method applies to systems with general time dependencies and is compatible with any dynamics generated by a linear operator -- Hamiltonian or not, quantum or classical, open or closed. This enables modeling of systems exhibiting strong modulation, dissipation, or non-adiabatic effects. Our approach unifies Hamiltonian techniques such as Lie-transform Perturbation Theory (LPT) with averaging-based methods like Time-Coarse Graining (TCG), revealing their structural equivalence through the lens of generalized cumulants. It also clarifies how non-Hamiltonian terms naturally emerge from averaging procedures, even in closed systems. We illustrate the power and flexibility of the method by analyzing a damped, parametrically driven Kapitza pendulum, a system beyond the reach of standard tools, demonstrating how accurate effective equations can be derived across a wide range of regimes.</description>

      <title>Study of spin states in vacuum pair production via the Dirac-Heisenberg-Wigner formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A general spin-resolved momentum distribution of electron-positron pairs produced in strong external fields is derived by combining the covariant spin projection operator and the Dirac-Heisenberg-Wigner (DHW) formalism. The result shows that the spin-resolved and helicity-resolved momentum distributions given in previous literature are actually two special cases of it. For any spin-direction unit vector, numerical investigations demonstrate that when the $z$-component of the unit vector vanishes, the number density of produced spin-up and spin-down particles is equal, while their momentum distributions have some asymmetry. For a nonzero $z$-component of the unit vector, there is a difference of $1-3$ orders of magnitude in the number density of spin-up and spin-down particles induced by angular momentum transfer in multiphoton absorption. Moreover, as the electric field strength increases and/or the field frequency decreases, the asymmetry between the spin-up and spin-down particle number density decreases rapidly. These results offer an approach to study general spin states in vacuum pair production, and enhance our understanding of angular momentum transfer from fields to matter in extreme environments.</description>

      <title>Enhancing pair production with optimized chirped laser fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The optimal chirped field for enhancing electron-positron (EP) pair production is explored using a quantum kinetic approach. First, the momentum spectrum and number density of EP pairs produced by Gaussian chirped fields are investigated. The results show that the momentum spectrum exhibits distinct interference patterns, while the number density grows monotonically with chirp parameters but oscillates with the carrier angular frequency. Moreover, the number density increases by four orders of magnitude compared to chirp-free fields. The results are further compared with those from four other chirped fields: frequency-modulated, linear, quadratic, and sinusoidal chirp. The analysis reveals that the maximum number density for sinusoidally chirped fields is the highest, followed by Gaussian, frequency-modulated, quadratically, and linearly chirped fields. This ranking also applies to the maximum enhancement factors for these chirped fields. Notably, the number density for sinusoidally chirped fields improves nine orders of magnitude compared to chirp-free fields. These results not only deepen our understanding of pair production in chirped fields but also provide significant optimization strategies for future vacuum pair production experiments.</description>

      <title>Sample-based Quantum Diagonalization Methods for Modeling the Photochemistry of Diazirine and Diazo Compounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diazirines and diazo compounds are widely employed as photoreactive precursors for generating carbenes, key intermediates in chemical biology and materials science. However, computationally modeling their reaction pathways remains challenging due to a need for large active spaces and the requirement to accurately capture excited-state surfaces along with transition states and conical intersections. In this work, we utilize a hybrid quantum-classical workflow for investigating carbene formation in representative diazirine-diazomethane systems. Our approach leverages Sample-based Quantum Diagonalization (SQD) and its extended variant (Ext-SQD) for ground and excited-state analysis, combined with classical tools for geometry optimization, active-space selection, and diagnostic evaluation. Quantum computations were carried out on superconducting quantum processors, and results for both aliphatic and aryl-substituted diazirine-diazomethane pairs were benchmarked against established classical methods, including DFT, CCSD, CASCI, and SCI. SQD achieves accuracy surpassing the chemical accuracy threshold for nearly all stationary points on the potential energy surface of parent diazirine relative to the CASCI(12,10) reference, and remains close to chemical accuracy for phenyl-substituted diazirine in a (30,30) active space, with an average deviation of 1.1 kcal/mol relative to the SCI benchmark. SQD closely follows CASCI and SCI trends, showing consistent agreement. The findings demonstrate the promise of quantum computing frameworks in modeling photochemical transformations of electronically complex and pharmacologically relevant molecules.</description>

      <title>Temperature Dependence of the Response Functions of Graphene: Impact on Casimir and Casimi-Polder Forces in and out of Thermal Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review and obtain some new results on the temperature dependence of spatially nonlocal response functions of graphene and their applications to calculation of both the equilibrium and nonequilibrium Casimir and Casimir-Polder forces. After a brief summary of the properties of the polarization tensor of graphene obtained within Dirac model in the framework of quantum field theory, we derive the expressions for the longitudinal and transverse dielectric functions. The behavior of these functions at different temperatures is investigated in the regions below and above the threshold. Special attention is paid to the double pole at zero frequency which is present in the transverse response function of graphene. An application of the response functions of graphene to calculation of the equilibrium Casimir force between two graphene sheets and Casimir-Polder forces between an atom (nanoparticle) and a graphene sheet is considered with due attention to the role of a nonzero energy gap, chemical potential and a material substrate underlying the graphene sheet. The same subject is discussed for out-of-thermal-equilibrium Casimir and Casimir-Polder forces. The role of the obtained and presented results for fundamental science and nanotechnology is outlined.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel semiconductor-superconductor hybrid material based on a molecular beam epitaxially grown InAsSb surface quantum well with an in-situ deposited Nb top layer. Relative to conventional Al-InAs based systems, the InAsSb surface quantum well offers a lower effective mass and stronger spin-orbit interaction, while the Nb layer has a higher critical temperature and a larger critical magnetic field. The in-situ deposition of the Nb results in a high-quality interface that enables strong coupling to the InAsSb quantum well. Transport measurements on Josephson junctions reveal an induced superconducting gap of 1.3 meV. Furthermore, a planar asymmetric SQUID is realized, exhibiting gate-tunable superimposed oscillations originating from both the individual Josephson junction and the full SQUID loop. The large induced superconducting gap combined with strong spin-orbit interaction position this material as an attractive platform for experiments exploring gate-tunable superconductivity and topological superconducting devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend and strengthen no-go results on pointwise-defined quantum fields to cover general spinors. We show that the weak continuity of quantum fields rules out equal-time canonical conjugate (anti)commutation relations in globally hyperbolic spacetimes; for quantum fields on Minkowski spacetime, weakly continuous translation covariance enforces the needed continuity and yields the same no-go. We also extend Wightman's no-go theorem to show that the weak continuity of quantum fields rules out fermionic microcausality in $C^2$ Lorentzian spacetimes. We finish by generalising Wizimirski's no-go theorem to show that the existence of a Poincar\'e-invariant vacuum precludes pointwise spinorial covariance on a Minkowski background -- ruling out, in particular, pointwise covariance for Weyl and Dirac fermions, for photons and gravitons -- which further highlights the difficulty of quantising gravity pointwisely.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the time evolution of weakly interacting Bose gases on a three-dimensional torus of arbitrary volume. The coupling constant is supposed to be inversely proportional to the density, which is considered to be large and independent of the number of particles. We take into account a class of initial states exhibiting quasi-complete Bose-Einstein condensation. For each fixed time in a finite interval, we prove the convergence of the one-particle reduced density matrix to the projection onto the normalized order parameter describing the condensate - evolving according to the Hartree equation - in the iterated limit where the volume (and therefore the particle number), and subsequently the density go to infinity. The rate of convergence depends only on the density and on the decay of both the expected number of particles and the energy of the initial quasi-vacuum state.</description>

      <title>QUASAR: Quantum Assembly Code Generation Using Tool-Augmented LLMs via Agentic RL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing and optimizing task-specific quantum circuits are crucial to leverage the advantage of quantum computing. Recent large language model (LLM)-based quantum circuit generation has emerged as a promising automatic solution. However, the fundamental challenges remain unaddressed: (i) parameterized quantum gates require precise numerical values for optimal performance, which also depend on multiple aspects, including the number of quantum gates, their parameters, and the layout/depth of the circuits. (ii) LLMs often generate low-quality or incorrect quantum circuits due to the lack of quantum domain-specific knowledge. We propose QUASAR, an agentic reinforcement learning (RL) framework for quantum circuits generation and optimization based on tool-augmented LLMs. To align the LLM with quantum-specific knowledge and improve the generated quantum circuits, QUASAR designs (i) a quantum circuit verification approach with external quantum simulators and (ii) a sophisticated hierarchical reward mechanism in RL training. Extensive evaluation shows improvements in both syntax and semantic performance of the generated quantum circuits. When augmenting a 4B LLM, QUASAR has achieved the validity of 99.31% in Pass@1 and 100% in Pass@10, outperforming industrial LLMs of GPT-4o, GPT-5 and DeepSeek-V3 and several supervised-fine-tuning (SFT)-only and RL-only baselines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single ion implantation using focused ion beam systems enables high spatial resolution and maskless doping for rapid and scalable engineering of materials for quantum technologies, particularly qubits and colour centres in solid-state hosts. In such applications, the confidence with which a single ion can be deterministically implanted is crucial, and so the efficiency of the detection mechanism is a vital parameter. Here, we present a study of the single-ion detection efficiency for a variety of ion species (Si, P, Mn, Co, Ge, Sb, Au and Bi) into various hosts (Si, SiO2, Al2O3, GaAs, diamond and SiC). The effect of varying ion mass, charge and kinetic energy are studied, in addition to the cluster implantation of Sb, Au and Bi. We demonstrate that it is possible to achieve detection efficiencies &gt;90% for a wide range of ion species and substrate combination through selection of the implantation parameters. Furthermore, detection efficiencies of 100% are found for the doping of Sb clusters which is of direct relevance for the future fabrication of quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Triacontagonal proofs of the Bell-Kochen-Specker theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coxeter pointed out that a number of polytopes can be projected orthogonally into two dimensions in such a way that their vertices lie on a number of concentric regular triacontagons (or 30-gons). Among them are the 600-cell and 120-cell in four dimensions and Gosset's polytope in eight dimensions. We show how these projections can be modified into Kochen-Secker diagrams from which parity proofs of the Bell-Kochen-Specker theorem are easily extracted. Our construction trivially yields parity proofs of fifteen bases for all theree polytopes and also allows many other proofs of the same type to be constructed for two of them. The defining feature of these proofs is that they have a fifteen-fold symmetry about the center of the Kochen-Specker diagram and thus involve both rays and bases that are multiples of fifteen. Any proof of this type can be written as a word made up of an odd number of distinct letters, each representing an orbit of fifteen bases. Knowing a word makes it possible to write down all the features of the associated proof without first having to recover its bases. A comparison is made with earlier approaches that have been used to obtain parity proofs in these polytopes, and two questions related to possible applications of these polytopes are raised.</description>

Abstract: This study presents a unitary quantum cellular automaton (QCA) that, in the continuum limit, converges to the (1+1)-dimensional Generalized Dirac Equation (GDE). We outline the construction of the unitary, discrete-time evolution and derive the model's exact dispersion relation from its eigenvalue spectrum, showing it possesses the correct relativistic limit. We then explore its dynamics through numerical simulations. While the total probability density is shown to be insensitive to the chiral angle parameter $(\rho)$ of the GDE, we demonstrate that this parameter has a profound and directly observable effect on the particle's local spin polarization. By measuring this quantity, we reveal the hidden internal dynamics of the spinor, providing a clear, visual confirmation of the physical consequences of the chiral mass term.</description>

      <title>Bound on the distance between controlled quantum state and target state under decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.06466v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To implement quantum information technologies, carefully designed control for preparing a desired state plays a key role. However, in realistic situation, the actual performance of those methodologies is severely limited by decoherence. Therefore, it is important to evaluate how close we can steer the controlled state to a desired target state under decoherence. In this paper, we provide an upper bound of the distance between the two controlled quantum systems in the presence and absence of decoherence. The bound quantifies the degree of achievement of the control for a given target state under decoherence, and can be straightforwardly calculated without solving any equation. Moreover, the upper bound is applied to derive a theoretical limit of the probability for obtaining the target state under decoherence.</description>

      <title>Parallel-in-time quantum simulation via Page and Wootters quantum time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12944v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the past few decades, researchers have created a veritable zoo of quantum algorithms by drawing inspiration from classical computing, information theory, and even from physical phenomena. Here we present quantum algorithms for parallel-in-time simulations that are inspired by the Page and Wootters formalism. In this framework, and thus in our algorithms, the classical time-variable of quantum mechanics is promoted to the quantum realm by introducing a Hilbert space of ``clock'' qubits which are then entangled with the ``system'' qubits. We show that our algorithms can compute temporal properties over $N$ different times of many-body systems by only using $\log(N)$ clock qubits. As such, we achieve an exponential trade-off between time and spatial complexities. In addition, we rigorously prove that the entanglement created between the system qubits and the clock qubits has operational meaning, as it encodes valuable information about the system's dynamics. We also provide a circuit depth estimation of all the protocols, showing a running time advantage in computation times over traditional sequential-in-time algorithms. In particular, for the case when the dynamics are determined by the Aubry--Andre model, we present a hybrid method for which our algorithms have a depth that only scales as $\mathcal{O}(\log(N)n)$. As a by-product, we can relate the previous schemes to the problem of equilibration of an isolated quantum system, thus indicating that our framework enables a new dimension for studying dynamical properties of many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Mutual information maximizing quantum generative adversarial networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.01363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the most promising applications in the era of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computing is quantum generative adversarial networks (QGANs), which offer significant quantum advantages over classical machine learning in various domains. However, QGANs suffer from mode collapse and lack explicit control over the features of generated outputs. To overcome these limitations, we propose InfoQGAN, a novel quantum-classical hybrid generative adversarial network that integrates the principles of InfoGAN with a QGAN architecture. Our approach employs a variational quantum circuit for data generation, a classical discriminator, and a Mutual Information Neural Estimator (MINE) to explicitly optimize the mutual information between latent codes and generated samples. Numerical simulations on synthetic 2D distributions and Iris dataset augmentation demonstrate that InfoQGAN effectively mitigates mode collapse while achieving robust feature disentanglement in the quantum generator. By leveraging these advantages, InfoQGAN not only enhances training stability but also improves data augmentation performance through controlled feature generation. These results highlight the potential of InfoQGAN as a foundational approach for advancing quantum generative modeling in the NISQ era.</description>

      <title>Quantum Lego and XP Stabilizer Codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19538v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply the recent graphical framework of "Quantum Lego" to XP stabilizer codes where the stabilizer group is generally non-Abelian. We show that the idea of operator matching continues to hold for such codes and is sufficient for generating all their XP symmetries provided the resulting code is XP. We provide an efficient classical algorithm for tracking these symmetries under tensor contraction or conjoining. This constitutes a partial extension of the algorithm implied by the Gottesman-Knill theorem beyond Pauli stabilizer states and Clifford operations. Because conjoining transformations generate quantum operations that are universal, the XP symmetries obtained from these algorithms do not uniquely identify the resulting tensors in general. Using this extended framework, we provide examples of novel XP stabilizer codes with a higher distance than existing non-trivial XP regular codes and a $[[8,1,2]]$ Pauli stabilizer code with a fault-tolerant $T$ gate. For XP regular codes, we also construct a tensor-network-based maximum likelihood decoder for any independently and identically distributed single qubit error channel using weight enumerators.</description>

      <title>Security of device-independent quantum key distribution via monogamy relations from multipartite information causality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Beyond the foundational significance, the problem of bounding nonlocal correlations by reasonable physical principles has meaningful practical consequences, particularly for device-independent (DI) cryptographic security. In this work, we advance in this direction, demonstrating that the IC is enough to ensure DI security on quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols. Security is proven for a range of theoretically quantum-attainable parameters against individual attacks by a potentially post-quantum eavesdropper. This result follows as a consequence of a strong form of monogamy of Bell's inequality violations, which we have proven to be implied by the recently proposed multipartite formulation for IC. Additionally, we demonstrated that the original bipartite formulation of IC fails to imply monogamy relations and hence, ensure security of DIQKD, thus stressing the necessity of the multipartite framework.</description>

      <title>Entropy Computing, A Paradigm for Optimization in Open Photonic Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04512v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finding better solutions to combinatorial optimization problems could have a large positive impact on many real-world application areas, such as logistics. For this reason, significant efforts have been made to design novel optimisation paradigms. Here we show an early instance of such paradigm in an optical setting, the entropy computing paradigm. Specifically, we experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of entropy computing by building a hybrid photonic-electronic computer that uses optical measurement and feedback to solve non-convex optimization problems. The system functions by using temporal photonic modes to create qudits in order to encode probability amplitudes in the time-frequency degree of freedom of a photon. This scheme, when coupled with with electronic interconnects, allows us to encode an arbitrary Hamiltonian into the system and solve non-convex continuous variables and combinatorial optimization problems. We show that the proposed entropy computing paradigm can act as a scalable and versatile platform for tackling a large range of NP-hard optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Quantum ergodicity and scrambling in quantum annealers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum annealers play a major role in the ongoing development of quantum information processing and in the advent of quantum technologies. Their functioning is underpinned by the many-body adiabatic evolution connecting the ground state of a simple system to that of an interacting classical Hamiltonian which encodes the solution to an optimization problem. Here we explore more general properties of the dynamics of quantum annealers, going beyond the low-energy regime. We show that the unitary evolution operator describing the complete dynamics is typically highly quantum chaotic. As a result, the annealing dynamics naturally leads to volume-law entangled random-like states when the initial configuration is rotated away from the low-energy subspace. Furthermore, we observe that the Heisenberg dynamics of a quantum annealer leads to extensive operator spreading, a hallmark of quantum information scrambling. In contrast, we find that when the annealing schedule is returned to the initial configuration (i.e. via a cyclic ramp), a subtle interplay between chaos and adiabaticity emerges, and the dynamics shows strong deviations from full ergodicity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Random fluctuations caused by environmental noise can lead to decoherence in quantum systems. Exploring and controlling such dissipative processes is both fundamentally intriguing and essential for harnessing quantum systems to gain practical advantages and deeper insights. In this work, we first demonstrate the diffusive dynamics assisted by controlled dephasing noise in superconducting quantum circuits, contrasting with coherent evolution. We show that dephasing can give distinct dynamical behavior in a superconducting qubit array with quasiperiodic order. Furthermore, by preparing different excitation distributions in the qubit array, we observe that a more localized initial state relaxes to a uniformly distributed mixed state faster with dephasing noise, illustrating another counterintuitive phenomenon called Mpemba-effect-like quantum dynamics, i.e., a far-from-equilibrium state can relax toward the equilibrium faster. These results deepen our understanding of diffusive dynamics at the microscopic level, and demonstrate controlled dissipative processes as a valuable tool for investigating Markovian open quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02673v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extracting work from a physical system is one of the cornerstones of quantum thermodynamics. The extractable work, as quantified by ergotropy, necessitates a complete description of the quantum system. This is significantly more challenging when the state of the underlying system is unknown, as quantum tomography is extremely inefficient. In this article, we analyze the number of samples of the unknown state required to extract work. With only a single copy of an unknown state, we prove that ergotropy approaches zero in the asymptotic limit, rendering work extraction nearly impossible. In contrast, when multiple copies are available, we quantify the sample complexity required to estimate extractable work, establishing a scaling relationship that balances the desired accuracy with success probability. Our work develops a sample-efficient protocol to assess the utility of unknown states as quantum batteries and opens avenues for estimating thermodynamic quantities using near-term quantum computers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: QuTiP, the Quantum Toolbox in Python, has been at the forefront of open-source quantum software for the past 13 years. It is used as a research, teaching, and industrial tool, and has been downloaded millions of times by users around the world. Here we introduce the latest developments in QuTiP v5, which are set to have a large impact on the future of QuTiP and enable it to be a modern, continuously developed and popular tool for another decade and more. We summarize the code design and fundamental data layer changes as well as efficiency improvements, new solvers, applications to quantum circuits with QuTiP-QIP, and new quantum control tools with QuTiP-QOC. Additional flexibility in the data layer underlying all ``quantum objects'' in QuTiP allows us to harness the power of state-of-the-art data formats and packages like JAX, CuPy, and more. We explain these new features with a series of both well-known and new examples. The code for these examples is available in a static form on GitHub and as continuously updated and documented notebooks in the qutip-tutorials package.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum relative entropy, a quantum generalization of the renowned Kullback-Leibler divergence, serves as a fundamental measure of the distinguishability between quantum states and plays a pivotal role in quantum information science. Despite its importance, efficiently estimating quantum relative entropy between two quantum states on quantum computers remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose the first quantum algorithm for directly estimating quantum relative entropy and Petz Renyi divergence from two unknown quantum states on quantum computers, addressing open problems highlighted in [Phys. Rev. A 109, 032431 (2024)] and [IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 70, 5653-5680 (2024)]. Notably, the circuit size of our algorithm is at most $2n+1$ with $n$ being the number of qubits in the quantum states and it is directly applicable to distributed scenarios, where quantum states to be compared are hosted on cross-platform quantum computers. We prove that our loss function is operator-convex, ensuring that any local minimum is also a global minimum. We validate the effectiveness of our method through numerical experiments and observe the absence of the barren plateau phenomenon. As an application, we employ our algorithm to investigate the superadditivity of quantum channel capacity. Numerical simulations reveal new examples of qubit channels exhibiting strict superadditivity of coherent information, highlighting the potential of quantum machine learning to address quantum-native problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17394v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the study of distributed quantum information processing, it is crucial to minimize the entanglement consumption by optimizing local operations. We develop a framework based on algebraic geometry to systematically simplify the optimization over separable (SEP) channels, which serve as widely used models for local operations. We apply this framework to computing one-shot entanglement cost for implementing non-local operations under SEP channels, in both probabilistic and zero-error settings. First, we present a unified generalization of previous analytical results on the entanglement cost. Via the generalization, we resolve an open problem posed by Yu et al. regarding the entanglement cost of local state discrimination. Second, we strengthen the Doherty--Parrilo--Spedalieri hierarchy and determine the trade-off between the entanglement cost and the success probability of implementing various operations -- such as entanglement distillation, non-local unitary channels, measurements, state verification, and multipartite entanglement distribution.</description>

Abstract: The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model is of paramount importance for the understanding of both strange metals and a microscopic theory of two-dimensional gravity. We study the interplay between Stabilizer R\'enyi Entropy (SRE) and entanglement entropy in both the ground state and highly excited states of the SYK4+SYK2 model interpolating the highly chaotic four-body interactions model with the integrable two-body interactions one. The interplay between these quantities is assessed also through universal statistics of the entanglement spectrum and its anti-flatness. We find that SYK4 is indeed characterized by a complex pattern of both entanglement and non-stabilizer resources while SYK2 is non-universal and not complex. We discuss the fragility and robustness of these features depending on the interpolation parameter.</description>

      <title>Critically Slow Hilbert-Space Ergodicity in Quantum Morphic Drives</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The maximum entropy principle is foundational for statistical analyses of complex dynamics. This principle has been challenged by the findings of a previous work [arXiv:1701.07596], where it was argued that a quantum system driven in time by a certain aperiodic sequence without any explicit symmetries, dubbed the Thue-Morse drive, gives rise to emergent nonergodic steady states which are underpinned by effective conserved quantities. Here, we resolve this apparent tension. We rigorously prove that the Thue-Morse drive achieves a very strong notion of quantum ergodicity in the long-time limit: The time evolution of any initial state uniformly visits every corner of its Hilbert space. On the other hand, we find the dynamics also approximates a Floquet drive for arbitrarily long albeit finite periods of time with no characteristic timescale, resulting in a scale-free ergodic dynamics we call critically slow complete Hilbert-space ergodicity. Furthermore, numerical studies reveal that critically slow complete Hilbert-space ergodicity is not specific to the Thue-Morse drive and is, in fact, exhibited by many other aperiodic drives derived from morphic sequences, i.e., words derived from repeatedly applying substitution rules on basic characters. Our work presents a new class of dynamics in time-dependent quantum systems where full ergodicity is eventually attained, but only after astronomically long times.</description>

      <title>The Complexity of Local Stoquastic Hamiltonians on 2D Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14244v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show the 2-Local Stoquastic Hamiltonian problem on a 2D square lattice is StoqMA-complete. We achieve this by extending the spatially sparse circuit construction of Oliveira and Terhal, as well as the perturbative gadgets of Bravyi, DiVincenzo, Oliveira, and Terhal. Our main contributions demonstrate StoqMA circuits can be made spatially sparse and that geometrical, stoquastic-preserving, perturbative gadgets can be constructed.</description>

      <title>Fundamental solutions of heat equation on unitary groups establish an improved relation between $\epsilon$-nets and approximate unitary $t$-designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The concepts of $\epsilon$-nets and unitary ($\delta$-approximate) $t$-designs are important and ubiquitous across quantum computation and information. Both notions are closely related and the quantitative relations between $t$, $\delta$ and $\epsilon$ find applications in areas such as (non-constructive) inverse-free Solovay-Kitaev like theorems and random quantum circuits. In recent work, quantitative relations have revealed the close connection between the two constructions, with $\epsilon$-nets functioning as unitary $\delta$-approximate $t$-designs and vice-versa, for appropriate choice of parameters. In this work we improve these results, significantly increasing the bound on the $\delta$ required for a $\delta$-approximate $t$-design to form an $\epsilon$-net from $\delta \simeq \left(\epsilon^{3/2}/d\right)^{d^2}$ to $\delta \simeq \left(\epsilon/d^{1/2}\right)^{d^2}$. We achieve this by constructing polynomial approximations to the Dirac delta using heat kernels on the projective unitary group $\mathrm{PU}(d) \cong\mathbf{U}(d)$, whose properties we studied and which may be applicable more broadly. We also outline the possible applications of our results in quantum circuit overheads, quantum complexity and black hole physics.</description>

      <title>Independent e- and m-anyon confinement in the parallel field toric code on non-square lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03512v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kitaev's toric code has become one of the most studied models in physics and is highly relevant to the fields of both quantum error correction and condensed matter physics. Most notably, it is the simplest known model hosting an extended, deconfined topological bulk phase. To this day, it remains challenging to reliably and robustly probe topological phases, as many state-of-the-art order parameters are sensitive to specific models and even specific parameter regimes. With the emergence of powerful quantum simulators which are approaching the regimes of topological bulk phases, there is a timely need for experimentally accessible order parameters. Here we study the ground state physics of the parallel field toric code on the honeycomb, triangular and cubic lattices using continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo. By extending the concept of experimentally accessible percolation-inspired order parameters (POPs) we show that electric and magnetic anyons are independently confined on the honeycomb and triangular lattices, unlike on the square lattice. Our work manifestly demonstrates that, even in the ground state, we must make a distinction between topological order and \mbox{(de-)confinement}. Moreover, we report multi-critical points in the aforementioned confinement phase diagrams. Finally, we map out the topological phase diagrams on the honeycomb, triangular and cubic lattices and compare the performance of the POPs with other topological order parameters. Our work paves the way for studies of confinement involving dynamical matter and the associated multi-critical points in contemporary quantum simulation platforms for $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theories.</description>

Abstract: Superconducting circuits comprising Josephson junctions have spurred significant research activity due to their promise to realize scalable quantum computers. Effective Hamiltonians for these systems have traditionally been derived assuming the junction connects superconducting islands of infinite size. We derive a quantized Hamiltonian for a Josephson junction between finite-sized islands and predict measurable corrections to the qubit frequency and charge susceptibility to test the theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and study peak state transfer, a notion of high state transfer in qubit networks modeled by continuous-time quantum walks. Unlike perfect or pretty good state transfer, peak state transfer does not require fidelity arbitrarily close to 1, but crucially allows for an explicit determination of the time at which transfer occurs. We provide a spectral characterization of peak state transfer, which allows us to find many examples of peak state transfer, and we also establish tight lower bounds on fidelity and success probability. As a central example, we construct a family of weighted path graphs that admit peak state transfer over arbitrarily long distances with transfer probability approaching $\pi/4 \approx 0.78$. These graphs offer exponentially improved sensitivity over known perfect state transfer examples such as the weighted paths related to hypercubes, making them practical candidates for efficient quantum wires.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21308v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While dissipation has traditionally been viewed as an obstacle to quantum coherence, it is increasingly recognized as a powerful computational resource. Dissipative protocols can prepare complex many-body quantum states by leveraging engineered system-environment interactions. This essay focuses on a class of algorithms that utilize algorithmically constructed Lindblad generators, and highlight recent advances enabling the preparation of ground and thermal states for certain non-commuting Hamiltonians with rigorous performance guarantees. We also propose extensions of these protocols to prepare excited and resonance states, which may offer new pathways toward realizing practical quantum advantage on early fault-tolerant quantum computing platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The resource theory of coherence addresses the extent to which quantum properties are present in a given quantum system. While coherence has been extensively studied for individual quantum states, measures of coherence for ensembles of quantum states remain an area of active research. The entanglement-based approach to ensemble coherence - where a partial measurement of an entangled state generates an ensemble - relates the ensemble coherence to both the initial entanglement and the measurement's uncertainty. This paper presents two methods for generating ensemble coherence from a fixed amount of entanglement. The first method involves applying a von Neumann measurement to one part of a non-maximally entangled bipartite state, resulting in a pair of non-orthogonal states whose coherence can equal the initial entanglement. The second method considers a class of symmetric observables capable of generating ensembles used in quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols such as B92, BB84, and three-state QKD. As a result, this work contributes to understanding how much ensemble coherence can be obtained from a given amount of entanglement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03034v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconducting cavities with high quality factors, coupled to a fixed-frequency transmon, provide a state-of-the-art platform for quantum information storage and manipulation. The commonly used selective number-dependent arbitrary phase (SNAP) gate faces significant challenges in ultra-high-coherence cavities, where the weak dispersive shifts necessary for preserving high coherence typically result in prolonged gate times. Here, we propose a protocol to achieve high-fidelity SNAP gates that are orders of magnitude faster than the standard implementation, surpassing the speed limit set by the bare dispersive shift. We achieve this enhancement by dynamically amplifying the dispersive coupling via sideband interactions, followed by quantum optimal control on the Floquet-engineered system. We also present a unified perturbation theory that explains both the gate acceleration and the associated benign drive-induced decoherence, corroborated by Floquet-Markov simulations. These results pave the way for the experimental realization of high-fidelity, selective control of weakly coupled, high-coherence cavities, and expanding the scope of optimal control techniques to a broader class of Floquet quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Efficient Non-Adaptive Quantum Algorithms for Tolerant Junta Testing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17306v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of deciding whether an $n$-qubit unitary (or $n$-bit Boolean function) is $\varepsilon_1$-close to some $k$-junta or $\varepsilon_2$-far from every $k$-junta, where $k$-junta unitaries act non-trivially on at most $k$ qubits and as the identity on the rest, and $k$-junta Boolean functions depend on at most $k$ variables. For constant numbers $\varepsilon_1,\varepsilon_2$ such that $0 &lt; \varepsilon_1 &lt; \varepsilon_2 &lt; 1$, we show the following. (1) A non-adaptive $O(k\log k)$-query tolerant $(\varepsilon_1,\varepsilon_2)$-tester for $k$-junta unitaries when $2\sqrt{2}\varepsilon_1 &lt; \varepsilon_2$. (2) A non-adaptive tolerant $(\varepsilon_1,\varepsilon_2)$-tester for Boolean functions with $O(k \log k)$ quantum queries when $4\varepsilon_1 &lt; \varepsilon_2$. (3) A $2^{\widetilde{O}(k)}$-query tolerant $(\varepsilon_1,\varepsilon_2)$-tester for $k$-junta unitaries for any $\varepsilon_1,\varepsilon_2$. The first algorithm provides an exponential improvement over the best-known quantum algorithms. The second algorithm shows an exponential quantum advantage over any non-adaptive classical algorithm. The third tester gives the first tolerant junta unitary testing result for an arbitrary gap.
  Besides, we adapt the first two quantum algorithms to be implemented using only single-qubit operations, thereby enhancing experimental feasibility, with a slightly more stringent requirement for the parameter gap.</description>

      <title>Structured Quantum Baths with Memory: A QuTiP Framework for Spectral Diagnostics and Machine Learning Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a compact simulation framework for modeling open quantum systems coupled to structured, memory-retaining baths using QuTiP. Our method models the bath as a finite set of layered qubits with adjustable connections, interpreted either as a physical realization or as a conceptual representation, rather than as a continuum. This explicit modeling enables direct control over non-Markovian dynamics and allows spectral diagnostics via Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of system observables. Using a triangle-based bath motif and its extension to a six-qubit anisotropic fractal-like architecture, we demonstrate how spectral fingerprints encode bath topology and memory depth. Standard machine learning tools such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and gradient boosting can then be employed to infer bath parameters and estimate proximity to exceptional points (EPs). The results suggest that spectral analysis can serve as a unifying, quantum-platform agnostic tool across theory, simulation, and experiment, offering both a student-accessible and experimentally relevant approach to understanding coherence loss and memory flow in quantum hardware. Rather than treating noise as an adversary to be eliminated, our approach views structured baths as collaborative partners, enabling controlled memory and delocalized memory and information flow for engineered quantum dynamics. In addition to its diagnostic power, the framework offers a modular and reproducible platform for teaching open quantum systems. Ultimately, we frame this as a pedagogical tool: students can pair FFT-based spectral features with lightweight ML (e.g., PCA and gradient boosting) to extract data-rich, interpretable signatures of open-system and non-Hermitian dynamics.</description>

Abstract: We present the results of a comprehensive study of optimization algorithms for the calibration of quantum devices. As part of our ongoing efforts to automate bring-up, tune-up, and system identification procedures, we investigate a broad range of optimizers within a simulated environment designed to closely mimic the challenges of real-world experimental conditions. Our benchmark includes widely used algorithms such as Nelder-Mead and the state-of-the-art Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES). We evaluate performance in both low-dimensional settings, representing simple pulse shapes used in current optimal control protocols with a limited number of parameters, and high-dimensional regimes, which reflect the demands of complex control pulses with many parameters. Based on our findings, we recommend the CMA-ES algorithm and provide empirical evidence for its superior performance across all tested scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12341v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a simple and provably correct replacement for the contested ``domain-extension'' in Step 9 of a recent windowed-QFT lattice algorithm with complex-Gaussian windows~\citep{chen2024quantum}. As acknowledged by the author, the reported issue is due to a periodicity/support mismatch when applying domain extension to only the first coordinate in the presence of offsets. Our drop-in subroutine replaces domain extension by a pair-shift difference that cancels all unknown offsets exactly and synthesizes a uniform cyclic subgroup (a zero-offset coset) of order $P$ inside $(\mathbb{Z}_{M_2})^n$. A subsequent QFT enforces the intended modular linear relation by plain character orthogonality. The sole structural assumption is a residue-accessibility condition enabling coherent auxiliary cleanup; no amplitude periodicity is used. The unitary is reversible, uses $\mathrm{poly}(\log M_2)$ gates, and preserves upstream asymptotics.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium Dynamics of Two-level Systems directly after Cryogenic Alternating Bias</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19223v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-level systems (TLSs) are tunneling states commonly found in amorphous materials that electrically couple to qubits, resonators, and vibrational modes in materials, leading to energy loss in those systems. Recent studies suggest that applying a large alternating electric field changes the oxide structure, potentially improving the performance of qubits and resonators. In this study, we probe the effect of alternating bias at cryogenic temperatures on TLS dynamics within amorphous oxide parallel-plate capacitors operating in the strongly coupled regime. We bias the TLSs in the capacitors using an electric field. This allows us to spectroscopically image TLSs and extract their densities and dipole moments. When an in-situ alternating bias is applied, the steady-state spectra from the standard TLS model disappear. Post-alternating bias TLS spectroscopy reveals transient behavior, in which the TLS frequency fluctuates on the order of minutes. Thermal cycling above 10 K reverses these effects, restoring the TLS spectrum to its original state, indicating a reversible mechanism. Importantly, the intrinsic loss tangent of the LC oscillator remains unchanged before and after the application of the alternating bias. We propose that the disappearance of the steady-state spectrum are caused by non-equilibrium energy build up from strain in the oxide film introduced by the pulsed voltage bias sequence. Understanding this non-equilibrium energy could inform future models of time-dependent TLS dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The intrinsic equivalence between electron spin and qubit offers a natural foundation for quantum simulations of magnetic materials. However, incorporating magnetocrystalline anisotropy (MCA), a key feature of real magnets, remains a major challenge. Here, we develop a quantum simulation framework for MCA in CuSb2O6, a spin-1/2 antiferromagnet with alternating ferromagnetic chains arising from frustrated, anisotropic exchange interactions in a nearly square lattice. The $\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}$ spin network is modeled as a four-qubit square lattice, with four paired ancilla qubits introduced to encode angle-dependent MCA. This two-qubit representation per spin site resolves the limitation that squared Pauli operators yield only the identity, enabling MCA terms to be faithfully embedded into quantum circuits. Using the variational quantum eigensolver, we determine an exceptionally small easy-axis MCA constant, just 0.00022% of the nearest-neighbor exchange interaction, yet sufficient to drive a spin-flop transition with $90^{\circ}$ spin reorientation and strong angular variation in magnetic torque. Beyond this regime, the simulations uncover a half-saturated magnetic phase at ultra-high fields, stabilized by anisotropic next-nearest-neighbor interactions. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of resource-efficient quantum simulations of complex magnetic phenomena in real materials.</description>

Abstract: Nonlinear optics underpins quantum photonics by enabling the generation and control of quantum states of light. We present new applications of optical resonators as mode selectors in nonlinear processes. First, we show that cavity-enhanced spontaneous parametric down-conversion can generate spectrally uncorrelated photon pairs with improved decorrelation and wavelength flexibility. Second, we demonstrate that a cavity-assisted sum-frequency generation process realizes a quantum pulse gate with high-resolution temporal-mode selectivity and precise spectral control. Our theoretical framework provides a general methodology for analyzing cavity-enhanced nonlinear processes and highlights the versatility of optical resonators as powerful tools for engineering quantum light.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic pressure sensing with an ultrafast Meissner-levitated microrotor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetically levitated spinning rotors are key elements in important technologies such as navigation by gyroscopes, energy storage by flywheels, ultra-high vacuum generation by turbomolecular pumps, and pressure sensing for process control. However, mechanical rotors are typically macroscopic and limited to room temperature and low rotation frequencies. In particular, sensing pressure at low temperatures remains a technological challenge, while emerging quantum technologies demand a precise evaluation of pressure conditions at low temperatures to cope with quantum-spoiling decoherence. To close this gap, we demonstrate wide range pressure sensing by a spinning rotor based on a micromagnet levitated by the Meissner effect at 4.2 Kelvin. We achieve rotational speeds of up to 138 million rotations per minute, resulting in very high effective quality factors, outperforming current platforms. Beside sensing applications, we envision the use of levitated rotors for probing fundamental science including quantum mechanics and gravity, enabled by ultralow torque noise.</description>

      <title>Scheme for braiding Majorana zero modes in vortices using an STT-matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18578v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Majorana zero modes (MZMs), promising for topological quantum computation, are naturally hosted in vortices of two-dimensional topological superconductors (TSCs). However, precise control and braiding of these vortex-bound MZMs remains a significant challenge. This work proposes and numerically demonstrates a novel braiding scheme utilizing a programmable matrix of spin transfer torque (STT) devices (STT-matrix) integrated with a TSC layer. By selectively activating individual STT elements, their localized stray fields enable deterministic manipulation, including driving, braiding, and fusion, of superconducting vortices and their associated MZMs. We establish a comprehensive simulation framework combining finite element analysis for STT-induced vortex formation, time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations for vortex dynamics and time-dependent Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations for MZM evolution. Simulations confirm the STT-matrix's capability for high-fidelity vortex manipulation and demonstrate MZM braiding dynamics. We quantify the impact of vortex acceleration and finite MZM coupling on braiding fidelity, showing it can be optimized by adjusting STT spacing and vortex separation. Furthermore, we demonstrate controlled MZM fusion and measure the resultant energy splitting. This STT-matrix-based approach offers a highly versatile, scalable, and potentially practical platform for operating MZMs within TSC vortices, advancing towards fault-tolerant topological quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Knot invariants and indefinite causal order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore indefinite causal order between events in the context of quasiclassical spacetimes in superposition. We introduce several new quantifiers to measure the degree of indefiniteness of the causal order for an arbitrary finite number of events and spacetime configurations in superposition. By constructing diagrammatic and knot-theoretic representations of the causal order between events, we find that the definiteness or maximal indefiniteness of the causal order is topologically invariant. This reveals an intriguing connection between the field of quantum causality and knot theory. Furthermore, we provide an operational encoding of indefinite causal order and discuss how to incorporate a measure of quantum coherence into our classification.</description>

      <title>Susceptibility of entanglement entropy: a universal indicator of quantum criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A measure of how sensitive the entanglement entropy is in a quantum system, has been proposed and its information geometric origin is discussed. It has been demonstrated for two exactly solvable spin systems, that thermodynamic criticality is directly \textit{indicated} by finite size scaling of the global maxima and turning points of the susceptibility of entanglement entropy through numerical analysis - obtaining power laws. Analytically we have proved those power laws for $| \ \lambda_c(N)-\lambda_c^{\infty}|$ as $N\to \infty$ in the cases of finite 1D transverse field ising model (TFIM) ($\lambda=h$) and XY chain ($\lambda=\gamma$). The integer power law appearing for XY model has been verified using perturbation theory in $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{N})$ and the fractional power law appearing in the case of TFIM, is verified by an exact approach involving Chebyshev polynomials, hypergeometric functions and complete elliptic integrals. Furthermore a set of potential applications of this quantity under quantum dynamics and also for non-integrable systems, are briefly discussed. The simplicity of this setup for understanding quantum criticality is emphasized as it takes in only the reduced density matrix of appropriate rank.</description>

      <title>A Physics-Inspired Optimizer: Velocity Regularized Adam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Velocity-Regularized Adam (VRAdam), a physics-inspired optimizer for training deep neural networks that draws on ideas from quartic terms for kinetic energy with its stabilizing effects on various system dynamics. Previous algorithms, including the ubiquitous Adam, operate at the so-called adaptive edge of stability regime during training, leading to rapid oscillations and slowed convergence of loss. However, VRAdam adds a higher order penalty on the learning rate based on the velocity such that the algorithm automatically slows down whenever weight updates become large. In practice, we observe that the effective dynamic learning rate shrinks in high-velocity regimes, and damping oscillations. By combining this velocity-based regularizer for global damping with per-parameter scaling of Adam, we create a powerful hybrid optimizer. For this optimizer, we provide rigorous theoretical analysis of operation at the edge of stability from a physical and control perspective for the momentum. Furthermore, we derive convergence bounds with the rate $\mathcal{O}(\ln(N)/\sqrt{N})$ for a stochastic non convex objective under mild assumptions. We demonstrate that VRAdam exceeds the performance against standard optimizers including AdamW. We benchmark various tasks such as image classification, language modeling, and generative modeling using diverse architectures and training methodologies including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Transformers, and GFlowNets.</description>

      <title>Anomaly of conserved and nonconserved axial charges in Hamiltonian lattice gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01336v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the axial anomaly in Hamiltonian lattice gauge theory. The definition of axial charge operators is ambiguous, especially between conserved and nonconserved axial charges. While these charges appear to differ only by a higher-order term in lattice spacing, they do not coincide in the continuum limit. We demonstrate, through analytical and numerical calculations in 1+1 dimensions, that the conserved axial charge correctly reproduces the axial anomaly relation in continuous spacetime. Our finding would serve as a valuable lesson about doubler artifact in Hamiltonian time evolution of lattice gauge theory.</description>

      <title>Quantum Theory of Optical Spin Texture in Chiral Tellurium Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21610v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The absence of inversion symmetry in chiral tellurium (Te) creates exotic spin textures within its electron waves. However, understanding textured optical waves within Te remains a challenge due to the semi-classical limitations of long-wavelength approximation. To unveil these textured optical waves, we develop a spin-resolved deep-microscopic optical bandstructure for Te analogous to its electronic counterpart. We demonstrate that the degeneracies in this optical bandstructure is lifted by the twisted lattice of Te, which induces optical gyrotropy. Our theory shows excellent agreement with experimental optical gyrotropy measurements. At the lattice level, we reveal that the chirality of Te manifests as deep-microscopic optical spin texture within the optical wave. Our framework uncovers the finite-momentum origin of optical activity and provides a microscopic basis for light-matter interactions in chiral crystalline materials.</description>

      <title>Imprints of screened dark energy on nonlocal quantum correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate how screening mechanisms, reconciling light scalar fields driving cosmic acceleration with local fifth force constraints, can be probed via their impact on non-local quantum correlations between entangled spin pairs, whose evolution on a curved background is affected by General Relativity (GR) and screened modified gravity effects. We consider a gedankenexperiment featuring a pair of massive, spin-1/2 particles orbiting the Earth, evaluating their non-local correlations through spin observables associated to the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality. Using a general formalism developed earlier for curved space-time spin evolution, we compute the effects of screening on the CHSH inequality, finding its degree of violation to be suppressed relative to the flat space-time case. Applying this formalism to the chameleon, symmetron, and dilaton mechanisms, we identify currently unconstrained regions of parameter space where the screening contribution is comparable to that of GR. While detecting these effects will be challenging, our work provides a proof-of-principle for testing screened dark energy through quantum non-locality.</description>

      <title>Floquet-engineered moire quasicrystal patterns of ultracold Bose gases in twisted bilayer optical lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21093v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the formation of moir\'e quasicrystal patterns in Bose gases confined in twisted bilayer optical lattices via Floquet-engineered intralayer atomic interactions. Dynamical evolutions of the inverse participation ratio and the density wave amplitude reveal the stage for the emergence of moir\'e quasicrystal patterns, whose symmetry can be easily manipulated by the modulation frequencies and amplitudes. Reducing the frequencies and increasing the amplitudes can both facilitate lattice symmetry breaking and the subsequent emergence of rotational symmetry. Notably, a twelve-fold quasicrystal pattern emerges under specific parameters, closely resembling the moir\'e quasicrystal in twisted bilayer graphene. The momentum-space distributions also exhibit high rotational symmetry, which is consistent with the real-space patterns at specific evolution times. Our findings establish a new quantum platform for exploring quasicrystals and their symmetry properties in ultracold bosonic systems.</description>

      <title>Probing the Critical Point (CritPt) of AI Reasoning: a Frontier Physics Research Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) with reasoning capabilities are progressing rapidly on high-school math competitions and coding, can they reason effectively through complex, open-ended challenges found in frontier physics research? And crucially, what kinds of reasoning tasks do physicists want LLMs to assist with? To address these questions, we present the CritPt (Complex Research using Integrated Thinking - Physics Test, pronounced "critical point"), the first benchmark designed to test LLMs on unpublished, research-level reasoning tasks that broadly covers modern physics research areas, including condensed matter, quantum physics, atomic, molecular &amp; optical physics, astrophysics, high energy physics, mathematical physics, statistical physics, nuclear physics, nonlinear dynamics, fluid dynamics and biophysics. CritPt consists of 71 composite research challenges designed to simulate full-scale research projects at the entry level, which are also decomposed to 190 simpler checkpoint tasks for more fine-grained insights. All problems are newly created by 50+ active physics researchers based on their own research. Every problem is hand-curated to admit a guess-resistant and machine-verifiable answer and is evaluated by an automated grading pipeline heavily customized for advanced physics-specific output formats. We find that while current state-of-the-art LLMs show early promise on isolated checkpoints, they remain far from being able to reliably solve full research-scale challenges: the best average accuracy among base models is only 4.0% , achieved by GPT-5 (high), moderately rising to around 10% when equipped with coding tools. Through the realistic yet standardized evaluation offered by CritPt, we highlight a large disconnect between current model capabilities and realistic physics research demands, offering a foundation to guide the development of scientifically grounded AI tools.</description>
