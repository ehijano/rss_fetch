      <title>Separating covering numbers and separating uniformity numbers of Hausdorff measures need large continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that if $\mathfrak{c} = \aleph_2$ then all covering numbers of Hausdorff measures $\operatorname{cov}(\mathcal{N}^s(\mathbb{R}^d))$ ($0 &lt; s &lt; d, d \in \omega$) are equal and all uniformity numbers $\operatorname{non}(\mathcal{N}^s(\mathbb{R}^d))$ ($0 &lt; s &lt; d, d \in \omega$) are equal. This is a partial answer to Problem 5.3 and 5.4 of [4].</description>

      <title>$L^p$ boundness of Oscillatory singular integral with Calder\'{o}n Type Commutators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper, we study a kind of Oscillatory singular integral operator with Calder\'{o}n Type Commutators $T_{P,K,A} $ defined by
  \[T_{P,K,A} f(x)=\text { p.v.} \int_{\mathbb{R}^{n}} f(y) \frac{K(x-y)}{|x-y|}(A(x)-A(y)-\nabla A(y))(x-y) e^{i P(x-y)} d y, \]
  where $P(t)$ is a real polynomial on $\mathbb{R},$ and $K$ is a function on $\mathbb{R}^{n},$ satisfies the vanishing moment and $CZ(\delta)$ conditions. Under these conditions, we show that $T_{P,K,A}$ is bounded on $L^p(\mathbb{R}^{n})$ with uniform boundedness, which improve and extend the previous result.</description>

      <title>Best approximation by polynomials on the conic domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new modulus of smoothness and its equivalent $K$-function are defined on the conic domains in $\mathbb{R}^d$, and used to characterize the weighted best approximation by polynomials. Both direct and weak inverse theorems of the characterization are established via the modulus of smoothness. For the conic surface $\mathbb{V}_0^{d+1} = \{(x,t): \|x\| = t\le 1\}$, the natural weight function is $t^{-1}(1-t)^\gamma$, which has a singularity at the apex, the rotational part of the modulus of smoothness is defined in terms of the difference operator in Euler angles with an increment $h/\sqrt{t}$, akin to the Ditzian-Totik modulus on the interval but with $\sqrt{t}$ in the denominator, which captures the singularity at the apex.</description>

      <title>The dimension of random subsets of self-similar sets generated by branching random walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a self-similar set $\Lambda$ that is the attractor of an iterated function system (IFS) $\{f_1,\dots,f_N\}$, consider the following method for constructing a random subset of $\Lambda$: Let $\mathbf{p}=(p_1,\dots,p_N)$ be a probability vector, and label all edges of a full $M$-ary tree independently at random with a number from $\{1,2,\dots,N\}$ according to $\mathbf{p}$, where $M\geq 2$ is an arbitrary integer. Then each infinite path in the tree starting from the root receives a random label sequence which is the coding of a point in $\Lambda$. We let $F\subset\Lambda$ denote the set of all points obtained in this way. This construction was introduced by Allaart and Jones [J. Fractal Geom. 12 (2025), 67--92], who considered the case of a homogeneous IFS on $\mathbb{R}$ satisfying the Open Set Condition (OSC) and proved non-trivial upper and lower bounds for the Hausdorff dimension of $F$. We demonstrate that under the OSC, the Hausdorff (and box-counting) dimension of $F$ is equal to the upper bound of Allaart and Jones, and extend the result to higher dimensions as well as to non-homogeneous self-similar sets.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that product singular integrals are bounded on product Hardy spaces and that flag singular integrals are bounded on flag Hardy spaces. The purpose of this paper is to obtain the complete boundedness of singular integrals on weighted flag and product Hardy spaces. In particular, we prove the boundedness of one-parameter singular integrals on both weighted flag and product Hardy spaces, as well as the boundedness of flag singular integrals on weighted product Hardy spaces.</description>

      <title>The multilinear fractional bounded mean oscillation operator theory I: sparse domination, sparse $T1$ theorem, off-diagonal extrapolation, quantitative weighted estimate -- for generalized commutators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces and studies a class of multilinear fractional bounded mean oscillation operators (denoted {\rm $m$-FBMOOs}) defined on ball-basis measure spaces $(X, \mu, \mathcal{B})$. These operators serve as a generalization of canonical classes, such as the multilinear fractional maximal operators, the multilinear fractional Ahlfors-Beurling operators, the multilinear pseudo-differential operators with multi-parameter H\"ormander symbol, and some multilinear operators admitting $\mathbb{V}$-valued $m$-linear fractional Dini-type Calder\'on-Zygmund kernel representation. Crucially, the definition utilized here, incorporating the notion of "bounded mean oscillation," provides greater generality compared to those in Karagulyan (2019) and Cao et al. (2023). Our investigation systematically examines the properties of these operators and their generalized commutators through the lens of modern harmonic analysis, focusing on two principal directions: 1.We establish Karagulyan-type sparse domination for the generalized commutators. Subsequently, by developing bespoke dyadic representation theorems pertinent to this setting, we prove a corresponding multilinear fractional sparse $T1$ theorem for these generalized commutators. 2.With sparse bounds established, we obtain weighted estimates in multiple complementary methods: (1) Under a novel class of multilinear fractional weights, we prove four types of weighted inequalities: sharp-type, Bloom-type, mixed weak-type, and local decay-type.(2) We develop a multilinear non-diagonal extrapolation framework for these weights, which transfers boundedness flexibly among weighted spaces and establishes corresponding vector-valued inequalities.</description>

      <title>Kernels for composition of positive linear operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the composition of Bernstein--Durrmeyer operators and Sz\'asz--Mirakjan--Durrmeyer operators, focusing on the structure and properties of the associated kernel functions. In the case of the Bernstein--Durrmeyer operators, we establish new identities for the kernel arising from the composition of two and three operators, from which the commutativity of these operators follows naturally. Building on the eigenstructure of the Bernstein--Durrmeyer operator $M_n$, we obtain a representation of the iterate $M_n^r$ as a linear combination of the operators $M_k$, for $k=0,1,\dots,n$. We also address the composition of Sz\'asz--Mirakjan--Durrmeyer operators and revisit a known result giving an elementary proof.</description>

      <title>Geometric implications of weak tiling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notion of weak tiling played a key role in the proof of Fuglede's spectral set conjecture for convex domains, due to the fact that every spectral set must weakly tile its complement. In this paper, we revisit the notion of weak tiling and establish some geometric properties of sets that weakly tile their complement. If $A \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ is a convex polytope, we give a direct and self-contained proof that $A$ must be symmetric and have symmetric facets. If $A \subset \mathbb{R}$ is a finite union of intervals, we give a necessary condition on the lengths of the gaps between the intervals.</description>

      <title>$L^p$-Logvinenko-Sereda sets and $L^p$-Carleson measures on compact manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Marzo and Ortega-Cerd\`a gave geometric characterizations for $L^p$-Logvinenko-Sereda sets on the standard sphere for all $1\le p&lt;\infty$. Later, Ortega-Cerd\`a and Pridhnani further investigated $L^2$-Logvinenko-Sereda sets and $L^2$-Carleson measures on compact manifolds without boundary. In this paper, we characterize $L^p$-Logvinenko-Sereda sets and $L^p$-Carleson measures on compact manifolds with or without boundary for all $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$. Furthermore, we investigate $L^p$-Logvinenko-Sereda sets and $L^p$-Carleson measures for eigenfunctions on compact manifolds without boundary, and we completely characterize them on the standard sphere $S^m$ for $p &gt; \frac{2m}{m-1}$. For the range $p &lt; \frac{2m}{m-1}$, we conjecture that $L^p$-Logvinenko-Sereda sets for eigenfunctions on the standard sphere $S^m$ are characterized by the tubular geometric control condition and we provide some evidence. These results provide new progress on an open problem raised by Ortega-Cerd\`a and Pridhnani.</description>

      <title>Shifted Pitt and uncertainty inequalities on Riemannian symmetric spaces of noncompact type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our primary objective is to study Pitt-type inequalities on Riemannian symmetric spaces $\mathbb{X}$ of noncompact type, as well as within the framework of Jacobi analysis. Inspired by the spectral gap of the Laplacian on $\mathbb{X}$, we introduce the notion of a \textit{shifted} Pitt's inequality as a natural and intrinsic analogue tailored to symmetric spaces, capturing key aspects of the underlying non-Euclidean geometry. In the rank one case (in particular, for hyperbolic spaces), we show that the sufficient condition for the \textit{shifted} Pitt's inequality matches the necessary condition in the range $p \leq q \leq p'$, yielding a sharp characterization of admissible polynomial weights with non-negative exponents.
  In the Jacobi setting, we modify the transform so that the associated measure exhibits polynomial volume growth. This modification enables us to fully characterize the class of polynomial weights with non-negative exponents for which Pitt-type inequalities hold for the modified Jacobi transforms. As applications of the \textit{shifted} Pitt's inequalities, we derive $L^2$-type Heisenberg-Pauli-Weyl uncertainty inequalities and further establish generalized $L^p$ versions. Moreover, the geometric structure of symmetric spaces allows us to formulate a broader version of the uncertainty inequalities previously obtained by Ciatti-Cowling-Ricci in the setting of stratified Lie groups.</description>

      <title>Stability transitions of NLS action ground-states on metric graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the orbital stability of action ground-states of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation over two particular cases of metric graphs, the $\mathcal{T}$ and the tadpole graphs. We show the existence of stability transitions near the $L^2$-critical exponent, a new dynamical feature of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. More precisely, as the frequency $\lambda$ increases, the action ground-state transitions from stable to unstable and then back to stable (or vice-versa).
  This result is complemented with the stability analysis of ground-states in the asymptotic cases of low/high frequency and weak/strong nonlinear interaction. Finally, we present a numerical simulation of the stability of action ground-states depending on the nonlinearity and the frequency parameter, which validates the aforementioned theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Uncentered Fractional Maximal functions and mean oscillation spaces associated with dyadic Hausdorff content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the action of uncentered fractional maximal functions on mean oscillation spaces associated with the dyadic Hausdorff content $\mathcal{H}_{\infty}^{\beta}$ with $0&lt;\beta\leq n$. For $0 &lt; \alpha &lt; n$, we refine existing results concerning the action of the Euclidean uncentered fractional maximal function $\mathcal{M}_{\alpha}$ on the functions of bounded mean oscillations (BMO) and vanishing mean oscillations (VMO). In addition, for $0 &lt; \beta_1 \leq \beta_2 \leq n$, we establish the boundedness of the $\beta_2$-dimensional uncentered maximal function $\mathcal{M}^{\beta_2}$ on the space $\text{BMO}^{\beta_1}(\mathbb{R}^n)$, where $\text{BMO}^{\beta_1}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ denotes the mean oscillation space adapted to the dyadic Hausdorff content $\mathcal{H}_{\infty}^{\beta_1}$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We find necessary and sufficient conditions on weights $u_1, u_2, v_1, v_2$, i.e. measurable, positive, and finite, a.e. on $(a,b)$, for which there exists a positive constant $C$ such that for given $0 &lt; p_1,q_1,p_2,q_2 &lt;\infty$ the inequality \begin{equation*} \begin{split} \bigg(\int_a^b \bigg(\int_a^t f(s)^{p_2} v_2(s)^{p_2} ds\bigg)^{\frac{q_2}{p_2}} u_2(t)^{q_2} dt \bigg)^{\frac{1}{q_2}}&amp; \\ &amp; \hspace{-3cm}\le C \bigg(\int_a^b \bigg(\int_a^t f(s)^{p_1} v_1(s)^{p_1} ds\bigg)^{\frac{q_1}{p_1}} u_1(t)^{q_1} dt \bigg)^{\frac{1}{q_1}} \end{split} \end{equation*} holds for every non-negative, measurable function $f$ on $(a,b)$, where $0 \le a &lt;b \le \infty$. The proof is based on a recently developed discretization method that enables us to overcome the restrictions of the earlier results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents explicit formulas for intertwining operators of the quantum group $U_q(sl_2)$ acting on tensor products of Verma modules. We express a first set of intertwining operators (the holographic operators) in terms of the little $q$-Jacobi polynomials, and we obtain for the dual set (the symmetry breaking operators) a $q$-deformation of the Rankin--Cohen operators. The Verma modules are realised on polynomial spaces and, interestingly, we find along the way the need to work with non-commuting variables. Explicit connections are given with the Clebsch--Gordan coefficients of $U_q(sl_2)$ expressed with the $q$-Hahn polynomials.</description>

      <title>Boundary Value Problems in graph Lipschitz domains in the plane with $A_{\infty}$-measures on the boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove several results for the Dirichlet, Neumann and Regularity problems for the Laplace equation in graph Lipschitz domains in the plane, considering $A_{\infty}$-measures on the boundary. More specifically, we study the $L^{p,1}$-solvability for the Dirichlet problem, complementing results of Kenig (1980) and Carro and Ortiz-Caraballo (2018). Then, we study $L^p$-solvability of the Neumann problem, obtaining a range of solvability which is empty in some cases, a clear difference with the arc-length case. When it is not empty, it is an interval, and we consider solvability at its endpoints, establishing conditions for Lorentz space solvability when $p&gt;1$ and atomic Hardy space solvability when $p=1$. Solving the Lorentz endpoint leads us to a two-weight Sawyer-type inequality, for which we give a sufficient condition. Finally, we show how to adapt to the Regularity problem the results for the Neumann problem.</description>

      <title>On the zero sets of harmonic polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider nonzero harmonic functions vanishing on certain subvarieties. Among other things, we give a positive solution to the Problem 151 from the Scottish Book posed by R. Wavre in 1936. In more detail, we construct a nonzero harmonic function in the whole space that vanishes on the edges of the unit cube. Moreover, using harmonic morphisms we construct certain new nontrivial families of harmonic polynomials that vanish at the same set in the unit ball in n-dimensional space for all n greater than or equal to 4. This extends results of Logunov and Malinnikova. We also present some (presumably) new results on harmonic functions in the space whose nodal sets are unions of (affine) subspaces.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal polynomials with periodic recurrence coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08166v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a class of orthogonal polynomials defined by a three-term recurrence relation with periodic coefficients. We derive explicit formulas for the generating function, the associated continued fraction, the orthogonality measure of these polynomials, as well as the spectral measure for the associated doubly infinite tridiagonal Jacobi matrix. Notably, while the orthogonality measure may include discrete mass points, the spectral measure(s) of the doubly infinite Jacobi matrix are absolutely continuous. Additionally, we uncover an intrinsic connection between these new orthogonal polynomials and Chebyshev polynomials through a nonlinear transformation of the polynomial variables.</description>
