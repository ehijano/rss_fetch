      <title>On the Distributions of Product and Quotient of two Independent $\hat{I}$-function variates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of probability distributions for random variables and their algebraic combinations has been a central focus driving the advancement of probability and statistics. Since the 1920s, the challenge of calculating the probability distributions of sums, differences, products, and quotients of independent random variables have drawn the attention of numerous statisticians and mathematicians who studied the algebraic properties and relationships of random variables. Statistical distributions are highly helpful in data science and machine learning, as they provide a range of possible values for the variables, aiding in the development of a deeper understanding of the underlying problem. In this paper, we have presented a new probability distribution based on the $\hat{I}$-function. Also, we have discussed the applications of the $\hat{I}$ function, particularly in deriving the distributions of product and the quotient involving two independent $\hat{I}$ function variates. Additionally, it has been shown that both the product and quotient of two independent $\hat{I}$-function variates also follow the $\hat{I}$-function distribution. Furthermore, the new distribution, known as the $\hat{I}$-function distribution, includes several well-known classical distributions such as the gamma, beta, exponential, normal H-function, and G-function distributions, among others, as special cases. Therefore, the $\hat{I}$-function distribution can be considered a characterization or generalization of the above-mentioned distributions.</description>

      <title>Integral and hypergeometric representations for multiple orthogonal polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses two primary objectives in the realm of classical multiple orthogonal polynomials with an arbitrary number of weights. Firstly, it establishes new and explicit hypergeometric expressions for type I Hahn multiple orthogonal polynomials. Secondly, applying the residue theorem and the Mellin transform, the paper derives contour integral representations for several families of orthogonal polynomials. Specifically, it presents contour integral formulas for both type I and type II multiple orthogonal polynomials in the Laguerre of the first kind, Jacobi-Pi\~neiro, and Hahn families. The evaluation of these integrals leads to explicit hypergeometric representations.</description>

      <title>Failure of weak-type endpoint restriction estimates for quadratic manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A paper of Beckner, Carbery, Semmes, and Soria proved that the Fourier extension operator associated to the sphere cannot be weak-type bounded at the restriction endpoint $q = 2d/(d-1)$. We generalize their approach to prove that the extension operator associated with any $n$-dimensional quadratic manifold in $\mathbb{R}^d$ cannot be weak-type bounded at $q = 2d/n$. The key step in generalizing the proof of Beckner, Carbery, Semmes, and Soria will be replacing Kakeya sets with what we will call $\mathcal{N}$-Kakeya sets, where $\mathcal{N}$ denotes a closed subset of the Grassmannian $\text{Gr}(d-n,d)$. We define $\mathcal{N}$-Kakeya sets to be subsets of $\mathbb{R}^d$ containing a translate of every $d-n$-plane segment in $\mathcal{N}$. We will prove that if $\mathcal{N}$ is closed and $n$-dimensional, then there exists compact, measure zero $\mathcal{N}$-Kakeya sets, generalizing the same result for standard Kakeya sets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study approximation properties of the Fr\'{e}chet space of all continuously differentiable functions $\tau$ such that $\tau'(x)=o(1)$ and such that their Laplace transforms admit entire extensions to $\mathbb{C}$. As an application, these approximation results are combined with the open mapping theorem to show the optimality theorem for the Ingham-Karamata Tauberian theorem.</description>

      <title>Some new properties of the beta function and Ramanujan R-function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the power series and hypergeometric series representations of the beta and Ramanujan functions \begin{equation*} \mathcal{B}\left( x\right) =\frac{\Gamma \left( x\right)^{2}}{\Gamma \left( 2x\right) }\text{ and }\mathcal{R}\left( x\right) =-2\psi \left( x\right) -2\gamma \end{equation*} are presented, which yield higher order monotonicity results related to $ \mathcal{B}(x)$ and $\mathcal{R}(x)$; the decreasing property of the functions $\mathcal{R}\left( x\right) /\mathcal{B}\left( x\right) $ and $[ \mathcal{B}(x) -\mathcal{R}(x)] /x^{2}$ on $\left( 0,\infty \right)$ are proved. Moreover, a conjecture put forward by Qiu et al. in [17] is proved to be true. As applications, several inequalities and identities are deduced. These results obtained in this paper may be helpful for the study of certain special functions. Finally, an interesting infinite series similar to Riemann zeta functions is observed initially.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show, by applying discrete weighted norm inequalities and the Rubio de Francia algorithm, that the discrete Hilbert transform and discrete Riesz potential are bounded on variable $\ell^{p(\cdot)}(\mathbb{Z})$ spaces whenever the discrete Hardy-Littlewood maximal is bounded on $\ell^{p(\cdot)}(\mathbb{Z})$. We also obtain vector-valued inequalities for the discrete fractional maximal operator.</description>

      <title>Phase space analysis of higher-order dispersive equations with point interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate nonlinear, higher-order dispersive equations with measure (or even less regular) potentials and initial data with low regularity. Our approach is of distributional nature and relies on the phase space analysis (via Gabor wave packets) of the corresponding fundamental solution - in fact, locating the modulation/amalgam space regularity of such generalized Fresnel-type oscillatory functions is a problem of independent interest in harmonic analysis.</description>

      <title>Fast second-order dynamics with slow vanishing damping approaching the zeros of a monotone and continuous operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we approach the problem of finding the zeros of a continuous and monotone operator through a second-order dynamical system with a damping term of the form $1/t^{r}$, where $r\in [0, 1]$. The system features the time derivative of the operator evaluated along the trajectory, which is a Hessian-driven type damping term when the governing operator comes from a potential. Also entering the system is a time rescaling parameter $\beta(t)$ which satisfies a certain growth condition. We derive $o\left(\frac{1}{t^{2r}\beta(t)}\right)$ convergence rates for the norm of the operator evaluated along the generated trajectories as well as for a gap function which serves as a measure of optimality for the associated variational inequality. The parameter $r$ enters the growth condition for $\beta(t)$: when $r &lt; 1$, the damping $1/t^{r}$ approaches zero at a slower speed than Nesterov's $1/t$ damping; in this case, we are allowed to choose $\beta(t)$ to be an exponential function, thus having linear convergence rates for the involved quantities. We also show weak convergence of the trajectories towards zeros of the governing operator. Through a particular choice for the operator, we establish a connection with the problem of minimizing a smooth and convex function with linear constraints. The convergence rates we derived in the operator case are inherited by the objective function evaluated at the trajectories and for the feasibility gap. We also prove weak convergence of the trajectories towards primal-dual solutions of the problem.
  A discretization of the dynamical system yields an implicit algorithm that exhibits analogous convergence properties to its continuous counterpart.
  We complement our theoretical findings with two numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Sharp commutator estimates of all order for Coulomb and Riesz modulated energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove functional inequalities in any dimension controlling the iterated derivatives along a transport of the Coulomb or super-Coulomb Riesz modulated energy in terms of the modulated energy itself. This modulated energy was introduced by the second author and collaborators in the study of mean-field limits and statistical mechanics of Coulomb/Riesz gases, where control of such derivatives by the energy itself is an essential ingredient. In this paper, we extend and improve such functional inequalities, proving estimates which are now sharp in their additive error term, in their density dependence, valid at arbitrary order of differentiation, and localizable to the support of the transport. Our method relies on the observation that these iterated derivatives are the quadratic form of a commutator. Taking advantage of the Riesz nature of the interaction, we identify these commutators as solutions to a degenerate elliptic equation with a right-hand side exhibiting a recursive structure in terms of lower-order commutators and develop a local regularity theory for the commutators, which may be of independent interest.
  These estimates have applications to obtaining sharp rates of convergence for mean-field limits, quasi-neutral limits, and in proving central limit theorems for the fluctuations of Coulomb/Riesz gases. In particular, we show here the expected $N^{\frac{\mathsf{s}}{\mathsf{d}}-1}$-rate in the modulated energy distance for the mean-field convergence of first-order Hamiltonian and gradient flows.</description>

      <title>Rapidly convergent series expansions for a class of resolvents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Following advances in the theory of composites we develop rapidly converging series expansions about $z=\infty$ for the resolvent ${\bf R}(z)=[z{\bf I}-{\bf P}^\dagger{\bf Q}{\bf P}]^{-1}$ where ${\bf Q}$ is an orthogonal projection and ${\bf P}$ is such that ${\bf P}^\dagger{\bf P}={\bf I}$ while $\Gamma={\bf P}{\bf P}^\dagger$ is an orthogonal projection. It is assumed that the spectrum of ${\bf P}^\dagger{\bf Q}{\bf P}$ lies within the interval $[z^-,z^+]$ for some known $z^+\leq 1$ and $z^-\geq 0$. The series converges in the entire $z$-plane excluding the cut $[z^-,z^+]$. It is obtained using subspace substitution, where the desired resolvent is tied to a resolvent in a larger space and ${\bf Q}$ gets replaced by a projection $\underline{\bf Q}$ that is no longer orthogonal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1912.10290v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By means of appropriate sparse bounds, we deduce compactness on weighted $L^p(w)$ spaces, $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$, for all Calder\'on-Zygmund operators having compact extensions on $L^2(\mathbb{R}^n)$. Similar methods lead to new results on boundedness and compactness of Haar multipliers on weighted spaces. In particular, we prove weighted bounds for weights in a class strictly larger than the typical $A_p$ class.</description>

Our results, which hold for general $\vec{p} \in [1,\infty)^m$ and feature quantitative improvements, rely on new local testing conditions and good-$\lambda$ inequalities.

      <title>On the Existence of an Extremal Function for the Delsarte Extremal Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04410v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the general setting of a locally compact Abelian group $G$, the Delsarte extremal problem asks for the supremum of integrals over the collection of continuous positive definite functions $f: G \to \mathbb{R}$ satisfying $f(0) = 1$ and having $\mathrm{supp} f_{+} \subset \Omega$ for some measurable subset $\Omega$ of finite measure. In this paper, we consider the question of the existence of an extremal function for the Delsarte extremal problem. In particular, we show that there exists an extremal function for the Delsarte problem when $\Omega$ is closed, extending previously known existence results to a larger class of functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the theory of inner and outer balayage of positive Radon measures on a locally compact space $X$ to arbitrary $A\subset X$ with respect to suitable, quite general function kernels, developed in a series of the author's recent papers, we find conditions ensuring the validity of the integral representations. The results thereby obtained do hold and seem to be largely new even for several interesting kernels in classical and modern potential theory, which looks promising for possible applications. As an example of such applications, we analyze how the total mass of a measure varies under its balayage with respect to fractional Green kernels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The real and complex zeros of the parabolic cylinder function $U(a,z)$ are studied. Asymptotic expansions for the zeros are derived, involving the zeros of Airy functions, and these are valid for $a$ positive or negative and large in absolute value, uniformly for unbounded $z$ (real or complex). The accuracy of the approximations of the complex zeros is then demonstrated with some comparative tests using a highly precise numerical algorithm for finding the complex zeros of the function.</description>

Abstract: Score-based generative models have emerged as a powerful approach for sampling high-dimensional probability distributions. Despite their effectiveness, their theoretical underpinnings remain relatively underdeveloped. In this work, we study the convergence properties of deterministic samplers based on probability flow ODEs from both theoretical and numerical perspectives. Assuming access to $L^2$-accurate estimates of the score function, we prove the total variation between the target and the generated data distributions can be bounded above by $\mathcal{O}(d^{3/4}\delta^{1/2})$ in the continuous time level, where $d$ denotes the data dimension and $\delta$ represents the $L^2$-score matching error. For practical implementations using a $p$-th order Runge-Kutta integrator with step size $h$, we establish error bounds of $\mathcal{O}(d^{3/4}\delta^{1/2} + d\cdot(dh)^p)$ at the discrete level. Finally, we present numerical studies on problems up to 128 dimensions to verify our theory.</description>
