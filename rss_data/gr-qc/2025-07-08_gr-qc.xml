      <title>Lower bound on the proper lengths of stationary bound-state charged massive scalar clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has recently been revealed that charged scalar clouds, spatially regular matter configurations which are made of linearized charged massive scalar fields, can be supported by spinning and charged Kerr-Newman black holes. Using analytical techniques, we establish a no-short hair theorem for these stationary bound-state field configurations. In particular, we prove that the effective proper lengths of the supported charged massive scalar clouds are bounded from below by the remarkably compact dimensionless relation $\ell/M&gt;\ln(3+\sqrt{8})$, where $M$ is the mass of the central supporting black hole. Intriguingly, this lower bound is universal in the sense that it is valid for all Kerr-Newman black-hole spacetimes [that is, in the entire regime $\{a/M\in(0,1],Q/M\in[0,1)\}$ of the dimensionless spin and charge parameters that characterize the central supporting black holes] and for all values of the physical parameters (electric charge $q$, proper mass $\mu$, and angular harmonic indexes $\{l,m\}$) that characterize the supported stationary bound-state scalar fields.</description>

      <title>Dynamical black holes and accretion-induced backreaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of future trapping horizons through the dynamics of the Misner-Sharp mass using ingoing Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates. Our analysis shows that an integral formulation of Hayward's first law governs much of the evolution of general spherically symmetric spacetimes. To account for the accretion backreaction, we consider a near-horizon approximation, yielding first-order corrections of a Vaidya-dark energy form. We further propose a systematic perturbative scheme to study these effects for an arbitrary background. As an application, we analyze an accreting Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole and demonstrate the horizon shifts that are produced. Finally, we compute accretion-induced corrections to an extremal configuration. It is shown that momentum influx and energy density produce distinct effects: the former forces the splitting of the extremal horizon, while the latter induces significant displacements in its position, computed up to first-order perturbative corrections. These results highlight how different components of the stress-energy tensor significantly affect horizon geometry, with potential implications for broader areas of research, including black-hole thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of an universe with Decaying Cold Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we focus on the thermodynamics consistency of a new set of solutions emerging from a cosmology in which dark matter is able to decay into relativistic particles within the dark sector. It is important to stress that the lifetime of dark matter is larger than the age of the universe in order to be consistent with observations. Given that the corresponding decay rate is small, this one can be used as a perturbative parameter and it is possible to construct analytic solutions from a perturbative analysis for the densities of the species and the scale factor. The decay of dark matter is an irreversible process since it occurs out of chemical equilibrium and therefore the entropy per comoving volume increases considerably, as a consequence the temperature does not scale as $a^{-1}$ in contrast to an adiabatic expansion. We take into account two scenarios: a) The case in which both species making up the fluid end up in thermal equilibrium and therefore their temperature is the same. b) A second instance in which the species do not reach thermal equilibrium and therefore they have different temperatures. We verify that the second law of thermodynamics is satisfied in any case.</description>

      <title>Lorentz-violating wormholes: The role of the matter coupled to Lorentz-violating fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The anisotropies induced by Lorentz-violating fields pose significant challenges for the search for compact objects in non-vacuum environments. In this work, we demonstrate that introducing couplings between Lorentz-violating fields and matter facilitates the formation of traversable wormholes. Specifically, we introduce additional couplings in the Lagrangian of a phantom scalar field and derive Ellis-Bronnikov spacetime analogs in three distinct Lorentz-violating scenarios: (I) modifications arising from the vacuum expectation value of the bumblebee field, (II) contributions from the vacuum expectation value of an antisymmetric rank-2 tensor field, and (III) a combined scenario incorporating both fields. In the latter case, despite the distinct nature of the fields, their non-zero vacuum expectation values contribute additively to the overall effect on the phantom distribution and on the resulting line element. Moreover, we consider scalar waves to probe the effects of the Lorentz violation in these spacetimes. Notably, the additional Lorentz-violating couplings can alter scalar field dynamics such that perturbations propagate as if in a General Relativity background, which allows for some traits of Lorentz violation to be hidden. We compute the quasinormal mode spectra of these perturbations using three methods: direct integration, 6th-order WKB approximation, and the Prony method, finding strong agreement among the results.</description>

      <title>Vacuum Phase Transitions and the Temperature of the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The authors discuss a possibility that the present great value of aT ( a is the radius of spatial curvature and T is the temperature of the Universe ) was generated by first order vacuum phase transitions. In Coleman-Weinberg type models such transitions are natural and they rise the value of aT from unity to an exponentially large value. Some GUTs are briefly discussed in this contest.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Perturbations of Extended NGR Model with Parity Violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently the modified teleparallel gravity models attracted a lot of interests. In this paper we consider more extensions to the New General Relativity (NGR) model with parity violations. This extended NGR model differs from the normal NGR model by the inclusion of additional parity-odd term that is quadratic in the torsion tensor. By investigating its cosmological perturbations of this model, we find that this model can avoid ghost instabilities in certain regions of the parameter space, where the coefficient of the parity-odd term does not vanish.</description>

      <title>Extreme mass-ratio inspirals and extra dimensions: Insights from modified Teukolsky framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) offer a promising avenue to test extra-dimensional physics through gravitational wave (GW) observations. In this work, we study equatorial eccentric EMRIs around a spherically symmetric braneworld black hole, focusing on the influence of a tidal charge parameter arising as extra dimensions. Using the fact of tr-symmetry of the spacetime under consideration, we implement the Modified Teukolsky Equation (MTE) framework and compute observables, as well as compare the results with those from the standard Teukolsky formalism for general relativity (GR). Our analysis reveals significant deviations in dephasing and mismatch values, especially for the higher eccentricities. These findings highlight not only the observational potential of future low-frequency detectors like the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) but also the necessity of using the MTE framework for accurately modeling binaries in theories beyond GR.</description>

      <title>A covariant approach to the Dirac field in LRS space-times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the polar decomposition to describe the Dirac field in terms of an effective spinorial fluid. After reformulating all covariant equations in ``spinorial'' signature $(+ -- )$, we develop a $(1+1+2)$ covariant approach for the Dirac field that does not require the use of tetrad fields or Clifford matrices. By identifying the velocity and spin fields as the generators of time-like and space-like congruences, we examine the compatibility of a self-gravitating Dirac field with Locally Rotationally Symmetric space-times of types I, II, and III. We provide illustrative examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of our construction.</description>

      <title>Scattering of a point mass by a Schwarzschild black hole: radiated energy and angular momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The radiated energy and angular momentum from a point mass on a hyperbolic-like orbit about a Schwarzschild black hole are computed for the first time in the framework of the first-order self-force theory. The analytical expressions for the fluxes are obtained through the standard method of Mano, Suzuki and Takasugi in the form of combined post-Minkowskian (PM) and post-Newtonian (PN) expansions. The reached PM accuracy for the energy and angular momentum losses is $O(G^5)$ and $O(G^4)$, respectively, and 7PN for both. The radiative losses (energy, angular momentum and linear momentum) are currently known in PN-expanded form up to the (fractional) 3PN order [D. Bini et al., Phys. Rev. D \textbf{107}, 024012 (2023)]. Exact PM results valid for arbitrary values of the velocity are limited to $O(G^4)$ for the energy and $O(G^3)$ for the angular momentum. An exact expression for the radiated energy at $O(G^5)$ has been recently obtained in [M. Driesse et al., Nature \textbf{641}, 603-607 (2025)] in the first-order self force limit, whereas the $O(G^4)$ radiated angular momentum has been partially determined in [C. Heissenberg, Phys. Rev. D \textbf{111}, 126012 (2025)]. The results of this work are in agreement with the state of the art of both energy and angular momentum losses, also completing the knowledge of the 4PM radiated angular momentum up to the reached PN accuracy. The expressions for radiative losses are then used to get the 5PM radiation-reacted scattering angle, which should also serve as a cross-check of ongoing calculations by other methods.</description>

      <title>Spherical Orbital Dynamics and Relativistic Precession in Kerr-MOG Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics and relativistic precessions of massive particles on spherical orbits around Kerr-MOG black holes in scalar-tensor-vector gravity (STVG). By employing the Hamilton-Jacobi formalism, we derive conserved quantities and analyze how the MOG parameter $\alpha$ and orbital tilt angle $\zeta$ influence the innermost stable spherical orbits (ISSOs) and orbital stability. We compute the nodal and periastron precession frequencies, finding that nodal precession increases monotonically with both black hole spin and MOG parameter, while periastron precession exhibits a more complex behavior: MOG amplifies curvature-induced effects, which can be partially counteracted by spin. Furthermore, to complement the orbital analysis, we examine the Lense-Thirring spin precession of a gyroscope and demonstrate its sensitivity to the MOG parameter, spin, and orbital tilt angle. These results reveal distinctive signatures of modified gravity in orbital dynamics and provide a potential observational probe to test deviations from general relativity near rotating black holes.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics in space-times without horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the energetics and thermodynamics of spacetimes with no horizons, but endowed with a preferred timelike junction surface. They could arise as a limiting case of the gravastar and other constructions regularizing the interior of the horizon of a black hole, or from the conceptual cutting of a portion of a non-asymptotically flat space and gluing it with flat space. We find that such surfaces can be made to have zero energy, so that the energetics of such spaces is not encumbered by them. They do have a transverse pressure, fixed by the jump in surface gravity. A peculiar matter thermodynamics then follows, with well defined entropy, temperature and surface pressure, constrained by specific relations arising from the zero energy condition. This is confirmed by the Euclidean path integral, with the proviso that the Tolman-Ehrenfest temperature should be used. The entropy of the space is then the area of the timelike surface in units of a fundamental area, and the matter temperature is proportional to the transverse pressure and so the jump in surface gravity. However, when the gravitational action is added, the free energy of the surface is also zero. The fact that for some such spaces the temperature comes out negative raises interesting questions regarding the third law of thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Ring formation from black hole superradiance through repeated particle production on bound orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultralight bosonic fields around a rotating black hole can extract energy and angular momentum through the superradiant instability and form a dense cloud. We investigate the scenario involving two scalar fields, $\phi$ and $\chi$, with a coupling term $\frac{1}{2}\lambda\phi\chi^2$, which is motivated by the multiple-axion framework. The ultralight scalar $\phi$ forms a cloud that efficiently produces $\chi$ particles non-perturbatively via parametric resonance, with a large mass hierarchy, $\mu_\chi \gg \mu_\phi$. Rather than escaping the system as investigated by previous studies, these $\chi$ particles remain bound, orbiting the black hole. Moreover, the particle production occurs primarily at the peak of the cloud's profile, allowing $\chi$ particles in quasi-circular orbits to pass repeatedly through resonant regions, leading to sustained amplification. This selective process naturally forms a dense ring of $\chi$ particles, with a mass ratio to the cloud fixed by $(\mu_\phi/\mu_\chi)^2$. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism for generating bound-state particles via parametric resonance, which also impacts the evolution of the cloud. This process can be probed through its imprint on binary dynamics and its gravitational-wave signatures.</description>

      <title>Stability and Criticality Behaviors of Accelerating Charged AdS Black Holes in Rainbow Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the thermodynamical properties of accelerated charged Anti-de Sitter black holes in the context of rainbow gravity. Concretely, we compute the corresponding quantities needed to study the thermal stability and the critical behaviors including the phase transitions. Linking the acceleration parameter $A$ and the horizon radius $r_h$ via a constant parameter $a$, we discuss the $P$-$v$ criticality behaviors by calculating the critical pressure $P_c$, the critical temperature $T_c$ and the critical specific volume $v_c$ in terms of $a$ and the rainbow gravity parameter $\varepsilon$. As results, we reveal that the ratio $ \dfrac{P_{c}v_{c}}{T_{c}}$ is an universal number with respect to the charge. In small limits of the external parameters, we recover the Van der Waals fluid behaviors.</description>

      <title>Cauchy Horizon (In)Stability of Regular Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A common feature of regular black hole spacetimes is the presence of an inner Cauchy horizon. The analogy to the Reissner-Nordstr\"om solution then suggests that these geometries suffer from a mass-inflation effect, rendering the Cauchy horizon unstable. Recently, it was shown that this analogy fails for certain classes of regular black holes, including the Hayward solution, where the late-time behavior of the mass function no longer grows exponentially but follows a power law. In this work, we extend these results in a two-fold way. First, we determine the basin-of-attraction for the power-law attractor, showing that the tamed growth of the mass function is generic. Second, we extend the systematic analysis to the Bardeen geometry, the Dymnikova black hole, and a spacetime arising from a non-singular collapse model newly proposed in the context of asymptotically safe quantum gravity. Remarkably, in the latter solution, the Misner-Sharp mass at the Cauchy horizon remains of the same order of magnitude of the mass of the black hole, since its growth is just logarithmic.</description>

      <title>Dymnikova Black Hole Surrounded by Quintessence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Dymnikova black hole (BH) is a regular solution that interpolates between a de Sitter core near the origin and a Schwarzschild-like behavior at large distances. In this work, we investigate the properties of a Dymnikova BH immersed in a quintessential field, characterized by the state parameter $\omega$ and a normalization constant $c$. We explore the thermodynamic behavior, null geodesics, scalar quasinormal modes and shadow profiles for this model. Our analysis shows that the presence of quintessence alters the Hawking temperature and specific heat, leading to parameter-dependent phase transitions. The null geodesics and corresponding black hole shadows are also found to be sensitive to the model parameters, especially $\omega$ and $c$. This sensitivity influences light deflection and shadow size. Furthermore, we compute the scalar quasinormal modes and observe that quintessence tends to enhance the damping of the modes, indicating greater stability under perturbations.</description>

      <title>Black-Hole Thermodynamics from Gauge Freedom in Extended Iyer-Wald Formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermodynamic systems admit multiple equivalent descriptions related by transformations that preserve their fundamental structure. This work focuses on exact isohomogeneous transformations (EITs), a class of mappings that keep fixed the set of independent variables of the thermodynamic potential, while preserving both the original homogeneity and the validity of a first law. Our investigation explores EITs within the extended Iyer--Wald formalism for theories containing free parameters (e.g., the cosmological constant). EITs provide a unifying framework for reconciling the diverse formulations of Kerr-anti de Sitter (KadS) thermodynamics found in the literature. While the Iyer--Wald formalism is a powerful tool for deriving first laws for black holes, it typically yields a non-integrable mass variation that prevents its identification as a proper thermodynamic potential. To address this issue, we investigate an extended Iyer--Wald formalism where mass and thermodynamic volume become gauge dependent. Within this framework, we identify the gauge choices and Killing vector normalizations that are compatible with EITs, ensuring consistent first laws. As a key application, we demonstrate how conventional KadS thermodynamics emerges as a special case of our generalized approach.</description>

      <title>Impact of flavor condensate dark matter on accretion disk luminosity in spherical spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of dark matter condensates on the emission and thermodynamic properties of accretion disks, in a spherically-symmetric and static background. We focus on a class of models where dark matter originates from a genuine mass mixing among neutrino fields and compute the corrections to the dark matter's potential within galactic halo. We find a corresponding Yukawa correction induced by the dark matter energy-momentum tensor over the Newtonian potential. In so doing, employing Schwarzschild coordinates, and adopting the Novikov-Thorne formalism, we compute the geodesic structure and the corresponding disk-integrated luminosity profiles. Assuming a constant mass accretion rate, constituted solely by baryonic matter, we find non-negligible deviations in both the disk structure and radiative output, as compared to the standard Schwarzschild case. Afterwards, we discuss physical consequences of our Yukawa correction, comparing it with recent literature, predicting similar potentials, albeit derived from extended theories of gravity. Accordingly, we thus speculate to use our results to distinguish among candidates of dark matter. Indeed, our findings suggest that incoming high-precision observations of accretion disk spectra may provide a tool to probe dark matter's nature under the form of particles, extended theories of gravity or condensates.</description>

      <title>Bekenstein-Hawking Entropy: A Brief Overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the early 1970s, Jacob Bekenstein proposed that black holes possess an entropy proportional to the area of their event horizon, introducing the Generalized Second Law of thermodynamics. Stephen Hawking initially objected to this idea, but his subsequent analysis of quantum field theory in curved spacetime led to the prediction of Hawking radiation and the concept of black hole temperature. This study offers a concise overview of the development of black hole thermodynamics between 1972 and 1975, highlighting the theoretical evolution of both Bekenstein's and Hawking's contributions. The work also reflects on the lasting impact of these developments on modern theoretical physics and quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Geometric Modeling of a Line of Alternating Disclinations: Application to Grain Boundaries in Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a conformal geometric model for grain boundaries in graphene based on a periodic line of alternating disclinations. Within the framework of (2+1)-dimensional gravity, we solve a reduced form of the Einstein equations to determine the conformal factor, from which the induced metric, scalar curvature, and holonomy are obtained analytically. Each pentagon-heptagon pair is modeled as a disclination dipole, forming a continuous distribution that captures the geometric signature of experimentally observed 5-7 grain boundaries. We show that the curvature is localized near the defect line and that the geometry becomes asymptotically flat, with trivial holonomy at large distances. This construction provides a tractable and physically consistent realization of the Katanaev-Volovich framework, connecting topological defect theory with atomistic features of graphene.</description>

      <title>Stability and Thermodynamics of a Generalized Power-Law Dark Energy Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a generalized power-law dark energy equation of state of the form \( p = w\rho - \beta\rho^m \) in a flat FLRW universe, analyzing its dynamical stability and thermodynamic consistency. The model exhibits a rich phase space structure, with an effective cosmological constant \(\rho^* = [(1+w)/\beta]^{1/(m-1)}\) emerging as a stable attractor for \((w &lt; -1,~ m &gt; 1)\). Notably, the universe evolves from an early de Sitter phase (\(w \to -1\)) to a late-time de Sitter-like one with phantom crossing (\(w(z) &lt; -1\)), aligning with DESI observations. Dynamical analysis reveals that the \(m &gt; 1\) regime avoids ghost instabilities while accommodating phantom behavior, with \(m = 2\) providing particular theoretical advantages. Thermodynamically, the Generalized Second Law holds when the null energy condition \(\rho + p \geq 0\) is satisfied, which naturally occurs for \(\rho \geq \rho^*\). The model's compatibility with both observational data and fundamental thermodynamic principles suggests it as a viable framework for describing late-time cosmic acceleration, resolving tensions associated with phantom crossing while maintaining entropy dominance of the cosmological horizon.</description>

      <title>Bright ring features and polarization structures in Kerr-Sen black hole images illuminated by radiatively inefficient accretion flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have investigated the bright ring-like features and polarization structures
  in the Kerr-Sen black hole's images based on general relativistic radiative transfer (GRRT) simulations, which are illuminated by the 230 GHz thermal synchrotron emission from the radiatively inefficient accretion flows (RIAF). Using the REx method, we extracted the bright ring from the black hole images and found that both the bright ring and black hole shadow shrink as the dilation parameter increases. Combing with the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observational data of SgrA*, we present the allowed ranges of black hole parameters for different observed inclinations and disk thicknesses. Our results show that effects of the disk thickness on the allowed parameter space are more strong than those of the observed inclination. We also probe the rotational symmetry of EVPA in the polarization structure of the black hole images by analyzing the coefficient $\beta_2$. The dilaton parameter results in that the real part $Re\beta_2$ increases and the imaginary part $Im\beta_2$ decreases, but the magnitude $|\beta_2|$ generally exhibits a declining trend. Finally, we find that effects of the disk thickness on $\beta_2$ are much weaker than those from the dilaton parameter.</description>

      <title>Study of Wormhole in $f(Q)$ gravity with some dark energy models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study discusses the development of some particular static wormhole models in the background of an extended $f(Q)$ gravity theory. Wormhole solutions are derived by considering the radial pressure to admit an equation of state corresponding to Chaplygin gas. The Chaplygin gas equation of state is taken into consideration in two different forms: $p_{r}=-\frac{Bb(r)^{u}}{\rho^{a}}$, $p_{r}=-\frac{B}{\rho^{a}}$. Wormhole models are also generated assuming that a variable barotropic fluid may explain the radial pressure given by $p_{r} =-\omega\rho b(r)^u$. For every model, the shape function $b(r)$ is the function that can be derived from the wormhole metric in any scenario. The stability analysis of the wormhole solutions and the shape function viability for each situation are then investigated.Since each wormhole model is shown to violate the null energy condition (NEC), it can be understood that these wormholes are traversable. More generally, we investigate whether the model is stable under the hydrostatic equilibrium state condition using the TOV equation.The physical characteristics of these models are shown under the same energy circumstances. The typical characteristic is the radial pressure $p_{r}$ near the wormhole throat, which violates the NEC $(\rho+P_{r} \geq0)$. In some models, it is possible to meet the NEC at the neck and yet violate the DEC $(\rho - P_{r}\geq0)$. In summary, precise wormhole models may be generated, provided that $(\rho\geq0)$, and there may be a potential breach of the NEC at the wormhole's throat.</description>

      <title>Spherical photon orbits around the Kerr-like black hole in Einstein-Bumblebee gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the photon orbits around a Kerr-like black hole in Einstein-Bumblebee gravity, where Lorentz symmetry is spontaneously broken. By solving the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, we derive a sixth-order polynomial that governs the photon motion, explicitly dependent on the rotation parameter $u$, the Lorentz violation parameter $\ell$, and the effective inclination angle $v$. We analyze photon orbit configurations in polar, equatorial, and general inclined planes, identifying significant deviations from the Kerr solution. In the polar and equatorial planes, we identify distinct photon orbit configurations and analyze their dependence on model parameters. For general inclined orbits, we find a critical inclination angle $v$ that determines the number and location of photon orbits in both extremal and non-extremal cases. All photon orbits are radially unstable, and the critical impact parameter decreases with increasing Lorentz violation, potentially providing observable signatures to differentiate Einstein-Bumblebee gravity from general relativity.</description>

      <title>In-depth analysis of violations of the (strong) equivalence principle in scalarized Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conducted a theoretical analysis of the violation of the equivalence principle within a broad class of scalar-Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theories that exhibit spontaneous scalarization. Beginning with the Jordan frame, we performed a conformal mapping to identify the equivalent model in the Einstein frame. This approach revealed that the Gauss-Bonnet coupling introduces a mixed term that links the Einstein tensor to the kinetic terms, along with an additional kinetic term associated with the box operator, echoing characteristics of Horndeski-like theories. Our findings confirm a violation of the weak equivalence principle, as the geodesic equation incorporates an extra term that, in the non-relativistic limit, leads to a modified Newtonian equation. This result was further corroborated using Eardley's methodology. We also examined the violation of the strong equivalence principle through the Nordtvedt effect within the framework of an extended parametrized post-Newtonian (PPN) formalism. We provide a concrete example of scalarized theories featuring extended PPN parameters that deviate from general relativity, comparing these results against observational constraints from the Cassini mission, the MESSENGER mission, and the Lunar Laser Ranging experiment. While the Cassini bounds remain the most stringent, the constraints on the Nordtvedt parameter offer significantly better restrictions on the parameter space than those derived from the precession rate of Mercury's perihelion.</description>

      <title>The Study on Modified Theories of General Relativity: A Differential Geometric Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The introduction of General Relativity (GR) in 1915 revolutionized our understanding of gravity, but over time, its limitations in explaining phenomena like dark energy, dark matter, and quantum gravity have motivated alternative theories. Early modifications, such as Weyl's 1919 proposal, focused on adding higher-order terms to the Einstein-Hilbert action. GR's non-renormalizability further strengthened the case for extending it. A central theme of modern gravity research is modifying the geometric structure, often by changing the gravitational Lagrangian. This leads to theories such as teleparallel and symmetric teleparallel gravity, utilizing torsion or non-Levi-Civita connections, with differential geometry providing the essential framework.
  This thesis explores several modified gravity models. Chapter 1 introduces necessary mathematical tools. Chapter 2 develops a novel parametrization of the deceleration parameter, constrained using MCMC and observational data, and applies it to f(Q) gravity. Chapter 3 embeds the LambdaCDM model into f(Q, L\_m) gravity with non-minimal coupling, producing analytic solutions and matching observations through cosmographic analysis. Chapter 4 considers Bianchi-I spacetime in f(R, L\_m) gravity with observational constraints to measure anisotropy. Chapter 5 presents wormhole solutions in f(Q, T) gravity with conformal symmetries. Chapter 6 explores wormholes in f(R, L\_m) with non-commutative geometry, analyzing shape functions, energy conditions, and stability. Chapter 7 studies Big Bang Nucleosynthesis in f(T) gravity, constraining hybrid models using early- and late-time data, and validating intermediate epochs via cosmography.</description>

      <title>Relativistic massive compact stars supported by decoupled matter: Implications for mass-radius bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The merger of binary neutron stars (BNSs) is a remarkable astrophysical event where all four fundamental forces interplay dynamically across multiple stages, producing a rich spectrum of multi-messenger signals. These observations present a significant multiphysics modeling challenge but also offer a unique opportunity to probe the nature of gravity and the strong nuclear interaction under extreme conditions. The landmark detection of GW170817 provided essential constraints on the properties of non-rotating neutron stars (NSs), including their maximum mass (M_{max}) and radius distribution, thereby informing the equation of state (EOS) of cold, dense nuclear matter. While the inspiral phase of such events has been extensively studied, the post-merger signal holds even greater potential to reveal the behavior of matter at supranuclear densities, particularly in scenarios involving a transition to deconfined quark matter. Motivated by the recent gravitational wave event GW190814 (2.5-2.67 M_{\odot}), we revisit the modeling of high-mass compact stars to investigate their internal structure via a generalized polytropic EOS. This framework incorporates a modified energy density profile and is coupled with the TOV equations. We explore mass-radius (M-R) relationships within both GR and the minimal geometric deformation (MGD) approach. Specifically, we constrain the radii of four massive compact objects PSR J1614-2230 (1.97^{+0.04}_{-0.04}\,M_{\odot}), PSR J0952-0607 (2.35^{+0.17}_{-0.17}\,M_\odot), GW190814 (2.5-2.67\,M_\odot), and GW200210 (2.83^{+0.47}_{-0.42}\,M_\odot) and demonstrate that our theoretical M-R curves are consistent with observational data. These findings provide meaningful constraints on the EOS and underscore the potential of alternative gravity models to accommodate ultra-massive compact stars within a physically consistent framework.</description>

      <title>Growth Rate Analysis in $f(R,L_m)$ Gravity: A Comparative Study with \boldmath$\Lambda$CDM Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of cosmic structures within the framework of modified gravity, specifically focusing on theories described by the function $f(R, L_m)$, where $R$ is the Ricci scalar and $L_m$ is the matter Lagrangian. This class of models introduces a non-minimal coupling between geometry and matter, leading to modifications in the dynamics of density perturbations. We derive the linear growth equation and compute the observable growth rate $f\sigma_8(z)$, which is directly accessible from redshift-space distortion (RSD) data. Using recent observational constraints from galaxy surveys such as eBOSS and DESI, we perform a comparative analysis between predictions from $f(R, L_m)$ gravity and the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Our results indicate that while $\Lambda$CDM remains broadly consistent with current data, the $f(R, L_m)$ framework can accommodate subtle deviations in structure growth, offering a possible resolution to existing tensions in large-scale structure observations. We also outline the implications of our findings for future surveys, including Euclid and LSST.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Hole Ringdown: the Irreducible Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Independently from the formation mechanism of primordial black holes in the early universe, their generation is accompanied by a ringdown phase during which they relax to a stationary configuration and gravitational waves under the form of quasinormal modes are emitted. Such gravitational waves generate an irreducible and unavoidable stochastic background which is testable by current and future experiments. In particular, the presence of a primordial black hole ringdown allows to significantly constrain the idea of extremely supermassive black holes to comprise the entire dark matter of the universe.</description>

      <title>Inflaton perturbations through an Ultra-Slow Roll transition and Hamilton-Jacobi attractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the behaviour of the gauge invariant scalar field perturbations in an analytic inflationary model that transitions from slow roll to an ultra-slow roll (USR) phase. We find that the numerical solution of the Mukhanov-Sasaki equation is well described by Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) theory, as long as the appropriate branches of the Hamilton-Jacobi solutions are invoked: Modes that exit the horizon during the slow roll phase evolve into the USR as described by the first HJ branch, up to a subdominant $\mathcal{O}(k^2/H^2)$ correction to the Hamilton-Jacobi prediction for their final amplitude that we compute, indicating the influence of neglected gradient terms. Modes that exit during the USR phase are described by a separate HJ branch (very close to de Sitter) once they become sufficiently superhorizon, obtained by the shift $\epsilon_2 \rightarrow \tilde{\epsilon}_2\simeq \epsilon_2+6$. This transition is similar to the conveyor belt concept put forward in our previous work [1] and the intuition deriving from it. We further discuss implications for the validity of the stochastic equations arising from the Hamilton-Jacobi formulation. We conclude that if appropriately used, the Hamilton-Jacobi attractors can describe the dynamics of long wavelength inflationary inhomogeneities beyond slow roll.</description>

      <title>Periapsis shift in the Zipoy-Voorhees spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the periapsis shift of timelike bound orbits in the Zipoy-Voorhees spacetime, which is an exact, static, axisymmetric, and vacuum solution characterized by the deformation parameter $\gamma$, including the Schwarzschild spacetime as $\gamma=1$. We derive both the exact formula for the periapsis shift of a quasi-circular orbit and the formula for the periapsis shift by the post-Newtonian (PN) expansion. We show that the periapsis shift in the Zipoy-Voorhees spacetime for $1/11 &lt; \gamma \leq 1/5$ is the same as in the Schwarzschild spacetime to the 2PN order if $e=\sqrt{(\gamma^{-1}-5)/6}$, where $e$ is the eccentricity of the orbit. Furthermore, we show that the parameter $\gamma$ and the corresponding quadrupole moment $\tilde{M}_2$ of the supermassive compact object at Sagittarius A* are constrained to $\gamma \gtrsim 1.7 \times 10^{-2}$ and $\tilde{M}_2 \lesssim 1.2 \times 10^3$, respectively, from observational data on S2 using the obtained PN expansion formula. Finally, we derive a new series representation for the periapsis shift in the Zipoy-Voorhees spacetime using a recently proposed prescription, which shows fast convergence not only in the weak-field regime but also for small eccentricity.</description>

Abstract: We present stationary and axially-symmetric black hole solutions to the Einstein field equations sourced by an anisotropic fluid, describing rotating black holes embedded in astrophysical environments. We compute their physical properties, including quantities associated with the circular geodesics of massless and massive particles, analyze their shadows and image features, and energy conditions. Overall, we find that deviations from the Kerr metric grow with spin.</description>

      <title>Optimal Detection Bands for Intermediate-Mass Black Hole Binaries: Prospects for LISA and AMIGO in General Relativity and $f(R, T)$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a semi analytic forecast for the detection of intermediate mass black hole (IMBH) binaries with the space based detectors LISA (millihertz band) and AMIGO (deci hertz band). A redshift dependent population model is built from extrapolated black hole mass functions and realistic pairing and merger time scales. Folding this population through the instrument sensitivities yields event rates of about 1e4 mergers for LISA in four observing years and between 1e2 and 1e3 mergers for AMIGO in three years, with complementary optimal detection bands in total mass and redshift.
  We then incorporate the minimal matter coupled modified gravity model f(R,T) = R + 2 lambda T. In this scenario the strain amplitude is rescaled by (1 - lambda / 8 pi)^(5/6) while the waveform phasing is unchanged at leading order. For Solar System compatible couplings abs(lambda) &lt;= 2 x 10^-3, the peak detection redshift shifts by less than one percent and the total number of events changes by less than five percent. Combined statistics from LISA and AMIGO therefore provide a consistency check on f(R,T) gravity without spoiling standard IMBH forecasts.</description>

      <title>A multi-parameter expansion for the evolution of asymmetric binaries in astrophysical environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compact binaries with large mass asymmetries - such as Extreme and Intermediate Mass Ratio Inspirals - are unique probes of the astrophysical environments in which they evolve. Their long-lived and intricate dynamics allow for precise inference of source properties, provided waveform models are accurate enough to capture the full complexity of their orbital evolution. In this work, we develop a multi-parameter formalism, inspired by vacuum perturbation theory, to model asymmetric binaries embedded in general matter distributions with both radial and tangential pressures. In the regime of small deviations from the Schwarzschild metric, relevant to most astrophysical scenarios, the system admits a simplified description, where both metric and fluid perturbations can be cast into wave equations closely related to those of the vacuum case. This framework offers a practical approach to modeling the dynamics and the gravitational wave emission from binaries in realistic matter distributions, and can be modularly integrated with existing results for vacuum sources.</description>

      <title>Suppressed Intrinsic Curvature Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider various mechanisms of modifying the effect of intrinsic curvature in gravity with respect to general relativity. Two primary approaches are studied. First, by considering a Lagrange multiplier or an auxiliary field. Second, by non-minimal coupling between a scalar field and the intrinsic curvature scalar. We reproduce the basic solutions of FLRW cosmology, black hole solutions, Lense-Thirring effect, and gravitational waves. The speed of gravitational waves is modified in comparison to the speed of light. A certain limit of our theory corresponds to the lowest-order Carroll gravity. Hence, our theory is a different UV completion of Carroll gravity, compared to the usual expansion of a small speed of light. Carroll gravity limit also has an enhanced symmetry, making the reduced or vanishing extrinsic curvature technically natural. Although the intrinsic curvature and its modification may depend on the foliation, we use the covariant formalism and show that such a foliation always exists. Perhaps the most important outcome is that in the non-minimal coupling approach, the intrinsic curvature appearing in Einstein's field equations can defer from the one appearing in the geodesic equation potentially leading to important observational consequences.</description>

      <title>Effective Equation of State Oscillations at Matter-Radiation Equality and Primordial Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory controlling the Universe's evolution in the classical regime has to be motivated by particle physics reasoning and should also generate inflation and dark energy eras in a unified way. One such framework is $F(R)$ gravity. In this work we examine a class of exponential deformations of $R^2$ gravity motivated by fundamental physics of scalaron evolution in a de Sitter background. As we show this class of models describe both inflation and the dark energy era in a viable way compatible with the Planck constraints on inflation and the cosmological parameters. Regarding the inflationary era, the exponentially deformed $R^2$ model also yields a rescaled Einstein-Hilbert term which remarkably does not affect the dynamics and the inflationary evolution is identical to that of an $R^2$ model. The dark energy era is also found to be viable and mimics the $\Lambda$-Cold-Dark-Matter model. More importantly, this class of $F(R)$ gravity exponential $R^2$ deformations also has an important characteristic, and specifically it yields total equation of state oscillations deeply in the matter domination era, for redshifts $z\sim 3400$, so near the matter-radiation equality. These total equation of state deformations at such a large redshift may directly affect the energy spectrum of the primordial gravitational waves. Indeed as we show, the effect is measurable and it leads to an enhancement of the tensor perturbations energy spectrum for low frequencies probed by the future LiteBIRD mission. This enhancement might have a measurable effect on the $B$-modes of the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation and thus may be detectable by the LiteBIRD mission. Only a handful of theoretical frameworks can generate the gravitational wave pattern generated by the class of exponentially deformed $R^2$ models we presented.</description>

      <title>Geodesic completeness, curvature singularities and infinite tidal forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report some new findings regarding the subtle relations among geodesic completeness, curvature singularities and tidal forces. It is well known that any particle may be torn up near a singularity at the center of a black hole due to the divergent tidal force. However, we find that singularity is not the only cause of tidal force divergence. Even on the surface of the Earth, the tidal force experienced by a particle could be arbitrarily large if the particle moves arbitrarily close to the speed of light in a nonradial direction. Usually, a curvature singularity implies geodesic incompleteness since in many cases the metric cannot be defined at the location of the singularity. Counterexamples have been found in recent years, suggesting that geodesics could pass through curvature singularities. By taking into account the fact that any real particle is an extended body, we calculate the tidal force acting on the particle in a static and spherically symmetric spacetime. We explicitly show that an infinite tidal force always occurs near such a singularity. Therefore, no particle can actually reach the curvature singularity even if the metric is well defined at that point. We also show that the tidal acceleration along a null geodesic at the coordinate origin is divergent. For a wormhole solution that has a curvature singularity at the throat but possesses a regular metric, we show that the tidal force on any particle passing through the throat is divergent.</description>

      <title>Improved Binary Black Hole Search Discriminator from the Singular Value Decomposition of Non-Gaussian Noise Transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sensitivity of current gravitational wave (GW) detectors to transient GW signals is severely affected by a variety of non-Gaussian and non-stationary noise transients, such as the blip and tomte "glitches". These glitches share some time-frequency resemblance with GW signals from massive binary black holes. In earlier works [Joshi et al., Phys. Rev. D 103, 044035 (2021); Choudhary et al., Phys. Rev. D 110, 044051 (2024)], the authors presented a method for constructing a $\chi^2$-distributed optimized statistic, based on the unified formalism of $\chi^2$ discriminators [Dhurandhar et al., Phys. Rev. D 96, 103018 (2017)], to distinguish the blip and tomte glitches from the compact binary coalescence (CBC) signals. Unlike past works, the new $\chi^2$ discriminator is constructed from the most significant singular vectors obtained from the singular-value decomposition (SVD) of glitches in real detector data. We find that the chi-square developed in this work performs as efficiently as in Choudhary et al. [Phys. Rev. D 110, 044051 (2024)], which used sine-Gaussian basis vectors. This result supports past empirical findings that the blips and tomtes are well-modeled by sine-Gaussians. It also introduces a method for constructing signal- and glitch-based $\chi^2$ discriminators by directly using real data containing the glitches and, thus, holds promise for extensions to glitches that are captured less well by sine-Gaussians or other analytical functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong self-gravitational fields enable the realization of macroscopic odd-parity quantum objects. Using ray-tracing methods, we systematically analyze the shadow features of rotating black holes with parity-odd scalar hair and contrast them with those of Kerr black holes. Our results demonstrate measurable distinctions between scalar-haired black hole shadows and their Kerr counterparts. Notably, even for tiny scalar charge and negligible scalar hair mass contributions, these differences remain quantitatively resolvable. These findings provide critical theoretical benchmarks for future observational campaigns targeting scalar-field dark matter candidates through black hole shadow imaging.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Topology of Black Holes within Tsallis Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the thermodynamic topology of black holes within the framework of Tsallis statistics. By integrating Tsallis non-extensive statistics with topological thermodynamics, we analyze the local and global stability of various black hole solutions, including Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordstrom, and higher-dimensional black holes. The introduction of Tsallis entropy, parameterized by the non-extensive parameter delta, results in distinct thermodynamic behaviors depending on its value. Employing Duan's phi-mapping theory, we classify the thermodynamic topology of four-dimensional Schwarzschild black holes and non-charged higher-dimensional black holes into three distinct classes based on their topological number W: stable (W = +1), unstable (W = -1), and critical (W = 0). Additionally, the thermodynamic topology of Reissner-Nordstrom and charged higher-dimensional black holes is categorized into two classes, where W = +1 indicates a stable class and W = 0 represents a less stable class. Our study further demonstrates that the number of dimensions does not affect the topological thermodynamics within the context of non-extensive statistics. This approach provides novel insights into the interplay between Tsallis statistics and black hole thermodynamics, underscoring the pivotal role of topology in understanding black hole physics.</description>

      <title>Science of the LISA mission: A Summary for the European Strategy for Particle Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The LISA mission is an international collaboration between ESA, its member states, and NASA, for the detection of gravitational waves from space. It was adopted in January 2024 and is scheduled for launch in the mid-2030's. It will be a constellation of three identical spacecraft forming a near-equilateral triangle in an heliocentric orbit, transferring laser beams over $2.5 \cdot 10^6$ km long arms. Laser interferometry is used to track separations between test masses, thus measuring spacetime strain variations as a function of time. LISA Science Objectives tackle many open questions in astrophysics, fundamental physics and cosmology, including ESA's Cosmic Vision questions "What are the fundamental laws of the universe?" and "How did the universe originate and of what is it made?". In this contribution, based on the LISA Red Book, we present a summary of the LISA Science Objectives relevant for the European Strategy for Particle Physics.</description>

      <title>Regular Magnetically Charged Black Holes from Nonlinear Electrodynamics: Thermodynamics, Light Deflection, and Orbital Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamic properties, light deflection, and orbital dynamics of regular magnetically charged black holes (NRCBHs) arising from nonlinear electrodynamics (NED) coupled to general relativity. The metric function $f(r)$ ensures complete regularity at the origin while maintaining asymptotic flatness, with the extremal magnetic charge limit reaching $q_{\text{ext}} \approx 2.54M$, significantly exceeding the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m value. Using the quantum tunneling framework, we derive the Hawking temperature and incorporate generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) corrections, showing $T_{\text{GUP}} = (f'(r_h)/4\pi)\sqrt{1-2\beta m_p^2}$. The weak deflection of light is analyzed through the Gauss-Bonnet theorem (GBT), revealing charge-dependent behavior where large $q$ values lead to negative deflection angles due to electromagnetic repulsion. Plasma effects further modify the deflection through the refractive index $n(r) = \sqrt{1 - \omega_p^2(r)f(r)/\omega_0^2}$. Keplerian motion analysis demonstrates that the angular velocity $\Omega(r)$ exhibits charge-sensitive maxima related to quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in accretion disks. Finally, we examine Joule-Thomson expansion (JTE) properties, finding that the coefficient $\mu_J$ indicates cooling behavior for higher charges and larger event horizons. Our results provide comprehensive insights into the observational signatures of NRCBHs, with implications for gravitational lensing, X-ray astronomy, and tests of nonlinear electromagnetic theories in strong gravitational fields.</description>

Abstract: A new class of exact spacetimes in Einstein's gravity, which are Kerr black holes immersed in an external magnetic (or electric) field that is asymptotically uniform and oriented along the rotational axis, is presented. These are axisymmetric stationary solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell equations such that the null directions of the Faraday tensor are not aligned with neither of the two principal null directions of the Weyl tensor of algebraic type D (unlike the Kerr-Melvin spacetime). Three physical parameters are the black hole mass $m$, its rotation $a$, and the external field value $B$. For vanishing $B$ the metric directly reduces to standard Boyer-Lindquist form of the Kerr black hole, while for zero $m$ we recover conformally flat Bertotti-Robinson universe with a uniform Maxwell field. For zero $a$ the spacetime is contained in the Van den Bergh-Carminati solution which can be understood as the Schwarzschild black hole in a magnetic field. Our family of black holes with non-aligned Maxwell hair - that can be called the Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson (Kerr-BR) black holes - may find application in various studies ranging from mathematical relativity to relativistic astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Interacting Scalar Fields as Dark Energy and Dark Matter in Einstein scalar Gauss Bonnet Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Gauss-Bonnet (GB) coupled scalar field $\phi$, responsible for the late-time cosmic acceleration and interacting with a coherent scalar field $\psi$ through an interaction potential $W(\phi,\psi)$, is considered from the point of view of particle physics for two different models. The non-minimal coupling between the GB curvature term and the field $\phi$ leads to a time-dependent speed of gravitational waves (GWs), which is fixed to unity in order to be consistent with current GW observations, rendering the GB coupling function model-independent. We investigate the dynamical stability of the system by formulating it in the form of an autonomous system, and constrain the model parameters using various sets of observational data. We find that both models are physically viable and closely follow the $\Lambda$CDM trend. We also use the updated Roman mock high redshift data to further constrain the parameters of the two models.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Subtraction with Neural Density Estimators as a General Solution to Overlapping Gravitational Wave Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Overlapping gravitational wave (GW) signals are expected in the third-generation (3G) GW detectors, leading to one of the major challenges in GW data analysis. Inference of overlapping GW sources is complicated - it has been reported that hierarchical inference with signal subtraction may amplify errors, while joint estimation, though more accurate, is computationally expensive. However, in this work, we show that hierarchical subtraction can achieve accurate results with a sufficient number of iterations, and on the other hand, neural density estimators, being able to generate posterior samples rapidly, make it possible to perform signal subtraction and inference repeatedly. We further develop likelihood-based resampling to accelerate the convergence of the iterative subtraction. Our method provides fast and accurate inference for overlapping GW signals and is highly adaptable to various source types and time separations, offering a potential general solution for overlapping GW signal analysis.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Dark Energies and Compact Objects in 4D Einstein Gauss Bonnet Gravity induced Universe A Data Based Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic evolution is the most sensational topic among researchers of modern cosmology. This article explores cosmic evolution in 4D Einstein Gauss Bonnet (EGB) gravity, focusing on mass accretion of compact objects (black holes and wormholes) by dark energy (DE). Three DE models Chevallier Polarski Linder (CPL), Jassal Bagla Padmanabhan (JBP), and Barboza Alcaniz (BA) parameterizations are studied within 4D EGB gravity, with their Hubble parameters derived and compared against observational data (Cosmic Chronometers, Type Ia Supernovae, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, and CMB). Bayesian analysis favors the CPL and BA models, with CPL providing the best fit. For black holes, mass accretion of CPL and JBP DE shows transitions between quintessence and phantom eras, while BA and LambdaCDM strictly exhibit quintessence-like behavior, driving cosmic acceleration. In contrast, wormholes exhibit the opposite trend, favoring a phantom-dominated era for the BA and LambdaCDM models. The study highlights the dynamic nature of DE in 4D EGB gravity and its role in cosmic expansion.</description>

      <title>Towards a consistent Semiclassical Theory of Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We argue that semiclassical gravity can be rendered consistent by assuming that quantum systems only emit a gravitational field when they interact with a stable determination chain (SDCs), which are specific chains of interactions modeled via decoherence and test functions obeying a set of conditions. When systems are disconnected from SDCs, they do not emit a gravitational field. This denies the universality of gravity, while upholding a version of the equivalence principle. We argue that this theory can be tested by experiments that investigate the gravitational field emitted by isolated systems like in gravcats experiments or by investigating the gravitational interactions between entangled systems like in the (Bose-Marletto-Vedral) BMV experiment. Our theory fits into a new framework which holds that in the absence of certain conditions, quantum systems cannot emit a gravitational field. There are many possible conditions for systems to emit a gravitational field, and we will adopt a subset of them. We will show how this subset of conditions provides multiple benefits beyond rendering semiclassical gravity consistent, which includes deriving the value of the cosmological constant from first principles and providing an explanation for why the vacuum does not gravitate.</description>

      <title>Twisted echoes of an odd quartet: Scalar-induced gravitational waves as a probe of primordial parity-violation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parity-violation leaves tell-tale trails in many cosmological observables. We illustrate parity-odd primordial scalar trispectra, that despite being of modest strength, impart detectable chirality to scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGW). This allows us to impose strong bounds on the parity-odd part of trispectrum. Over certain scales, we find SIGW directly quantify parity-violation in primordial non-Gaussianity, unobscured by the Gaussian contribution. Our results call for treatment of SIGW and parity-odd trispectrum as complementary predictions of parity-violating theories.</description>

      <title>Evolving Dark Sector and the Dark Dimension Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: String theory naturally leads to the expectation that dark energy is not stable, and may be evolving as captured by the Swampland de Sitter conjectures. Moreover, motivated by the distance conjecture a unification of dark sector has been proposed, where the smallness of dark energy leads to one extra dimension of micron size with dark matter being the KK graviton excitations in this extra dimension. We consider the natural possibility that the radius of the dark dimension varies as the dark energy decreases, leading to the variation of the dark matter mass. This correlates the decrease of the dark energy with the variation of the dark matter mass as they depend on the variations of a scalar field $\phi$ controlling the radius of the extra dimension. A simple realization of this idea for small range of $\phi$ is captured by choosing a potential which is locally of the form $V=V_0\ {\rm exp}(-c\phi)$ and dark matter mass $m_{\rm DM}=m_0\ {\rm exp}(-c' \phi)$ where the sign of $\phi$ is chosen such that $c'\geq 0$ while we have two choices for the sign of $c$ depending on whether the dark dimension expands or shrinks when the dark energy dominates. We find excellent agreement with recent experimental data from DESI DR2 combined with SN measurements and reproduces the same significance as CPL parametrization with the added benefit of providing a natural explanation for the apparent phantom behavior ($w&lt;-1$) reported by DESI and DES based on a physical model. Regardless of the SN dataset, there is a preference for non-zero values of $c'$ and $c$ that are in the expected $O(1)$ range in Planck units as suggested by the Swampland criteria. In particular, there is a remarkable consistency with $c'\simeq 0.05 \pm 0.01$ for all dataset combinations including SN, and close to the experimental upper bound of $c'\lesssim 0.2$ demanded by the lack of detection of fifth force in the dark sector.</description>

      <title>An Open System Approach to Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several major open problems in cosmology, including the nature of inflation, dark matter, and dark energy, share a common structure: they involve spacetime-filling media with unknown microphysics, and can be probed so far only through their gravitational effects. This observation motivates a systematic open-system approach to cosmology, in which gravity evolves in the presence of a generic, unobservable environment. In this work, we develop a general framework for open gravitational dynamics based on general relativity and the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism, carefully addressing the nontrivial constraints imposed by diffeomorphism invariance. At the quantum level, our path integral formulation computes the gravitational density matrix in perturbation theory around a semi-classical spacetime.
  As illustrative applications, we study inflation and the propagation of gravitational waves in classical regimes where environmental interactions are non-negligible. In the inflationary context, our framework reproduces the known Open Effective Field Theory of Inflation in the decoupling limit and extends it to include gravitational interactions. For gravitational waves, we derive the most general conservative and dissipative corrections to propagation. Remarkably, we find that the leading-order gravitational birefringence is dissipative in nature, whereas conservative birefringence appears only at higher derivative order, opposite to the electromagnetic case. Our results pave the way to modeling dissipative effects in the late universe.</description>

      <title>Inferring the neutron star equation of state with nuclear-physics informed semiparametric models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past decade, an abundance of information from neutron-star observations, nuclear experiments and theory has transformed our efforts to elucidate the properties of dense matter. However, at high densities relevant to the cores of neutron stars, substantial uncertainty about the dense matter equation of state (EoS) remains. In this work, we present a semiparametric EoS framework aimed at better integrating knowledge across these domains in astrophysical inference. We use a Meta-model at low densities, and Gaussian Process extensions at high densities. Comparisons between our semiparametric framework to fully nonparametric EoS representations show that imposing nuclear theoretical and experimental constraints through the Meta-model up to nuclear saturation density results in constraints on the pressure up to twice nuclear saturation density. We show that our Gaussian Process trained on EoS models with nucleonic, hyperonic, and quark compositions extends the range of EoS explored at high density compared to a piecewise polytropic extension schema, under the requirements of causality of matter and of supporting the existence of heavy pulsars. We find that maximum TOV masses above $3.2 M_{\odot}$ can be supported by causal EoS compatible with nuclear constraints at low densities. We then combine information from existing observations of heavy pulsar masses, gravitational waves from binary neutron star mergers, and X-ray pulse profile modeling of millisecond pulsars within a Bayesian inference scheme using our semiparametric EoS prior. With current astrophysical observations, we find a favored pressure at two times nuclear saturation density of $P(2\rho_{\rm nuc}) = 1.98^{+2.13}_{-1.08}\times10^{34}$ dyn/cm$^{2}$, a radius of a $1.4 M_{\odot}$ neutron star value of $R_{1.4} = 11.4^{+0.98}_{-0.60}$\;km, and $M_{\rm max} = 2.31_{-0.23}^{+0.35} M_{\odot}$ at the 90\% credible level.</description>

An upper bound for the genus of stable surfaces in the electrostatic system is provided. We also study the positivity for the charged Hawking mass of a minimal surface with index one in the electrostatic space-times. A criterion for a CMC surface in the Reissner-Nordstrom deSitter space to be stable is presented.</description>

      <title>Quantum Transparency of Near-extremal Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the scattering of electromagnetic and gravitational waves off a Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole in the low-temperature regime where the near-horizon throat experiences large quantum fluctuations. We find that the black hole is transparent to electromagnetic and gravitational radiation below a certain frequency threshold. This phenomenon arises because the angular momentum of the black hole is quantized, creating an energy gap between the spinless black hole state and the first excited spinning states. Radiation with angular momentum -- such as photons, gravitons, and partial waves of a massless scalar field, which we also study -- must supply enough energy to bridge this gap to be absorbed. Below this threshold, no absorption can occur, rendering the black hole transparent. For frequencies above the gap, the scarcity of black hole states continues to suppress the absorption cross-section relative to semiclassical predictions, making the black hole translucent rather than completely transparent. Notably, electromagnetic absorption is significantly stronger than gravitational absorption, beyond what differences in spin alone would suggest.</description>

      <title>Bimetric gravity improves the fit to DESI BAO and eases the Hubble tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate whether the latest combination of DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements, cosmic microwave background (CMB) data (Planck 2018 + ACT), and Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) compilations (Pantheon+, Union3, and DES Y5) favor a dynamical dark energy component, and explore if such a scenario can simultaneously help resolve the Hubble tension. We contrast two frameworks: the widely used phenomenological $w_0 w_a$CDM model, and bimetric gravity, a fundamental modification of general relativity that naturally gives rise to phantom dark energy. The $w_0 w_a$CDM model is moderately preferred over $\Lambda$CDM, at the $2$-$4 \, \sigma$ level, when fitting DESI DR2 + CMB + SNe Ia, but it exacerbates the Hubble tension. By comparison, bimetric gravity provides a modest improvement in fit quality, at the $1 \, \sigma$ level, but, by inferring $H_0 = 69.0 \pm 0.4 \, \mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$, it partially eases the Hubble tension, from a $5 \,\sigma$ discrepancy to a $3.7 \, \sigma$ tension. Including locally calibrated SNe Ia brings the overall preference for the bimetric model over $\Lambda$CDM to the $2 \, \sigma$ level, comparable to that of the $w_0 w_a$CDM model when including the local SN Ia calibration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a non-Hermitian model with gain/loss and non-reciprocal next-nearest-neighbor hopping that emulates black-hole physics. The model describes a one-dimensional lattice with a smooth connection between regions with distinct hopping parameters. By mapping the system to an effective Schwarzschild metric in the Painlev\'e-Gullstrand coordinates, we find that the interface is analogue to a black-hole event horizon. We obtain emission rates for particles and antiparticles, the Hawking temperature, the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, and the mass of the analogue black hole as a function of the interface sharpness and the system parameters. An experimental realization of the theoretical model is proposed, thus opening the way to the detection of elusive black-hole features.</description>

      <title>Gauging the Schwarzian Action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we promote the global $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ symmetry of the Schwarzian derivative to a local gauge symmetry. To achieve this, we develop a procedure that potentially can be generalized beyond the $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ case: We first construct a composite field from the fundamental field and its derivative such that it transforms linearly under the group action. Then we write down its gauge-covariant extension and apply standard gauging techniques. Applying this to the fractional linear representation of $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$, we obtain the gauge-invariant analogue of the Schwarzian derivative as a bilinear invariant of covariant derivatives of the composite field. The framework enables a simple construction of N\"other charges associated with the original global symmetry. The gauge-invariant Schwarzian action introduces $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ gauge potentials, allowing for locally invariant couplings to additional fields, such as fermions. While these potentials can be gauged away on topologically trivial domains, non-trivial topologies (e.g., $S^1$) lead to distinct topological sectors. We mention that in the context of two-dimensional gravity, these sectors could correspond to previously discussed quantized defects in the bulk theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the dynamics of pure scalar fields rolling on an exponential potential in the absence of any additional background fluid and demonstrate the existence of self-tracking solutions in which the self-perturbations of the scalar field act as an effective radiation background. The validity of these solutions is demonstrated through both analytic techniques and numerical simulations using CosmoLattice. We discuss applications to string cosmologies with significant trans-Planckian field excursions between inflation and BBN, including the required initial level of scalar perturbations to avoid overshoot.</description>

      <title>Superrotations are Linkages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that superrotations can be described using the geometric conformal completion method of Penrose. In particular, superrotation charges can be described and calculated using the linkage method of Geroch and Winicour.
  Whether superrotation charges are calculated using the coordinate based Bondi formalism or the geometric Penrose formalism, the fact that the superrotation blows up at a point makes the superrotation charge formally ill defined. Nonetheless, we show that it can be made well defined through a regularization procedure devised by Flanagan and Nichols.</description>

      <title>Particle Production Scenario in an Algebraically Coupled Quintessence Field with a Dark Matter Fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10215v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of an algebraically coupled quintessence field with a dark matter fluid, focusing on particle production through the action principle via a modified interaction Lagrangian. The interaction parameter serves as the source of dark matter particle production and entropy generation. As particle creation occurs due to the interaction between the field and fluid sectors, the system exhibits additional pressure. Our analysis includes studying the system's dynamics by considering an exponential type of interaction corresponding to the field's exponential potential. We assess the system's background dynamics using the dynamical system stability technique to derive the constraints on the model parameters. Additionally, we determine the best-fit values of the model parameters against two combinations of data sets: (i) CC+Pantheon+SH0ES, and (ii) CC+Pantheon+SH0ES+SDSS BAO+ DESI BAO. By employing a comprehensive data analysis technique, we compare the evidence of our models to flat $\Lambda$CDM. Based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), one of the models emerges as a robust alternative to $\Lambda$CDM when considering the joint data sets.</description>

      <title>Echoes and quasi-normal modes of perturbations around Schwarzchild traversable wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00377v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the waveforms and quasi-normal modes around Schwarzschild traversable wormholes under different field perturbations, including the scalar field, the electromagnetic (vector) field, and the axial gravitational (tensor) field perturbations. Our results indicate that under the influence of the matter at the throat of the wormhole, a Dirac $\delta$-function distribution of matter appears in the effective potentials of the scalar and axial gravitational perturbations and it affects the propagation of these two types of perturbations in spacetime. However, the matter at the throat has no influence on the propagation of electromagnetic perturbations. Furthermore, we quantify the impact of throat matter on both the perturbation waveforms and quasi-normal modes for all three field types. Through comparative studies between Schwarzschild traversable wormholes and Schwarzschild black holes, we identify two distinct features. Firstly, the perturbation waveforms exhibit echoes and damping oscillations around wormholes, whereas they solely display damping oscillations around black holes. Secondly, the difference between the adjacent peaks varies with the mass parameter and the throat radial coordinate in the waveform around Schwarzschild traversable wormholes, while a constant peak spacing occurs, which is determined solely by mass, in the waveform around Schwarzschild black holes. Based on these findings, we propose a framework to estimate the mass parameter and throat radial coordinate of Schwarzschild traversable wormholes through waveforms and quasi-normal modes. Our analyses provide a more profound comprehension of the inherent characteristics of Schwarzschild traversable wormholes.</description>

      <title>Gravitational field and lensing of a circular chiral vorton</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05270v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the metric of a circular chiral vorton in the weak field limit. The object is self-supporting by means of its chiral current. A conical singularity with deficit angle, identical to that of straight string with the same linear mass density, is present at the vorton's core. We find that the metric is akin to the electromagnetic $4$-potential of a circular current wire loop, illustrating the concept of gravito-electromagnetism. Surprisingly we find that the solution asymptotically mimics a Kerr-like naked singularity with mass $M_v=4\pi R\mu$ and spin parameter $a=R/2$. Finally, we also simulate the gravitational lensing images by solving the corresponding null geodesic equations. This reveals interesting properties of the images, such as the simultaneous creation of a minimally distorted source image and its Einstein ring, as well as the formation of double images on the back side of the ring.</description>

      <title>What happens to topological invariants (and black holes) in singularity-free theories?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11450v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Potentials arising in ultraviolet-completed field theories can be devoid of singularities, and hence render spacetimes simply connected. This challenges the notion of topological invariants considered in such scenarios. We explore the classical implications for (i) electrodynamics in flat spacetime, (ii) ultrarelativistic gyratonic solutions of weak-field gravity, and (iii)the Reissner--Nordstr\"om black hole in general relativity. In linear theories, regularity spoils the character of topological invariants and leads to radius-dependent Aharonov--Bohm phases, which are potentially observable for large winding numbers. In general relativity, the physics is richer: The electromagnetic field can be regular and maintain its usual topological invariants, and the resulting geometry can be interpreted as a Reissner--Nordstr\"om black hole with a spacetime region of coordinate radius $\sim q^2/(GM)$ cut out. This guarantees the regularity of linear and quadratic curvature invariants ($\mathcal{R}$ and $\mathcal{R}^2$), but does not resolve singularities in invariants such as $\mathcal{R}^p\Box^n \mathcal{R}^q$, reflected by conical or solid angle defects. This motivates that gravitational models beyond general relativity need to be considered. These connections between regularity (= UV properties of field theories) and topological invariants (= IR observables) may hence present an intriguing avenue to search for traces of new physics and identify promising modified gravity theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16243v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the scalar and tensor modes of the gravitational perturbation in the presence of a scalar field which describes inflation. We investigate the back-reaction of the perturbations to the background by studying the effective energy-momentum tensor (2EMT) which is the second order constructed by the quadratic terms of the linear perturbations. 2EMT is gauge dependent due to the scalar mode. We obtain 2EMT in the slow-roll stage of inflation, and get its cosmological expressions in three (longitudinal, spatially flat, and comoving) gauge conditions. We find that the pure scalar-mode part in 2EMT is stronger in the short-wavelength limit, while the parts involved with the tensor mode (the pure tensor-mode part and the scalar-tensor coupled part) are stronger in the long-wavelength limit.</description>

Abstract: Spherically symmetric geometrodynamics is studied for scalar-tensor theory and Einstein General Relativity minimally coupled to a scalar field. We discussed the importance of boundary terms and derived the equations of motion in the Hamiltonian canonical formalism both in the Jordan and Einstein frames. These two frames are connected through an Hamiltonian canonical transformation on the reduced phase space obtained gauge-fixing the lapse and the radial shift functions. We discussed the effects of the singularity of the Hamiltonian canonical transformation connecting Jordan and Einstein frames for two static solutions (Fisher, Janis, Newman and Winicour solution in the Einstein frame and Bocharova-Bronnikov-Melnikov-Bekenstein black hole solution in the Jordan frame).</description>

      <title>Avoiding Big Rip Singularities in Phantom Scalar Field theory with Gauss-Bonnet term</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a phantom scalar field coupled to the Gauss-Bonnet scalar within a spatially flat FLRW geometry. Moreover, we assume a nonzero interaction between the scalar field and the matter term. We perform a detailed phase space analysis using two sets of dimensionless variables. Specifically, we introduce dimensionless variables based on the Hubble normalization approach and a new set based on the matter-scalar field normalization. These two sets of variables allow for a comprehensive phase space analysis. This model supports inflationary solutions without the Big Rip or Big Crunch singularities appearing as asymptotic solutions. This outcome is attributed to the presence of the Gauss-Bonnet scalar. The result remains valid even in the absence of the interaction term.</description>

Abstract: We derive formulae that resum, at a given order in the soft limit, the infinite series of Post-Minkowskian (small gravitational coupling) or Post-Newtonian (small velocities) corrections to the gravitational waveform produced by particles moving along a general (open or closed) trajectory in the Schwarzschild geometry in the probe limit. Specifying to the case of circular orbits, we compute the waveform and the energy flux to order 30PN, and compare it against the available results in the literature. Our results are based on a novel hypergeometric representation of the solutions of the Heun equation (and its confluence), that leads to a simple mathematical proof of the Heun connection formula.</description>

      <title>Investigating the shadows of new regular black holes with a Minkowski core: Effects of spherical accretion and core type differences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06388v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigated the shadows and optical appearances of a new type of regular black holes (BHs) with a Minkowski core under various spherical accretion scenarios. These BHs are constructed by modifying the Newtonian potential based on the minimum observable length in the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP). They correspond one-to-one with traditional regular BHs featuring a de-Sitter (dS) core (such as Bardeen/Hayward BHs), characterized by a quantum gravity effect parameter ($\alpha_0$) and spacetime deformation factor ($n$). We found that the characteristic parameters give rise to some novel observable features. For these new BHs, both the shadow and photon sphere radii decrease with the increase in $\alpha_0$, while the observed specific intensity increases. Conversely, as n increases, the shadow and photon sphere radii increase, while the observed specific intensity decreases. Under different spherical accretion scenarios, the shadows and photon sphere radii remain identical; however, the observed specific intensity is greater under static spherical accretion than under infalling spherical accretion. Additionally, we found that these regular BHs with different cores exhibit variations in shadows and optical appearances, particularly under static spherical accretion. Compared with Bardeen BH, the new BHs exhibit a lower observed specific intensity, a dimmer photon ring, and smaller shadow and photon sphere radii. Larger values of $\alpha_0$ lead to more significant differences, and a similar trend was also observed when comparing with Hayward BH. Under infalling spherical accretion, the regular BHs with different cores exhibit only slight differences in observed specific intensity, which become more evident when $\alpha_0$ is relatively large.</description>

      <title>The problem of reconstruction for static spherically-symmetric $4D$ metrics in scalar-Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00244v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the $4D$ gravitational model with a scalar field $\varphi$, Einstein and Gauss-Bonnet terms. The action of the model contains a potential term $U(\varphi)$, Gauss-Bonnet coupling function $f(\varphi)$ and a parameter $\varepsilon = \pm1 $, where $\varepsilon = 1$ corresponds to ordinary scalar field and $\varepsilon = -1 $ - to phantom one. Inspired by the recent works of Nojiri and Nashed, we explore a reconstruction procedure for a generic static spherically symmetric metric written in the Buchdal parametrization: $ds^2 = \left(A(u)\right)^{-1}du^2 - A(u)dt^2 + C(u)d\Omega^2$, with given $A(u) &gt; 0$ and $C(u) &gt; 0$. The procedure gives the relations for $U(\varphi(u))$, $f(\varphi(u))$ and $d\varphi/du$, which lead to exact solutions to equations of motion with a given metric. A key role in this approach is played by the solutions to a second order linear differential equation for the function $f(\varphi(u))$. The formalism is illustrated by two examples when: a) the Schwarzschild metric and b) the Ellis wormhole metric, are chosen as a starting point. For the first case a) the black hole solution with a ``trapped ghost'' is found which describes an ordinary scalar field outside the photon sphere and phantom scalar field inside the photon sphere. For the second case b) the sEGB-extension of the Ellis wormhole solution is found when the coupling function reads: $f(\varphi) = c_1 + c_0 ( \tan ( \varphi) + \frac{1}{3} (\tan ( \varphi))^3)$, where $c_1$ and $c_0$ are constants.</description>

      <title>Computation of the semiclassical outflux emerging from a collapsing spherical null shell</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00622v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a minimally coupled, massless quantum scalar field $\hat{\Phi}$ propagating in the background geometry of a four-dimensional black hole formed by the collapse of a spherical thin null shell, with a Minkowski interior and a Schwarzschild exterior. The field is taken in the natural ``in'' vacuum state, namely, the quantum state in which no excitations arrive from past null infinity. Within the semiclassical framework, we analyze the vacuum polarization $\left\langle\hat{\Phi}^{2}\right\rangle _{\text{ren}}$ and the energy outflux density $\left\langle \hat{T}_{uu}\right\rangle _{\text{ren}}$ (where $u$ is the standard null Eddington coordinate) just outside the shell. Using the point-splitting method, we derive closed-form analytical expressions for both these semiclassical quantities. In particular, our result for $\left\langle \hat{T}_{uu}\right\rangle _{\text{ren}}$ reveals that it vanishes like $(1-2M_{0}/r_{0})^{2}$ as the shell collapses toward the event horizon, where $M_{0}$ is the shell's mass and $r_{0}$ is the value of the area coordinate $r$ at the evaluation point. This confirms that, along a late-time outgoing null geodesic (i.e., one that emerges from the shell very close to the event horizon and propagates toward future null infinity), the outflux gradually evolves (from virtually zero) up to its final Hawking-radiation value while the geodesic traverses the strong-field region (rather than the Hawking-radiation outflux being emitted entirely from the collapsing shell, which would lead to significant backreaction effects).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While the two derivative action of gravitation is specified uniquely, higher derivative operators are also allowed with coefficients that are not specified uniquely by effective field theory. We focus on a four derivative operator in which the Riemann tensor couples directly to the electromagnetic field $a\,R_{\mu\nu\alpha\beta}F^{\mu\nu}F^{\alpha\beta}$. We compute the corresponding corrections to the Shapiro time delay in the solar system and compare this to data from the Cassini probe. We place an observational upper bound on the coefficient $a$ at 95\% confidence $|a|&lt;26\,(1000\,\mbox{km})^2$. By way of motivation, we also compare this to a weak gravity conjecture (WGC) prediction of a bound on the coefficients $a,\,b$ of four derivative operators involving the graviton and the photon; this includes the above term $a\,R_{\mu\nu\alpha\beta}F^{\mu\nu}F^{\alpha\beta}$ as well as $b\,F^4$. We show that by using the observed value of the $b$ coefficient from measurements of light by light scattering, which arises in the Standard Model from integrating out the electron, the WGC predicted bound for $a$ is $a\lesssim 7.8\,(1000\,\mbox{km})^2$. This is consistent with the above observational bound, but is intriguingly close and can be further probed in other observations.</description>

Abstract: Nonlinear tails in black hole perturbations, arising from second-order effects, present a distinct departure from the well-known Price tail of linear theory. We present an analytical derivation of the power law indices and amplitudes for nonlinear tails stemming from outgoing sources, and validate these predictions to percent-level accuracy with numerical simulations. We then perform a perturbative analysis on the dynamical formation of nonlinear tails in a self-interacting scalar field model, wherein the nonlinear tails are sourced by a $\lambda \Phi^3$ cubic coupling. Due to cascading mode excitations and back-reactions, nonlinear tails with $t^{-l-1}$ power law are sourced in each harmonic mode, dominating the late time behavior of the scalar perturbations. In verification, we conducted numerical simulations of the self-interacting scalar model, including all real spherical harmonic (RSH) with $l\leq 4$ and their respective nonlinear couplings. We find general agreement between the predicted and numerical power law indices and amplitudes for the nonlinear tails, with the exception of $l=4$ modes, which display $t^{-4}$ power law instead of the predicted $t^{-5}$. This discrepancy is due to distortion in the source of the tails, which is caused by another nonlinear effect. These results establish nonlinear tails as universal features of black hole dynamics, with implications for gravitational wave astronomy: they may imprint observable signatures in merger remnants, offering novel probes of strong-field gravity and nonlinear mode couplings.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Primordial Black Holes, Dimensionless Small Parameter, Inflationary Cosmology and Non-Gaussianity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12968v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present work consideration is given to the primordial black holes ({\bf pbhs}) in the Schwarzschild-de Sitter Metric with small mass (ultralight) in the preinflationary epoch. Within the scope of natural assumptions, it has been shown that the quantum-gravitational corrections ({\bf qgcs}) to the characteristics of such black holes can contribute to all the cosmological parameters, shifting them compared with the semiclassical consideration. These contributions are determined by a series expansion in terms of a small parameter dependent on the hole mass (radius). For this pattern different cases have been considered (stationary, black hole evaporation...). It has been demonstrated that involvement of ({\bf qgcs}) leads to a higher probability for the occurrence of such {\bf pbhs}. Besides, high-energy deformations of Friedmann Equations created on the basis of these corrections have been derived for different patterns. In the last section of this work it is introduced a study into the contributions generated by the above-mentioned {\bf qgcs} in inflationary cosmological perturbations. Besides, it has been shown that non-Gaussianity of these perturbations is higher as compared to the semi-classical pattern.</description>

      <title>Influence of a Kalb-Ramond black hole on neutrino behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15373v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the consequences of Lorentz symmetry breaking induced by a black hole solution within Kalb-Ramond gravity on neutrino dynamics. The analysis is structured around three key phenomena: the energy output associated with neutrino-antineutrino annihilation, the impact of spacetime geometry on the oscillation phases of neutrinos, and the changes in flavor transition probabilities caused by gravitational lensing effects. To complement the theoretical framework, we also carry out a numerical evaluation of neutrino oscillation probabilities, comparing scenarios of normal and inverted mass orderings within a two-flavor approximation.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous symmetry breaking induced by curvature : Analysis via non-perturbative 2PI Hartree approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16578v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we investigate the spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) induced by a classical background spacetime's curvature, via the 2 particle irreducible (2PI) non-perturbative effective action formalism. We use the standard Schwinger-DeWitt local expansion of the Feynman propagator, appropriate to probe the effect of spacetime curvature on the local or short scale physics. Recently it was shown using perturbative computations that such SSB is possible with a scalar with a quartic self interaction, positive rest mass squared and positive non-minimal coupling. Here we confirm in the two loop Hartree approximation that curvature can indeed induce SSB for such a theory. SSB for such a model is not possible in a flat spacetime. The 2PI technique does not only resum the self energy resulting in mass generation, but also resums, as we have discussed, curvature terms through such mass generation. We have explicitly discussed our results in the context of the de Sitter spacetime, although our calculations are valid for any non-singular curved spacetime. We show that, in contrast to the perturbative results, SSB is possible with a vanishing non-minimal coupling. These results are further extended to the case of an $O(N)$ symmetric scalar field theory. Restoration of the broken symmetry in the thermal case is also briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Einstein Maxwell Scalar Black Hole: Thermodynamic Properties with Logarithmic Barrow Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17172v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The thermodynamics of black holes (BHs) within the Einstein Maxwell Scalar (EMS) framework, incorporating Barrow entropy and its logarithmic corrections to analyze quantum gravity effects is investigated here. A static, spherically symmetric BH solution is obtained by coupling the scalar field nonminimally to the electromagnetic field through a scalar dependent function. The thermodynamic properties including temperature, specific heat, and Gibbs free energy are derived and explored in the context of Barrow-modified entropy. We identify phase transitions and critical behavior by analyzing PV criticality and uncover the influence of scalar and electric charges on stability. Furthermore, the Joule Thomson expansion is examined to understand the inversion behavior and thermodynamic responses under adiabatic expansion. Our findings suggest the presence of thermodynamic instabilities, remnants, and nontrivial critical phenomena, providing new insights into BH thermodynamics in modified gravity scenarios with quantum corrections.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative Quantum Dynamics on Embedded Submanifolds: From Geometric Mass to Higgs Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07337v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a quantum dynamics framework for curved submanifolds embedded in higher-dimensional spaces. Through rigorous dimensional reduction, we derive the first complete Schr\"{o}dinger and Klein-Gordon equations incorporating non-perturbative geometric interactions-resolving ambiguities in constrained quantization. Crucially, extrinsic curvature of the ambient manifold governs emergent low-dimensional quantum phenomena. Remarkably, this mechanism generates scalar field masses matching Kaluza-Klein spectra while eliminating periodic compactification requirements. Geometric induction concurrently produces Higgs mechanism potentials. Particle masses emerge solely from submanifold embedding geometry, with matter-field couplings encoded in curvature invariants. This enables experimental access to higher-dimensional physics at all energy scales through geometric induction. We also discuss the Higgs vacuum near small-mass black holes.</description>

      <title>Identifying multiple images of gravitational-wave sources lensed by elliptical lensing potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18750v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real astrophysical lenses typically lack axisymmetry, necessitating the study of gravitational-wave (GW) lensing by elliptical mass distributions to accurately assess detectability and waveform interpretation. We investigate strong lensing using the singular isothermal ellipsoid (SIE) model, which produces two or four images depending on the source's position relative to lens caustics. Employing a quasi-geometrical optics framework, we determine that the geometrical-optics approximation holds reliably for lens masses above approximately $10^5 \, M_\odot$ at GW frequencies relevant for ground-based detectors $(\sim 10^2 \,\text{Hz})$, though wave-optics effects become significant for lower masses or sources near caustics. Our waveform mismatch analysis demonstrates that the use of three-image templates significantly improves our ability to distinguish source signals, reducing mismatches from $O(10^{-1})$ to $O(10^{-2})$, typically by factors between 1.5 and 5 compared to the standard two-image template model. At lens masses above $10^7 \, M_\odot$, diffraction effects become negligible for ground-based detectors, resulting in an additional mismatch reduction by a factor of approximately three. These findings highlight the critical need for multi-image templates in GW searches to enhance detection efficiency and accuracy.</description>

      <title>Compact Cauchy horizons admit constant surface gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20004v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that in any spacetime dimension and under the null energy condition, every totally geodesic connected smooth compact null hypersurface (hence every compact Cauchy horizon) admits a smooth lightlike tangent vector field of constant surface gravity. That is, we solve the open degenerate case by showing that, if there is a complete generator, then there exists a smooth future-directed geodesic lightlike tangent field. The result can be stated as an existence result for a particular cohomological equation. The proof uses elements of ergodic theory, Hodge theory and Riemannian flow theory. We emphasize that, remarkably, these results really require only the null energy condition, whereas previous works assumed, already in the Killing or the non-degenerate case, the stronger dominant energy condition.</description>

      <title>Exploring Dark Energy via Non-Minimal Coupling in $f(Q,L_m)$ Gravity with Gong-Zhang Parameterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the late-time accelerated expansion of the universe within the framework of non-minimally coupled $f(Q,L_m)$ gravity, where $Q$ is the non-metricity scalar and $L_m$ is the matter Lagrangian. We derive modified Friedmann equations in a flat FLRW background and employ the \textit{Gong-Zhang} parameterization for the DE equation of state (EoS), allowing an analytical form of the Hubble parameter $H(z)$. The model parameters are constrained using recent Cosmic Chronometers (CC) and Pantheon+SH0ES Type Ia supernova datasets through MCMC-based chi-squared minimization. We analyze various cosmological quantities including the deceleration parameter, EoS, jerk, snap, lerk, and diagnostic tools such as $Om(z)$ and the statefinder pair $(r,s)$. Our findings indicate a viable transition from deceleration to acceleration and reveal a quintessence-to-phantom-like evolution of dark energy. Furthermore, energy conditions are examined, showing a violation of the strong energy condition, consistent with current cosmic acceleration. The results establish that the $f(Q,L_m) $ framework with non-minimal coupling and parameterized EoS provides a compelling alternative to $\Lambda$CDM in describing cosmic acceleration.</description>

      <title>Exploring the role of accretion disk geometry in shaping black hole shadows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21148v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study black hole imaging in the context of geometrically thick accretion disks in Schwarzschild spacetime. By decomposing the emitting region into a set of one-dimensional luminous segments, each characterized by its inclination angle and inner radius, we construct transfer functions that capture key image features-namely, the direct image, lensing ring, and photon ring. This approach allows a unified treatment of disk geometry and viewing angle. We explore three regimes: optically thin, optically thick, and partially optically thick disks. For optically thin flows, increasing the disk thickness (characterized by the half-opening angle $\psi_0$) broadens the lensing ring, gradually bridging the photon ring and the direct image. The photon ring remains narrow, but its position robustly defines the innermost edge of the lensing structure. In the optically thick case, image features are primarily determined by the first intersection of traced light rays with the disk, and we provide analytical criteria for the presence of lensing and photon rings based on the critical deflection angles. For partially optically thick disks, we adopt a simplified radiative transport model and find a critical absorption coefficient $\chi \sim (6M\psi_0)^{-1}$ beyond which the image rapidly transitions from an optically thin- to thick-disk appearance. These results help clarify the respective roles of the photon and lensing rings across different disk configurations, and may offer a useful framework for interpreting future high-resolution black hole observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02045v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the dynamics of an extreme mass-ratio inspiral (EMRI) embedded within a scalar cloud populated around the massive black hole. This cloud may be generated through the black hole superradiant process if the wavelength of the scalar particle is comparable to the size of the massive black hole. The EMRI motion perturbs the cloud, producing scalar radiation towards infinity and into the black hole horizon. In addition, the backreaction of the scalar radiation onto the orbit modifies the motion of the EMRI and induces an observable gravitational-wave phase shift for a range of system parameters. We quantify the scalar flux and the induced phase shift, as one of the examples of exactly-solvable, environmental effects of EMRIs.</description>

Abstract: In this essay based on 0907.2939, we argue that the emergence of classically connected spacetimes is intimately related to the quantum entanglement of degrees of freedom in a non-perturbative description of quantum gravity. Disentangling the degrees of freedom associated with two regions of spacetime results in these regions pulling apart and pinching off from each other in a way that can be quantified by standard measures of entanglement.</description>

      <title>Looking for Black Hole Morsels in Astrophysical Mergers via Hawking Radiation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12880v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave observation has provided numerous insights into the merger of astrophysical black holes. In contrast to other violent events (e.g. supernovae), they are, however, not expected to lead to significant emissions of photons and neutrinos. In this paper we discuss a scenario that would lead to characteristic observable gamma ray bursts, which would provide numerous hints to physics beyond General Relativity. Starting from the hypothesis that micro-black holes (called morsels) are formed during the merger process, we show that it is possible to observe their Hawking radiation, which takes the form of gamma ray bursts of a uniquely characteristic form: with energies in the TeV range, their temporal structure is unlike that stemming from any other astrophysical event. Notably, the time delay from the gravitational wave event is correlated to the mass distribution of the morsels. The integrated mass of the morsels, allowed by the unaccounted merger mass, leads to a Hawking radiation in photons that is above the sensitivity of atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes such as HESS, LHAASO and HAWC, and gamma ray space telescopes, such as Fermi-LAT. This renders the hypothesis of morsel creation experimentally testable, and we provide the first concrete bounds on the total mass of morsels formed in specific events.</description>

      <title>On the effective spin-mass ratio relation of binary black hole mergers that evolved in isolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ground-based measurement of gravitational waves (GW) from merging binary black holes (BBH) uniquely allows determination of spins of stellar-remnant black holes (BH), thereby offering insights into their formation mechanisms. The observed population of BBH mergers exhibits two intriguing peculiarities related to BH spins, namely, a positively biased distribution of effective spin parameter, $\chi_{\rm eff}$, and an apparent anti-correlation between merger mass ratio, $q$, and $\chi_{\rm eff}$. Here we investigate the potential mechanisms for such observed properties, in BBH mergers via isolated binary evolution. We synthesize BBH mergers with the fast binary evolution code BSE. The role of various physical assumptions is explored, including tidal spin-up, compact remnant mass, and mass transfer physics. We compare the properties of WR-BH binaries that formed through stable mass transfer (SMT) and common envelope evolution (CE). We find that both the asymmetry in $\chi_{\rm eff}$ distribution and the $\chi_{\rm eff}-q$ anti-correlation are natural outcomes of isolated-binary BBH formation with the standard assumptions on mass transfer physics. The anti-correlation is particularly pronounced for SMT-channel BBH mergers that experience a mass-ratio-reversal, i.e., those where the second-born BH is the more massive member. The anti-correlation arises from the dependence of orbital shrinking during mass transfer and the Roche lobe size on the system's mass ratio. This characteristic $\chi_{\rm eff}-q$ trend diminishes with increasing metallicity and when the isolated-binary BBH merger population is mixed with a significant contribution of dynamically formed BBH mergers. Our results demonstrate that isolated massive binary evolution via the SMT sub-channel can reproduce the observable BBH merger population, with characteristic signatures in mass, mass ratio, and spin distributions.[abr.]</description>

Abstract: We provide an exact analytical solution to the nonlinear relativistic Boltzmann equation for a homogeneous, anisotropically scattering massless gas. Utilizing a BKW-like trial solution, we cast the Boltzmann equation into a set of nonlinear coupled equations for scalar moments, based on which the analytical solution is derived. One remarkable feature of our analytical solution lies in the nontrivial scattering angle dependence. We also show that this analytical solution admits a stable fixed point corresponding to the equilibrium solution as long as the parameters are physically feasible. Furthermore, a clear correspondence between our solution and the BKW solution pertaining to nonrelativistic Maxwell molecules is established, thereby clarifying the non-existence of a BKW-type solution in the relativistic domain for massive particles.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Radiation from Scalar Fields in Modified Gravity: A Comparison with Axion-Like Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17186v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze electromagnetic (EM) radiations arising from scalar fields predicted by modified gravity theories and compare these features with those induced by axion-like particles (ALPs). Scalar and axion fields couple differently to the EM field due to their distinct parity properties, $\phi F_{\mu\nu} F^{\mu\nu}$ for scalar fields and $\phi F_{\mu\nu} \tilde{F}^{\mu\nu}$ for axions. Building on analytical methods developed for ALPs, this work presents a theoretical feasibility analysis that demonstrates how the scalar field in modified gravity could produce observable EM signatures from oscillating field configurations. We also show that resonance effects can amplify the EM radiation for the scalar field under specific conditions, and that the enhancement mechanisms depend on the coupling structure and the configuration of the background magnetic field. Resonance phenomena can accentuate the differences in signal strength and spectral features, potentially aiding future observations in distinguishing scalar fields from ALPs. This work provides a theoretical framework for studying generic pure and pseudo-scalar fields on an equal footing and suggests new avenues for observational tests of modified gravity scenarios alongside ALP models.</description>

      <title>Unconventional Supersymmetry via the Dressing Field Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01898v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We re-construe unconventional supersymmetry, a notion introduced by Alvarez-Valenzuela-Zanelli (AVZ), as an attempt to use the framework of supersymmetric field theory to describe fermionic matter fields and bosonic gauge fields in a unified way, as parts of a single superconnection. It hinges upon the so-called matter ansatz. Unfortunately, the formal and conceptual status of the ansatz has remained unclear, preventing unconventional supersymmetry to be used in a principled way as a general approach beyond the model in which it was first considered. In this letter, we lift this restriction by showing that the ansatz is a special case of the Dressing Field Method, a new systematic tool to exhibit the gauge-invariant content of general-relativistic gauge field theories.</description>

      <title>Fractonic self-duality and covariant magnetic fractons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18510v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fractons, excitations with restricted mobility, have emerged as a novel paradigm in high-energy and condensed matter physics, revealing deep connections to gauge theories and gravity. Here, we propose a tensorial generalization of electromagnetic duality using a doubled-potential framework with two symmetric tensor gauge fields. This approach symmetrically describes electric and magnetic sectors, introducing covariant magnetic fractons with reduced mobility and supporting a genuine fractonic self-duality. Notably, we find the absence of a Witten-like effect in the covariant fractonic case, precluding the emergence of fractonic dyons.</description>

      <title>Geometric modular flows in 2d CFT and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02633v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study geometric modular flows in two-dimensional conformal field theories. We explore which states exhibit a geometric modular flow with respect to a causally complete subregion and, conversely, how to construct a state from a given geometric modular flow. Given suitable boundary conditions, we find that generic geometric modular flows in the Rindler wedge are conformally equivalent. Based on this insight, we show how conformal unitaries can be used to explicitly construct a state for each flow. We analyze these states, deriving general formulas for the energy density and entanglement entropy. We also consider geometric flows beyond the Rindler wedge setting, and in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Thawing Dark Energy and Massive Neutrinos in Light of DESI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00126v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent analyses have shown that a dynamic dark energy modeled by the CPL parameterization of the dark energy equation of state (EoS) can ease constraints on the total neutrino mass compared to the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. This helps reconcile cosmological and particle physics measurements of $\sum m_\nu$. In this study, we investigate the robustness of this effect by assessing the extent to which the CPL assumption influences the results. We examine how alternative EoS parameterizations - such as Barboza-Alcaniz (BA), Jassal-Bagla-Padmanabhan (JBP), and a physically motivated thawing parameterization that reproduces the behavior of various scalar field models - affect estimates of $\sum m_\nu$. Although both the BA and JBP parameterizations relax the constraints similarly to the CPL model, the JBP parameterization still excludes the inverted neutrino mass hierarchy at $\sim 2.1\;\sigma$ with $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.096$\;eV. The thawing parameterization excludes the inverted hierarchy at $\sim 3.3\sigma$ and yields tighter constraints, comparable to those of the $\Lambda$CDM model, with $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.071$\;eV. Finally, we show that the thawing model can be mapped into the BA and JBP $w_0$-$w_a$ parameter space, with the apparent preference for the phantom regime actually supporting quintessence (non-phantom) models.</description>

      <title>Core Collapse Supernova Gravitational Wave Sourcing and Characterization based on Three-Dimensional Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06406v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present for the first time an analysis of high-frequency gravitational wave (GW) emission from proto-neutron stars (PNS) in core collapse supernovae (CCSN) that combines spatial decomposition and modal decomposition to both source and characterize the emission using three-dimensional CCSN simulations. We analyze simulations initiated from 15 and 25 solar mass progenitors with Solar- and zero-metallicity respectively. We decompose the GW strains into five spatial regions and find that strains are initially largest in the PNS surface layers from accretion and later largest from the Ledoux convective and convective overshoot regions of the PNS. We compute the fractional GW luminosity as a function of enclosed radius and observe that most of the luminosity moves from the PNS surface to deep within the PNS at later times. Using a self-consistent perturbative analysis, we investigate the evolution of the oscillation modes of the PNS. We find that the frequency of the evolving high-frequency component of the GW signal is well matched to the eigenfrequency evolution of the ${}^2g_2$-, ${}^2g_1$-, and ${}^2f$-modes over time. We show that the ${}^2g$-modes emit most of their power in GW initially from the PNS surface region, but within a few 100 ms after bounce, it is the convective overshoot region of the PNS that emits the most GW power for the ${}^2g_1$-mode. Eventually, the ${}^2f$-mode is the dominant mode producing GWs, and they are emitted primarily from the convective overshoot region. Thus, we show that, while the GW emission is global, it is possible to source the dominant contributions to it. We find that the source of the high-frequency GW emission from the PNS in CCSN is more complex than assessed by other methods, as well as time dependent, first emitted by ${}^2g$-modes driven by accretion onto the PNS and later emitted by the ${}^2f$-mode driven by sustained Ledoux convection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06392v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A fundamental challenge in supersymmetric field theory is that supersymmetry transformations on field variables generally form an algebra only on-shell, i.e. upon imposing the field equations. We show that this issue is defused in a manifestly relational - and thus automatically invariant - formulation of supersymmetric field theory, achieved through the application of the Dressing Field Method of symmetry reduction, a systematic tool to exhibit the gauge-invariant content of general-relativistic gauge field theories.</description>

Abstract: A technique to build perturbative series for the spectator field's correlation functions in de Sitter space through the Fokker-Planck equation is proposed. We derive from the first-order differential equation the iterative integral relation for equal- and multi-time correlation functions. With an appropriate integration, the obtained two-point and four-point correlation functions are in agreement with quantum field theory's ones.</description>

      <title>Insights into Neutron Star Matter: EoS Models and Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05241v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The equation of state (EoS) for neutron stars is a crucial topic in astrophysics, nuclear physics, and quantum chromodynamics (QCD), influencing their structure, stability, and observable properties. This review classifies EoS models into hadronic matter, hybrid, and quark matter models, analyzing their assumptions, predictions, and constraints. While hadronic models characterize nucleonic matter, potentially including contributions from hyperons or mesons, hybrid models introduce phase transitions to quark matter, and quark models hypothesize the presence of deconfined quark matter cores or entirely quark-composed stars. By synthesizing results from recent theoretical and observational studies, this review aims to offer a comprehensive understanding of the methodologies used in constructing neutron star EoS, their implications, and future directions.</description>

      <title>Features of the Partition Function of a $\Lambda&gt;0$ Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11330v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider properties of the gravitational path integral, ${Z}_{\text{grav}}$, of a four-dimensional gravitational effective field theory with $\Lambda&gt;0$ at the quantum level. To leading order, ${Z}_{\text{grav}}$ is dominated by a four-sphere saddle subject to small fluctuations. Beyond this, ${Z}_{\text{grav}}$ receives contributions from additional geometries that may include Einstein metrics of positive curvature. We discuss how a general positive curvature Einstein metric contributes to ${Z}_{\text{grav}}$ at one-loop level. Along the way, we discuss Einstein-Maxwell theory with $\Lambda&gt;0$, and identify an interesting class of closed non-Einstein gravitational instantons. We provide a detailed study for the specific case of $\mathbb{C}P^2$ which is distinguished as the saddle with second largest volume and positive definite tensor eigenspectrum. We present exact one-loop results for scalar particles, Maxwell theory, and Einstein gravity about the Fubini-Study metric on $\mathbb{C}P^2$.</description>

      <title>Lie Group Theory of Multipole Moments and Shape of Stationary Rotating Fluid Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a rigorous framework for determining the equilibrium configurations of uniformly rotating, self-gravitating fluid bodies. This work addresses the classical challenge of modeling rotational deformation in celestial objects such as stars and planets. By integrating foundational theory with modern mathematical tools, we develop a unified formalism that enhances the precision and generality of shape modeling in astrophysical contexts. Our method applies Lie group theory to vector flows and solves functional equations using the Neumann series. We extend Clairaut's classical linear perturbation theory into the nonlinear regime via Lie exponential mapping, yielding a system of nonlinear functional equations for gravitational potential and fluid density. These are analytically tractable using shift operators and Neumann series summation, enabling explicit characterization of density and gravitational perturbations. This leads to an exact nonlinear differential equation for the shape function, describing equilibrium deformation without assuming slow rotation. We validate the framework through exact solutions, including the Maclaurin spheroid, Jacobi ellipsoid, and unit-index polytrope. We also introduce spectral decomposition techniques for analyzing radial harmonics and gravitational perturbations. Using Wigner's formalism for angular momentum addition, we compute higher-order nonlinear corrections efficiently. The framework includes boundary conditions for Legendre harmonics, supporting the derivation of nonlinear Love numbers and gravitational multipole moments. This work offers a comprehensive, non-perturbative approach to modeling rotational and tidal deformations in astrophysical and planetary systems.</description>

Abstract: We examine data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration which has implications for the nature of dark energy. We consider classes of models that manifestly obey the null energy condition, with a focus on quintessence models. We find that hilltop potentials and exponential potentials provide modest improvement compared to a cosmological constant, but the statistical evidence is only marginal at this stage. We correct some analyses in the existing literature which attempted to compare some quintessence models to the data, giving an overly positive result.</description>

      <title>Perturbative K\"ahler Moduli Inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present two classes of inflationary models in the framework of type IIB string theory. The inflatons correspond to blow-up K\"ahler modulus arising from compactifying type IIB string theory on a Calabi-Yau. Using perturbative corrections, we first highlight a procedure for stabilising more than one K\"ahler modulus. For the case of two K\"ahler moduli, we explicitly construct two classes of inflationary potentials within the K\"ahler cone which satisfy both EFT and cosmological constraints. The first class of models, arising from moduli redefinition of the blow-up mode, garners a potential of the form $V(\phi)=V_{0}(1+C_{1} \phi^{2/3})$ align with CMB data with scalar-to-tensor ratio $r\lesssim 10^{-2}$. The second class of models, which have been recently proposed as loop blow-up inflation, have a form $V(\phi)=V_{0}(1+C_{2}\phi^{-2/3})$, also agrees with CMB data with scalar-to tensor-ratio $r\lesssim 10^{-8}$. Our work differs from the original loop blow-up inflation in terms of stabilization mechanism and subsequently the scalar-to tensor ratio.</description>

      <title>JT de Sitter Gravity as a Model of Coleman-de Luccia Tunneling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09283v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We interpret the Euclidean solution of JT de Sitter gravity as the Coleman-de Luccia instanton for the decay of the low-entropy horizon of its static patch solution into either a Big Crunch or an infinite-entropy Lorentzian de Sitter cosmology. As in previous work by one of the authors, the Big Crunch is interpreted as bounding the entropy of the static state. The principle of detailed balance then guarantees it will transition back to a higher entropy causal diamond in the expanding cosmology. We then construct a family of explicit quantum mechanical models and appropriate metastable states, with transition probabilities well approximated by the semi-classical calculations in JT de Sitter gravity.</description>

      <title>Geometry of Chord Intertwiner, Multiple Shocks and Switchback in Double-Scaled SYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19013v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the bulk Hilbert space interpretation of chords in the double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) model and introduce a notion of intertwiner that constructs bulk states from states with fixed boundary conditions. This leads to an isometric map that factorizes the one-particle bulk Hilbert space into a tensor product of two boundary Hilbert spaces without particle insertion. The map enables a systematic derivation of a family of correlation functions with arbitrary finite amount of matter insertions, relevant for capturing the switchback effect-a feature of holographic complexity. We further develop a path integral framework that describes multiple shockwave configurations in the semiclassical limit. For the two-body scattering processes in semi-classical regime, we show it exhibits sub-maximal chaos at finite temperature, consistent with the scramblon dynamics associated with the "fake disk" geometry. The effective "fake temperature" governing this behavior emerges from the semiclassical limit of the quantum $6 j$-symbol associated with the out-of-time-order correlator. We further analyze multi-shockwave configurations and derive precise conditions under which the switchback effect is realized, both in terms of the total chord number and the Krylov complexity of precursor operators. Our results clarify the structure of correlation functions with multiple operator insertions, their bulk interpretation in terms of shockwave geometries in the semiclassical regime, and provide a microscopic derivation of the switchback effect in the DSSYK model.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Sectors in Chord Space and Relational Holography in the DSSYK</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21447v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Can there be multiple bulk theories for the same boundary theory? We answer this affirmatively in the double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) model using the tools of constrained systems. We find different symmetry sectors generated by specific constraints within the chord Hilbert space of the DSSYK with matter. Each sector corresponds to a different bulk description. These include chord parity symmetry, corresponding to End-Of-The-World (ETW) branes and Euclidean wormholes in sine dilaton gravity; and relative time-translations in a doubled DSSYK model (as a single DSSYK with an infinitely heavy chord) used in de Sitter holography. We derive the partition functions and thermal correlation functions in the ETW brane and Euclidean wormhole systems from the boundary theory. We deduce the holographic dictionary by matching geodesic lengths in the bulk with the spread complexity of the parity-gauged DSSYK. The Euclidean wormholes of fixed size are perturbatively stable, and their baby universe Hilbert space is non-trivial only when matter is added. We conclude studying the constraints in the path integral of the doubled DSSYK. We derive the gauge invariant operator algebra of one of the DSSYKs dressed to the other one and discuss its holographic interpretation.</description>

      <title>Finite-cutoff Holographic Thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01010v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a framework for holographic thermodynamics in finite-cutoff holography, extending the anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence to incorporate a finite radial cutoff in the bulk and a $T^2$-deformed CFT on the boundary. We formulate the first laws of thermodynamics for a Schwarzschild-AdS (SAdS) black hole with a Dirichlet cutoff on the quasilocal boundary and its dual deformed CFT, introducing the deformation parameter as a thermodynamic variable. The holographic Euler relation for the deformed CFT and its equation of state are derived, alongside the Smarr relation for the bulk. We show that the Rupert teardrop coexistence curve defines a phase space island where deformation flow alters states, with up to three deformed CFTs or cut-off SAdS sharing a same phase transition temperature, one matching the seed CFT or original SAdS. These results offer insights into gravitational thermodynamics with boundary constraints and quantum gravity in finite spacetime regions.</description>
