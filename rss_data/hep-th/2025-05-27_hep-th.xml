      <title>Properties of scalar partition functions of 2d CFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the spectrum of scalar primary operators in any two-dimensional conformal field theory. We show that the scalars alone obey a nontrivial crossing equation. This extends previous work that derived a similar equation for Narain conformal field theories. Additionally, we show that at high temperature, the difference between the true scalar partition function and the one predicted from a semiclassical gravity calculation is controlled by: the modular integral of the partition function, the light states of the theory, and an infinite series terms directly related to the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function. We give several numerical examples and compute their modular integrals.</description>

      <title>Momentum space entanglement of four fermion field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18820v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Momentum space entanglement of four fermion field theory is calculated from the Wilsonian effective action pertubatively using replica trick, local terms in low energy effective action are proved to be non-relevant pertubatively and nonlocal terms are the only source of entanglement between different momentum modes. The final result again can be represented by a set of basketball feynmann diagrams with new feynmann rules proposed to inteprete them.</description>

      <title>The universality class of the first levels in low-dimensional gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the physics of a small group of quantum states defined above the sharply defined ground state of a chaotic ensemble. This `universality class of the first levels' (UFL) is realized in the majority of `synthetic' random matrix models but, for all we know, in only one microscopically defined system: low-dimensional gravity. We discuss the physical properties of these states, notably their exceptional rigidity against external perturbations, as quantified by the so-called quantum state fidelity. Examining these structures through the lenses of random matrix and string theory, we highlight their relevance to the physics of low-dimensional holographic principles.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping the Cosmological Collider with Resonant Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Signatures of heavy particles during inflation are exponentially suppressed by the Boltzmann factor when the masses are far above the Hubble scale. In more realistic scenarios, however, scale-dependent features may change this conventional picture and boost the cosmological collider signals. In this paper, we compute cosmological correlators of the primordial curvature perturbations exchanging an intermediate heavy field with periodically varying couplings. The basic setup corresponds to inflation scenarios with globally oscillating features that enjoy a discrete shift symmetry. Adopting the bootstrap approach, we derive and solve the boundary differential equations that are satisfied by the massive-exchange three-point functions. The presence of the oscillatory couplings leads to resonance-enhanced cosmological collider signals for heavy fields when the oscillating frequency exceeds the field masses. Meanwhile, the forms of these differential equations are modified, which generates new shapes of primordial non-Gaussianity as a combination of resonant features and collider signals. Based on these computations, we revisit the string-inspired model of axion monodromy inflation and point out that the cosmological correlators can become sensitive to heavy moduli fields of flux compactifications. This finding suggests a breakdown of the conventional single-field description, as the heavy moduli may not be simply integrated out but yield detectably large signals in the primordial bispectrum.</description>

      <title>York time in JT gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notion of time in general relativity must arise from an internal clock, i.e., a degree of freedom in the gravitational theory internal to the system that can serve the role of a physical clock. One such internal notion of time is the York time, corresponding to constant extrinsic curvature slicing of spacetime. We study the Hartle-Hawking wavefunction of asymptotically $AdS_2$ JT gravity as a function of York time. Using both canonical quantization and the JT gravity path integral, we explicitly calculate this wavefunction and show that it satisfies a Schrodinger equation with respect to York time. We find the corresponding York Hamiltonian, which turns out to be manifestly Hermitian. Our analysis cleanly avoids operator ordering ambiguities. The dependence of the wavefunction on York time should be thought of as emerging from a unitary transformation of the gravitational length basis states, and not from a physical time evolution of the state in the dual boundary theory.</description>

      <title>The Gauge Theory Bootstrap: Predicting pion dynamics from QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gauge Theory Bootstrap [arXiv:2309.12402, arXiv:2403.10772] computes the strongly coupled pion dynamics by considering the most general scattering matrix, form factors and spectral densities and matching them with perturbative QCD at high energy and with weakly coupled pions at low energy. In this work, we show that further constraints on the spectral densities significantly reduce the possible solutions to a small set of qualitatively similar ones. Quantitatively, the precise solution is controlled by the asymptotic value of the form factors and SVZ sum rules. We also introduce an iterative procedure that, starting from a generic feasible point, converges to a unique solution parameterized by the UV input. For the converged solution we compute masses and widths of resonances that appear, scattering lengths and effective ranges of partial waves, low energy coefficients in the effective action. Additionally, we use these results to discuss the thermodynamics of a pion gas including pair correlations of pions with same and opposite charge.</description>

      <title>2d Cardy-Rabinovici model with the modified Villain lattice: Exact dualities and symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cardy-Rabinovici model is a toy model of the lattice $U(1)$ gauge theories to study various oblique confinement states associated with the nonzero $\theta$ angles. We reformulate the $2$d version of this model using the modified Villain lattice formalism, and we establish the exact $\theta$ periodicity for the Witten effect and the strong-weak duality at the finite lattice spacings. We then study the phase structure of this model based on the duality, symmetry and anomaly, and the perturbative renormalization group.</description>

      <title>Mirror Symmetry and Spinor-Vector Duality: A Top-Down Approach to the Swampland Program</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mirror symmetry is one of the celebrated developments in pure mathematics that arose from an initial observation in worldsheet string constructions. The profound implications of mirror symmetry in the Effective Field Theory (EFT) limit of string compactifications was subsequently understood. In particular, it proved to be an exceptionally useful tool in the field of enumerative geometry. Spinor-Vector Duality (SVD) is an extension of mirror symmetry that can be readily understood in terms of the moduli parameters of toroidal heterotic-string compactifications, which include the metric, the anti-symmetric ternsor field and the Wilson-line moduli. While mirror symmetry corresponds to maps of the internal moduli parameters, {\i.e.} the metric and the anti-symmetric tensor field, SVD corresponds to maps of the Wilson-line moduli. Similar to mirror symmetry the imprint of SVD in the EFT limit can serve as a tool to study the properties of complex manifolds with vector-bundles. Spinor-Vector Duality motivates a top--down approach to the "Swampland" program, by studying the imprint of the symmetries of the worldsheet ultra-violet complete string constructions in the EFT limit. It is conjectured that SVD provides a demarcation line between (2,0) EFTs that possess an ultra-violet complete embedding in string theory versus those that do not.</description>

      <title>Effective potential of scalar Lee-Wick pseudo-electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of effective potential for the scalar Lee-Wick pseudo-electrodynamics in one-loop is presented in this letter. The planar and non-local Lee-Wick pseudo-electrodynamics is so coupled to a complex scalar field sector in 1+2 dimensions, where we achieve the Lee-Wick pseudo-scalar electrodynamics. The effective action formalism is applied such that the quantum corrections are examined in one loop to the scalar effective potential as function of the classical field, of the Lee-Wick mass, and also of the coupling constants of this model. The instability of the effective potential is investigated due to Lee-Wick mass.</description>

      <title>Ultra-Planckian Quark and Gluon Scattering in Agravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate tree-level scattering processes involving quarks and gluons mediated by graviton exchange in the framework of Agravity, a dimensionless and renormalizable theory of quadratic quantum gravity. Focusing on the ultra-Planckian regime, we compute the squared amplitudes and analyze the differential cross sections for the processes $gg \rightarrow gg$, $gg \rightarrow q\bar{q}$, $gq \rightarrow gq$, and $qq \rightarrow qq$. We demonstrate that all amplitudes scale as $1/s$ at high energies, in agreement with expectations for a UV-complete theory of gravity. In addition, we explore the issue of unitarity in the presence of higher-derivative ghost modes by analyzing the positivity properties of the squared amplitudes. While IR divergences appear in the forward scattering of massless particles, we show that these are regularized by finite quark masses. Our findings support the viability of Agravity as a perturbatively unitary and UV-complete extension of general relativity, capable of consistently describing gravitational interactions among elementary matter fields at trans-Planckian energies.</description>

      <title>Notes on Rindler wave packets in Minkowski spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider wave packets of a massless scalar field that have well-localized Rindler energy, and examine how their energy appears to a Minkowski observer to see how the classical gravitational blue-shift formula is modified quantum mechanically. We derive, by using the saddle point approximation, an analytic expression for the Minkowski momentum distribution of such Rindler wave packets. We find a universal lower bound on the uncertainty of Minkowski momentum; the momentum distribution can never become arbitrarily sharp.</description>

      <title>Bulk Reconstruction of Scalar Excitations in Flat$_3$/CCFT$_2$ and the Flat Limit from (A)dS$_3$/CFT$_2$</title>

Abstract: We explore the reconstruction of bulk local states in three-dimensional flat spacetime (Flat$_3$) using states from two-dimensional Carrollian conformal field theories (CCFT$_2$), proposed as dual field theories in one lower dimension. For massive scalar-type bulk excitations, reconstruction is achieved through states in the induced representation. This method successfully reproduces the bulk massive scalar spectrum and the bulk-to-bulk propagator. Additionally, we identify a new flat limit from AdS$_3$ and dS$_3$ spacetimes, further validating our proposal for scalar reconstruction in Flat$_3$/CCFT$_2$.</description>

      <title>Vortex Fractional Fermion Number through Heat Kernel methods and Edge States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computing the vacuum expectation of fermion number operator on a soliton background is often challenging. A recent proposal in arXiv:2305.13606 simplifies this task by considering the soliton in a bounded region and relating the $\eta$ invariant, and thus the fermion number, to a specific heat kernel coefficient and to contributions from the edge states. We test this method in a system of charged fermions living on an Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen (ANO) vortex background. We show that the resulting $\eta$ invariant is independent of boundary conditions, confirming the validity of the method. Our analysis reveals a nontrivial feature for the fermionic spectrum in the vortex-induced Higgs phase. As a by-product, we also find that for a vortex living on a disk, the edge states carry fractional charge.</description>

      <title>Resonances in Lifetimes of AdS Oscillon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oscillons are classical oscillatory solutions with very long but finite lifetimes in real scalar field theories with appropriate potentials. An interesting feature is that resonances appear in the lifetimes of the oscillon for the initial size of the oscillon core $R_0$, which was discovered by Honda and Choptuik in the case of Minkowski space. In a previous work, oscillons in the global anti-de Sitter (AdS) space have been constructed, which we abbreviate as AdS oscillons. We present new resonance structures for the curvature radius $L$ and the core size $R_0$ in the lifetime of the AdS oscillon. We then compute exponents associated with the resonance peaks. Finally, we observe the bifurcation of the peaks due to the reflected waves.</description>

      <title>Derivations for the MPS overlap formulas of rational spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a universal formula for the overlaps between integrable matrix product states (MPS) and Bethe eigenstates in $\mathfrak{gl}_{N}$ symmetric spin chains. This formula expresses the normalized overlap as a product of a MPS-independent Gaudin-determinant ratio and a MPS-dependent scalar factor constructed from eigenvalues of commuting operators, defined via the $K$-matrix associated with the MPS. Our proof is fully representation-independent and relies solely on algebraic Bethe Ansatz techniques and the $KT$-relation. We also propose a generalization of the overlap formula to $\mathfrak{so}_{N}$ and $\mathfrak{sp}_{N}$ spin chains, supported by algebra embeddings and low-rank isomorphisms. These results significantly broaden the class of integrable initial states for which exact overlap formulas are available, with implications for quantum quenches and defect CFTs.</description>

      <title>On geometric bases for A-polynomials II: $\mathfrak{su}_3$ and Kuberberg bracket</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue the study of quantum A-polynomials -- equations for knot polynomials with respect to their coloring (representation-dependence) -- as the relations between different links, obtained by hanging additional ``simple'' components on the original knot. Depending on the choice of this ``decoration'', the knot polynomial is either multiplied by a number or decomposes into a sum over ``surrounding'' representations by a cabling procedure. What happens is that these two of decorations, when complicated enough, become dependent -- and this provides an equation. Remarkably it can be made independent of the representation. However, the equivalence of links is not a topological property -- it follows from the properties of $R$-matrices, and strongly depends on the choice the gauge group and particular links. The relatively well studied part of the story concerns $\mathfrak{su}_2$, where $R$-matrices can be chosen in an especially convenient Kauffman form, what makes the derivation of equations rather geometrical. To make these geometric methods somewhat simpler we suggest to use an arcade formalism/representation of the braid group to simplify decorating links universally. Here we attempt to extend this technique to the next case, $\mathfrak{su}_3$, where the Kauffman rule is substituted by a more involved Kuberberg rule, still remains more geometric than generic analysis of MOY-diagrams, needed for higher ranks. Already in this case we encounter a classification problem for possible ``decorations'' and emergence of two-lined Young diagrams in enumeration of representations.</description>

      <title>On world-sheet S-matrix of NSR string in static gauge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As was shown in arXiv:1203.1054, expanding the Nambu action near the "long string" vacuum in the static gauge one finds that the one-loop 2 to 2 scattering amplitude of the $D-2=24$ transverse 2d fluctuations $X^i$ is given by a pure phase expression consistent with underlying integrability. Similar computation in the Green-Schwarz superstring was carried out in arXiv:2404.09658. Here we consider the case of the NSR string starting with its manifestly 2d covariant action given by $D$ scalar multiplets coupled to 2d supergravity. Eliminating the zweibein and gravitino fields is non-trivial, and a Nambu-like formulation of the spinning string involving only scalar coordinates and their 2d fermionic partners has not previously been available. We show how the auxiliary fields can be eliminated in static gauge after a specific choice of superconformal gauge for the fermions, while keeping the transverse fields $X^i$ and $\psi^i$ off-shell. The resulting one-loop S-matrix for $X^i$ is found, as expected, to be the same as in the GS superstring case. We also discuss similar actions for the heterotic string and a $T\bar T$ deformation of free 2d scalar multiplet.</description>

      <title>Propagating Gravitational Waves in Teleparallel Gauss-Bonnet Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves offer a key insight into the viability of classes of gravitational theories beyond general relativity. The observational constraints on their speed of propagation can provide strong constraints on generalized classes of broader gravitational frameworks. In this work, we reconsider the general class of Gauss-Bonnet theories in the context of teleparallel gravity, where the background geometry is expressed through torsion. We perform tensor perturbations on a flat FLRW background, and derive the gravitational wave propagation equation. We find that gravitational waves propagate at the speed of light in these classes of theories. We also derive the distance-duality relationship for radiation propagating in the gravitational wave and electromagnetic domains.</description>

      <title>Insights on the Cosmic Origin of Matter from Proton Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the phenomenology of a model in which the proton is rendered absolutely stable by an IR mechanism that remains robust against unknown quantum gravity effects. A linear combination of baryon number and lepton flavors is gauged and spontaneously broken to a residual $\mathbb{Z}_9$ discrete gauge symmetry enforcing a strict selection rule: $\Delta B = 0\,(\mathrm{mod}\,3)$. Despite its minimal field content, the model successfully accounts for established empirical evidence of physics beyond the SM. High-scale symmetry breaking simultaneously provides a seesaw mechanism explaining the smallness of neutrino masses, minimal thermal leptogenesis, and a viable phenomenology of the majoron as dark matter. Any cosmic string-wall network remaining after inflation is unstable for numerous charge assignments. Lepton flavor non-universality, central to the construction, leads to predictive neutrino textures testable via oscillation experiments, neutrinoless double beta decay, and cosmology. The model motivates searches in $X$- and $\gamma$-ray lines, neutrino telescopes, and predicts CMB imprints.</description>

      <title>Frequency contamination from new fundamental fields in black hole ringdowns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the modelling of black hole ringdown beyond General Relativity (GR), emphasizing the limitations of approaches that rely solely on shifted quasinormal mode (QNM) frequencies. Starting from modified Teukolsky equations in such scenarios, we classify the distinct types of deviations that can arise -- those shifting QNM frequencies, and those introducing additional frequencies associated with extra fields. We then construct the most general ansatz for metric perturbations in this context and discuss its implications for QNM modelling and theory-agnostic tests of GR using gravitational wave data.</description>

      <title>Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet-Myrzakulov Gravity from $R + F(T, G)$: Numerical Insights and Torsion-Gauss-Bonnet Dynamics in Weitzenb\"ock Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of modified gravity models has garnered significant attention because of their potential to provide alternative explanations for cosmological phenomena, such as the accelerated expansion of the universe and the nature of dark energy. One such model, the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet-Myrzakulov $R + F(T, G)$ gravity (EGBMG), which incorporates the curvature $R$, torsion $T$, and the Gauss-Bonnet term $G$, offers a promising framework to explore the dynamics of the universe and its evolution. This paper delves into the theoretical and observational implications of the EGBMG model, focusing on its ability to address long-standing challenges in cosmology, including the evolution of dark energy and the transition from early-time inflationary behavior to late-time acceleration. We review recent advancements in the model, including its compatibility with observational data and its ability to provide new insights into cosmic acceleration. Through a combination of theoretical models, dynamical systems analysis, and cosmological diagnostics, we demonstrate the robustness of the EGBMG framework in explaining the large-scale structure of the universe and its accelerated expansion. This paper serves as a step toward further exploring the potential of this model to understand the fundamental forces driving Weitzenb$\"{o}$ck spacetime.</description>

      <title>Non-covariant parabolic theories of relativistic diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new first-order theory of relativistic dissipation has been recently proposed, where viscous effects are incorporated using the traditional Navier-Stokes framework. Its main novelty is the avoidance of dynamical instabilities by allowing different observers to use equations that are not related by exact Lorentz transformations. In this work, we explore the implications of this non-covariance in depth. In particular, we discuss how predictions differ between observers moving at nearly luminal speeds relative to each other. We find that all disagreements stem from the relativity of simultaneity, which introduces frame-dependent anisotropic delays in the diffusive process. These anisotropies significantly limit the applicability of the equation used by observers who move very fast relative to the medium. However, the magnitude of the related error remains finite at infinite Lorentz factors, meaning that it is possible to find a regime where all observers agree on the outcome of experiments.</description>

      <title>Towards Laboratory Electron-Positron Plasma via Electromagnetic Showers in Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The kinetic equations describing electromagnetic showers from high-energy electron beams interacting with targets are solved, building on the analytical framework developed in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 135001 (2025)]. Two regimes are defined by the ratio of the target thickness L to the radiation length Lr , which depends on the electron energy and target composition. For thin targets (L &lt; Lr ), we derive explicit expressions for the spectra of produced photons and pairs, as well as the number of pairs. For thick targets (L&gt;Lr ), we obtain the total pair number and photon spectrum. Analytical results agree well with Geant4 simulations, which show that significant pair escape requires L&lt;Lr . The divergence, density and characteristic dimensions of the escaping pair jets are obtained, and a criterion for pair plasma formation is derived. While current laser wakefield beams are not well adapted, multi-petawatt lasers may provide new electron or photon sources suitable for laboratory pair plasma production, opening new avenues for studying extreme plasma astrophysics in the laboratory.</description>

      <title>Constraints on maximum neutron star mass from proto-neutron star evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A proto-neutron star (PNS) gets formed after a successful supernova when the stellar remnant decouples from the ejecta. In this study, we explore a relativistic framework for the finite-temperature $\beta$-equilibrium limit of equation of state (EOS), constrained via a Bayesian inference methodology. The EOS is constrained by minimal approximations on a few nuclear saturation properties, low-density pure neutron matter constraints from chiral effective field theory, and a neutron star (NS) maximum mass greater than 2.0 $M_{\odot}$. Two sets of EOS derived from the relativistic mean field model for nucleonic and hyperonic matter constrained by a Bayesian inference calculation at the zero temperature limit are used. The thermal adiabatic index ($\Gamma_{\rm Th}$) is calculated as a function of the baryonic density across several temperatures for both the sets. Our results suggest that the maximum NS mass is of the order of 2.15 $M_\odot$ if hyperons are present. In addition, the present study suggests that an observation of NS with mass larger than $2.2\ M_{\odot}$ can indirectly indicates the absence of hyperons in its core. The deleptonization of hyperonic PNS reduces the stellar maximum mass rendering the PNS exceeding the zero temperature maximum stellar (baryonic) mass limit becomes metastable which is prone to collapse into a black hole while PNS below such a mass threshold evolves to a stable NS.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Dark Energy at Late Time $\Lambda$CDM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamical properties of dark energy through a detailed analysis of its equation of state parameter $w(z)$ as a function of redshift. We derive a general expression for $w(z)$ from the Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) equations, establishing a direct relationship between the dark energy equation of state and the observable Hubble parameter $H(z)$ and its derivative. Using the relation $w(z) = -1 + \frac{2(1+z)}{3H(z)} \frac{dH}{dz}$, we develop an approximation method valid for $z \lesssim 1$ that accounts for the changing balance between matter and dark energy contributions to cosmic expansion. We compare our theoretical framework with recent observational data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) DR2, analysing how well the commonly used Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization $w(z) = -1 + w_a \frac{z}{1+z}$ captures the evolution of dark energy. Our results indicate that the dark energy equation of state exhibits a monotonic evolution with redshift, transitioning from deceleration to acceleration around $z \approx 0.7$. Notably, our predicted $w_{\mathrm{DE}}$ remains greater than $-1$ across all redshifts, avoiding phantom energy scenarios that would violate the null energy condition. This work demonstrates how precise measurements of the cosmic expansion history can constrain the nature of dark energy and provides a framework for testing dynamical dark energy models against current and future cosmological observations.</description>

Abstract: We examine data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration which has implications for the nature of dark energy. We consider classes of models that manifestly obey the null energy condition, with a focus on quintessence models. We find that hilltop potentials and exponential potentials provide modest improvement compared to a cosmological constant, but the statistical evidence is only marginal at this stage. We correct some analyses in the existing literature which attempted to compare some quintessence models to the data, giving an overly positive result.</description>

      <title>Dirac fermions on a surface with localized strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the influence of a localized Gaussian deformation on massless Dirac fermions confined to a two-dimensional curved surface. Both in-plane and out-of-plane displacements are considered within the framework of elasticity theory. These deformations couple to the Dirac spinors via the spin connection and the vielbeins, leading to a position-dependent Fermi velocity and an effective geometric potential. We show that the spin connection contributes an attractive potential centered on the deformation and explore how this influences the fermionic density of states. Analytical and numerical solutions reveal the emergence of bound states near the deformation and demonstrate how the Lam\'{e} coefficients affect curvature and state localization. Upon introducing an external magnetic field, the effective potential becomes confining at large distances, producing localized Landau levels that concentrate near the deformation. A geometric Aharonov-Bohm phase is identified through the spinor holonomy. These results contribute to the understanding of strain-induced electronic effects in Dirac materials, such as graphene.</description>

      <title>On the Pipeline Dependence of DESI Dynamical Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We continue scientific scrutiny of the DESI dynamical dark energy (DE) claim by explicitly demonstrating that the result depends on the analysis pipeline. Concretely, we define a likelihood that converts the $w_0 w_a$CDM model back into the flat $\Lambda$CDM model, which we fit to DESI constraints on the flat $\Lambda$CDM model from DR1 Full-Shape (FS) modelling and BAO. We further incorporate CMB constraints. Throughout, we find that $w_0$ and $w_a$ are within $1 \sigma$ of the flat $\Lambda$CDM Model. Our work makes it explicit that, in contrast to DR1 and DR2 BAO, there is no dynamical DE signal in FS modelling, even when combined with BAO and CMB. Moreover, one confirms late-time accelerated expansion today $(q_0 &lt; 0)$ at $ \gtrsim 3.4 \sigma$ in FS modelling+BAO. On the contrary, DR1 and DR2 BAO fail to confirm $q_0 &lt; 0$ under similar assumptions. Our analyses highlight the fact that trustable scientific results should be independent of the analysis pipeline.</description>

      <title>Testing cosmological principle under Copernican principle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observational analyses have revealed potential evidence for a preferred spatial direction in cosmological data. Such directional parameterization inherently places observers at a privileged spatial position, thereby conflicting with the Copernican principle and suffering from the look-elsewhere effect. To restore the Copernican principle which is the foundation of modern astronomy, we propose a stochastic framework for cosmological principle violations. The almost uniform temperature of cosmic microwave background suggests that the deviation of isotropy is negligible ($\lesssim 10^{-5}$ level) on the last scattering surface, which can be used as a zero boundary condition to construct an orthogonal basis below the redshift of recombination. The relative deviation from Hubble diagram of isotropic ($\Lambda$CDM or $w_0w_a$CDM) models is expanded with the orthogonal basis with a hierarchy of increasing resolution. Using this new approach, we test cosmological principle with type Ia supernovae, strong lens time delay, and gravitational-wave standard siren. The data sets are consistent with statistical isotropy on large scales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain quantum parameter ($\alpha$)-mass ($M$) induced spontaneous scalarization of quantum Oppenheimer-Snyder (qOS)-black hole in the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet-scalar theory with the unknown qOS action.
  We derive Smarr formula which describes a correct thermodynamics for the bald qOS-black hole.
  It is turned out that two Davies points of heat capacity are identified with two critical onset mass and quantum parameter for spontaneous scalarization.
  Furthermore, the shadow radius analysis of qOS-black hole is performed to distinguish quantum parameter from mass by comparing them with the EHT observation.
  There is no constraints on the quantum parameter, but new constraints are found for the mass.
  This work is considered as the first example to show a close connection between thermodynamics of bald black hole and spontaneous scalarization.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic gauge symmetry and UV extension of the nonperturbative coupling in holographic QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend our recent analytic study of the strong coupling $\alpha_{\rm eff}$ in the nonperturbative and near-perturbative regimes~\cite{deTeramond:2024ikl} by imposing rigorous renormalization-group results from asymptotically free gauge theories at $Q^2 \to \infty$. The asymptotic boundary conditions modify the scaling properties of $\alpha_{\rm eff}$ at large values of the momentum transfer $Q^2$, and lead to a scale-dependent confinement strength $\kappa(Q^2)$. This requires that both $\kappa(Q^2)$ and $\alpha_{\rm eff}\left(Q^2, \kappa(Q^2)\right)$ remain holomorphic in the complex $Q^2$ plane, except at the physical cuts associated with the heavy-quark thresholds and the singularity flow trajectory studied in~\cite{deTeramond:2024ikl}. For color $SU(3)$, a precise connection is found between the scaling exponent of $\kappa(Q^2)$ in the ultraviolet, the value of the infrared fixed point of the strong coupling, and the number of flavors in agreement with observations. The nonperturbative analytic model gives an accurate description of the strong coupling at all scales, up to the highest available data.</description>

      <title>Longitudinal magnetoconductivity in chiral multifold semimetals exemplified by pseudospin-1 nodal points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We embark on computing the longitudinal magnetoconductivity within the semiclassical Boltzmann formalism, where an isotropic triple-point semimetal (TSM) is subjected to collinear electric ($\boldsymbol E $) and magnetic ($\boldsymbol B$) fields. Except for the Drude part, the $B$-dependence arises exclusively from topological properties like the Berry curvature and the orbital magnetic moment. We solve the Boltzmann equations exactly in the linear-response regime, applicable in the limit of weak/nonquantising magnetic fields. The novelty of our investigation lies in the consideration of the truly multifold character of the TSMs, where the so-called flat-band (flatness being merely an artifact of linear-order approximations) is made dispersive by incorporating the appropriate quadratic-in-momentum correction in the effective Hamiltonian. It necessitates the consideration of interband scatterings within the same node as well, providing a complex interplay of intraband, interband, intranode, and internode processes. The exact results are compared with those obtained from a naive relaxation-time approximation.</description>

Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) originating from cosmological sources offer direct insights into the physics of the primordial Universe, the fundamental nature of gravity, and the cosmic expansion of the Universe. In this review paper, we present a comprehensive overview of our recent advances in GW cosmology, supported by the national key research and development program of China, focusing on cosmological GW sources and their implications for fundamental physics and cosmology. We first discuss the generation mechanisms and characteristics of stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds generated by physical processes occurred in the early Universe, including those from inflation, phase transitions, and topological defects, and summarize current and possible future constraints from pulsar timing array and space-based detectors. Next, we explore the formation and observational prospects of primordial black holes as GW sources and their potential connection to dark matter. We then analyze how GWs are affected by large-scale structure, cosmological perturbations, and possible modifications of gravity on GW propagation, and how these effects can be used to test fundamental symmetry of gravity. Finally, we discuss the application of GW standard sirens in measuring the Hubble constant, the expansion history, and dark energy parameters, including their combination with electromagnetic observations. These topics together show how GW observations, especially with upcoming space-based detectors, such as LISA, Taiji, and Tianqin, can provide new information about the physics of the early Universe, cosmological evolution, and the nature of gravity.</description>

      <title>Gauge symmetry breaking with $S^2$ extra dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider symmetry breaking of arbitrary gauge groups on a six-dimensional space-time which consists of a four-dimensional Minkowski space-time $M^4$ and a two-dimensional sphere $S^2$. We expand the gauge fields in the presence of a non-trivial background unique to $S^2$. We analyze Kaluza-Klein(KK) modes of the gauge fields and derive the mass spectrum of the KK modes. We found that the gauge fields (not) commuting with the background fields (do not) remain symmetry operators in four dimensions. We also discuss the mass spectrum of the extra-dimensional components of the gauge fields and identify a physical scalar $\phi$ and a Nambu-Goldstone mode $\chi$. As a result, we obtain a method to break gauge symmetry due to the nontrivial solution for gauge fields which is a unique feature of $S^2$.</description>

      <title>Tight Generalization of Robertson-Type Uncertainty Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the tightest possible Robertson-type preparation uncertainty relation, which explicitly depends on the eigenvalue spectrum of the quantum state. The conventional constant 1/4 is replaced by a state-dependent coefficient with the largest and smallest eigenvalues of the density operator. This coefficient is optimal among all Robertson-type generalizations and does not admit further improvement. Our relation becomes more pronounced as the quantum state becomes more mixed, capturing a trade-off in quantum uncertainty that the conventional Robertson relation fails to detect. In addition, our result provides a strict generalization of the Schroedinger uncertainty relation, showing that the uncertainty trade-off is governed by the sum of the covariance term and a state-dependent improvement over the Robertson bound. As applications, we also refine error-disturbance trade-offs by incorporating spectral information of both the system and the measuring apparatus, thereby generalizing the Arthurs-Goodman and Ozawa inequalities.</description>

      <title>Explicit classes in Habiro cohomology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a cycle description of the Habiro cohomology of a smooth variety $X$
  over the spectrum $B$ of an \'etale $Z[\lambda]$-algebra and construct explicit
  nontrivial cycles using either the Picard-Fuchs equation on $X/B$
  of a hypergeometric motive, or a push-forward of elements
  of the Habiro ring of $X/B$. In particular, we give explicit classes for
  1-parameter Calabi--Yau families.
  The $q$-hypergeometric origin of our cycles imply
  that they generate $q$-holonomic modules that define $q$-deformations of the
  classical Picard-Fuchs equation. We illustrate our theorems with three examples:
  the Legendre family of elliptic
  curves, the $A$-polynomial curve of the figure eight knot, and
  for the quintic three-fold, whose $q$-Picard Fuchs equation appeared in
  its genus $0$-quantum $K$-theory. Our methods give a unified treatment of
  quantum $K$-theory and complex Chern-Simons theory around higher dimensional
  critical loci.</description>

      <title>The modular Hamiltonian in asymptotically flat spacetime conformal to Minkowski</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a four-dimensional globally hyperbolic spacetime $(M,g)$ conformal to Minkowski spacetime, together with a massless, conformally coupled scalar field. Using a bulk-to-boundary correspondence, one can establish the existence of an injective $*$-homomorphism $\Upsilon_M$ between $\mathcal{W}(M)$, the Weyl algebra of observables on $M$ and a counterpart which is defined intrinsically on future null infinity $\Im^+\simeq\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{S}^2$, a component of the conformal boundary of $(M,g)$. Using invariance under the asymptotic symmetry group of $\Im^+$, we can individuate thereon a distinguished two-point correlation function whose pull-back to $M$ via $\Upsilon_M$ identifies a quasi-free Hadamard state for the bulk algebra of observables. In this setting, if we consider $\mathsf{V}^+_x$, a future light cone stemming from $x\in M$ as well as $\mathcal{W}(\mathsf{V}^+_x)=\mathcal{W}(M)|_{\mathsf{V}^+_x}$, its counterpart at the boundary is the Weyl subalgebra generated by suitable functions localized in $\mathsf{K}_x$, a positive half strip on $\Im^+$. To each such cone, we associate a standard subspace of the boundary one-particle Hilbert space, which coincides with the one associated naturally to $\mathsf{K}_x$. We extend such correspondence replacing $\mathsf{K}_x$ and $\mathsf{V}^+_x$ with deformed counterparts, denoted by $\mathsf{S}_C$ and $\mathsf{V}_C$. In addition, since the one particle Hilbert space at the boundary decomposes as a direct integral on the sphere of $U(1)$-currents defined on the real line, we prove that also the generator of the modular group associated to the standard subspace of $\mathsf{V}_C$ decomposes as a suitable direct integral. This result allows us to study the relative entropy between coherent states of the algebras associated to the deformed cones $\mathsf{V}_C$ establishing the quantum null energy condition.</description>

      <title>A frequentist view on the two-body decaying dark matter model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decaying dark matter (DDM) has emerged as an interesting framework to extend the Lambda-cold-dark-matter (LCDM) model, as many particle physics models predict that dark matter may not be stable over cosmic time and can impact structure formation. In particular, a model in which DM decays at a rate $\Gamma$ and imprints a velocity kick $v$ onto its decay products leads to a low amplitude of fluctuations, as quantified by the parameter $S_8$, in better agreement with that measured by some past weak lensing surveys. Bayesian analyses have provided mixed conclusions regarding its viability, with a reconstructed clustering amplitude only slightly below the standard LCDM value. In this paper, we perform a frequentist analysis of Planck+BAO data. We find $1\sigma$ constraints on the half-life of $6.93^{+7.88}_{-2.85}$Gyr and a velocity kick of $1250^{+1450}_{-1000}$km/s which differ from their Bayesian counterparts, indicating the presence of volume effects. Moreover, we find that under the DDM model, the frequentist analysis predicts lower values of $S_8$, in agreement with those found by KiDS-1000 and DES-Y3 at $1.5\sigma$. We further show that previously derived KiDS-1000 constraints that appeared to exclude the best-fit model from Planck data were driven by priors on the primordial parameters $A_s$ and $n_s$. When those are removed from the analysis, KiDS-1000 constraints on the DDM parameters are fully relaxed. It is only when applying Planck-informed priors on $A_s$ and $n_s$ to the KiDS-1000 analysis that one can constrain the model. We further highlight that in the absence of such priors, the region of scales best-measured by KiDS-1000 does not exactly match the $S_8$ kernel, but rather a slightly smaller range of scales centered around $k\sim 0.3\, h/$Mpc. One must thus be careful in applying $S_8$ constraints to a model instead of the full data likelihood.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present version 3 of Kira, a Feynman integral reduction program for high-precision calculations in quantum field theory and gravitational-wave physics. Building on previous versions, Kira 3 introduces optimized seeding and equation selection algorithms, significantly improving performance for multi-loop and multi-scale problems. New features include convenient numerical sampling, symbolic integration-by-parts reductions, and support for user-defined additional relations. We demonstrate its capabilities through benchmarks on two- and three-loop topologies, showcasing up to two orders of magnitude improvement over Kira 2.3. Kira 3 is publicly available and poised to support ambitious projects in particle physics and beyond.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we derive the five-dimensional non-Abelian $\mathcal{N}=1$ Chern-Simons action from its established definition of variation with respect to an infinitesimal deformation of the vector prepotential in a projective superspace setting. It has been a long-standing open problem how to integrate this variation. Now, thanks to the simplicity of a projective superspace technique, we have been finally able to obtain this term. As a bonus, we also give the supersymmetric Yang-Mills action with a half measure as well.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17269v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Elko is a spin-half fermion with a two-fold Wigner degeneracy and Klein-Gordon dynamics. In this paper, we show that in a spatially flat FLRW space-time, slow-roll inflation can be initiated by the homogeneous Elko fields. The inflaton is a composite scalar field obtained by contracting the spinor field with its dual. This is possible because the background evolution as described by the Friedmann equation is completely determined by the scalar field. This approach has the advantage that we do not need to specify the initial conditions for every component of the spinor fields. We derive the equation of motion for the inflaton and also show that this solution is an attractor. Finally, we examine the slow-roll parameters and the power-spectrum, showing that obtaining a behavior in agreement with observational requirements is hard to be obtained, unless one uses more complicated potentials, which may act a limitation of Elko inflation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Calabi-Yau compactifications have typically a large number of complex structure and/or K\"ahler moduli that have to be stabilised in phenomenologically-relevant vacua. The former can in principle be done by fluxes in type IIB solutions. However, the tadpole conjecture proposes that the number of stabilised moduli can at most grow linearly with the tadpole charge of the fluxes required for stabilisation. We scrutinise this conjecture in the $2^6$ Gepner model: a non-geometric background mirror dual to a rigid Calabi-Yau manifold, in the deep interior of moduli space. By constructing an extensive set of supersymmetric Minkowski flux solutions, we spectacularly confirm the linear growth, while achieving a slightly higher ratio of stabilised moduli to flux charge than the conjectured upper bound. As a byproduct, we obtain for the first time a set of solutions within the tadpole bound where all complex structure moduli are massive. Since the $2^6$ model has no K\"ahler moduli, these show that the massless Minkowski conjecture does not hold beyond supergravity.</description>

      <title>Effective field theories of dissipative fluids with one-form symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A system with a one-form global symmetry at finite temperature can be viewed as a dissipative fluid of string-like objects. In this work, we classify and construct the most general effective field theories for hydrodynamics of such string fluids, in a probe limit where the one-form charge density is decoupled from the energy-momentum tensor. We show that at leading order in the derivative expansion, there are two distinct types of diffusive transport in a string fluid depending on the discrete spacetime symmetries present in it. One particular application of interest is magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), where the effective field theories describe the diffusion of magnetic field lines. Due to the distinction between the effective field theories for different discrete symmetries, we show that the MHD of a fluid with charge conjugation symmetry is qualitatively different from that of a neutron star, which we previously discussed in arXiv:2207.01636. The explicit effective actions that we write down can be used to obtain the dispersion relations $\omega(k)$ up to cubic order in momenta for each of the different discrete symmetry choices. As another application of this formalism, we show that when the one-form symmetry is spontaneously broken, the effective action reduces to the Maxwell theory. This confirms the interpretation of the photon as a Goldstone boson arising from the spontaneous breaking of a one-form symmetry.</description>

Abstract: We derive analytic expressions for the Helmholtz free energy, Casimir force, and Casimir entropy for both one-dimensional and three-dimensional scalar fields with Dirichlet boundary conditions at finite temperature. We investigate the negative Casimir entropy problem in these systems, as well as for a scalar field in the bulk of a three-dimensional sphere, and find that this issue arises under different regularization prescriptions with differing counterterms. We argue against introducing any counterterms for the thermal corrections to the Casimir effect and predict that the thermal-fluctuation-induced Casimir force becomes repulsive in the high-temperature regime -- for instance, when $aT/(\pi\hbar{v})&gt;0.2419$ for three-dimensional scalar fields.</description>

      <title>Chaos and moduli space volumes in unorientable JT gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08129v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show the late time, or $\tau-$scaled, limit of the canonical spectral form factor (SFF) in unorientable JT gravity agrees with universal random matrix theory (RMT) up to genus one in the topological expansion, establishing a key signature of quantum chaos for the time-reversal symmetric case. The loop equations for an orthogonal matrix model with spectral curve $y(z) \propto \sin(2\pi z)$ are used to compute the moduli space volumes of unorientable surfaces. The divergences of the unorientable volumes are regularized by first regularizing the resolvents of the orthogonal matrix model. To this end, we make use of the large $p$ limit of the $(2,2p+1)$ minimal string model. Using properties of the volumes and the loop equations, we derive streamlined formulas to compute the volumes for one and two boundaries, giving explicit results up to genus one. We find the general structure of the unorientable volumes to be written in terms of multiple polylogarithms and zeta values, with weight determined by the genus, number of boundaries, and number of crosscaps. In the $\tau-$scaled limit, contributions to the SFF from the divergent parts of the volume cancel, and the SFF becomes finite and independent of regularization. The SFF from universal RMT is a distinct computation, that depends on the leading order energy density of JT gravity, which we also derive up to genus one.</description>

      <title>Classical Observables from Causal Response Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09016v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the calculation of classical observables from causal response functions, following up on recent work by Caron-Huot at al. [JHEP 01 (2024) 139]. We derive a formula to compute asymptotic in-in observables from a particular soft limit of five-point amputated response functions. Using such formula, we re-derive the formulas by Kosower, Maybee and O'Connell (KMOC) for the linear impulse and radiated linear momentum of particles undergoing scattering, and we present an unambiguous calculation of the radiated angular momentum at leading order. Then, we explore the consequences of manifestly causal Feynman rules in the calculation of classical observables by employing the causal (Keldysh) basis in the in-in formalism. We compute the linear impulse, radiated waveform and its variance at leading and/or next-to-leading order in the causal basis, and find that all terms singular in the $\hbar \to 0$ limit cancel manifestly at the integrand level. We also find that the calculations simplify considerably and classical properties such as factorization of six-point amplitudes are more transparent in the causal basis.</description>

      <title>Higher obstructions to conformal boundary conditions and lattice realizations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although it is long believed that vanishing of chiral central charges of a 2d conformal field theory (CFT) implies the existence of conformal boundary conditions, there are yet higher obstructions. In this paper, we focus on 2d rational CFTs, for which we identify a series of obstructions, known as higher central charges. We also discuss its implication for lattice realizations and the generalization with global symmetries.</description>

Abstract: By extending the six-dimensional hybrid formalism for the superstring to include $d=6$ $\mathcal{N}=1$ superspace variables along with unconstrained bosonic ghost fields, we construct a manifestly spacetime supersymmetric vertex operator $U$. We demonstrate that the BRST invariance of $U$ implies the $d=6$ $\mathcal{N}=1$ SYM equations of motion in superspace. Furthermore, we show that spacetime supersymmetric scattering amplitudes can be computed in a manner analogous to that of the non-minimal pure spinor formalism.</description>

      <title>States and IR divergences in factorization algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08183v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There are several choices of states. In factorization algebras, we often use a natural augmentation state $\langle-\rangle_{\rm aug}$. In physics, we use a state given by compactification of spacetime $\langle-\rangle_{\rm cptf}$, or a state corresponding Schwartz boundary condition $\langle-\rangle_{\rm Sch}$. At first glance, the relation between these three states is not so clear.
  In this paper, propose a definition of compactification method in factorization algebras and give a way to treat IR divergences in massless theory. As a result, we see the three sates are equivalent both in massive theory and massless theory.</description>

      <title>Unitarity constrains the quantum information metrics for particle interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12585v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unitarity provides mathematical and physical constraints on quantum information systems. e.g., in entanglement swapping, unitarity requires the same von Neumann entanglement entropy generation for either a particle interaction or an act of measurement. For the first time, the language of non-relativistic quantum mechanics is presented to derive the density matrix for hard scattering. We show that unitarity allows for finding the latter's cross section without using the scattering amplitude or the Lippmann-Schwinger equation plus Green's function. We also show the language of relativistic quantum mechanics can be used to derive the momentum entropy or Sackur-Tetrode equation for the inelastic scattering of an electron from a proton. The latter entropy derives from a Shannon entropy and an additional entropy that evokes the uncertainty principle. This article's presentation allows particle physicists to readily begin calculating quantum information metrics such as correlations and mutual information for any particle interaction.</description>

      <title>Remark on the Emergence of Color Superconductivity for Gauge Theories in General Spacetime Dimensions from simple Holographic Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17875v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize the concept of holography for the color superconductivity (CSC) phase by considering $d$-dimensional Anti de Sitter (AdS) space instead of the traditional 6 dimensions. The corresponding dual field theory is an arbitrary confining gauge theory with $SU(N_c)$ symmetry, like quantum chromodynamics (QCD) CSC. We then use a holographic model based on Einstein-Maxwell gravity in $d$-dimensional AdS spacetime to study this phenomenon in both confinement and deconfinement phase, study the confinement$-$deconfinement phase transition and the condition for the $N_c=2$ CSC phase with $d=4$ case, one special case from arXiv:2411.05550</description>

      <title>The nucleon properties in finite temperature and density with Gaussian fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of nucleons at finite temperature and density using a two-flavor quark meson model with Gaussian fluctuations that extend beyond the mean-field approximation. Our findings suggest that Gaussian fluctuations lead to a non-monotonic behavior of the nucleon mass as a function of temperature and density, which may play an important role in the study of the hadronization process of relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Moreover, we observe an increase in the nucleon radius due to Gaussian fluctuations, suggesting an effective repulsive force akin to the Casimir effect, as observed in the gold-bromobenzene-silica system. This study offers new insights into how temperature, density, and quantum fluctuations affect the structure and properties of nucleons under extreme conditions.</description>

      <title>Quantization of Carrollian fermions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05645v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide the first example of interacting quantized Carrollian Dirac fermions and investigate their discrete symmetries, including charge conjugation (C), parity (P), and time reversal (T) transformations. As a toy model, we couple these fermions to a Carrollian scalar field using Carrollian Yukawa theory and compute the tree-level diagram, revealing an ultralocal interaction between the Carrollian fermions and the scalar field. This interaction, widely known as a Dirac delta interaction with time-dependent factor, frequently appears in quantum physics. We then address the renormalization of the theory by employing the Wilsonian procedure at one-loop order. Furthermore, we analyze the fixed points and stability properties of Carrollian Yukawa theory, comparing them with their relativistic counterparts. Beyond the specific Yukawa model studied here, we expect that our framework will have broader applications in Carrollian physics, particularly in understanding ultralocal interactions and their role in condensed matter systems, where similar phenomena arise in strongly correlated and non-relativistic regimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20310v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study properties of non-Lorentzian geometries arising from BPS decoupling limits of string theory that are central to matrix theory and the AdS/CFT correspondence. We focus on duality transformations between ten-dimensional non-Lorentzian geometries coupled to matrix theory on D-branes. We demonstrate that T- and S-duality transformations exhibit novel asymmetric properties: depending not only on the choice of transformation but also on the value of the background fields, the codimension of the foliation structure of the dual non-Lorentzian background may be different or the same. This duality asymmetry underlies features observed in the study of non-commutativity and Morita equivalence in matrix and gauge theory. Finally, we show how the holographic correspondence involving non-commutative Yang-Mills fits into our framework, from which we further obtain novel holographic examples with non-Lorentzian bulk geometries.</description>

      <title>Perturbative aspects of the supersymmetric three-dimensional massive QED</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19575v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform the study of perturbative aspects of a three-dimensional supersymmetric Maxwell-Chern-Simons-Proca theory minimally coupled to scalar superfields. Using the superfield formalism, we derive the propagators for both gauge and matter superfields and compute the leading quantum corrections to the effective action. The presence of the Proca-like term explicitly breaks gauge invariance, modifying the structure of the gauge superfield propagator and leading to an essentially new form of quantum contributions in comparison with the usual QED. We analyze the Feynman diagrams that contribute to the quadratic part of the effective action, obtaining corrections to both the kinetic and mass terms of the scalar superfields. Furthermore, we discuss the UV behavior of the model, considering its renormalization properties and the possibility of perturbative finiteness to all loop orders, similar to supersymmetric QED$_3$. Finally, we highlight potential applications of this model in condensed matter systems and possible connections with modified supersymmetric electrodynamics and dualities in lower-dimensional theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The soft photon and soft graviton theorems of Weinberg are known to derive from conservation laws associated with asymptotic symmetries. Within the corresponding classical theories, one often speaks of spontaneous symmetry breaking and vacuum degeneracy, but a genuine quantum description of this phenomenon has largely been lacking. Here we establish spontaneous breaking of asymptotic symmetries and the existence of Goldstone `particles' using exclusively the language of quantum field theory. This is made possible through the reformulation of massless scattering theory in terms of carrollian conformal field theory, and the observation that soft theorems correspond to Ward identities of broken symmetries. A suitable version of Goldstone theorem shows that there must exist zero-momentum particles described by conformal fields on the celestial sphere, in agreement with the common lore. More specifically, these belong to unitary representations in the discrete series of the Lorentz group, and are therefore naturally equipped with logarithmic two-point functions. We discuss the relevance of these observations to the problem of infrared divergences that scattering amplitudes suffer from.</description>

Abstract: Based on the studies of pseudo-entropy in de Sitter, there have been recent proposals for a timelike entanglement in AdS/CFT. In this work, we explore this proposal in the context of a holographic CFT undergoing a global quench. We study various cases in which the timelike intervals are anchored at various boundary times, sometimes straddling the infalling shell. Our results seem to be consistent with how the quenched CFT evolves towards thermalization.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the non-equilibrium time evolution of symmetry-resolved entanglement entropy (SREE) following an inhomogeneous quench in a critical one-dimensional free fermion system. Using conformal field theory, we derive an exact expression for the SREE and analyze its behavior. We find that, at leading order in the long-time limit, the SREE grows logarithmically as $\log t$. While the equipartition of entanglement holds at leading order, we identify subleading corrections that break it. Our numerical simulations corroborate the analytical predictions with excellent agreement.</description>

      <title>On consistency of the interacting (anti)holomorphic higher-spin sector</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13125v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the recently proposed generating systems for the (anti)holomorphic sector of the 4d higher spin theory and for the off-shell higher spin theory in generic dimension locality was achieved due to a peculiar limiting star product. Even though the generating systems exhibit all-order locality, the product itself encounters uncertainties when functions from specific classes are multiplied. This fact leads to the absence of the Leibniz rule for the differential operator acting on the auxiliary variables $z$ and, hence, its ambiguous definition in the generating equations. We identify the gap in the original proof of consistency associated with this freedom. Nonetheless considered generating systems are perfectly consistent as shown by direct computations on the resulting vertices. Considering specific orderings of fields we show that consistency rests on the star-exchange-like identities for the limiting star product formulated and proved here. Connection with the 4d Vasiliev theory is discussed.</description>

Abstract: Recently it is asserted that the standard beta function does not describe the correct running of the coupling constant in some theories. We show that the problem arises from the assumption $\mu=p$ ($\mu$ is a renormalization point) and that a suitable choice of $\mu$ gives the correct running. It is also claimed that neither the cosmological constant nor Newton coupling run. We argue that running can be discussed when we consider the curved spacetime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02318v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the response tensors in planar Hall (or planar thermal Hall) configurations such that a three-dimensional Weyl or multi-Weyl semimetal is subjected to the influence of an electric field $\mathbf E $ (or temperature gradient $\nabla_{\mathbf r } T$) and an effective magnetic field $\mathbf B^{\rm tot}$, which are oriented at a generic angle with respect to each other. The effective magnetic field consists of two parts: (a) an actual/physical magnetic field $\mathbf B $, and (b) an emergent magnetic field $\mathbf B_5 $ which quantifies the elastic deformations of the sample. $\mathbf B_5 $ is an axial pseudomagnetic field because it couples to conjugate nodal points with opposite chiralities with opposite signs. We study the interplay of the orientations of these two components of $\mathbf B^{\rm tot}$ with respect to the direction of the electric field (or temperature gradient) and elucidate how it affects the characteristics involving the chirality of the node. Additionally, we show that the magnitude and sharpness of the conductivity tensor profiles strongly depend on the value of the topological charge at the node in question.</description>

Abstract: Quantum entanglement manifests itself in non-local correlations between the constituents of a system. In its simplest realization, a measurement on one subsystem is affected by a prior measurement on its partner, irrespective of their separation. For multiple parties, purely collective types of entanglement exist but their detection, even theoretically, remains an outstanding open question. Here, we argue that all forms of multipartite entanglement entirely disappear during the typical evolution of a physical state as it heats up, evolves in time in a large family of dynamical protocols, or as its parts become separated. We focus on the generic case where the system interacts with an environment. These results mainly follow from the geometry of the entanglement-free continent in the space of physical states, and hold in great generality. We illustrate these phenomena with a frustrated molecular quantum magnet in and out of equilibrium, and a quantum spin chain. In contrast, if the particles are fermions, such as electrons, another notion of entanglement exists that protects bipartite quantum correlations. However, genuinely collective fermionic entanglement disappears during typical evolution, thus sharing the same fate as in bosonic systems. These findings provide fundamental knowledge about the structure of entanglement in quantum matter and architectures, paving the way for its manipulation.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Flavor Symmetry Landscape</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09503v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore flavor dynamics in the broad scenario of a strongly interacting light Higgs (SILH). Our study focuses on the mechanism of partial fermion compositeness, but is otherwise as systematic as possible. Concretely, we classify the options for the underlying flavor (and CP) symmetries, which are necessary in order to bring this scenario safely within the range of present or future explorations. Our main goal in this context is to provide a practical map between the space of hypotheses (the models) and the experimental ground that will be explored in the medium and long term, in both indirect and direct searches, in practice at HL-LHC and Belle II, in EDM searches and eventually at FCC-hh. Our study encompasses scenarios with the maximal possible flavor symmetry, corresponding to minimal flavor violation (MFV), scenarios with no symmetry, corresponding to the so-called flavor anarchy, and various intermediate cases that complete the picture. One main result is that the scenarios that allow for the lowest new physics scale have intermediate flavor symmetry rather than the maximal symmetry of MFV models. Such optimal models are rather resilient to indirect exploration via flavor and CP violating observables, and can only be satisfactorily explored at a future high-energy collider. On the other hand, the next two decades of indirect exploration will significantly stress the parameter space of a large swath of less optimal but more generic models up to mass scales competing with those of the FCC-hh.</description>

      <title>Large Angular Momentum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14931v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum states of a spin $\tfrac{1}{2}$ (a qubit) are parametrized by the space ${\mathbf {CP}}^1 \sim S^2$, the Bloch sphere. A spin $j$ for a generic $j$ (a $2j+1$-state system) is represented instead by a point of a larger space, ${\mathbf {CP}}^{2j}$. Here we study the state of a single angular momentum/spin in the limit, $j \to \infty$. The special class of states $ | j, {\mathbf n}\rangle \in {\mathbf {CP}}^{2j} $, with spin oriented towards definite spatial directions ${\mathbf n} \in S^2$, i.e., $({\mathbf J}\cdot {\mathbf n} ) \, | j, {\mathbf n}\rangle = j\, |j, {\mathbf n}\rangle $, are found to behave as classical angular momenta, $j \, {\mathbf n}$, in this limit. Vice versa, general spin states in ${\mathbf {CP}}^{2j}$ do not become classical, even at large $j$. We discuss these questions, by analysing the Stern-Gerlach processes, the angular-momentum composition rule, and the rotation matrix. Our observations help to clarify better how classical mechanics emerges from quantum mechanics in this context (e.g., with unique trajectories for a particle carrying a large spin), and to make the widespread idea that large spins somehow become classical, more precise.</description>

      <title>Resonant Forbidden CP Asymmetry from Soft Leptons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06555v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To explain the baryon asymmetry in the early universe via leptogenesis, quantum corrections to new particles are commonly invoked to generate the necessary CP asymmetry. We demonstrate, however, that a large CP asymmetry can already arise from Standard Model leptons. The mechanism relies on resummation of soft leptons at finite temperatures. The CP asymmetry, which is kinematically forbidden in vacuum, can be resonantly enhanced from thermally resummed leptons by seven orders of magnitude. Contrary to the resonance from exotic particles, we show that the resonant enhancement from soft leptons is protected by controlled widths under finite-temperature perturbation theory. We quantify such CP asymmetries in leptogenesis with secluded flavor effects and comment on the significance and application. The mechanism exploits the maximal role of leptons themselves, featuring low-scale leptogenesis, minimal model buildings and dark matter cogenesis.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-wave effects in the most general vector-tensor theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11838v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a model-independent framework based on the Isaacson picture to analyze the gravitational-wave effects in the most general vector-tensor theory that yields second-order field equations. Within this framework, we derive two basic sets of equations for the Isaacson picture. These equations enable the analysis of gravitational wave polarization modes, the dispersion relation of each mode, the effective energy-momentum tensor of gravitational waves, and the memory effects. These features are closely tied to observable phenomena and have attracted considerable attention. They are expected to be detected by the next generation of gravitational wave observatories designed to test potential modifications to general relativity. Using this framework, we present the explicit expression for the effective energy-momentum tensor of gravitational waves in the most general second-order vector-tensor theory and perform a complete analysis of their polarization modes.</description>

      <title>Berry Curvature and Spin-One Color Superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08005v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the interplay between Berry curvature and topological properties in single-flavor color superconductors, where quarks form spin-one Cooper pairs. By deriving a new relation, we connect the topological nodal structure of the gap function in momentum space to the (nonabelian) Berry flux associated with paired quarks. This generalizes the early work by Li and Haldane [Phys. Rev. Lett. 120, 067003 (2018)] to systems with additional internal quantum numbers, such as color. In the ultrarelativistic limit, we uncover rich topological structures driven by the interplay of spin, chirality, and color. Specifically, we identify chirality-induced topological nodes in the transverse (opposite chirality pairing) polar and A phases. In contrast, the color-spin-locking phase lacks these nodes due to a nontrivial color Berry flux, which in turn induces gapless excitations with total Berry monopole charges of $\pm 3/2-$differing from conventional Weyl fermions. Our findings can be potentially extended to other fermionic systems carrying additional internal degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Learning Fricke signs from Maass form Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we conduct a data-scientific investigation of Maass forms. We find that averaging the Fourier coefficients of Maass forms with the same Fricke sign reveals patterns analogous to the recently discovered "murmuration" phenomenon, and that these patterns become more pronounced when parity is incorporated as an additional feature. Approximately 43% of the forms in our dataset have an unknown Fricke sign. For the remaining forms, we employ Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to machine learn their Fricke sign, achieving 96% (resp. 94%) accuracy for forms with even (resp. odd) parity. We apply the trained LDA model to forms with unknown Fricke signs to make predictions. The average values based on the predicted Fricke signs are computed and compared to those for forms with known signs to verify the reasonableness of the predictions. Additionally, a subset of these predictions is evaluated against heuristic guesses provided by Hejhal's algorithm, showing a match approximately 95% of the time. We also use neural networks to obtain results comparable to those from the LDA model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08777v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe deformations of the classical principle chiral model and 1+1 Gaudin model related to ${\rm GL}_N$ Lie group. The deformations are generated by $R$-matrices satisfying the associative Yang-Baxter equation. Using the coefficients of the expansion for these $R$-matrices we derive equations of motion based on a certain ansatz for $U$-$V$ pair satisfying the Zakharov-Shabat equation. Another deformation comes from the twist function, which we identify with the cocentral charge in the affine Higgs bundle underlying the Hitchin approach to 2d integrable models.</description>

      <title>Curvature perturbations from vacuum transition during inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01632v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that in the presence of a light scalar spectator field, vacuum transitions taking place during inflation can produce large, potentially detectable non-Gaussian signatures in the primordial curvature perturbation. Such transitions are common in theories with multiple scalar fields when the potential has several minima. Our computation proceeds by numerically finding the instanton solution that describes quantum tunnelling between vacuum states in a de Sitter background, calculating its dependence on the spectator field and, thereby, its effect on the expansion of space. For a scenario with Higgs inflation, we obtain the non-Gaussianity parameter $f_\mathrm{NL} \sim O(10)$ and study its parameter dependence.</description>

      <title>Classification of Gapped Domain Walls of Topological Orders in 2+1 dimensions: A Levin-Wen Model Realization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel systematic construction of gapped domain walls (GDWs) within the Levin-Wen (LW) model. By gluing two LW models along their open sides in a compatible way, we achieve a complete GDW classification by subsets of bulk input data, which encompass the classifications in terms of bimodule categories. A generalized bimodule structure is introduced to capture domain-wall excitations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that folding along any GDW yields a gapped boundary (GB) described by a Frobenius algebra of the input UFC for the folded model, thus bridging our GDW classification and the GB classification in \cite{hu2018boundary}.</description>

      <title>On the cosmological degrees of freedom of Proca field with non-minimal coupling to gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07454v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Proca theory with non-minimal coupling to gravity through the Ricci tensor and Ricci scalar interactions. We show that in the homogeneous and isotropic Universe together with cosmological constant, the temporal component of the vector field acquires a background value. As a result, we show that the theory propagates an additional degree of freedom, with respect to the generalized Proca theories, whose kinetic term suggests the presence of several strong coupling regimes that depend on the value of the background solution, the combination and vanishing of coupling constants, together with a scale-dependent one. We show in addition, that the speed of propagation for this mode vanishes, indicating the presence of another type of strong coupling. To further investigate this, we extend our analysis to the Bianchi Type I Universe, with the most general solution for the vector field. We show that the extra degree of freedom remains in the theory. Among the modes, we further show that the mode with vanishing speed of propagation is still present, pointing to the strong coupling. In addition, we discover a mode with scale-dependent strong coupling (vanishing kinetic term), one mode that propagates only in one single direction and two unstable modes.</description>

Abstract: We study the coupling selection rules associated with non-group symmetries, i.e., $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauging of $\mathbb{Z}_M$ symmetries. We clarify which Yukawa textures can be derived by our selection rules for $M=3, 4$, and 5, and obtain various textures including the the nearest neighbor interaction type and its extension. Some of them cannot be realized by a conventional group-like symmetry. They lead to interesting phenomenology such as a solution to the strong CP problem without axion.</description>

      <title>Chiral vortex-line liquid of three-dimensional interacting Bose systems with moat dispersion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01080v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate and investigate a novel quantum state, the Chiral Vortex-Line Liquid (CVLL), emerging in three-dimensional interacting Bose systems exhibiting moat-band dispersions. Such dispersions feature extensive degeneracy along closed manifolds in momentum space, significantly amplifying quantum fluctuations that suppress conventional Bose-Einstein condensation. By extending the two-dimensional Chern-Simons (CS) flux-attachment transformation to three dimensions through a combination of planar CS phases and Jordan-Wigner fermionization along vortex lines, we construct the CVLL state, characterized by preserved rotational $SO(2)$ symmetry, broken time-reversal symmetry, nontrivial vortex-line excitations, and topological gapless edge surface states. We construct the associated field theory in a curved spatial geometry and analyze the low-energy effective theory of the CVLL state, demonstrating its topological nature. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we numerically determine the scaling of the chemical potential of the CVLL ground state as a function of boson density for interacting bosons in a cylindrical moat-band geometry and demonstrate that the CVLL phase energetically outcompetes traditional condensate phases at low densities, highlighting its relevance to experimental platforms including frustrated quantum magnets, ultracold atomic gases, the physics of rotons in $^4$He, and moat regimes in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01770v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We recently reported new results on the $\gamma^{(*)} + N(940)\frac{1}{2}^+ \to \Delta(1700)\frac{3}{2}^{-}$ transition form factors using a symmetry-preserving treatment of a vector$\,\otimes\,$vector contact interaction (SCI) within a coupled formalism based on the Dyson-Schwinger, Bethe-Salpeter, and Faddeev equations. In this work, we extend our investigation to the $\gamma^{(*)} + N(940)\frac{1}{2}^+ \to N(1520)\frac{3}{2}^{-}$ transition. Our computed transition form factors show reasonable agreement with experimental data at large photon virtualities. However, deviations emerge at low $Q^2$, where experimental results exhibit a sharper variation than theoretical predictions. This discrepancy is expected, as these continuum QCD analyses account only for the quark-core of baryons, while low photon virtualities are dominated by meson cloud effects. We anticipate that these analytical predictions, based on the simplified SCI framework, will serve as a valuable benchmark for more refined studies and QCD-based truncations that incorporate quark angular momentum and the contributions of scalar and vector diquarks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02786v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that 4-dimensional maximally symmetric spacetimes can be obtained from a coherent state quantisation of gravity, always resulting in geometries that approach the Minkowski vacuum exponentially away from the radius of curvature. A possible connection with the central charge in the AdS/CFT correspondence is also noted.</description>

      <title>Hodge Dual Gauge Symmetry in Minimal Einstein-Aether Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12641v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Einstein-aether gravity is a theory that breaks the local Lorentz symmetry by introducing a preferred direction via a vector field, which is considered to play the role of an aether. The theory is identified by four coupling constants between the aether and gravity. Minimal Einstein-aether is the special case in which only one of the couplings is non-zero. We show that the aether vector field in its minimal version is Hodge dual to a gauge field. The gauge symmetry in the dual description has been known for decades and has been used to implement a cosmological constant into the Lagrangian. As a result, solutions to the well-established gauge theory can be transferred into the minimal Einstein-aether theory straightforwardly. On the other hand, some of the proposed solutions to the minimal Einstein-aether theory could be discarded as pure gauges of the vanishing aether. We prove as a theorem that this holds true for all divergence-less aether fields.</description>

      <title>What is the Hierarchy Problem?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00694v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Is there a Hierarchy Problem? If so, what, exactly, is the problem? Almost every theorist has a personal answer to these questions. In this article, I give my answers. I will explain that the Hierarchy Problem is not a formal problem but rather our ignorance of a crucial physics explanation -- the explanation of the nature of the Higgs boson. Without the solution to this problem, we cannot make progress on the major questions of our field.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Dark Energy Emerges from Massive Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03870v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate that a dynamical dark energy component predicted by massive gravity gives rise to a distinctive evolution of the equation of state. This scenario is favoured over the standard $\Lambda$CDM model when confronted with the latest combined datasets from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), the cosmic microwave background (CMB), and supernova observations. The model stands out as a rare example of a healthy, self-consistent theory that accommodates phantom dark energy while maintaining a technically natural, small asymptotic cosmological constant. Our analysis indicates a preferred graviton mass of approximately $4.0 \times 10^{-33} \text{eV}$, suggesting the emergence of a new cosmological length scale. This leads to a maximal deviation of the equation of state around $z \sim 3$, a prediction that will be robustly tested by upcoming, deeper surveys of baryon acoustic oscillations.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Thermodynamics in Harada's inspired theory of gravity: Stability, Phase Structure and Geometrothermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the thermodynamic properties of spherically symmetric, static black hole solutions within the framework of Conformal Killing Gravity (CKG). This is a modified theory of gravity that retains all solutions of General Relativity, while addressing some of its theoretical shortcomings and enriching gravitational phenomenology at large distances. We derive key thermodynamic quantities, including mass, temperature, heat capacity and Gibbs free energy, to examine the stability and phase structure of extended Schwarzschild-AdS and charged AdS black holes. Furthermore, employing the formalism of geometrothermodynamics, we analyze the behavior of the thermodynamic curvature scalar to identify critical points and characterize phase transitions. Our results demonstrate that the parameter \( \lambda \), which quantifies deviations from Einstein's theory, plays a pivotal role in shaping the thermodynamic behavior, resulting in new stability conditions and distinct phase transition patterns compared to those predicted by standard General Relativity.</description>

      <title>Aspects of the WIMP quality problem and R-parity violation in natural supersymmetry with all axion dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09785v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In supersymmetric models where the mu problem is solved via discrete R-symmetries, then both the global U(1)_{PQ} (Peccei-Quinn, needed to solve the strong CP problem) and R-parity conservation (RPC, needed for proton stability) are expected to arise as accidental, approximate symmetries. Then in some cases, SUSY dark matter is expected to be all axions since the relic lightest SUSY particles (LSPs) can decay away via small R-parity violating (RPV) couplings. We examine several aspects of this {\it all axion} SUSY dark matter scenario. 1. We catalogue the operator suppression which is gained from discrete R-symmetry breaking via four two-extra-field base models. 2. We present exact tree-level LSP decay rates including mixing and phase space effects and compare to results from simple, approximate formulae. 3. Natural SUSY models are characterized by light higgsinos with mass ~100-350 GeV so that the dominant sparticle production cross sections at LHC14 are expected to be higgsino pair production which occurs at the 10^2-10^4 fb level. Assuming nature is natural, the lack of an RPV signal from higgsino pair production in LHC data translates into rather strong upper bounds on nearly all trilinear RPV couplings in order to render the SUSY signal (nearly) invisible. Thus, in natural SUSY models with light higgsinos, the RPV-couplings must be small enough that the LSP has a rather high quality of RPC.</description>

      <title>Classical integrable spin chains of Landau-Lifshitz type from R-matrix identities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09918v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe a family of 1+1 classical integrable space-discrete models of the Landau-Lifshitz type through the usage of ansatz for $U$-$V$ (Lax) pair with spectral parameter satisfying the semi-discrete Zakharov-Shabat equation. The ansatz for $U$-$V$ pair is based on $R$-matrices satisfying the associative Yang-Baxter equation and certain additional properties. Equations of motion are obtained using a set of $R$-matrix identities. In the continuous limit we reproduce the previously known family of the higher rank Landau-Lifshitz equations.</description>

      <title>Scale Factorized-Quantum Field Theory (SF-QFT): An innovative framework for yielding scale and scheme invariant observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09947v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Scale Factorized-Quantum Field Theory (SF-QFT), a framework that performs path-integral factorization of ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) momentum modes at a physical scale $Q^*$ before perturbative expansion. This approach yields a UV-finite effective action whose Wilson coefficients $C_i(Q)$ and coupling $a_{\mathrm{eff}}(Q)$ are fixed by matching to experiment. Because the two-loop $\beta$-function is universal in massless QCD, $a_{\mathrm{eff}}(Q)$ evolves with a scheme-independent equation, with higher-order $\beta$-coefficients absorbed into the $C_i$. Applying SF-QFT to the inclusive ratio $R_{e^{+}e^{-}}$ gives $R^{\mathrm{SF-QFT}}(31.6\,\mathrm{GeV}) = 1.05221 \pm 0.0007$, in excellent agreement with experiment ($R^{\mathrm{exp}}(31.6\,\mathrm{GeV})= 1.0527 \pm 0.005$) while requiring orders of magnitude fewer calculations than a conventional four-loop $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ approach. We find universal algebraic recursion relations that generate all higher-order contributions without additional Feynman diagrams, yielding scheme-invariant predictions with remarkable convergence with a closed-form solution. SF-QFT provides a rigorous proof for the existence of a positive mass gap in Yang-Mills theory, resolving one of the Millennium Prize Problems by demonstrating how non-perturbative effects emerge naturally from the path-integral factorization. For QED, the same formalism integrates out high-energy modes above $Q^*$, producing scheme-independent predictions for the electron anomalous magnetic moment with unprecedented precision ($a_e^{\text{theory}} = 0.001\,159\,652\,180\,61(76))$). SF-QFT heralds a paradigm shift in quantum field theory, replacing the pursuit of ever-higher loop orders with a unified framework that handles both perturbative and non-perturbative physics while maintaining manifest gauge invariance and eliminating renormalization ambiguities.</description>

      <title>Curvature corrections to Starobinsky inflation can explain the ACT results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10305v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of curvature corrections to Starobinsky inflation in light of the latest observational results from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). While the pure Starobinsky model remains a compelling candidate for cosmic inflation, we explore how the higher-order curvature terms $R^3$, $R^{4}$ and $R^{3/2}$ modify the inflationary predictions. Using the scalar-tensor formulation of $f(R)$ gravity, we derive the effective scalar potentials and compute the resulting scalar tilt $n_s$, its running index $\alpha_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. We show that those curvature corrections can shift the predictions to align better with the ACT data, thus providing a possible resolution to a minor discrepancy between the standard Starobinsky model and ACT observations. Our findings suggest that the modified Starobinsky models with the higher-order curvature terms offer a viable pathway to reconciling inflationary predictions with precision cosmological measurements. At the same time, measuring or constraining primordial tensor modes can help to discriminate between these corrections.</description>

      <title>Some Aspects of Three-Quark Potentials (Part II)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We continue our investigation of the effective string model for the triply heavy quark system, mimicking that in pure $SU(3)$ gauge theory. We present analytical and numerical studies of the three-quark potential for isosceles and collinear geometries. In the general case, we derive the asymptotic expression of the potential in the infrared limit. Here we also demonstrate the universality of the string tension and interpret the transition between two distinct regimes, occurring when one of the triangle's angles formed by the quarks is equal to $\frac{2}{3}\pi$, as a breaking of permutational symmetry. This symmetry breaking implies the emergence of a heavy quark dressed by gluons, transforming in the two-index antisymmetric representation. Additionally, we discuss various aspects of the $Y$- and $\Delta$-laws, diquarks, and connections to lattice QCD.</description>

      <title>What Price Fiber Bundle Substantivalism? On How to Avoid Holes in Fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12876v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On a mathematically foundational level, our most successful physical theories (gauge field theories and general-relativistic theories) are formulated in a framework based on the differential geometry of connections on principal bundles. After reviewing the essentials of this framework, we articulate the generalized hole and point-coincidence arguments, examining how they weight on a substantivalist position towards bundle spaces. This question, then, is considered in light of the Dressing Field Method, which allows a manifestly invariant reformulation of gauge field theories and general-relativistic theories, making their conceptual structure more transparent: it formally implements the point-coincidence argument and thus allows to define (dressed) fields and (dressed) bundle spaces immune to hole-type arguments.</description>

      <title>Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves in Palatini $f(R)$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13420v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial scalar perturbations that reenter the horizon after inflation may induce a second-order Gravitational Wave spectrum with information about the primordial Universe on scales inaccessible to Cosmic Microwave Background experiments. In this work, we develop a general framework for the study of Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves in Palatini $f(R)$ gravity, a theory that was proven to successfully realise inflation and quintessence, and consider the case of the Starobinsky-like model as an example. A regime of radiation domination with a subdominant matter component is assumed, allowing for a well-motivated perturbative approach to the gravity modifications. We calculate the kernel function and the density spectrum numerically and find accurate analytical expressions. The spectral density, which may be tested across a wide range of frequencies by upcoming Gravitational Wave experiments, is shown to differ from the General Relativity and metric $f(R)$ gravity predictions under certain conditions. We comment on previous results in the literature regarding the metric formulation and make special emphasis on the potential of these distinctive features of the spectrum to probe the two formalisms of gravity.</description>
