      <title>Atomic oxygen densities in He/O$_2$ micro-scaled atmospheric pressure plasma jets: a systematic model validation study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reactive species produced by atmospheric pressure plasma jets have high application potential in the fields of biomedicine and surface processing. An extensive validation between the simulation results in this work and measurement data from various research groups is carried out in order to reliably understand the complicated chemical kinetics defining the reactive species densities. Atomic oxygen densities in parallel plate radio frequency driven He/O$_2$ micro-scaled atmospheric pressure plasma jets ($\mu$APPJs) have been measured in the literature by several research groups with different methods including: two-photon absorption laser induced fluorescence (TALIF) spectroscopy and optical emission spectroscopy (OES)-based methods. These measurement data with a variation of the absorbed power, the He gas flow rate and the O$_2$ mixture ratio are simulated in this paper with a zero-dimensional (0-D) plasma-chemical plug-flow model coupled with a two-term Boltzmann equation solver. The simulated atomic oxygen densities agree well with most of the measured ones. Specifically, good agreement is achieved between the simulations and most of the TALIF measurements over a range of operating conditions. Our model prediction accuracy relative to these TALIF measurements is quantified by the percentage error between the measured and simulated atomic oxygen densities. An approximate normal distribution is observed in the histogram plot of the percentage error, and the mean is close to zero. The mean is shifted positively and negatively in the case of removing a dominant atomic oxygen gain and loss reaction channel, which implies the underestimation and overestimation of the simulation results relative to the measurement data, respectively. This indicates that proper incorporation of the dominant reaction channels in the simulations plays a key role in the model prediction accuracy.</description>

      <title>Plasma-state metasurfaces for ultra-intensive field manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-power lasers offer ultrahigh intensities for plasma interactions, but they lack advanced techniques to control the properties of the fields, because no optical elements could withstand their high intensities. The vibrant field of metasurfaces has transformed modern optics by enabling unprecedented control over light at subwavelength through deliberate design. However, metasurfaces have traditionally been limited to solid-state materials and low light intensities. Extending the sophisticated capabilities of metasurfaces from solids into the plasma realm would open new horizons for high-field science. Here, we experimentally demonstrate plasma-state metasurfaces (PSMs) through the photonic spin Hall effect and stable-propagating vortex beam generation irradiated by intense light. Time-resolved pump-probe measurements reveal that the functionality of PSMs can persist for several picoseconds, making them suitable for controlling ultra-intense femtosecond lasers, even in state-of-the-art multi-petawatt systems. Harnessing the powerful toolkit of metasurfaces, this approach holds the promise to revolutionize our ability to manipulate the amplitude, phase, polarization, and wavefront of high-power lasers during their pulse duration. It also opens new possibilities for innovative applications in laser-plasma interactions such as compact particle acceleration and novel radiation sources.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Laboratory Benchmark of K-shell Dielectronic Satellites of Fe XXV-XXI Ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on comprehensive laboratory studies of the K-shell dielectronic recombination (DR) resonances of Fe XXV - XXI ions that prominently contribute to the hard X-ray spectrum of hot astrophysical plasmas. By scanning a monoenergetic electron beam to resonantly excite trapped Fe ions in an electron beam ion trap, and achieving a high electron-ion collision energy resolution of ~7 eV, we resolve their respective KL$n$ satellites up to n'=11. By normalization to known radiative recombination cross sections we also determine their excitation cross sections and that of the continuum with uncertainties below 15%, and verify our results with an independent normalization based on previous measurements. Our experimental data excellently confirm the accuracy and suitability of distorted-wave calculations obtained with the Flexible Atomic Code (FAC) for modeling astrophysical and fusion plasmas.</description>

      <title>Gap modes in Arnold tongues and their topological origins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gap modes in a modified Mathieu equation, perturbed by a Dirac delta potential, are investigated. It is proved that the modified Mathieu equation admits stable isolated gap modes with topological origins in the unstable regions of the Mathieu equation, which are known as Arnold tongues. The modes may be identified as localized electron wavefunctions in a 1D chain or as toroidal Alfv\'en eigenmodes. A generalization of this argument shows that gap modes can be induced in regimes of instability by localized potential perturbations for a large class of periodic Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Infinite Boundary Terms and Pairwise Interactions: A Unified Framework for Periodic Coulomb Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06023v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The introduction of the infinite boundary terms and the pairwise interactions [J. Chem. Theory Comput., 10, 5254, (2014)] enables a physically intuitive approach for deriving electrostatic energy and pressure for both neutral and non-neutral systems under the periodic boundary condition (PBC). For a periodic system consisting of $N$ point charges (with charge $q_j$ located at ${\mathbf r}_j$ where $j=1,2,\cdots N$) and one charge distribution of density $\rho({\mathbf r})$ within a primary cell of volume $V$, the derived electrostatic energy can be expressed as, \[ {\mathcal U} = \sum_{i&lt;j}^N q_iq_j\nu({\mathbf r}_{ij} ) + \sum_{j=1}^N q_j \int_V d{\mathbf r}_0\,\rho({\mathbf r}_0) \nu({\mathbf r}_{0j} ) + \frac{1}{2}\int_V d{\mathbf r}_0 \int_V d{\mathbf r}_1\,\rho({\mathbf r}_0)\rho({\mathbf r}_1) \nu({\mathbf r}_{01}), \] where ${\mathbf r}_{ij}={\mathbf r}_i - {\mathbf r}_j$ is the relative vector and $\nu({\mathbf r})$ represents the effective pairwise interaction under PBC. The charge density $\rho({\mathbf r})$ is free of Delta-function-like divergence throughout the volume but may exhibit discontinuity. This unified formulation directly follows that of the isolated system by replacing the Coulomb interaction $1/\lvert {\mathbf r} \rvert$ or other modified Coulomb interactions with $\nu({\mathbf r})$. For a particular system of one-component plasma with a uniform neutralizing background, the implementation of various pairwise formulations clarifies the contribution of the background and subsequently reveals criteria for designing volume-dependent potentials that preserve the simple relation between energy and pressure.</description>
