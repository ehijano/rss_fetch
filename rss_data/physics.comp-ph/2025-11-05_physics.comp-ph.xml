      <title>Making PLUMED fly: a tutorial on optimizing performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PLUMED is an open-source software package that is widely used for analyzing and enhancing molecular dynamics simulations that works in conjunction with most available molecular dynamics softwares. While the computational cost of PLUMED calculations is typically negligible compared to the molecular dynamics code's force evaluation, the software is increasingly being employed for more computationally demanding tasks where performance optimization becomes critical. In this tutorial, we describe a recently implemented tool that can be used to reliably measure code performance. We then use this tool to generate detailed performance benchmarks that show how calculations of large-numbers of distances, angles or torsions can be optimized by using vector-based commands rather than individual scalar operations. We then present benchmarks that illustrate how to optimize calculations of atomic order parameters and secondary structure variables. Throughout the tutorial and in our implementations we endeavor to explain the algorithmic tricks that are being used to optimize the calculations so others can make use of these prescriptions both when they are using PLUMED and when they are writing their own codes.</description>

      <title>Delta-learned force fields for nonbonded interactions: Addressing the strength mismatch between covalent-nonbonded interaction for global models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Noncovalent interactions--vdW dispersion, hydrogen/halogen bonding, ion-$\pi$, and $\pi$-stacking--govern structure, dynamics, and emergent phenomena in materials and molecular systems, yet accurately learning them alongside covalent forces remains a core challenge for machine-learned force fields (MLFFs). This challenge is acute for global models that use Coulomb-matrix (CM) descriptors compared under Euclidean/Frobenius metrics in multifragment settings. We show that the mismatch between predominantly covalent force labels and the CM's overrepresentation of intermolecular features biases single-model training and degrades force-field fidelity. To address this, we introduce \textit{$\Delta$-sGDML}, a scale-aware formulation within the sGDML framework that explicitly decouples intra- and intermolecular physics by training fragment-specific models alongside a dedicated binding model, then composing them at inference. Across benzene dimers, host-guest complexes (C$_{60}$@buckycatcher, NO$_3^-$@i-corona[6]arene), benzene-water, and benzene-Na$^+$, \mbox{$\Delta$-sGDML} delivers consistent gains over a single global model, with fragment-resolved force-error reductions up to \textbf{75\%}, without loss of energy accuracy. Furthermore, molecular-dynamics simulations further confirm that the $\Delta$-model yields a reliable force field for C$_{60}$@buckycatcher, producing stable trajectories across a wide range of temperatures (10-400~K), unlike the single global model, which loses stability above $\sim$200~K. The method offers a practical route to homogenize per-fragment errors and recover reliable noncovalent physics in global MLFFs.</description>

      <title>Energy Loss Functions for Physical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effectively leveraging prior knowledge of a system's physics is crucial for applications of machine learning to scientific domains. Previous approaches mostly focused on incorporating physical insights at the architectural level. In this paper, we propose a framework to leverage physical information directly into the loss function for prediction and generative modeling tasks on systems like molecules and spins. We derive energy loss functions assuming that each data sample is in thermal equilibrium with respect to an approximate energy landscape. By using the reverse KL divergence with a Boltzmann distribution around the data, we obtain the loss as an energy difference between the data and the model predictions. This perspective also recasts traditional objectives like MSE as energy-based, but with a physically meaningless energy. In contrast, our formulation yields physically grounded loss functions with gradients that better align with valid configurations, while being architecture-agnostic and computationally efficient. The energy loss functions also inherently respect physical symmetries. We demonstrate our approach on molecular generation and spin ground-state prediction and report significant improvements over baselines.</description>

      <title>Explicit invariant-preserving integration of differential equations using homogeneous projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a general framework for numerically solving differential equations while preserving invariants. As in standard projection methods, we project an arbitrary base integrator onto an invariant-preserving manifold, however, our method exploits homogeneous symmetries to evaluate the projection exactly and in closed form. This yields explicit invariant-preserving integrators for a broad class of nonlinear systems, as well as pseudo-invariant-preserving schemes capable of preserving multiple invariants to arbitrarily high precision. The resulting methods are high-order and introduce negligible computational overhead relative to the base solver. When incorporated into adaptive solvers such as Dormand-Prince 8(5,3), they provide error-controlled, invariant-preserving, high-order time-stepping schemes. Numerical experiments on double-pendulum and Kepler ODEs as well as semidiscretised KdV and Camassa-Holm PDEs demonstrate substantial improvements in both accuracy and efficiency over standard approaches.</description>

      <title>Simulation of multi-species kinetic instabilities with the Numerical Flow Iteration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kinetic instabilities are one of the most challenging aspects in computational plasma physics. Accurately capturing their onset and evolution requires fine resolution of the high-dimensional distribution functions of each relevant species, which quickly becomes computationally prohibitively expensive. Additionally, plasma dynamics is an inherently multi-scale phenomenon due to the vast separation of scales between heavy ions and light-weight electrons. In previous work the Numerical Flow Iteration (NuFI) was suggested as a high-fidelity alternative with reduced memory complexity making it an interesting candidate to simulate complicated kinetic instabilities. In this work we extend NuFI to non-periodic boundary conditions and demonstrate how it is possible to reduce the computational complexity to allow for longer simulation periods.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast magnetic moment transfer and bandgap renormalization in monolayer \ce{FeCl2}</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The microscopic origin of laser-induced ultrafast demagnetization remains an open question, to which the non-thermal electronic distribution plays a vital role at the initial stage. Herein, we investigate the connection between the non-thermal electronic distribution and the ultrafast spin dynamics as well as the electronic structure evolution in ferromagnetic \ce{FeCl2} monolayer using real-time time-dependent density functional theory (rt-TDDFT) with self-consistent Hubbard $U$ correction. Our simulations reveal that femtosecond laser pulses induce ultrafast magnetic moment transfer from Fe to Cl atoms. More importantly, through a comprehensive analysis of orbital-resolved electronic structure, we elucidate the microscopic origin of this transfer, attributing it to specific intra-atomic and inter-atomic charge transfer pathways driven by non-thermal excitations. The extent of demagnetization of Fe atoms exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on the laser photon energy, reaching a maximum at the resonant excitation. In addition, the dynamical evolution of the band structure was studied based on the eigenstates of the instantaneous Hamiltonian. Under resonant excitation, the bandgap reduction reaches up to $41\%$ within tens of fs. These findings provide fundamental insights into ultrafast spin control and suggest a strategy to optically engineer the magnetism in two-dimensional magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Redundancy Maximization as a Principle of Associative Memory Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Associative memory, traditionally modeled by Hopfield networks, enables the retrieval of previously stored patterns from partial or noisy cues. Yet, the local computational principles which are required to enable this function remain incompletely understood. To formally characterize the local information processing in such systems, we employ a recent extension of information theory - Partial Information Decomposition (PID). PID decomposes the contribution of different inputs to an output into unique information from each input, redundant information across inputs, and synergistic information that emerges from combining different inputs. Applying this framework to individual neurons in classical Hopfield networks we find that below the memory capacity, the information in a neuron's activity is characterized by high redundancy between the external pattern input and the internal recurrent input, while synergy and unique information are close to zero until the memory capacity is surpassed and performance drops steeply. Inspired by this observation, we use redundancy as an information-theoretic learning goal, which is directly optimized for each neuron, dramatically increasing the network's memory capacity to 1.59, a more than tenfold improvement over the 0.14 capacity of classical Hopfield networks and even outperforming recent state-of-the-art implementations of Hopfield networks. Ultimately, this work establishes redundancy maximization as a new design principle for associative memories and opens pathways for new associative memory models based on information-theoretic goals.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning for RNA Secondary Structure Prediction: a review of current methods and challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting the secondary structure of RNA is a core challenge in computational biology, essential for understanding molecular function and designing novel therapeutics. The field has evolved from foundational but accuracy-limited thermodynamic approaches to a new data-driven paradigm dominated by machine learning and deep learning. These models learn folding patterns directly from data, leading to significant performance gains. This review surveys the modern landscape of these methods, covering single-sequence, evolutionary-based, and hybrid models that blend machine learning with biophysics. A central theme is the field's "generalization crisis," where powerful models were found to fail on new RNA families, prompting a community-wide shift to stricter, homology-aware benchmarking. In response to the underlying challenge of data scarcity, RNA foundation models have emerged, learning from massive, unlabeled sequence corpora to improve generalization. Finally, we look ahead to the next set of major hurdles-including the accurate prediction of complex motifs like pseudoknots, scaling to kilobase-length transcripts, incorporating the chemical diversity of modified nucleotides, and shifting the prediction target from static structures to the dynamic ensembles that better capture biological function. We also highlight the need for a standardized, prospective benchmarking system to ensure unbiased validation and accelerate progress.</description>

      <title>From Densities to Potentials: Benchmarking Local Exchange-Correlation Approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the Kohn-Sham (KS) inversion method of Hollins et al. [J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 29, 04LT01 (2017)], we invert densities from variational and diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculations to obtain benchmark QMC-KS potentials for a range of insulators and semiconductors, which we then compare to the KS potentials of popular density functional approximations (DFAs). Our results show that different DFAs yield similar electron densities, despite differences in their KS potentials, which originate primarily from the exchange and correlation contribution. We also find that the KS gap from the QMC density is typically larger than the KS gaps of most DFAs, with the exception of Hartree-Fock. Finally, the KS gap is sensitive to the inclusion of semicore states in the pseudopotentials, such that comparison with experiment should be done with caution.</description>

      <title>Are Foundational Atomistic Models Reliable for Finite-Temperature Molecular Dynamics?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning force fields have emerged as promising tools for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, potentially offering quantum-mechanical accuracy with the efficiency of classical MD. Inspired by foundational large language models, recent years have seen considerable progress in developing foundational atomistic models, sometimes referred to as universal force fields, designed to cover most elements in the periodic table. This Perspective adopts a practitioner's viewpoint to ask a critical question: Are these foundational atomistic models reliable for one of their most compelling applications, in particular simulating finite-temperature dynamics? Instead of a broad benchmark, we use the canonical ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transition in PbTiO$_3$ as a focused case study to evaluate prominent foundational atomistic models. Our findings suggest a potential disconnect between static accuracy and dynamic reliability. While 0 K properties are often well-reproduced, we observed that the models can struggle to consistently capture the correct phase transition, sometimes exhibiting simulation instabilities. We believe these challenges may stem from inherent biases in training data and a limited description of anharmonicity. These observed shortcomings, though demonstrated on a single system, appear to point to broader, systemic challenges that can be addressed with targeted fine-tuning. This Perspective serves not to rank models, but to initiate a crucial discussion on the practical readiness of foundational atomistic models and to explore future directions for their improvement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20021v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the 3D stationary flow of a weakly conducting fluid in a cubic cavity, driven by the Lorentz force created by two permanent magnets and a weak constant current. Our goal is to determine the conditions leading to efficient mixing within the cavity. The flow is composed of a large recirculation cell created by one side magnet, superposed to two recirculation cells created by a central magnet perpendicular to the first one. The overall structure of this flow, obtained here by solving the Stokes equations with Lorentz forcing, is similar to the tri-cellular model flow studied by Toussaint et. al. (Phys. Fluids. 7, 1995). Chaotic advection in this flow is analyzed by means of Poincar\'e sections, Lyapunov exponents and expansion entropies. In addition, we quantify the quality of mixing by computing contamination rates, homogeneity, as well as mixing times. Though individual vortices have poor mixing properties, the superposition of both flows creates chaotic streamlines and efficient mixing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13647v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following Hollins et al. [J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 29, 04LT01 (2017)], we invert the electronic ground state densities for various semiconducting and insulating solids calculated using several density functional approximations within the generalised Kohn-Sham (GKS) scheme, Hartree-Fock (HF) theory and the LDA+$U$ method, and benchmark against standard (semi-)local functionals. The band structures from the resulting local exchange-correlation (LXC) Kohn-Sham potential for these densities are then compared with the band structures of the original GKS method. We find the LXC potential obtained from the HF density systematically predicts band gaps in good agreement with experiment, even in strongly correlated transition metal monoxides (TMOs). Furthermore, we find that the HSE06 and PBE0 hybrid functionals yield similar densities and LXC potentials, and in weakly correlated systems, these potentials are similar to PBE. For LDA+$U$ densities, the LXC potential effectively reverses the flattening of bands caused by over-localisation by a large Hubbard-$U$ value, while for meta-GGAs, we find only small differences between the GKS and LXC results demonstrating that the non-locality of meta-GGAs is weak.</description>

      <title>Consistent Sampling and Simulation: Molecular Dynamics with Energy-Based Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17139v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, diffusion models trained on equilibrium molecular distributions have proven effective for sampling biomolecules. Beyond direct sampling, the score of such a model can also be used to derive the forces that act on molecular systems. However, while classical diffusion sampling usually recovers the training distribution, the corresponding energy-based interpretation of the learned score is often inconsistent with this distribution, even for low-dimensional toy systems. We trace this inconsistency to inaccuracies of the learned score at very small diffusion timesteps, where the model must capture the correct evolution of the data distribution. In this regime, diffusion models fail to satisfy the Fokker--Planck equation, which governs the evolution of the score. We interpret this deviation as one source of the observed inconsistencies and propose an energy-based diffusion model with a Fokker--Planck-derived regularization term to enforce consistency. We demonstrate our approach by sampling and simulating multiple biomolecular systems, including fast-folding proteins, and by introducing a state-of-the-art transferable Boltzmann emulator for dipeptides that supports simulation and achieves improved consistency and efficient sampling. Our code, model weights, and self-contained JAX and PyTorch notebooks are available at https://github.com/noegroup/ScoreMD.</description>

Abstract: The natural gradient is central in neural quantum states optimizations but it is limited by the cost of computing and inverting the quantum geometric tensor, the quantum analogue of the Fisher information matrix. We introduce a block-diagonal quantum geometric tensor that partitions the metric by network layers, analogous to block-structured Fisher methods such as K-FAC. This layer-wise approximation preserves essential curvature while removing noisy cross-layer correlations, improving conditioning and scalability. Experiments on Heisenberg and frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$ models show faster convergence, lower energy, and improved stability.</description>

      <title>Exploring the limit of the Lattice-Bisognano-Wichmann form describing the Entanglement Hamiltonian: A quantum Monte Carlo study</title>

Abstract: The entanglement Hamiltonian (EH) encapsulates the essential entanglement properties of a quantum many-body system and serves as a powerful theoretical construct. From the EH, one can extract a variety of entanglement quantities, such as entanglement entropies, negativity, and the entanglement spectrum. However, its general analytical form remains largely unknown. While the Bisognano-Wichmann theorem gives an exact EH form for Lorentz-invariant field theories, its validity on lattice systems is limited, especially when Lorentz invariance is absent. In this work, we propose a general scheme based on the lattice-Bisognano-Wichmann (LBW) ansatz and multi-replica-trick quantum Monte Carlo methods to numerically reconstruct the entanglement Hamiltonian in two-dimensional systems and systematically explore its applicability to systems without translational invariance, going beyond the original scope of the primordial Bisognano-Wichmann theorem. Various quantum phases--including gapped and gapless phases, critical points, and phases with either discrete or continuous symmetry breaking--are investigated, demonstrating the versatility of our method in reconstructing entanglement Hamiltonians. Furthermore, we find that when the entanglement boundary of a system is ordinary (i.e., free from surface anomalies), the LBW ansatz provides an accurate approximation well beyond Lorentz-invariant cases. Our work thus establishes a general framework for investigating the analytical structure of entanglement in complex quantum many-body systems.</description>
