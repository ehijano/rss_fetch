      <title>Multi-band superconductors have enhanced critical temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a multi-band BCS free energy functional and prove that for a multi-band superconductor the effect of inter-band coupling can only increase the critical temperature, irrespective of its attractive or repulsive nature and its strength. Further, for weak coupling and weaker inter-band coupling, we prove that the dependence of the increase in critical temperature on the inter-band coupling is (1) linear, if there are two or more equally strongly superconducting bands, or (2) quadratic, if there is only one dominating band.</description>

      <title>The factorial growth of topological recursion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the $n$-point, genus-$g$ correlation functions of topological recursion on any regular spectral curve with simple ramifications grow at most like $(2g - 2 + n)!$ as $g \rightarrow \infty$, which is the expected growth rate. This provides, in particular, an upper bound for many curve counting problems in large genus and serves as a preliminary step for a resurgence analysis.</description>

      <title>The Huang-Yang formula for the low-density Fermi gas: upper bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the ground state energy of a gas of spin $1/2$ fermions with repulsive short-range interactions. We derive an upper bound that agrees, at low density $\rho$, with the Huang-Yang conjecture. The latter captures the first three terms in an asymptotic low-density expansion, and in particular the Huang-Yang correction term of order $\rho^{7/3}$. Our trial state is constructed using an adaptation of the bosonic Bogoliubov theory to the Fermi system, where the correlation structure of fermionic particles is incorporated by quasi-bosonic Bogoliubov transformations. In the latter, it is important to consider a modified zero-energy scattering equation that takes into account the presence of the Fermi sea, in the spirit of the Bethe-Goldstone equation.</description>

      <title>X-ray multiple-beam (n-baem) dynamical diffraction theories, numerical methods to solve them and experimental verification by using the synchrotron X-rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Behavior of X-rays diffracted in a perfect or quasi-perfect crystal can be described by the dynamical theory of X-ray diffraction. Study on the two-beam cases in which only transmitted and one reflected X-ray beams are strong has a history of one hundred years. However, the population of researchers who study on the multiple-beam cases (n-beam cases) in which more than two beams are simultaneously strong is small. The present author has derived the Takagi-Taupin (T-T) dynamical theory that can be applied to the n-beam cases, coded the computer programs to solve it and experimentally verified them by using the synchrotron X-rays. The equivalence between the Ewald-Laue (E-L) and the T-T dynamical theories described by the Fourier transform also for the n-beam cases is explicitly verified in the present paper. Further, the methods of the computer simulations and the experiments are also described.
  Furthermore, a hypothesis concerning the too large values of R-factor in protein crystallography is also described. This might be extremely important in protein crystallography in the future.</description>

      <title>Hopf algebras and solvable unitary circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exactly solvable models in quantum many body dynamics provide valuable insights into many interesting physical phenomena, and serve as platforms to rigorously investigate fundamental theoretical questions. Nevertheless, they are extremely rare and existing solvable models and solution techniques have serious limitations. In this paper we introduce a new family of exactly solvable unitary circuits which model quantum many body dynamics in discrete space and time. Unlike many previous solvable models, one can exactly compute the full quantum dynamics initialized from any matrix product state in this new family of models. The time evolution of local observables and correlations, the linear growth of Renyi entanglement entropy, spatiotemporal correlations, and outof-time-order correlations are all exactly computable. A key property of these models enabling the exact solution is that any time evolved local operator is an exact matrix product operator with finite bond dimension, even at arbitrarily long time, which we prove using the underlying (weak) Hopf algebra structure along with tensor network techniques. We lay down the general framework for the construction and solution of this family of models, and give several explicit examples. In particular, we study in detail a model constructed out of a weak Hopf algebra that is very close to a floquet version of the PXP model, and the exact results we obtain may shed light on the phenomenon of quantum many body scars, and more generally, floquet quantum dynamics in constrained systems.</description>

      <title>Reflected entropy in random tensor networks III: triway cuts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For general random tensor network states at large bond dimension, we prove that the integer R\'enyi reflected entropies (away from phase transitions) are determined by minimal triway cuts through the network. This generalizes the minimal cut description of bipartite entanglement for these states. A natural extrapolation away from integer R\'enyi parameters, suggested by the triway cut problem, implies the holographic conjecture $S_R=2EW$, where $S_R$ is the reflected entropy and $EW$ is the entanglement wedge cross-section. Minimal triway cuts can be formulated as integer programs which cannot be relaxed to find a dual maximal flow/bit-thread description. This sheds light on the gap between the existence of tripartite entanglement in holographic states and the bipartite entanglement structure motivated by bit-threads. In particular, we prove that the Markov gap that measures tripartite entanglement is lower bounded by the integrality gap of the integer program that computes the triway cut.</description>

      <title>Free Independence and the Noncrossing Partition Lattice in Dual-Unitary Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate details of the chaotic dynamics of dual-unitary quantum circuits by evaluating all $2k$-point out-of-time-ordered correlators. For the generic class of circuits, by writing the correlators as contractions of a class of quantum channels, we prove their exponential decay. This implies that local operators separated in time approach free independence. Along the way, we develop a replica trick for dual-unitary circuits, which may be useful and of interest in its own right. We classify the relevant eigenstates of the replica transfer matrix by paths in the lattice of noncrossing partitions, combinatorial objects central to free probability theory. Interestingly, the noncrossing lattice emerges even for systems without randomness and with small onsite Hilbert space dimension.</description>

      <title>Solving four-dimensional superconformal Yang-Mills theories with Tracy-Widom distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a special class of observables in $\mathcal N=2$ and $\mathcal N=4$ superconformal Yang-Mills theories which, for an arbitrary 't Hooft coupling constant $\lambda$, admit representation as determinants of certain semi-infinite matrices. Similar determinants have previously appeared in the study of level-spacing distributions in random matrices and are closely related to the celebrated Tracy-Widom distribution. We exploit this relationship to develop an efficient method for computing the observables in superconformal Yang-Mills theories at both weak and strong coupling. The weak coupling expansion has a finite radius of convergence. The strong coupling expansion involves the sum of the `perturbative' part, given by series in $1/\sqrt\lambda$, and the `non-perturbative' part, given by an infinite sum of exponentially small terms, each accompanied by a series in $1/\sqrt\lambda$ with factorially growing coefficients. We explicitly compute the expansion coefficients of these series and show that they are uniquely determined by the large order behavior of the expansion coefficients of the perturbative part via resurgence relations.</description>

      <title>Measuring Entanglement by Exploiting its Anti-symmetric Nature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite significant progress in experimental quantum sciences, measuring entanglement entropy remains challenging. Through a geometric perspective, we reveal the intrinsic anti-symmetric nature of entanglement. We prove that most entanglement measures, such as von Neumann and Renyi entropies, can be expressed in terms of exterior products, which are fundamentally anti-symmetric. Leveraging this, we propose utilizing the anti-symmetric nature of fermions to measure entanglement entropy efficiently, offering a resource-efficient approach to probing bipartite entanglement.</description>

      <title>Sub-ballistic operator growth in spin chains with heavy-tailed random fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We rigorously prove that in nearly arbitrary quantum spin chains with power-law-distributed random fields, namely such that the probability of a field exceeding $h$ scales as $h^{-\alpha}$, it is impossible for any operator evolving in the Heisenberg picture to spread with dynamical exponent less than $1/\alpha$. In particular, ballistic growth is impossible for $\alpha &lt; 1$, diffusive growth is impossible for $\alpha &lt; 1/2$, and any finite dynamical exponent becomes impossible for sufficiently small $\alpha$. This result thus establishes a wide family of models in which the disorder provably prevents conventional transport. We express the result as a tightening of Lieb-Robinson bounds due to random fields -- the proof modifies the standard derivation such that strong fields appear as effective weak interactions, and then makes use of analogous recent results for random-bond spin chains.</description>

      <title>Conformally K\"ahler structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a one-to-one correspondence between K\"ahler metrics in a given conformal class and parallel sections of a certain vector bundle with conformally invariant connection, where the parallel sections satisfy a set of non--linear algebraic constraints that we describe. The vector bundle captures 2-form prolongations and is isomorphic to $\Lambda^3(\cT)$, where ${\cT}$ is the tractor bundle of conformal geometry, but the resulting connection differs from the normal tractor connection by curvature terms.
  Our analysis leads to a set of obstructions for a Riemannian metric to be conformal to a K\"ahler metric. In particular we find an explicit algebraic condition for a Weyl tensor which must hold if there exists a conformal Killing-Yano tensor, which is a necessary condition for a metric to be conformal to K\"ahler. This gives an invariant characterisation of algebraically special Riemannian metrics of type $D$ in dimensions higher than four.</description>

      <title>Pure state entanglement and von Neumann algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop the theory of local operations and classical communication (LOCC) for bipartite quantum systems represented by commuting von Neumann algebras. Our central result is the extension of Nielsen's Theorem to arbitrary factors. As in the matrix algebra case, the LOCC ordering of bipartite pure states is connected to the majorization of their restrictions. Our theorem implies that, in a bipartite system modeled by commuting factors in Haag duality, a) all states have infinite one-shot entanglement if and only if the local factors are not of type I, b) type III factors are characterized by LOCC transitions of arbitrary precision between any two pure states, and c) the latter holds even without classical communication for type III$_{1}$ factors. In the case of semifinite factors, the usual construction of entanglement monotones carries over using majorization theory. In the appendix, we provide a self-contained treatment of majorization on semifinite von Neumann algebras and $\sigma$-finite measure spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The number of standard Young tableaux of a skew shape $\lambda/\mu$ can be computed as a sum over excited diagrams inside $\lambda$. Excited diagrams are in bijection with certain lozenge tilings, with flagged semistandard tableaux and also nonintersecting lattice paths inside $\lambda$. We give two new proofs of a multivariate generalization of this formula, which allow us to extend the setup beyond standard Young tableaux and the underlying Schur symmetric polynomials. The first proof uses multiple contour integrals. The second one interprets excited diagrams as configurations of a six-vertex model at a free fermion point, and derives the formula for the number of standard Young tableaux of a skew shape from the Yang-Baxter equation.</description>

      <title>Optimal trace-distance bounds for free-fermionic states: Testing and improved tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Free-fermionic states, also known as fermionic Gaussian states, represent an important class of quantum states ubiquitous in physics. They are uniquely and efficiently described by their correlation matrix. However, in practical experiments, the correlation matrix can only be estimated with finite accuracy. This raises the question: how does the error in estimating the correlation matrix affect the trace-distance error of the state? We show that if the correlation matrix is known with an error $\varepsilon$, the trace-distance error also scales as $\varepsilon$ (and vice versa). Specifically, we provide distance bounds between (both pure and mixed) free-fermionic states in relation to their correlation matrix distance. Our analysis also extends to cases where one state may not be free-fermionic. Importantly, we leverage our preceding results to derive significant advancements in property testing and tomography of free-fermionic states. Property testing involves determining whether an unknown state is close to or far from being a free-fermionic state. We first demonstrate that any algorithm capable of testing arbitrary (possibly mixed) free-fermionic states would inevitably be inefficient. Then, we present an efficient algorithm for testing low-rank free-fermionic states. For free-fermionic state tomography, we provide improved bounds on sample complexity in the pure-state scenario, substantially improving over previous literature, and we generalize the efficient algorithm to mixed states, discussing its noise-robustness.</description>

Abstract: We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for universality limits for orthogonal polynomials on the real line and related systems. One of our results is that the Christoffel-Darboux kernel has sine kernel asymptotics at a point $\xi$, with regularly varying scaling, if and only if the orthogonality measure (spectral measure) has a unique tangent measure at $\xi$ and that tangent measure is the Lebesgue measure. This includes all prior results with absolutely continuous or singular measures.
  Our work is not limited to bulk universality; we show that the Christoffel-Darboux kernel has a regularly varying scaling limit with a nontrivial limit kernel if and only if the orthogonality measure has a unique tangent measure at $\xi$ and that tangent measure is not a point mass. The possible limit kernels correspond to homogeneous de Branges spaces; in particular, this equivalence completely characterizes several prominent universality classes such as hard edge universality, Fisher-Hartwig singularities, and jump discontinuities in the weights.
  The main part of the proof is the derivation of a new homeomorphism. In order to directly apply to the Christoffel-Darboux kernel, this homeomorphism is between measures and chains of de Branges spaces, not between Weyl functions and Hamiltonians. In order to handle limits with power law weights, this homeomorphism goes beyond the more common setting of Poisson-finite measures, and allows arbitrary power bounded measures.</description>

      <title>Graded contractions on the orthogonal Lie algebras of dimensions 7 and 8</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graded contractions of certain non-toral $\mathbb{Z}_2^3$-gradings on the simple Lie algebras $\mathfrak{so}(7,\mathbb C)$ and $\f{so}(8,\mathbb C)$ are classified up to two notions of equivalence. In particular, there arise two large families of Lie algebras (the majority of which are solvable) of dimensions 21 and 28. This is achieved as a significant generalization of the classification of related graded contractions on $\mathfrak g_2$, the derivation algebra of the octonion algebra. Many of the results can be further extended to any \emph{good} $\mathbb Z_2^3$-grading on an arbitrary Lie algebra.</description>

      <title>Bridging 4D QFTs and 2D VOAs via 3D high-temperature EFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The high-temperature limit of the superconformal index, especially on higher sheets, often captures useful universal information about a theory. In 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal field theories with fractional r-charges, there exists a special notion of high-temperature limit on higher sheets that captures data of three-dimensional topological quantum field theories arising from r-twisted circle reduction. These TQFTs are closely tied with the VOA of the 4d SCFT. We study such high-temperature limits. More specifically, we apply Di~Pietro-Komargodski type supersymmetric effective field theory techniques to r-twisted circle reductions of $(A_1,A_{2n})$ Argyres-Douglas theories, leveraging their Maruyoshi-Song Lagrangian with manifest $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetry. The result on the second sheet is the Gang-Kim-Stubbs family of 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ SUSY enhancing rank-$0$ theories with monopole superpotentials, whose boundary supports the Virasoro minimal model VOAs $M(2,2n+3)$. Upon topological twist, they give non-unitary TQFTs controlled by the $M(2,2n+3)$ modular tensor category (MTC). The high-temperature limit on other sheets yields their unitary or non-unitary Galois conjugates. This opens up the prospect of a broader four-supercharge perspective on the celebrated correspondence between 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFTs and 2d VOAs via interpolating 3d EFTs. Several byproducts follow, including a systematic approach to 3d SUSY enhancement from 4d SUSY enhancement, and a 3d QFT handle on Galois orbits of various MTCs associated with 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFTs.</description>

      <title>On the representation of fourth and higher order anisotropic elasticity tensors in generalized continuum models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classification of all fourth-order anisotropic tensor classes for classical linear elasticity is well known. In this article, we review the related problem of explicitly computing the dimension and the expressions of the elements belonging to these classes, and we extend this computation to fourth-order elasticity tensors acting on non-symmetric matrices. These tensors naturally appear in generalized continuum models. Based on tensor symmetrization, we provide the most general forms of these tensors for orthotropic, transversely isotropic, cubic, and isotropic materials. We present a self-contained discussion and provide detailed calculations for simple examples.</description>

Abstract: Kaniadakis deformed \kappa-mathematics is an area of mathematics that has found relevance in the analysis of complex systems. Specifically, the mathematical framework in the context of a first-order decay \kappa-differential equation is investigated, facilitating an in-depth examination of the \kappa-mathematical structure. This framework serves as a foundational platform, representing the simplest non-trivial setting for such inquiries which are demonstrated for the first time in the literature. Finally, additional avenues of study are discussed</description>

      <title>Formulating and indirectly proving the quantum fluctuations of space-time and a justification for applying fractional quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.12466v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well known that in quantum gravity, the very geometry of space and time is subject to continual fluctuation. The mathematical formulation for this old theory is still lacking. This article formulates this more than forty-year-old theory of quantum gravity, the result of which is that the equations of quantum gravity become fractional. The existence of such fluctuations is proved indirectly. On the other hand, recent attention has been paid to fractional gravity. Although this type of gravity leads to brilliant results, we have no root and logical reason for applying it other than that it works. We actually simultaneously demonstrate that fractional gravity is generated by stochastic quantum fluctuations of space-time. For clarification, Einstein-Hilbert theory along with a scalar field is investigated in deformed and non-deformed minisuperspaces. The results illustrate a transition from decelerated to accelerated expansion (late-time-accelerated expansion).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.13164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study axisymmetric solutions to the wave equation on extremal Kerr backgrounds and obtain integrated local energy decay (or Morawetz estimates) through an analysis \textit{exclusively in physical-space}. Boundedness of the energy and Morawetz estimates for axisymmetric waves in extremal Kerr were first obtained by Aretakis through the construction of frequency-localized currents used in particular to express the trapping degeneracy. Here we extend to extremal Kerr a method introduced by Stogin in the sub-extremal case, simplifying Aretakis' derivation of Morawetz estimates through purely classical currents.</description>

      <title>Finite energy well-posedness for nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with non-vanishing conditions at infinity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.00751v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relevant physical phenomena are described by nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with non-vanishing conditions at infinity. This paper investigates the respective 2D and 3D Cauchy problems. Local well-posedness in the energy space for energy-subcritical nonlinearities, merely satisfying Kato-type assumptions, is proven, providing the analogue of the well-established local $H^1$-theory for solutions vanishing at infinity. The critical nonlinearity will be simply a byproduct of our analysis and the existing literature. Under an assumption that prevents the onset of a Benjamin-Feir type instability, global well-posedness in the energy space is proven for a) non-negative Hamiltonians, b) sign-indefinite Hamiltonians under additional assumptions on the zeros of the nonlinearity, c) generic nonlinearities and small initial data. The cases b) and c) only concern 3D.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we analyze and bound the effect of modeling errors on the stabilization of pure states or subspaces for quantum stochastic evolutions. Different approaches are used for open-loop and feedback control protocols. For both, we highlight the key role of dynamical invariance of the target: if the perturbation preserves invariance, it is possible to prove that it also preserves its attractivity, under some additional assumptions. In addition, we prove boundedness in mean of the solutions of perturbed systems under open-loop protocols. For the feedback strategies, in the general case without assumptions on invariance, we provide bounds on the perturbation effect in expectation and in probability, as well as specific bounds for non-demolition nominal systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum memory assisted entangled state verification with local measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11066v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the quantum memory assisted quantum state verification task, where an adversary prepare independent multipartite entangled states and send to the local verifiers, who then store several copies in the quantum memory and measure them collectively to make decision. We establish an exact analytic formula for optimizing two-copy state verification, where the verifiers store two copies, and give a globally optimal two-copy strategy for multi-qubit graph states involving only Bell measurements. When the verifiers can store arbitrarily many copies, we present a dimension expansion technique that designs efficient verification strategies for this case, showcasing its application to efficiently verifying GHZ-like states. These strategies become increasingly advantageous with growing memory resources, ultimately approaching the theoretical limit of efficiency. Our findings demonstrate that quantum memories enhance state verification efficiency, sheding light on error-resistant strategies and practical applications of large-scale quantum memory-assisted verification.</description>

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to prove the existence of Hadamard states for the Maxwell equations on any globally hyperbolic spacetime. This will be achieved by introducing a new gauge fixing condition, the Cauchy radiation gauge, that will allow to suppress all the unphysical degrees of freedom. The key ingredient for achieving this gauge is a new Hodge decomposition for differential k-forms in Sobolev spaces on complete (possibly non-compact) Riemannian manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02660v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ramanujan studied a general class of Stirling constants that are the resummation of some natural divergent series. These constants include the classical Euler-Mascheroni, Stirling and Glaisher-Kinkelin constants. We find natural integral representations for all these constants that appear as exponential periods in the field $\mathbb Q (t,e^{-t})$ which reveals their natural transalgebraic nature. We conjecture that all these constants are transcendental numbers. Euler-Mascheroni's and Stirling's integral formula are classical, but the integral formula for Glaisher-Kinkelin appears to be new, as well as the integral formulas for the higher Stirling-Ramanujan constants. The method presented generalizes naturally to prove that many other constants are exponential periods over the field $\mathbb Q(t,e^{-t})$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we show that three different generalized similarities enclose all unitary and anti-unitary symmetries that induce exceptional points in lower-dimensional non-Hermitian systems. We prove that the generalized similarity conditions result in a larger class of systems than any class defined by a unitary or anti-unitary symmetry. Further we highlight that the similarities enforce spectral symmetry on the Hamiltonian resulting in a reduction of the codimension of exceptional points. As a consequence we show that the similarities drive the emergence of exceptional points in lower dimensions without the more restrictive need for a unitary and/or anti-unitary symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11550v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theory of resurgence uniquely associates a factorially divergent formal power series with a collection of exponentially small non-perturbative corrections paired with a set of complex numbers known as Stokes constants. When the Borel plane displays a single infinite tower of singularities, the secondary resurgent series are trivial, and the Stokes constants are coefficients of an $L$-function, a rich analytic number-theoretic fabric underlies the resurgent structure of the asymptotic series. We propose a new paradigm of modular resurgence that focuses on the role of the Stokes constants and the interplay of the $q$-series acting as their generating functions with the corresponding $L$-functions. Guided by two pivotal examples arising from topological string theory and the theory of Maass cusp forms, we introduce the notion of modular resurgent series, which we conjecture to have specific summability properties as well as to be related to quantum modular forms.</description>

      <title>Rotations, Negative Eigenvalues, and Newton Method in Tensor Network Renormalization Group</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10312v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the tensor network approach to statistical physics, properties of the critical point of a 2D lattice model are encoded by a four-legged tensor which is a fixed point of an RG map. The traditional way to find the fixed point tensor consists in iterating the RG map after having tuned the temperature to criticality. Here we develop a different and more direct technique, which solves the fixed point equation via the Newton method. This is challenging due to the existence of marginal deformations -- linear transformations of the coordinate frame, which parametrize a two-dimensional family of fixed points. We address this challenge by including a 90 degree rotation into the RG map. This flips the sign of the problematic marginal eigenvalues, rendering the fixed point isolated and accessible via the Newton method. We demonstrate the power of this technique via explicit computations for the 2D Ising model. Using the Gilt-TNR algorithm at bond dimension $\chi=30$, we find the fixed point tensor with $10^{-9}$ accuracy, much higher than what was previously achieved.</description>

Abstract: We construct soliton solutions of the four-dimensional Wess-Zumino-Witten (4dWZW) model in the context of a unified theory of integrable systems with relation to the 4d/6d Chern-Simons theory. We calculate the action density of the solutions and find that the soliton solutions behave as the KP-type solitons, that is, the one-soliton solution has a localized action/energy density on a 3d hyperplane in 4-dimensions (soliton wall) and the n-soliton solution describes n intersecting soliton walls with phase shifts. We note that the Ward conjecture holds mostly in the split signature (+,+,-,-). Furthermore, the 4dWZW model describes the string field theory action of the open N=2 string theory in the four-dimensional space-time with the split signature and hence our soliton solutions would describe a new-type of physical objects in the N=2 string theory. We discuss instanton solutions in the 4dWZW model as well. Noncommutative extension and quantization of the unified theory of integrable systems are also discussed.</description>
