      <title>Machine Learning and First-Principles Predictions of Materials with Low Lattice Thermal Conductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform machine learning (ML) simulations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to search for materials with low lattice thermal conductivity, $\kappa_L$. Several cadmium (Cd) compounds containing elements from the alkali-metal and carbon groups including A$_2$CdX (A = Li, Na, and K; X = Pb, Sn, and Ge) are predicted by our ML models to exhibit very low $\kappa_L$ values ($&lt; 1.0 $ W/mK), rendering these materials suitable for potential thermal management and insulation applications. Further DFT calculations of electronic and transport properties indicate that the figure of merit, $ZT$, for thermoelectric performance can exceed 1.0 in compounds such as K$_2$CdPb, K$_2$CdSn, and K$_2$CdGe, which are thereby also promising thermoelectric materials.</description>

      <title>Influence of Point Defects on Laser-Induced Excitation in Silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We studied the influence of defect states on the laser excitation process in silicon using time-dependent density functional theory. We assumed two types of point defects: interstitial oxygen and silicon vacancies. We found that the photoabsorption efficiency increased with defect density in both cases owing to the color center. These defects distorted the crystal structure, thereby relaxing the selection rules and changing the indirect gap to direct. At low laser intensities, the defect states dominated the absorption process. However, as the laser intensity increased, the excitation efficiency approached that of crystalline silicon. In addition, we observed that the excitation efficiency did not scale linearly with the pulse length. Notably, in the case of Si vacancies, saturable absorption significantly reduced photoabsorption. Our results suggest that the existence of a defect and its density could be detected by even-order high-harmonics generation.</description>

      <title>Impact of Ge, Ga, and Al doping on the mechanical properties and anisotropy of Cr$_3$Si: a first-principles investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mechanical properties of cubic Cr$_3$Si doped with Ge, Ga, and Al are systematically investigated using first-principles calculations based on density functional theory. We examine the effects of doping on the lattice constants, formation enthalpies, elastic moduli, wave velocities, Debye temperature, and mechanical anisotropy to understand how these dopants influence the structural stability and mechanical behavior of Cr$_3$Si. Our results indicate that doping with Ge, Ga, and Al lead to an increase in lattice constants, reflecting lattice expansion. Despite the negative formation enthalpies across all doped configurations, indicating thermodynamic stability, higher dopant concentrations reduce the stability of the alloys. The elastic moduli, including bulk modulus, shear modulus, and Young's modulus, decrease with increasing dopant concentration, suggesting a reduction in mechanical stiffness and rigidity. Wave velocity and Debye temperature also grow smaller, further indicating a softer material structure with diminished thermal conductivity. Additionally, the study reveals that Al and Ga doping significantly increases mechanical anisotropy, as demonstrated by the anisotropy indices and three-dimensional contour analyses. In contrast, Ge maintains a more isotropic mechanical behavior, making it the most favorable dopant for applications requiring balanced mechanical and thermal properties. These findings provide critical insights into the design and optimization of Cr$_3$Si-based materials, highlighting the trade-offs between mechanical strength, anisotropy, and other functional properties introduced by doping. The results underscore the potential of tailoring Cr$_3$Si alloys for specific high-performance applications where directional mechanical properties and thermal stability are of paramount importance.</description>

      <title>Estimation of material parameter uncertainties using probabilistic and interval approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the calibration of material models, often the numerical results of a simulation model $y$ are compared with the experimental measurements $y^*$. Usually, the differences between measurements and simulation are minimized using least squares approaches including global and local optimization techniques. In this paper, the resulting scatter or uncertainty of the identified material parameters p are investigated by assuming the measurement curves as non-deterministic. Based on classical probabilistic approaches as the Markov estimator or the Bayesian updating procedure, the scatter of the identified parameters can be estimated as a multi-variate probability density function. Both procedures require a sufficient accurate knowledge or estimate of the scatter of the measurement points, often modeled by a Gaussian covariance matrix. In this paper, we present a different idea by assuming the scatter of the measurements not as correlated random numbers but just as individual intervals with known minimum and maximum values. The corresponding possible minimum and maximum values for each input parameter can be obtained for this assumption using a constrained optimization approach. However, the identification of the whole possible parameter domain for the given measurement bounds is not straight forward. Therefore, we introduce an efficient line-search method, where not only the bounds itself but also the shape of the feasible parameter domain can be identified. This enables the quantification of the interaction and the uniqueness of the input parameters. As a numerical example, we identify the fracture parameters of plain concrete with respect to a wedge splitting test, where five unknown material parameters could be identified.</description>

      <title>Temperature dependence of the AB-lines and Optical Properties of the Carbon-Antisite Vacancy Pair in 4H-SiC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Defects in semiconductors have in recent years been revealed to have interesting properties in the venture towards quantum technologies. In this regard, silicon carbide has shown great promise as a host for quantum defects. In particular, the ultra-bright AB photoluminescence lines in 4H-SiC are observable at room temperature and have been proposed as a single-photon quantum emitter. These lines have been previously studied and assigned to the carbon antisite-vacancy pair (CAV). In this paper, we report on new measurements of the AB-lines' temperature dependence, and carry out an in-depth computational study on the optical properties of the CAV defect. We find that the CAV defect has the potential to exhibit several different zero-phonon luminescences with emissions in the near-infrared telecom band, in its neutral and positive charge states. However, our measurements show that the AB-lines only consist of three non-thermally activated lines instead of the previously reported four lines, meanwhile our calculations on the CAV defect are unable to find optical transitions in full agreement with the AB-line assignment. In the light of our results, the identification of the AB-lines and the associated room temperature emission require further study.</description>

      <title>Monolayer Magnetic Metal with Scalable Conductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 2D magnets have emerged as a class of materials highly promising for studies of quantum phenomena and applications in ultra-compact spintronics. Current research aims at design of 2D magnets with particular functional properties. A formidable challenge is to produce metallic monolayers: the material landscape of layered magnetic systems is strongly dominated by insulators; rare metallic magnets, such as Fe3GeTe2, become insulating as they approach the monolayer limit. Here, electron transport measurements demonstrate that the recently discovered 2D magnet GdAlSi - graphene-like AlSi layers coupled to layers of Gd atoms - remains metallic down to a single monolayer. Band structure analysis indicates the material to be an electride, which may stabilize the metallic state. Remarkably, the sheet conductance of 2D GdAlSi is proportional to the number of monolayers - a manifestation of scalable conductivity. The GdAlSi layers are epitaxially integrated with silicon, facilitating applications in electronics.</description>

      <title>Optical line shapes of color centers in solids from classical autocorrelation functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Color centers play key roles in applications, including, e.g., solid state lighting and quantum information technology, for which the coupling between their optical and vibrational properties is crucial. Established methodologies for predicting the optical lineshapes of such emitters rely on the generating function (GF) approach and impose tight constraints on the shape of and relationship between the ground and excited state landscapes, which limits their application range. Here, we describe an approach based on direct sampling of the underlying auto-correlation functions through molecular dynamics simulations (MD-ACF) that overcomes these restrictions. The energy landscapes are represented by a machine-learned potential, which provides an accurate yet efficient description of both the ground and excited state landscapes through a single model, guaranteeing size-consistent predictions. We apply this methodology to the (VSiVC)kk(0) divacancy defect in 4H-SiC, a prototypical color center, which has been studied both experimentally and theoretically. We demonstrate that at low temperatures the present MD-ACF approach yields predictions in agreement with earlier GF calculations. Unlike the latter it is, however, also applicable at high temperatures as it is not subject to the same limitations, especially with respect to handling of anharmonicity, and can be applied to study non-crystalline materials. While we discuss remaining challenges and possible extensions, the methodology presented here already holds the potential to substantially widen the range of computational predictions of the optical properties of color centers and related defects, especially for cases with pronounced anharmonicity and/or large differences between the initial and final states.</description>

      <title>Acoustic and Optical Phonon Frequencies and Acoustic Phonon Velocities in Silicon-Doped Aluminum Nitride Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the results of the study of the acoustic and optical phonons in Si-doped AlN thin films grown by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition on sapphire substrates. The Brillouin - Mandelstam and Raman light scattering spectroscopies were used to measure the acoustic and optical phonon frequencies close to the Brillouin zone center. The optical phonon frequencies reveal non-monotonic changes, reflective of the variations in the thin-film strain and dislocation densities with the addition of Si dopant atoms. The acoustic phonon velocity decreases monotonically with increasing Si dopant concentration, reducing by ~300 m/s at the doping level of 3 x 10^19 1/cm3. Knowledge of the acoustic phonon velocities can be used to optimize ultra-wide bandgap semiconductor heterostructures and minimize the thermal boundary resistance of high-power devices.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Coexistence of Spin States in [Fe-(tpy-ph)$_2$]$^{2+}$ Complexes on Au(111) using ab initio calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07014v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we systematically study the electronic structure and stability of spin states of the [Fe-(tpy-ph)$_2$]$^{2+}$ molecule in both gas phase and on a Au(111) substrate using density functional theory +U (DFT+U) calculations. We find that the stability of the Fe$^{2+}$ ion's spin states is significantly influenced by the Hubbard U parameter. In the gas phase, the low-spin (LS, S=0) state is found to be energetically favorable for U(Fe) $\leq$ 3 eV, whereas the high-spin (HS, S=2) state is stabilized for U(Fe) &gt; 3 eV. Interaction with the Au(111) substrate is found to elevate the critical U for the spin-state transition to 3.5 eV. Additionally, we perform L-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) calculations based on time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) for both HS and LS states. The calculated XAS suggests that the HS state more closely aligns with the experimental observations, indicating the potential coexistence of the HS state as the initial state during the X-ray excitation process. These findings enrich our understanding of spin-state dynamics in [Fe-(tpy-ph)$_2$]$^{2+}$.</description>

      <title>Open whispering gallery modes resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are some issues with traditional whispering gallery mode (WGM) resonators like poor light extraction and a dense mode spectrum. In this paper we introduce a solution to these limitations by proposing open WGM (OWGM) resonators that effectively reduce the mode density and enable directional radiation through a connected waveguide at the expense of some lowering in Q-factor. Numerical simulations of two-dimensional metallic and dielectric disk resonators with holes reveal a significant increase in intermode distance. The study also extends to three-dimensional dielectric OWGM resonators, demonstrating the formation of sparse spectra suitable for photonics applications. Additionally, the design of a cylindrical Bragg microresonator connected to a single-mode fiber via an optimized topology-based connector achieves near-unity transmission and efficient coupling. This approach enhances the development of new photonic devices, addressing the limitations of traditional high Q-factor WGM resonators and offering potential advancements in laser technology and optical communications, where compactness and manufacturability are prioritized over ultra-high Q-factors.</description>

      <title>Using $k$-means to sort spectra: electronic order mapping from scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging techniques have a unique ability to probe the inhomogeneity of material properties whether driven by compositional variation or other forms of phase segregation. In the doped cuprates, iridates, and related materials, scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) measurements have found the emergence of pseudogap 'puddles' from the macroscopically Mott insulating phase with increased doping. However, categorizing this hyperspectral data by electronic order is not trivial, and has often been done with ad hoc methods. In this paper we demonstrate the utility of $k$-means, a simple and easy-to-use unsupervised clustering method, as a tool for classifying heterogeneous scanning tunneling spectroscopy data by electronic order for Rh-doped Sr$_2$IrO$_{4}$, a cuprate-like material. Applied to STM data acquired within the Mott phase, $k$-means successfully identified areas of Mott order and of pseudogap order. The unsupervised nature of $k$-means limits avenues for bias, and provides clustered spectral shapes without a priori knowledge of the physics. Additionally, we demonstrate successful use of $k$-means as a preprocessing tool to constrain phenomenological function fitting. Clustering the data allows us to reduce the fitting parameter space, limiting over-fitting. We suggest $k$-means as a fast, simple model for processing hyperspectral data on materials of mixed electronic order.</description>

      <title>Advancing Nonadiabatic Molecular Dynamics Simulations for Solids: Achieving Supreme Accuracy and Efficiency with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-adiabatic molecular dynamics (NAMD) simulations have become an indispensable tool for investigating excited-state dynamics in solids. In this work, we propose a general framework, N$^2$AMD which employs an E(3)-equivariant deep neural Hamiltonian to boost the accuracy and efficiency of NAMD simulations. The preservation of Euclidean symmetry of Hamiltonian enables N$^2$AMD to achieve state-of-the-art performance. Distinct from conventional machine learning methods that predict key quantities in NAMD, N$^2$AMD computes these quantities directly with a deep neural Hamiltonian, ensuring supreme accuracy, efficiency, and consistency. Furthermore, N$^2$AMD demonstrates excellent generalizability and enables seamless integration with advanced NAMD techniques and infrastructures. Taking several extensively investigated semiconductors as the prototypical system, we successfully simulate carrier recombination in both pristine and defective systems at large scales where conventional NAMD often significantly underestimates or even qualitatively incorrectly predicts lifetimes. This framework not only boosts the efficiency and precision of NAMD simulations but also opens new avenues to advance materials research.</description>

      <title>Polarization entanglement enabled by orthogonally stacked van der Waals NbOCl2 crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polarization entanglement holds significant importance for photonic quantum technologies. Recently emerging subwavelength nonlinear quantum light sources, e.g., GaP and LiNbO3 thin films, benefiting from the relaxed phase-matching constraints and volume confinement, has shown intriguing properties, such as high-dimensional hyperentanglement and robust entanglement anti-degradation. Van der Waals (vdW) NbOCl2 crystal, renowned for its superior optical nonlinearities, has emerged as one of ideal candidates for ultrathin quantum light sources [Nature 613, 53 (2023)]. However, polarization-entanglement is inaccessible in NbOCl2 crystal due to its unfavorable nonlinear susceptibility tensor. Here, by leveraging the twist-stacking degree of freedom inherently in vdW systems, we showcase the preparation of tunable polarization entanglement and quantum Bell states. Our work not only provides a new and tunable polarization-entangled vdW photon-pair source, but also introduces a new knob in engineering the entanglement state of quantum light at the nanoscale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose that flat bands and van Hove singularities near the magic angle can be stabilized against angle disorder in the twisted Kane-Mele model. With continuum model and maximally localized Wannier function approaches, we identify a quadratic dispersion relationship between the bandwidth, interaction parameters versus the twist angle, in contrast to twisted bilayer graphene (TBG). Introducing Kane-Mele spin-orbit coupling to TBG greatly reduces the fractional Chern insulator indicator and enhances the stability of fractional Chern states near the magic angle, as confirmed by exact diagonalization calculations. Moreover, in twisted bilayer Pt$_2$HgSe$_3$ with intrinsic Kane-Mele spin-orbit coupling, we identify a topological flat band at a large twist angle around 4 degrees.</description>

      <title>Optical Control of Ultrafast Photocurrent in Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to manipulate electrons with the intense laser pulse enables an unprecedented control over the electronic motion on its intrinsic timescale. Present work explores the desired control of photocurrent generation in monolayer graphene on ultrafast timescale. The origin of photocurrent is attributed to the asymmetric residual electronic population in the conduction band after the end of the laser pulse, which also facilitates valley polarization. Present study offers a comprehensive analysis of the differences between these two observables, namely photocurrent and valley polarization. It is found that the corotating circularly polarized $\omega-2\omega$ laser pulses allow the generation of photocurrent but no valley polarization, whereas counterrotating circularly polarized $\omega-2\omega$ laser pulses yield significant valley polarization without any photocurrent in graphene. Different laser parameters, such as subcycle phase, wavelength, and intensity provide different knobs to control the generation of the photocurrent. In addition, threefold increase in the photocurrent's amplitude can be achieved by altering electronic properties of graphene via strain engineering.

Abstract: The growth of high-composition GeSn films of the future will likely be guided via algorithms. In this study we show how a logarithmic-based algorithm can be used to obtain high-quality GeSn compositions up to 16 % on GaAs (001) substrates via molecular beam epitaxy. Within we demonstrate composition targeting and logarithmic gradients to achieve linearly graded pseudomorph Ge1-xSnx compositions up to 10 % before partial relaxation of the structure and a continued gradient up to 16 % GeSn. In this report, we use X-ray diffraction, simulation, SIMS and atomic force microscopy to analyze and demonstrate some of the possible growths that can be produced with the enclosed algorithm. This methodology of growth is a major step forward in the field of GeSn development and the first demonstration of algorithmically driven, linearly graded GeSn films.</description>

Abstract: This work demonstrates how first-principles thermodynamic research within a Bayesian framework can quantify and propagate uncertainties to downstream thermodynamic calculations. To address the issue of Bayesian prior selection, knowledge of zero Kelvin ground states in the material system of interest is incorporated into the prior. The effectiveness of this framework is shown by creating a phase diagram for the FCC Zirconium Nitride system, including confidence intervals on phase boundary regions of interest.</description>

      <title>Optimized Sandwich and Topological Structures for Enhanced Haptic Transparency</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Humans rely on multimodal perception to form representations of the world. This implies that environmental stimuli must remain consistent and predictable throughout their journey to our sensory organs. When it comes to vision, electromagnetic waves are minimally affected when passing through air or glass treated for chromatic aberrations. Similar conclusions can be drawn for hearing and acoustic waves. However, tools that propagate elastic waves to our cutaneous afferents tend to color tactual perception due to parasitic mechanical attributes such as resonances and inertia. These issues are often overlooked, despite their critical importance for haptic devices that aim to faithfully render or record tactile interactions. Here, we investigate how to optimize this mechanical transmission with sandwich structures made from rigid, lightweight carbon fiber sheets arranged around a 3D-printed lattice core. Through a comprehensive parametric evaluation, we demonstrate how this design paradigm provides superior haptic transparency, regardless of the lattice types. Drawing an analogy with topology optimization, our solution approaches a foreseeable technological limit. It offers a practical way to create high-fidelity haptic interfaces, opening new avenues for research on tool-mediated interactions.</description>

      <title>Strong impact of low-level substitution of Mn by Fe on the magnetoelectric coupling in $TbMnO_{3}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02802v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The correlation between static magnetoelectric coupling and magnetic structure was investigated in $TbMn_{0.98}Fe_{0.02}O_{3}$ with magnetic field up to 8 T and down to 2 K. Single-crystal neutron diffraction experiments reveal a substantial increase in the temperature dependence of the incommensurate modulation wave vector of the antiferromagnetic phase as the magnetic field strength increases. Magnetic field-dependent pyroelectric current measurements revealed significantly higher magnetoelectric coupling at magnetic fields below 4 T than in pure TbMnO3. This is due to the higher sensitivity of the incommensurably modulated cycloid structure to weak magnetic fields. Detailed analysis of our data confirmed that the ferroelectric polarization is induced by inverse Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction for magnetic field strength up to 4 T, but at higher fields a departure from theoretical predictions is ascertained, giving evidence for an additional, as yet misunderstood, contribution to magnetoelectric coupling. It shows that a small 2% substitution of Mn3+ by Fe3+ has a strong impact on the magnetic structure, promoting the destabilization of the incommensurably modulated magnetic cycloidal structure of $TbMnO_{3}$ in a magnetic field above 5 T. We demonstrate that the magnetoelectric coupling magnitude can be tuned through suitable substitutional elements, even at low level, inducing local lattice distortions with different electronic and magnetic properties.</description>

      <title>How Graph Neural Network Interatomic Potentials Extrapolate: Role of the Message-Passing Algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph neural network interatomic potentials (GNN-IPs) are gaining significant attention due to their capability of learning from large datasets. Specifically, universal interatomic potentials based on GNN, usually trained with crystal geometries, often exhibit remarkable extrapolative behavior towards untrained domains, such as surfaces or amorphous configurations. However, the origin of this extrapolation capability is not well understood. This work provides a theoretical explanation of how GNN-IPs extrapolate to untrained geometries. First, we demonstrate that GNN-IPs can capture non-local electrostatic interactions through the message-passing algorithm, as evidenced by tests on a toy model and DFT data. We find that GNN-IPs accurately predict electrostatic forces in untrained domains, indicating that they have learned the exact functional form of the Coulomb interaction. Based on these results, we suggest that the ability to learn non-local electrostatic interactions, coupled with the embedding nature of GNN-IPs, explains their extrapolation ability. Finally, we find that the universal GNN-IP, SevenNet-0, effectively infers non-local Coulomb interactions in untrained domains.</description>

      <title>Effect of helium bubbles on the mobility of edge dislocations in copper</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Helium bubbles can form in materials upon exposure to irradiation. It is well known that the presence of helium bubbles can cause changes in the mechanical behavior of materials. To improve the lifetime of nuclear components, it is important to understand deformation mechanisms in helium-containing materials. In this work, we investigate the interactions between edge dislocations and helium bubbles in copper using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We focus on the effect of helium bubble pressure (equivalently, the helium-to-vacancy ratio) on the obstacle strength of helium bubbles and their interaction with dislocations. Our simulations predict significant differences in the interaction mechanisms as a function of helium bubble pressure. Specifically, bubbles with high internal pressure are found to exhibit weaker obstacle strength as compared to low-pressure bubbles of the same size due to the formation of super-jogs in the dislocation. Activation energies and rate constants extracted from the MD data confirm this transition in mechanism and enable upscaling of these phenomena to higher length-scale models.</description>

Abstract: Cs$_2$AgBiBr$_6$ exhibits promising photovoltaic and light-emitting properties, making it a candidate for next-generation solar cells and LED technologies. Additionally, it serves as a model system within the family of halide double perovskites, offering insights into the broader class of materials. Here, we study various possible excited states of this material to understand its absorption and emission properties. We use Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TD-DFT) coupled with non-empirical hybrid functionals, specifically PBE0($\alpha$) and dielectric-dependent hybrids (DDH) to explore direct, indirect, and self-trapped excitons in this material. Based on comparison with experiment, we show that these methods can give excellent prediction of the absorption spectrum and that the fundamental band gap has been underestimated in previous computational studies. We connect the experimental photoluminescence signals at 1.9-2.0 eV to the emission from self-trapped excitons and electron polarons. Finally, we reveal a complex landscape with energetically competing direct, indirect, and self-trapped excitons in the material.</description>

      <title>Towards Verifying Exact Conditions of Density Functional Theory Approximations</title>

Abstract: Density Functional Theory (DFT) is used extensively in the computation of electronic properties of matter, with various applications. Approximating the exchange-correlation (XC) functional is the key to the Kohn-Sham DFT approach, the basis of most DFT calculations. The choice of this density functional approximation (DFA) depends crucially on the particular system under study, which has resulted in the development of hundreds of DFAs. Though the exact density functional is not known, researchers have discovered analytical properties of this exact functional. Furthermore, these exact conditions are used when designing DFAs. We present XCVerifier, the first approach for verifying whether a DFA implementation satisfies the DFT exact conditions. XCVerifier was evaluated on five DFAs from the popular Libxc library and seven exact conditions from recent work. XCVerifier was able to verify or find violations for a majority of the DFA/condition pairs, demonstrating the feasibility of using formal methods to verify DFA implementations.</description>

      <title>Exciton diffusion in two-dimensional chiral perovskites</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05946v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites emerged as a versatile platform for light-emitting and photovol-taic applications due to their unique structural design and chemical flexibility. Their properties depend heavily on both the choice of the inorganic lead halide framework and the surrounding organic layers. Recently, the introduction of chiral cations into 2D perovskites has attracted major interest due to their potential for introducing chirality and tuning the chiro-optical response. Importantly, the optical properties in these materials are dominated by tightly bound excitons that also serve as primary carriers for the energy transport. The mobility of photoinjected excitons is thus important from the perspectives of fundamental material properties and optoelectronic applications, yet remains an open question. Here, we demonstrate exciton propagation in a 2D chiral perovskite methylbenzylammonium lead iodide (MBA2PbI4) using transient photoluminescence microscopy and reveal density-dependent transport over more than 100 nanometers at room temperature with diffusion coeffi-cients as high as 2 cm2/s. We observe two distinct regimes of initially rapid diffusive propagation and subsequent localiza-tion. Moreover, perovskites with enantiomer pure cations are found to exhibit faster exciton diffusion compared to the race-mic mixture, correlated with the impact of the material composition on disorder. Altogether, the observations of efficient exciton diffusion at room temperature highlight the potential of 2D chiral perovskites to merge chiro-optical properties with strong light-matter interaction and efficient energy transport.</description>

      <title>Superfluid Stiffness and Josephson Quantum Capacitance: Adiabatic Approach and Topological Effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12223v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We bring forward a unified framework for the study of the superfluid stiffness and the quantum capacitance of superconducting platforms exhibiting conventional spin-singlet pairing. We focus on systems which in their normal phase contain topological band touching points or crossings, while in their superconducting regime feature a fully gapped energy spectrum. Our unified description relies on viewing these two types of physical quantities as the charge current and density response coefficients obtained for ``slow" spatiotemporal variations of the superconducting phase. Within our adiabatic formalism, the two coefficients are given in terms of Berry curvatures defined in synthetic spaces. Our work lays the foundations for the systematic description of topological diagonal superfluid responses induced by singularities dictating the synthetic Berry curvatures. We exemplify our approach for concrete one- and two-dimensional models of superconducting topological (semi)metals. We discuss topological phenomena which arise in the superfluid stiffness of bulk systems and the quantum capacitance of Josephson junctions. We show that both coefficients become proportional to a topological invariant which counts the number of topological touchings/crossings of the normal phase band structure. These topological effects can be equivalently viewed as manifestations of chiral anomaly. Our predictions appear experimentally testable in topological semimetals with proximity-induced pairing, such as in graphene-superconductor hybrids at charge neutrality.</description>

Abstract: Deep-learning density functional theory (DFT) shows great promise to significantly accelerate material discovery and potentially revolutionize materials research. However, current research in this field primarily relies on data-driven supervised learning, making the developments of neural networks and DFT isolated from each other. In this work, we present a theoretical framework of neural-network DFT, which unifies the optimization of neural networks with the variational computation of DFT, enabling physics-informed unsupervised learning. Moreover, we develop a differential DFT code incorporated with deep-learning DFT Hamiltonian, and introduce algorithms of automatic differentiation and backpropagation into DFT, demonstrating the capability of neural-network DFT. The physics-informed neural-network architecture not only surpasses conventional approaches in accuracy and efficiency, but also offers a new paradigm for developing deep-learning DFT methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19445v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superconducting diode effects have recently attracted much attention for their potential applications in superconducting logic circuits. Several mechanisms such as magneto-chiral effects, finite momentum Cooper pairing, asymmetric edge currents have been proposed to give rise to a supercurrent diode effect in different materials. In this work, we establish the presence of a large intrinsic Josephson diode effect in a type-II Dirac semimetal $1T-PtTe_2$ facilitated by its helical spin-momentum locking and distinguish it from other extrinsic effects. The magnitude of the Josephson diode effect is shown to be directly correlated to the large second-harmonic component of the supercurrent that is induced by the significant contribution of the topological spin-momentum locked states that promote coherent Andreev processes in the junction. We denote such junctions, where the relative phase between the two harmonics corresponding to charge transfers of $2e$ and $4e$ can be tuned by a magnetic field, as second order ${\phi}_0$-junctions. The direct correspondence between the second harmonic supercurrent component and the diode effect in $1T-PtTe_2$ junctions makes topological semimetals with high transparency an ideal platform to study and implement the Josephson diode effect, while also enabling further research on higher order supercurrent transport in Josephson junctions.</description>
