      <title>A new iterative three-point method for solving systems of nonlinear equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A three-point iterative method for solving scalar non-linear equations was selected and then adapted to solve systems of non-linear equations. Subsequently, by applying Taylor's theorem to functions of $\R^{n}$ in $\R^{n}$, it is shown that the new method also has a sixth order of convergence. It is confirmed that the theoretical order of convergence coincides with the computational order of convergence by the numerical solution of two problems. Finally, its computational efficiency is calculated and subsequently compared with that of other three-point methods of fifth and sixth order convergence that also solve systems of non-linear equations.</description>

      <title>Conjectures on Sums of Consecutive Primes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study additive properties of consecutive prime numbers and the primality of the sums they generate. For a given prime number $p_n$, we consider the sums \[ S_k(p_n) = p_n + p_{n+1} + \cdots + p_{n+k-1}, \] where $k \ge 3$ is an odd integer. We first formulate an existence conjecture asserting that, for every prime number $p_n$, there exists at least one odd length $k \ge 3$ such that $S_k(p_n)$ is itself a prime number. An exhaustive computational verification covering the first one million prime numbers revealed no counterexamples. We then propose a strengthened conjecture according to which, for every prime number $p_n$, there exist infinitely many odd lengths $k$ such that $S_k(p_n)$ is prime. This strong version is supported by a probabilistic heuristic showing that the series of the corresponding primality probabilities diverges, suggesting that the phenomenon is not exceptional but recurrent. We also analyze the possible modular obstructions, showing that they are local in nature and cannot persist when the length $k$ varies among odd integers. A Diophantine interpretation of the problem is proposed, together with a conceptual comparison with the generalized Goldbach conjecture. Finally, we discuss the role of the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis (GRH) in controlling the distribution of the sums under consideration. These structural, modular, Diophantine, and probabilistic (heuristic) arguments support both conjectures and formalize heuristic theorems of Cram\'er, GRH, and Hardy--Littlewood type explaining the expected absence of counterexamples.</description>

      <title>High-Degree Polynomial Approximations for Solving Linear Integral, Integro-Differential, and Ordinary Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a universal numerical scheme tailored for tackling linear integral, integro-differential, and both initial and boundary value problems of ordinary differential equations. The numerical scheme is readily adapted for resolving ill-posed problems. Central to our approach is high-degree piecewise-polynomial approximation to the exact solution. We illustrate the accuracy and stability of our numerical solutions in the presence of noise through illustrative examples. Additionally, we demonstrate that proposed regularization being applied to high-degree interpolation, effectively eliminates Runge's phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Structures in the Stopping Time Dynamics of the 3x+1 Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03385</link>
      <description>arXiv:1709.03385v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $3x+1$ problem concerns the iteration of the map $T:\mathbb{Z}\to\mathbb{Z}$ defined by $T(x)=x/2$ for even $x$ and $T(x)=(3x+1)/2$ for odd $x$. This paper investigates the stopping time dynamics associated with $T$ within a deterministic and algebraic framework. By relating the parity vectors of Collatz trajectories to exponential Diophantine equations, we construct a recursively generated tree of congruence classes $\bmod\, 2^{\sigma_n}$ that characterizes the stopping time classes $\sigma(x)=\sigma_n$. We demonstrate that the generation of these classes follows an explicit deterministic recursion and derive arithmetic transition rules between neighboring congruence classes, based on the differences of the associated Diophantine sums. Finally, we prove that the union of stopping time congruence classes generated up to a fixed order $N$ is periodic, establishing a computable finite-range coverage bound.</description>

      <title>Newton-Mandelbrot set and Murase-Mandelbrot set</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14872v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain four extended Newton's methods and three extended Mandelbrot's recurrence formulas from the Wasan (Japanese mathematics in the Edo period (1603-1868)). Furthermore, two extended Newton's methods relate to one of the extended Mandelbrot's recurrence formulas. We lead four types of extended Mandelbrot recurrence formulas. Next, we show that these become the same extended Mandelbrot set, and connected, closed set. These show the originality of Wasan.</description>

      <title>A Generalization of the Fox H-function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we present a generalization of the Fox H-function called Fox-Barnes J-function. Like the Fox H-function, it is defined as a contour integral in the complex plane, but instead of an integrand given by a ratio of products of gamma functions involving several parameters, we use a ratio of products of double gamma functions. We study the conditions for its existence and how to choose a contour of integration based on the involved parameters. We discuss how the Fox H-function appears as a particular case and prove some properties of the Fox-Barnes J-function. As an application, we show how the Laplace transform of the Kilbas-Saigo function can be conveniently written in terms of the Fox-Barnes J-function, even in cases where the usual series representation is not convergent.</description>

      <title>Computational Evidence Against Quadratic-Cubic Factorization for the Second Cuboid Quintic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $Q_{p,q}(t)\in\mathbb{Z}[t]$ be Sharipov's even monic degree-$10$ second cuboid polynomial depending on coprime integers $p\neq q&gt;0$. Writing $Q_{p,q}(t)$ as a quintic in $t^{2}$ produces an associated monic quintic polynomial. After the weighted normalization $r=p/q$ and $s=r^{2}$ we obtain a one-parameter family $P_s(x)\in\mathbb{Q}[x]$ such that \[ Q_{p,q}(t)=q^{20}\,P_s\!\left(\frac{t^{2}}{q^{4}}\right)\qquad\text{with}\qquad s=\left(\frac{p}{q}\right)^{2}. \] Assuming a quadratic divisor $x^{2}+ax+b$ with $a,b\in\mathbb{Q}$, we reduce divisibility of $P_s(x)$ to the vanishing of an explicit remainder \[ R(x)=R_{1}(s,a,b)\,x+R_{0}(s,a,b). \] A key structural observation is that $R_1$ and $R_0$ are quadratic in $b$ and that, on the equation $R_1=0$, the second condition becomes linear in $b$. This yields a one-direction elimination to a plane obstruction curve $F(s,a)=0$ with $F\in\mathbb{Z}[s,a]$, without any lifting-back issues: when the linear coefficient is nonzero, the parameter $b$ is forced to be the rational value $b=C/L$. We isolate the degenerate locus $L=C=0$ and show it produces only $s=\pm 1$ (hence only $s=1$ in the cuboid domain $s&gt;0$). Let $\overline{C}\subset\mathbb{P}^{2}$ be the projective closure of $F(s,a)=0$. Using Magma we perform a height-bounded search for rational points on $\overline{C}$. With bound $H=10^{9}$, the search returns $8$ rational points, whose affine part has $s\in\{-1,0,1\}$. In particular, no affine rational point with $s&gt;0$ and $s\neq 1$ is found up to this bound. This provides strong computational evidence that for rational $s&gt;0$, $s\neq 1$, the quintic $P_s(x)$ admits no quadratic factor over $\mathbb{Q}$ (equivalently, no $2+3$ (quadratic-cubic) factorization over $\mathbb{Q}$), and yields a conditional exclusion assuming completeness of the rational-point enumeration on $\overline{C}$.</description>
