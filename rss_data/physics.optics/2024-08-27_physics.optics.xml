      <title>All-dielectric silicon microring resonators with deeply sub-diffractive mode volumes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report an approach to achieve deeply sub-diffractive mode volumes in all-dielectric ring resonators. Specifically, we leverage simultaneous usage of nanostructured subwavelength metamaterial waveguides and excitation of standing wave rather than traveling wave whispering gallery mode (WGM) resonances. This enables the mode volume to be reduced by factors greater than 10 to 100 compared to a diffraction-limited silicon microring resonator. We also highlight how a combination of diffractive mode volume scaling and sub-diffractive near-field intensity scaling indicates a lower limit for the sub-diffractive all-dielectric mode volume, $V_{\text{min}}'$, which scales in proportion to the mode order times the refractive index raised to the seventh power, i.e., $V_{\text{min}}' \sim m n^{-7}$. Through both numerical modeling and experimental characterization, we systematically investigate the modal properties of metawaveguide ring resonators comprised of Si and SiO$_2$. The sub-diffractive devices are experimentally shown to support standing wave resonances with high intrinsic quality factors, on the order of $10^4$ to $10^5$. These metamaterial ring resonators present a promising WGM platform for interfacing wavelength-scale optics with sub-wavelength matter.</description>

      <title>Photonic time-delayed reservoir computing based on lithium niobate microring resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On-chip micro-ring resonators (MRRs) have been proposed for constructing delay reservoir computing (RC) systems, offering a highly scalable, high-density computational architecture that is easy to manufacture. However, most proposed RC schemes have utilized passive integrated optical components based on silicon-on-insulator (SOI), and RC systems based on lithium niobate on insulator (LNOI) have not yet been reported. The nonlinear optical effects exhibited by lithium niobate microphotonic devices introduce new possibilities for RC design. In this work, we design an RC scheme based on a series-coupled MRR array, leveraging the unique interplay between thermo-optic nonlinearity and photorefractive effects in lithium niobate. We first demonstrate the existence of three regions defined by wavelength detuning between the primary LNOI micro-ring resonator and the coupled micro-ring array, where one region achieves an optimal balance between nonlinearity and high memory capacity at extremely low input energy, leading to superior computational performance. We then discuss in detail the impact of each ring's nonlinearity and the system's symbol duration on performance. Finally, we design a wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) based multi-task parallel computing scheme, showing that the computational performance for multiple tasks matches that of single-task computations.</description>

      <title>Designing electromagnetic resonators with quasinormal modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Micro- and nanoresonators, which enable light trapping in small volumes for extended durations, play a crucial role in modern photonics. The optical response of these resonators is determined by their fundamental resonances, known as quasinormal modes (QNMs). Over the past decade, the electromagnetic theory of QNMs has undergone significant development and has now reached a level of maturity that allows its reliable application to numerous contemporary electromagnetic problems. In this review, we explore recent applications of QNM theory for designing and understanding micro and nanoresonators. We highlight why QNMs provide deep physical insights and enhance computational efficiency in scenarios involving mode hybridization and perturbation.</description>

      <title>High-power femtosecond mid-IR source with tunable center frequency and chirp</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an experimental implementation of a chirped mid-infrared (mid-IR) high-power laser source with variable center frequency between 4 THz to 30 THz and continuously tunable frequency sweep of up to 20 % within one pulse, with a pulse duration of 2 ps. The peak electric field obtained at 4 THz is 1.5 MV/cm. We generate the mid-IR light using a difference-frequency generation (DFG) process with two phase-locked, chirped IR pulses. The obtained mid-IR electric field waveform is characterized using electro-optic sampling. We compare our experimental results with the predictions of numerical simulations. The results indicate the potential for efficient driving of vibrational modes into a strongly anharmomic regime, in cases where using Fourier-transform-limited pulses to achieve similar vibrational amplitudes would lead to dielectric breakdown.</description>

      <title>Remote detection of radioactive material using a short pulse CO2 laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detection of radioactive material at distances greater than the radiated particle range is an important goal with applications in areas such as national defense and disaster response. Here we demonstrate avalanche-breakdown-based remote detection of a 3.6 mCi alpha-particle source at a stand-off distance of 10 m, using 70 ps, long wave infrared (lambda=9.2 micron) CO2 laser pulses. This is ~10X longer than our previous results using a mid-IR laser. The primary detection method is direct backscatter from microplasmas generated in the laser focal volume. The backscatter signal is amplified as it propagates back through the CO2 laser chain, enhancing sensitivity by &gt;100X. We also characterize breakdown plasmas with fluorescence imaging, and present a simple model to estimate backscattered signal as a function of the seed density profile in the laser focal volume. All of this was achieved with a relatively long drive laser focal geometry (f/200) that is readily scalable to &gt;100 m.</description>

      <title>Room-temperature polariton condensate in a two-dimensional hybrid perovskite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Layered 2D halide perovskites are chemically synthesized realizations of quantum well stacks with giant exciton oscillator strengths, tunable emission spectra and very large exciton binding energies. While these features render 2D halide perovskites a promising platform for room-temperature polaritonics, bosonic condensation and polariton lasing in 2D perovskites have so far remained elusive at ambient conditions. Here, we demonstrate room-temperature cavity exciton-polariton condensation in mechanically exfoliated crystals of the 2D Ruddlesden-Popper iodide perovskite $(BA)_{2}(MA)_{2}Pb_{3}I_{10}$ in an open optical microcavity. We observe a polariton condensation threshold of $P_{th}=6.76 fJ$ per pulse and detect a strong non-linear response. Interferometric measurements confirm the spontaneous emergence of spatial coherence across the condensate with an associated first-order autocorrelation reaching $g^{(1)}\approx 0.6$. Our results lay the foundation for a new class of room-temperature polariton lasers based on 2D halide perovskites with great potential for hetero-integration with other van-der-Waals materials and combination with photonic crystals or waveguides.</description>

      <title>Multi-watt long-wavelength infrared femtosecond lasers and resonant enamel ablation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-power broadband tunable long-wavelength infrared (LWIR) femtosecond lasers operating at fingerprint wavelengths of 7-14 {\mu}m hold significant promise across a range of applications, including molecular hyperspectral imaging, strong-field light-matter interaction, and resonant tissue ablation. Here we present 6-12 {\mu}m broadband tunable parametric amplifier based on LiGaS2 or BaGa4S7, generating new record output power of 2.4 W at 7.5 {\mu}m, and 1.5 W at 9.5 {\mu}m, pumped by a simple and effective thin-square-rod Yb:YAG amplifier producing 110 W 274 fs output pulses. As a proof of concept, we showcase efficient resonant ablation and microstructure fabrication on enamel at the hydroxyapatite resonant wavelength of 9.5 {\mu}m, with a laser intensity two orders-of-magnitude lower than that required by non-resonant femtosecond lasers, which could foster more precision surgical applications with superior biosafety.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interconnection of lasers is pivotal across various research domains, from generating high-power lasers to studying out-of-equilibrium coupled systems. This paper explores our investigation into Hermitian coupling between lasers in an array, with the aim of achieving arbitrary coupling and creating artificial gauge fields that can break time-reversal symmetry. For that, we investigated Hermitian coupling within three laser array geometries: a square array of 100 lasers, a triangular array of 130 lasers, and a ring array of 8 lasers. In the square array, we implemented arbitrary laser coupling with a precision of $2\pi/120$ radians, enabling the attainment of any desired phase-locking state. In the triangular array, we controlled the chirality of the lasers with 99% purity. In the ring array, the introduction of an artificial gauge field revealed discrete quantized first-order transitions between distinct topological phase-locking states. This arbitrary coupling, with control over both the strength and phase, paves the way for exploring spin systems and configurations characterized by exotic, non-conventional coupling.</description>

      <title>Uncovering the complex mechanisms behind nanomaterials-based plasmon-driven photocatalysis through the utilization of Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasmonic materials have got wide attention as a potential candidate for light driven catalysis of chemical conversions by harnessing solar energy to reduce the environmental issues generated by fossil fuels-based bulk chemical industries. Toward diluting this crisis, many reported the utilization of plasmonic nanostructured materials in driving industrially important reactions at normal temperature and pressure. However, these chemical conversions often suffer from low yield difficulties, and poor efficiency problems. Also, the mechanism of energy transfer from plasmon to desired molecules is still not properly understood which retards the efforts of scaling them up. Recent endeavors of using SERS to explore the complex mechanisms associated with plasmonic photocatalysis have shown great promises because of the higher sensitivity of the technique. In this article, our aim is to analyze the role of ultrafast SERS in revealing charge transfer as the primary mechanism of photocatalytic reaction of 4-nitrothiophenol to azobenzene-4,4-dithiol and how nanoparticles other than noble metals can also drive this dimerization reaction with similar potential of noble metals. We also intend to investigate why plasmonic heating occurring at metal surface is inadequate to run photocatalytic conversions. A series of analysis has been done in these works using SERS to gather data and understand the mechanisms involved in the processes by pumping plasmonic resonance simultaneously and investigating signals from molecules at various time delays. These results open the door for researchers to consider SERS as a promising technique to uncover the physical and chemical processes involved in plasmon-driven photocatalysis and to advance toward environment friendly and cost-efficient photochemical conversions in future.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Cherenkov radiation in twisted hyperbolic Van der Waals crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cherenkov radiation in artificial structures experiencing strong radiation enhancements promises important applications in free-electron quantum emitters, broadband light sources, miniaturized particle detectors, etc. However, the momentum matching condition between the swift electron and emitted photons generally restricts the radiation enhancement to a particular momentum. Efficient Cherenkov radiation over a wide range of momenta is highly demanded for many applications but has still remained a challenging task. To this end, we explore the interaction between a swift electron and twisted hyperbolic Van der Waals crystals, and observe enhanced Cherenkov radiation at the flatband resonance frequency. We show that, at the photonic magic angle of the twisted crystals, the electron momentum, once matching with that of the flatband photon, gives rise to a maximum energy loss (corresponding to the surface phonon generation), one-order of magnitude higher than that in conventional hyperbolic materials. Such a significant enhancement is attributed to the excitation of flatband surface phonon polaritons over a broad momentum range. Our findings provide a feasible route to highly directional free-electron radiation and radiation shaping.</description>

      <title>One-dimensional Photonic Crystal Structure Enhanced External-Magnetic-Field-Free Spintronic Terahertz High-Field Emitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intense terahertz (THz) radiation in free space offers multifaceted capabilities for accelerating electron, understanding the mesoscale architecture in (bio)materials, elementary excitation and so on. Recently popularized spintronic THz emitters (STEs) with their versatility such as ultra-broadband, cost-effectiveness, large-size and ease for-integration have become one of the most promising alternative for the next generation of intense THz sources. Nevertheless, the typical W| Co20Fe60B20 | Pt necessitates an external-magnetic-field to saturate magnetization for stable operation, limiting its scalability for achieving higher THz field with uniform distribution over larger sample areas. Here we demonstrate the methodologies of enhancing the high-field THz radiation of external-magnetic-field-free IrMn3 | Co20Fe60B20 |W heterostructure via optimizing the substrate with superior thermal conductivity and integrating a one-dimensional photonic crystal (PC) structure to maximize the radiation efficiency. Under the excitation of a Ti: sapphire femtosecond laser amplifier with central wavelength of 800 nm, pulse duration of 35 fs, and repetition rate of 1 kHz and maximum single pulse energy of 5.5 mJ, we successfully generate intense THz radiation with focal peak electric field up to 1.1 MV/cm with frequency range covering 0.1-10 THz without external-magnetic-fields. These high-field STEs will also enable other applications such as ultra-broadband high-field THz spectroscopy and polarization-based large-size strong-field THz imaging.</description>

      <title>The twin paradox and time dilation have equivalents in polarization optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phenomena known as the twin-paradox and time dilation, which are familiar effects in the special theory of relativity, have analogous counterparts in polarization optics. To show that, we present the concept of proper irradiance for a partially polarized lightwave. The analogous effect of the twin paradox is that the proper irradiance of the incoherent addition of two partially polarized lightwaves exceeds the sum of the proper irradiances of each individual lightwave. This effect does not pose a paradox in optics. The analog of time dilation is the increase in irradiance experienced by a lightwave as it propagates through a pure dichroic device.</description>

      <title>Unidirectional chiral scattering from single enantiomeric plasmonic nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling scattering and routing of chiral light at the nanoscale is important for optical information processing and imaging, quantum technologies as well as optical manipulation. Here, we introduce a concept of rotating chiral dipoles in order to achieve unidirectional chiral scattering. Implementing this concept by engineering multipole excitations in plasmonic helicoidal nanoparticles, we experimentally demonstrate enantio-sensitive and highly-directional forward scattering of circularly polarised light. The intensity of this highly-directional scattering is defined by the mutual relation between the handedness of the incident light and the chirality of the structure. The concept of rotating chiral dipoles opens up numerous possibilities for engineering of scattering from chiral nanostructures and optical nano-antennas for the design and application of chiral light-matter interaction.</description>

      <title>Coexisting phases of individual VO$_2$ nanoparticles for multilevel nanoscale memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vanadium dioxide (VO$_2$) has received significant interest in the context of nanophotonic metamaterials and memories owing to its reversible insulator-metal transition associated with significant changes in its optical and electronic properties. While the VO$_2$ transition has been extensively studied for several decades, the hysteresis dynamics of individual single-crystal VO$_2$ nanoparticles (NPs) remains largely unexplored. Here, employing transmission electron microscopy techniques, we investigate phase transitions of single VO$_2$ NPs in real time. Our analysis reveals the statistical distribution of the transition temperature and steepness and how they differ during forward (heating) and backward (cooling) transitions. We assess the stability of coexisting phases in individual NPs and prove the persistent multilevel memory at near-room temperatures using only a few VO$_2$ NPs. Our findings shed new light on the underlying physical mechanisms governing the hysteresis of VO$_2$ and establish VO$_2$ NPs as a promising component of optoelectronic and memory devices with enhanced functionalities.</description>

Abstract: Collective light-matter interactions have been used to control chemistry and energy transfer, yet accessible approaches that combine ab initio methodology with large many-body quantum optical systems are missing due to the fast increase in computational cost for explicit simulations. We introduce an accessible ab initio quantum embedding concept for many-body quantum optical systems that allows to treat the collective coupling of molecular many-body systems effectively in the spirit of macroscopic QED while keeping the rigor of ab initio quantum chemistry for the molecular structure. Our approach fully includes the quantum fluctuations of the polaritonic field and yet remains much simpler and more intuitive than complex embedding approaches such as dynamical mean-field theory. We illustrate the underlying assumptions by comparison to the Tavis--Cummings model. The intuitive application of the quantized embedding approach and its transparent limitations offer a practical framework for the field of ab initio polaritonic chemistry to describe collective effects in realistic molecular ensembles.</description>

      <title>Engineering biphoton spectral wavefunction in a silicon micro-ring resonator with split resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Frequency-time is a degree of freedom suitable for photonic high-dimensional entanglement, with advantages such as compatibility with single-mode devices and insensitivity to dispersion. The engineering control of the frequency-time amplitude of a photon's electric field has been demonstrated on platforms with second-order optical nonlinearity. For integrated photonic platforms with only third-order optical nonlinearity, the engineered generation of the state remains unexplored. Here, we demonstrate a cavity-enhanced photon-pair source on the silicon-on-insulator (SOI) platform that can generate both separable states and controllable entangled states in the frequency domain without post-manipulation. By choosing different resonance combinations and employing on-chip optical field differentiation, we achieve independent control over two functions that affect the joint spectral intensity (JSI) of the state. A semi-analytical model is derived to simulate the biphoton spectral wavefunction in the presence of resonance splitting and pump differentiation, and its parameters can be fully determined through fitting-based parameter extraction from the resonator's measured linear response. The measured spectral purity for the separable state is $95.5\pm 1.2\%$, while the measured JSIs for the entangled states show two- or four-peaked functions in two-dimensional frequency space. The experiments and simulations demonstrate the capacity to manipulate the frequency-domain wavefunction in a silicon-based device, which is promising for applications like quantum information processing using pulsed temporal-mode encoding or long-distance quantum key distribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Silicon color centers (SiCCs) have recently emerged as potential building blocks for light emitters in Si photonics, quantum emitters with spin storage capabilities, and Si-based quantum repeaters. We have recently developed a non-invasive method to engineer carbon-related SiCCs confined to ultra-thin nanolayers within a pristine crystalline environment, which is of utmost importance for the photostability of SiCCs. Here, we demonstrate embedding these C-doping-based SiCCs into the only 9 nm wide intrinsic region of a p-i-n diode using the epitaxial self-assembly of color centers. We report electrically-pumped light emission with an exponential increase in the intensity as a function of the driving current until saturation. We associate this property with the shift of quasi-Fermi-level position upon electrical driving, which simultaneously improves the spectral homogeneity of the engineered SiCCs. Our study demonstrates the electrical control and driving of near-infrared emitters in high-quality silicon diodes, an essential milestone for advancing classical and quantum optoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Charge Transfer Dynamics at the MoS$_2$/Au Interface Observed via Optical Spectroscopy under Ambient Conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To take advantage of the exceptional properties of atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC) for advanced devices and catalysts, integration with metallic surfaces is an efficacious approach for facilitating charge carrier injection and extraction from TMDC monolayers. Light-matter interactions predominantly occur at the K point in TMDC monolayers, making the charge carrier dynamics at this point essential for their optimal performance. However, direct access to and comprehensive understanding of the charge carrier dynamics at the K point of TMDC monolayer on a metal substrate remains challenging. In this study, we employed azimuth- and polarization-dependent final-state sum frequency generation (FS-SFG) spectroscopy to investigate the ultrafast dynamics of charge transfer at the K point of a MoS$_2$ monolayer interfaced with an Au substrate. We observed an ultrafast injection (sub-20 fs) of photoexcited hot electrons from the Au substrate to the conduction band minimum (CBM) of the MoS$_2$ monolayer. Subsequently, driven by an internal electric field induced by charge redistribution, injected hot electrons in MoS$_2$ experience a relaxation and fast return ($\sim2$ ps) from the CBM and a trap state mediated slow return ($\sim60$ ps) process. The direct optical observation of the full electron dynamics at the K point of MoS$_2$ monolayer in ambient conditions provides valuable insights into the mechanisms of charge carrier transfer across the TMDC-metal interface, informing the design of advanced TMDC-based devices with enhanced charge transfer rates.</description>

      <title>Batch-FPM: Random batch-update multi-parameter physical Fourier ptychography neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fourier Ptychographic Microscopy (FPM) is a computational imaging technique that enables high-resolution imaging over a large field of view. However, its application in the biomedical field has been limited due to the long image reconstruction time and poor noise robustness. In this paper, we propose a fast and robust FPM reconstruction method based on physical neural networks with batch update stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization strategy, capable of achieving attractive results with low single-to-noise ratio and correcting multiple system parameters simultaneously. Our method leverages a random batch optimization approach, breaks away from the fixed sequential iterative order and gives greater attention to high-frequency information. The proposed method has better convergence performance even for low signal-to-noise ratio data sets, such as low exposure time dark-field images. As a result, it can greatly increase the image recording and result reconstruction speed without any additional hardware modifications. By utilizing advanced deep learning optimizers and perform parallel computational scheme, our method enhances GPU computational efficiency, significantly reducing reconstruction costs. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves near real-time digital refocusing of a 1024 x 1024 pixels region of interest on consumer-grade GPUs. This approach significantly improves temporal resolution (by reducing the exposure time of dark-field images), noise resistance, and reconstruction speed, and therefore can efficiently promote the practical application of FPM in clinical diagnostics, digital pathology, and biomedical research, etc. In addition, we believe our algorithm scheme can help researchers quickly validate and implement FPM-related ideas. We invite requests for the full code via email.</description>

      <title>Optical Inversion Using Plasmonic Contrast Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a new method to reconstruct the permittivity distribution, of an object to image, from the remotely measured electromagnetic field. We propose to use the remote fields measured before and after injecting locally in the medium plasmonic nano-particles. Such a technique is known in the framework of imaging using contrast agents where, in optical imaging, the nano-particles play the role of these contrast agents. The plasmonic nano-particles are known to enjoy resonant effects, as enhancing the applied incident field, while excited at certain particular frequencies called plasmonic resonances. These resonant frequencies encode the values of the unknown permittivity at the location of the injected nano-particles. The imaging methods we propose mainly use this resonant effect. We show that the imaging functional build up from contrasting the fields before and after injecting the nano-particles, measured at one single back-scattered direction, and in an explicit band of incident frequencies reaches its maximum values, in terms of the incident frequency, precisely at the mentioned plasmonic resonances. Such a behavior allows us to recover these plasmonic resonances from which we recover the point-wise values of the permittivity distribution.
  In this work, we describe the method and provide the mathematical justification of this resonant effect and its use for the optical inversion using plasmonic nano-particles as contrast agents.</description>

      <title>Phonon-induced modification of polaritonic Rabi oscillations in the presence of the dark excitonic condensate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optically inactive (dark) excitons are characterized by relatively long life time, and therefore are desirable candidates for realizing collective excitonic phases. However, a detection of their coherence by light is problematic. Here we propose a method for detecting a dark excitonic condensate. It relies on the interaction between excitons and phonons responsible for the interconversion between bright and dark excitons. As long as the dark condensate forms, the Rabi oscillations between photons and bright excitons can become strongly modified. The analysis is conducted in the limit of weak interaction, and the perspective for the case of the strong interaction leading to the polaronic effect is discussed.</description>

Abstract: The Poisson spot is a fascinating lecture demonstration. Its simple explanation can lead to further questions, not only the one posed in the title, but also questions such as why the simple model that considers only light passing just outside the spherical object is successful.

      <description>arXiv:2408.14162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The phase-resolved imaging of confined light fields by homodyne detection is a cornerstone of metrology in nano-optics and photonics, but its application in electron microscopy has been limited so far. Here, we report the mapping of optical modes in a waveguide structure by illumination with femtosecond light pulses in a continuous-beam transmission electron microscope. Multi-photon photoemission results in a remanent charging pattern which we image by Lorentz microscopy. The resulting image contrast is linked to the intensity distribution of the standing light wave and quantitatively described within an analytical model. The robustness of the approach is showcased in a wider parameter range and more complex sample geometries including micro- and nanostructures. We discuss further applications of light-interference-based charging for electron microscopy with in-situ optical excitation, laying the foundation for advanced measurement schemes for the phase-resolved imaging of propagating light fields.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Design of Au-Based Alloys for Improved Plasmon Delivery and Nanoheating in Near-Field Transducers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasmonic near-field transducers (NFTs) play a key role in administering nanoscale heating for a number of applications ranging from medical devices to next generation data processing technology. We present a novel multi-scale approach, combining quantum many-body perturbation theory with finite-element modelling, to predict the electric and thermal material parameters of various Au-based, noble metal (M) alloys. Specifically, we focus on modelling their performance within an NFT designed to focus high-intensity, sub-diffracted light for technologies such as nanoscale etching, manipulation, sensing, and heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR). Elemental Au is the long-standing general-purpose NFT medium due its excellent plasmonic performance at relevant wavelengths. However, elemental Au is a soft, ductile material that tends to extrude and deform in response to extreme temperature gradients. Therefore, alloying Au with other noble metals such as Ag, Cu, Pd or Pt, has attracted considerable interest for improved mechanical and thermal robustness while reaching threshold plasmonic generation at standard optoelectronics operating wavelengths (e.g., $\approx 830$~nm) and approximate high-power NFT temperatures ($\approx 400$~K). We predict that certain Au-Ag alloys may offer improved thermal stability as whole-NFT media compared to elemental Au, alongside plasmonic figures of merit comparable to that of Au. Simulations of certain solid solution Au-Pd/Pt alloys enable us to predict significantly enhanced thermal conductivity. We predict that alloying with Pd at low concentrations $\sim 10\%$ may preserve the NFT performance of Au, while offering the benefits of improved thermal and mechanical stability.</description>

      <title>Transformation and amplification of light modulated by a traveling wave with a relatively low frequency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19117v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The behavior of electromagnetic waves in a medium modulated in time and space, largely investigated decades ago, has recently attracted renewed interest. Here, we solve an intriguing problem of this research: can light with an initial frequency $\omega_0$ be amplified in a realistic photonic circuit solely pumped by a traveling wave with a much lower frequency $\omega_p \ll \omega_0$? Generally, the bandwidth of the modulation-induced optical frequency comb spectrum can be substantially broadened when the phase velocity of the traveling wave, $v_p$, approaches the phase velocity of light, $v_0$. However, in realistic photonic waveguides, the amplification effect remains small due to the unfeasible modulation and waveguide parameters required. In contrast, we demonstrate that modulating an optical resonator with a traveling wave that has a small phase velocity $v_p \ll v_0$ (rather than a synchronous $v_p \approx v_0$) can result in narrow-band light amplification, which is dramatically enhanced near the Brillouin phase-matching condition $\omega_p/v_p \approx 2\omega_0/v_0$. Our calculations show that the proposed amplifier of light can be realized in a lithium niobate racetrack resonator with millimeter-scale perimeter modulated by a surface acoustic wave with surprisingly small and practically achievable amplitude.</description>

Abstract: The generation of terawatt (TW) near-single-cycle laser pulses is of high interest for applications including attosecond science. Here we demonstrate a three-stage post-compression scheme in a non-guided geometry using He as the nonlinear medium, resulting in the generation of multi-mJ pulses with a duration of 3.7 fs. Key features of this approach are its simplicity, robustness and high stability, making it ideally suited for highly demanding applications such as attosecond-pump attosecond-probe spectroscopy (APAPS). This is demonstrated by performing two-color APAPS in Ar and Ne, where both simultaneous and sequential two-photon absorption are observed. Our approach is scalable to multi-TW powers.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The scattering of wavepackets with arbitrary energy dispersion on surfaces has been analyzed. Expanding up to second order in scattering shifts, it is found that besides the known Goos-H\"anchen or Imbert-Fedorov spatial offset, as well as the Wigner delay time, new momentum and frequency shifts appear. Furthermore, the width of the scattered wave packet becomes modified as well, which can lead to a shrinking of pulses by multiple scattering. For a model of dielectric material characterized by a longitudinal and transverse dielectric function the shifts are calculated analytically. From the Goos-H\"anchen and Imbert-Fedorov shifts one can access the longitudinal and transversal dielectric function. Perfectly aligned crystal symmetry axes with respect to scattering beam shows no Imbert-Fedorov effect. It is found that the Goos-H\"anchen and Imbert-Fedorov effect are absent for homogeneous materials. Oppositely it is found that the Wigner delay time and the shrinking of the temporal pulse width allows to access the dielectric function independent on the beam geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10792v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonlinear optical interactions in nanostructures are essential for both fundamental research and practical applications. The optical Kerr effect, a third-order nonlinear optical phenomenon, induces anisotropic changes in the refractive index of a material when exposed to high-intensity laser beams. However, the relatively modest magnitude of this effect limits its practical application in free-space nanophotonics. In this study, we achieve an enhancement of the optical Kerr effect by over three orders of magnitude using guided-mode resonance in a dielectric diffraction grating. Our work includes the design, fabrication, and measurement of the transmittance of a resonant silicon nitride (SiNx) crossed grating illuminated with short light pulses. We observe spectral resonance shifts with varying pulse power, resulting in more than fifty percent modulation of the resonance magnitude. Additionally, this study investigates the potential of the grating for dynamic pulse shaping. The presented results unveil promises in the development of next-generation all-optical devices, leveraging enhanced Kerr nonlinearities in dielectric gratings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of band topology in photonic crystals was primarily focused on near-field effects, including edge states and high order corner states. However, this work investigated the polarization distribution of radiated fields for photonic crystal slabs to get their far-field properties of band topology. We introduced a new topological invariant: the winding number of far-field polarization around the Brillouin zone boundary and confirmed a robust correspondence between it and the Chern number of energy bands from the perspective of symmetry, which can be used to analyze the process of topological phase transition. It is found that changes in the winding number and Chern number, associated with the exchange of far-field polarization singularities, especially for bound states in the continuum(BIC), will emerge during phase transition. These findings offer new insights for further understanding the intriguing properties of topological materials.</description>

      <title>Long-Propagating Ghost Phonon Polaritons Enabled by Selective Mode Excitation</title>

Abstract: The precise control of phonon polaritons(PhPs) is essential for advancements in nanophotonic applications like on-chip optical communication and quantum information processing. Ghost hyperbolic phonon polaritons (g-HPs), which have been recently discovered, feature in-plane hyperbolic dispersion and oblique wavefronts, enabling long-range propagation. Despite their potential, controlling the directionality and selective excitation of g-HPs remains challenging. Our research demonstrates that modifying the shape of the launching micro/nano antenna can achieve this control. Using an asymmetric triangular gold antenna on a calcite crystal surface, we achieve highly directional g-HP excitation by selectively targeting specific polariton modes. Additionally, the mode of g-HPs can be adjusted by changing the excitation wavelength or rotating the antenna. Remarkably, our near-field imaging experiments show g-HP propagation over distances exceeding 35 micrometers, more than twice the length reported in previous studies. This work merges g-HP theory with structural engineering, enhancing the control over g-HPs and paving the way for innovative applications in mid-IR optoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Light-enhanced nonlinear Hall effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.18038v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well known that a nontrivial Chern number results in quantized Hall conductance. What is less known is that, generically, the Hall response can be dramatically different from its quantized value in materials with broken inversion symmetry. This stems from the leading Hall contribution beyond the linear order, known as the Berry curvature dipole (BCD). While the BCD is in principle always present, it is typically very small outside of a narrow window close to a topological transition and is thus experimentally elusive without careful tuning of external fields, temperature, or impurities. In this work, we transcend this challenge by devising optical driving and quench protocols that enable practical and direct access to large BCD and nonlinear Hall responses. Varying the amplitude of an incident circularly polarized laser drives a topological transition between normal and Chern insulator phases, and importantly allows the precise unlocking of nonlinear Hall currents comparable to or larger than the linear Hall contributions. This strong BCD engineering is even more versatile with our two-parameter quench protocol, as demonstrated in our experimental proposal. Our predictions are expected to hold qualitatively across a broad range of Hall materials, thereby paving the way for the controlled engineering of nonlinear electronic properties in diverse media.</description>

      <title>Nonlocality enhanced precision in quantum polarimetry via entangled photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11932v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a nonlocal quantum approach to polarimetry, leveraging the phenomenon of entanglement in photon pairs to enhance the precision in sample property determination. By employing two distinct channels, one containing the sample of interest and the other serving as a reference, we explore the conditions under which the inherent correlation between entangled photons can increase measurement sensitivity. Specifically, we calculate the quantum Fisher information (QFI) and compare the accuracy and sensitivity for the cases of single sample channel versus two channel quantum state tomography measurements. The theoretical results are verified by experimental analysis. Our theoretical and experimental framework demonstrates that the nonlocal strategy enables enhanced precision and accuracy in extracting information about sample characteristics more than the local measurements. Depending on the chosen estimators and noise channels present, theoretical and experimental results show that noise-induced bias decreases the precision for the estimated parameter. Such a quantum-enhanced nonlocal polarimetry holds promise for advancing diverse fields including material science, biomedical imaging, and remote sensing, via high-precision measurements through quantum entanglement.</description>

      <title>Lightwave-controlled relativistic plasma mirrors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06396v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on attosecond-scale control of high-harmonic and electron emission from plasma mirrors driven by relativistic-intensity near-single-cycle lightwaves at kHz repetition rate. By controlling the waveform of the intense light transient, we reproducibly form a sub-cycle temporal intensity gate at the plasma mirror surface, leading to the observation of extreme ultraviolet spectral continua, characteristic of isolated attosecond pulse generation. We also observe the correlated emission of a waveform-dependent relativistic electron beam, paving the way towards fully lightwave-controlled dynamics of relativistic plasma mirrors.</description>

      <title>Quantum beats of a macroscopic polariton condensate in real space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12429v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We experimentally observe harmonic oscillations in a bosonic condensate of exciton-polaritons confined within an elliptical trap. These oscillations arise from quantum beats between two size-quantized states of the condensate, split in energy due to the trap's ellipticity. By precisely targeting specific spots inside the trap with non-resonant laser pulses, we control the frequency, amplitude, and phase of these quantum beats. The condensate wavefunction dynamics are visualized on a streak camera and mapped to the Bloch sphere, demonstrating Hadamard and Pauli-Z operations. We conclude that a qubit based on a superposition of these two polariton states would exhibit a coherence time exceeding the lifetime of an individual exciton-polariton by at least two orders of magnitude.</description>
