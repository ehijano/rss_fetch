      <title>Interpreting seasonal and interannual Hadley cell descending edge migrations via the cell-mean Rossby number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The poleward extent of Earth's zonal-mean Hadley cells varies across seasons and years, which would be nice to capture in a simple theory. A plausible candidate, from Hill et al. (2022), combines the conventional two-layer, quasi-geostrophic, baroclinic instability-based framework with a less conventional assumption: that each cell's upper-branch zonal winds are suitably captured by a single, cell-wide Rossby number, with meridional variations in the local Rossby number neglected. We test this theory against ERA5 reanalysis data, finding that it captures both seasonal and interannual variations in the Hadley cell zonal winds and poleward extent rather well. For the seasonal cycle of the NH cell only, this requires empirically lagging the prediction by one month, for reasons unclear to us. In all cases, the bulk Rossby number value that yields the most accurate zonal wind fields is approximately equal to the actual cell-mean value. Variations in these cell-mean Rossby numbers, in turn, predominantly drive variations in each cell's poleward extent. All other terms matter much less -- including the subtropical static stability, which, by increasing under global warming, is generally considered the predominant driver of future Hadley cell expansion. It thus seems plausible that warming-driven changes in the cell-mean Rossby number, which have yet to be rigorously explored, could meaningfully influence the mean and spread in projections of future Hadley cell expansion.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Use of Machine Learning Weather Models in Data Assimilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of machine learning (ML) models in meteorology has attracted significant attention for their potential to improve weather forecasting efficiency and accuracy. GraphCast and NeuralGCM, two promising ML-based weather models, are at the forefront of this innovation. However, their suitability for data assimilation (DA) systems, particularly for four-dimensional variational (4DVar) DA, remains under-explored. This study evaluates the tangent linear (TL) and adjoint (AD) models of both GraphCast and NeuralGCM to assess their viability for integration into a DA framework.
  We compare the TL/AD results of GraphCast and NeuralGCM with those of the Model for Prediction Across Scales - Atmosphere (MPAS-A), a well-established numerical weather prediction (NWP) model. The comparison focuses on the physical consistency and reliability of TL/AD responses to perturbations. While the adjoint results of both GraphCast and NeuralGCM show some similarity to those of MPAS-A, they also exhibit unphysical noise at various vertical levels, raising concerns about their robustness for operational DA systems.
  The implications of this study extend beyond 4DVar applications. Unphysical behavior and noise in ML-derived TL/AD models could lead to inaccurate error covariances and unreliable ensemble forecasts, potentially degrading the overall performance of ensemble-based DA systems, as well. Addressing these challenges is critical to ensuring that ML models, such as GraphCast and NeuralGCM, can be effectively integrated into operational DA systems, paving the way for more accurate and efficient weather predictions.</description>

      <title>Kolmogorov Modes and Linear Response of Jump-Diffusion Models: Applications to Stochastic Excitation of the ENSO Recharge Oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a generalization of linear response theory for mixed jump-diffusion models, combining both Gaussian and L\'evy noise forcings that interact with the nonlinear dynamics. This class of models covers a broad range of stochastic chaos and complexity for which the jump-diffusion processes are a powerful tool to parameterize the missing physics or effects of the unresolved scales onto the resolved ones.
  By generalizing concepts such as Kolmogorov operators and Green's functions to this context, we derive fluctuation-dissipation relationships for such models. The system response can then be interpreted in terms of contributions from the eigenmodes of the Kolmogorov operator (Kolmogorov modes) decomposing the time-lagged correlation functions of the unperturbed dynamics. The underlying formulas offer a fresh look on the intimate relationships between the system's natural variability and its forced variability.
  We apply our theory to a paradigmatic El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) subject to state-dependent jumps and additive white noise parameterizing intermittent and nonlinear feedback mechanisms, key factors in the actual ENSO phenomenon. Such stochastic parameterizations are shown to produce stochastic chaos with an enriched time-variability. The Kolmogorov modes encoding the latter are then computed, and our Green's functions formulas are shown to achieve a remarkable accuracy to predict the system's response to perturbations.
  This work enriches Hasselmann's program by providing a more comprehensive approach to climate modeling and prediction, allowing for accounting the effects of both continuous and discontinuous stochastic forcing. Our results have implications for understanding climate sensitivity, detection and attributing climate change, and assessing the risk of climate tipping points.</description>

      <title>A Foundation Model for the Earth System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13063v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reliable forecasts of the Earth system are crucial for human progress and safety from natural disasters. Artificial intelligence offers substantial potential to improve prediction accuracy and computational efficiency in this field, however this remains underexplored in many domains. Here we introduce Aurora, a large-scale foundation model for the Earth system trained on over a million hours of diverse data. Aurora outperforms operational forecasts for air quality, ocean waves, tropical cyclone tracks, and high-resolution weather forecasting at orders of magnitude smaller computational expense than dedicated existing systems. With the ability to fine-tune Aurora to diverse application domains at only modest computational cost, Aurora represents significant progress in making actionable Earth system predictions accessible to anyone.</description>

      <title>A multi-frequency spaceborne radar perspective of deep convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Global numerical weather models are starting to resolve atmospheric moist convection which comes with a critical need for observational constraints. One avenue for such constraints is spaceborne radar which tend to operate at three wavelengths, Ku-, Ka- and W-band. Many studies of deep convection in the past have primarily leveraged Ku-band because it is less affected by attenuation and multiple scattering. However, future spaceborne radar missions might not contain a Ku-band radar and thus considering the view of convection from Ka-band or W-band compared to the Ku-band would be useful. This study examines a coincident dataset between the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Mission and CloudSat as well as the entire GPM record to compare convective characteristics across various wavelengths within deep convection. We find that W-band reflectivity (Z) tends to maximize near the Ku-band defined echo-top while Ka-band often maximizes 4-5 km below. The height of the maximum Z above the melting level for W-band does not linearly relate to the Ku-band maximum. However, using the full GPM record the Ka-band 30 dBZ echo-tops can be linearly related to the Ku-band 40 dBZ echo-top with an $R^2$ of 0.62 and a root mean squared error of about 1 km. The spatial distribution of echo-tops from Ka-band corresponds well to the Ku-band echo-tops, highlighting regions of relatively large ice water path. This paper suggests that Ka-band only missions, like NASA's Investigation for Convective Updrafts, should be able to characterize global convection in a similar manner to a Ku-band system.</description>

      <title>HF radar estimation of ocean wave parameters: second-order Doppler spectrum versus Bragg wave modulation approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an original technique for the HF radar estimation of the main sea state parameters by exploiting the amplitude modulation of the radar signal time series. While the classical method for ocean wave measurement is based on the second-order ocean Doppler spectrum, this alternative approach uses the slow amplitude modulation of the Bragg wave in the radar signal, which is more robust to noise than the second-order echo. We apply this method to an annual set of HF radar data in the vicinity of Toulon (Mediterranean coast of France) and compare it with the classical second-order method, using a nearby buoy and the WWIII model as ground truth. The Doppler spectrum-based method is found to be more accurate in calculating the significant wave height and the peak wave frequency while the modulation approach provides coarser estimates but can achieve longer ranges and higher temporal coverage.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Tornadic Supercell Thunderstorms on the Atmospheric Muon Flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19311v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tornadoes are severe weather phenomena characterized by a violently rotating column of air connecting the ground to a parent storm. Within the United States, hundreds of tornadoes occur every year. Despite this, the dynamics of tornado formation and propagation are not particularly well understood, in part due to the challenge of instrumentation: many existing instruments for measuring atmospheric properties are in-situ detectors, making deployment in or near an active or developing tornado difficult. Here, we combine local atmospheric and cosmic ray air shower simulation to explore the potential for remote measurement of the pressure field within tornado-producing supercell thunderstorms by examining directional variations of the atmospheric muon flux.</description>
