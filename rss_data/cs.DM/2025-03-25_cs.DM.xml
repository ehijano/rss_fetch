      <title>A unified convention for achievement positional games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce achievement positional games, a convention for positional games which encompasses the Maker-Maker and Maker-Breaker conventions. We consider two hypergraphs, one red and one blue, on the same vertex set. Two players, Left and Right, take turns picking a previously unpicked vertex. Whoever first fills an edge of their color, blue for Left or red for Right, wins the game (draws are possible). We establish general properties of such games. In particular, we show that a lot of principles which hold for Maker-Maker games generalize to achievement positional games. We also study the algorithmic complexity of deciding whether Left has a winning strategy as first player when all blue edges have size at mot $p$ and all red edges have size at most $q$. This problem is in P for $p,q \leq 2$, but it is NP-hard for $p \geq 3$ and $q=2$, coNP-complete for $p=2$ and $q \geq 3$, and PSPACE-complete for $p,q \geq 3$. A consequence of this last result is that, in the Maker-Maker convention, deciding whether the first player has a winning strategy on a hypergraph of rank 4 after one round of (non-optimal) play is PSPACE-complete.</description>

      <title>Linear, nested, and quadratic ordered measures: Computation and incorporation into optimization problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we address a unified mathematical optimization framework to compute a wide range of measures used in most operations research and data science contexts. The goal is to embed such metrics within general optimization models allowing their efficient computation. We assess the usefulness of this approach applying it to three different families of measures, namely linear, nested, and quadratic ordered measures. Computational results are reported showing the efficiency and accuracy of our methods as compared with standard implementations in numerical software packages. Finally, we illustrate this methodology by computing a number of optimal solutions with respect to different metrics on three well-known linear and combinatorial optimization problems: scenario analysis in linear programming, the traveling salesman and the weighted multicover set problem.</description>

      <title>Counterexample to Winkler's conjecture on Venn diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1984, Peter Winkler conjectured that every simple Venn diagram with $n$ curves can be extended to a simple Venn diagram with $n+1$ curves. We present a counterexample to his conjecture for $n=7$, which is obtained by combining theoretical ideas with computer assistance from state-of-the-art SAT solvers.</description>

      <title>Identifying and Characterising Higher Order Interactions in Mobility Networks Using Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding human mobility is essential for applications ranging from urban planning to public health. Traditional mobility models such as flow networks and colocation matrices capture only pairwise interactions between discrete locations, overlooking higher-order relationships among locations (i.e., mobility flow among two or more locations). To address this, we propose co-visitation hypergraphs, a model that leverages temporal observation windows to extract group interactions between locations from individual mobility trajectory data. Using frequent pattern mining, our approach constructs hypergraphs that capture dynamic mobility behaviors across different spatial and temporal scales. We validate our method on a publicly available mobility dataset and demonstrate its effectiveness in analyzing city-scale mobility patterns, detecting shifts during external disruptions such as extreme weather events, and examining how a location's connectivity (degree) relates to the number of points of interest (POIs) within it. Our results demonstrate that our hypergraph-based mobility analysis framework is a valuable tool with potential applications in diverse fields such as public health, disaster resilience, and urban planning.</description>

      <title>Path degeneracy and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we relate girth and path-degeneracy in classes with sub-exponential expansion, with explicit bounds for classes with polynomial expansion and proper minor-closed classes that are tight up to a constant factor (and tight up to second order terms if a classical conjecture on existence of $g$-cages is verified). As an application, we derive bounds on the generalized acyclic indices, on the generalized arboricities, and on the weak coloring numbers of high-girth graphs in such classes. Along the way, we prove a conjecture proposed in [T.~Bartnicki et al., Generalized arboricity of graphs with large girth, Discrete Mathematics 342 (2019), no.~5, 1343--1350.], which asserts that, for every integer $k$, there is an integer $g(p,k)$ such that every $K_k$ minor-free graph with girth at least $g(p,k)$ has $p$-arboricity at most $p+1$.</description>

      <title>Maker-Breaker is solved in polynomial time on hypergraphs of rank 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.12819v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the Maker-Breaker positional game, Maker and Breaker take turns picking vertices of a hypergraph $H$, and Maker wins if and only if she possesses all the vertices of some edge of $H$. Deciding the outcome (i.e. which player has a winning strategy) is PSPACE-complete even when restricted to 5-uniform hypergraphs (Koepke, 2025). On hypergraphs of rank 3, a structural characterization of the outcome and a polynomial-time algorithm have been obtained for two subcases: one by Kutz (2005), the other by Rahman and Watson (2020) who conjectured that their result should generalize to all hypergraphs of rank 3. We prove this conjecture through a structural characterization of the outcome and a description of both players' optimal strategies, all based on intersections of some key subhypergraph collections, from which we derive a polynomial-time algorithm. Another corollary of our structural result is that, if Maker has a winning strategy on a hypergraph of rank 3, then she can ensure to win the game in a number of rounds that is logarithmic in the number of vertices. Note: This paper provides a counterexample to a similar result which was incorrectly claimed (arXiv:2209.11202, Theorem 22).</description>

      <title>M-convexity of the minimum-cost packings of arborescences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08381</link>
      <description>arXiv:1805.08381v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to reveal the discrete convexity of the minimum-cost packings of arborescences and branchings. We first prove that the minimum-cost packings of disjoint $k$ branchings (minimum-cost $k$-branchings) induce an $\mathrm{M}^\natural$-convex function defined on the integer vectors on the vertex set. The proof is based on a theorem on packing disjoint $k$-branchings, which extends Edmonds' disjoint branchings theorem and is of independent interest. We then show the $\mathrm{M}$-convexity of the minimum-cost $k$-arborescences, which provides a short proof for a theorem of Bern\'ath and Kir\'aly (SODA 2016) stating that the root vectors of the minimum-cost $k$-arborescences form a base polyhedron of a submodular function. Finally, building upon the $\mathrm{M}^\natural$-convexity of $k$-branchings, we present a new problem of minimum-cost root location of a $k$-branching, and show that it can be solved in polynomial time if the opening cost function is $\mathrm{M}^\natural$-convex.</description>

      <title>Efficient Computation in Congested Anonymous Dynamic Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.07849v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An anonymous dynamic network is a network of indistinguishable processes whose communication links may appear or disappear unpredictably over time. Previous research has shown that deterministically computing an arbitrary function of a multiset of input values given to these processes takes only a linear number of communication rounds (Di Luna-Viglietta, FOCS 2022).
  However, fast algorithms for anonymous dynamic networks rely on the construction and transmission of large data structures called "history trees", whose size is polynomial in the number of processes. This approach is unfeasible if the network is congested, and only messages of logarithmic size can be sent through its links. Observe that sending a large message piece by piece over several rounds is not in itself a solution, due to the anonymity of the processes combined with the dynamic nature of the network. Moreover, it is known that certain basic tasks such as all-to-all token dissemination (by means of single-token forwarding) require $\Omega(n^2/\log n)$ rounds in congested networks (Dutta et al., SODA 2013).
  In this work, we develop a series of practical and efficient techniques that make it possible to use history trees in congested anonymous dynamic networks. Among other applications, we show how to compute arbitrary functions in such networks in $O(n^3)$ communication rounds, greatly improving upon previous state-of-the-art algorithms for congested networks.</description>

      <title>Enumerating all geodesics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16955v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By "geodesic" we mean any sequence of vertices $(v_1,v_2,...,v_k)$ of a graph $G$ that constitute a shortest path from $v_1$ to $v_k$. We propose a novel, very natural (yet output-polynomial) algorithm to enumerate all geodesics of $G$. The graph can be directed or not, and weighted or not.</description>
