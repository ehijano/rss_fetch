      <title>Serendipitous decametre detection of ultra steep spectrum radio emission in Abell 655</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some galaxy clusters contain non-thermal synchrotron emitting plasma permeating the intracluster medium (ICM). The spectral properties of this radio emission are not well characterized at decameter wavelengths ({\nu} &lt; 30 MHz), primarily due to the severe corrupting effects of the ionosphere. Using a recently developed calibration strategy, we present LOFAR images below 30 MHz of the low mass galaxy cluster Abell 655, which was serendipitously detected in an observation of the bright calibrator 3C 196. We combine this observation with LOFAR data at 144 MHz, and new Band 4 Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope observations centered at 650 MHz. In the 15-30 MHz LOFAR image, diffuse emission is seen with a physical extent of about 700 kpc. We argue that the diffuse emission detected in this galaxy cluster likely has multiple origins. At higher frequencies (650 MHz), the diffuse emission resembles a radio halo, while at lower frequencies the emission seems to consist of several components and bar-like structures. It suggests that most low-frequency emission in this cluster comes from re-energized fossil plasma from old AGN outbursts, coexisting with the radio halo component. By counting the number of cluster radio detections in the decameter band, we estimate that around a quarter of the Planck clusters host re-energised fossil plasma that is detectable in the decameter band with LOFAR.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Wavelength Technique for Estimating Galaxy Cluster Mass Accretion Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mass accretion rate of galaxy clusters is a key factor in determining their structure, but a reliable observational tracer has yet to be established. We present a state-of-the-art machine learning model for constraining the mass accretion rate of galaxy clusters from only X-ray and thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich observations. Using idealized mock observations of galaxy clusters from the MillenniumTNG simulation, we train a machine learning model to estimate the mass accretion rate. The model constrains 68% of the mass accretion rates of the clusters in our dataset to within 33% of the true value without significant bias, a ~58% reduction in the scatter over existing constraints. We demonstrate that the model uses information from both radial surface brightness density profiles and asymmetries.</description>

      <title>Emulating the Lyman-Alpha forest 1D power spectrum from cosmological simulations: New models and constraints from the eBOSS measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Lyssa suite of high-resolution cosmological simulations of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest designed for cosmological analyses. These 18 simulations have been run using the Nyx code with $4096^3$ hydrodynamical cells in a 120 Mpc comoving box and individually provide sub-percent level convergence of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest 1d flux power spectrum. We build a Gaussian process emulator for the Lyssa simulations in the lym1d likelihood framework to interpolate the power spectrum at arbitrary parameter values. We validate this emulator based on leave-one-out tests and based on the parameter constraints for simulations outside of the training set. We also perform comparisons with a previous emulator, showing a percent level accuracy and a good recovery of the expected cosmological parameters. Using this emulator we derive constraints on the linear matter power spectrum amplitude and slope parameters $A_{\mathrm{Ly}\alpha}$ and $n_{\mathrm{Ly}\alpha}$. While the best-fit Planck $\Lambda$CDM model has $A_{\mathrm{Ly}\alpha}=8.79$ and $n_{\mathrm{Ly}\alpha}=-2.363$, from DR14 eBOSS data we find that $A_{\mathrm{Ly}\alpha}&lt;7.6$ (95\% CI) and $n_{\mathrm{Ly}\alpha}=-2.369 \pm 0.008$. The low value of $A_{\mathrm{Ly}\alpha}$, in tension with Planck, is driven by the correlation of this parameter with the mean transmission of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. This tension disappears when imposing a well-motivated external prior on this mean transmission, in which case we find $A_{\mathrm{Ly}\alpha}=9.8\pm1.1$ in accordance with Planck.</description>

      <title>The Status of Neutrino Cosmology: Standard $\Lambda$CDM, Extensions, and Tensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the performance of the six-parameter $\Lambda$CDM model and its extensions in light of recent cosmological observations, with particular focus on neutrino properties inferred from cosmology. Using a broad suite of nine combinations of datasets, with three separate analyses of the Planck Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data, and three separate supernovae (SNe) survey data, plus the recent DESI baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) scale results, we derive constraints on the sum of neutrino masses ($\Sigma m_\nu$). Our results show upper limits in the range of $\Sigma m_\nu &lt; 76.9\,\mathrm{meV}$ to $\Sigma m_\nu &lt; 108\,\mathrm{meV}$ (95\% CL). The variation in the limits on $\Sigma m_\nu$ arises from the separate analyses of the Planck CMB data and the separate supernovae datasets, as they relate to the inferred matter density and its relation to the sensitivity of the BAO scale and CMB lensing to $\Sigma m_\nu$. In the context of hierarchical mass models in $\Lambda$CDM, we find a $1.47\sigma$ preference for normal ordering (NO) over inverted ordering (IO), with similar values of preference across all datasets. Despite the strong constraints, an inclination towards massless neutrinos over NO remains weak at $1.36\sigma$. We find that a ``negative'' neutrino mass, inferred from the shape of the likelihood in the physical regime, $\Sigma m_\nu &gt; 0$, is only present at less than $2\sigma$. We confirm that models allowing extra relativistic degrees of freedom, with $N_{\rm eff} \approx 3.5$, alleviate the Hubble tension. Significantly, we find a $3.3\sigma$ preference for a 0.1 eV partially thermalized sterile neutrino when the SH0ES $H_0$ measurement is included, a scale of interest in short-baseline oscillation experiment results.

      <title>SZ-X-ray Surface Brightness Fluctuations in the SPT-XMM clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hot plasma in galaxy clusters, the intracluster medium (ICM), is expected to be shaped by subsonic turbulent motions, which are key for heating, cooling, and transport mechanisms. The turbulent motions contribute to the non-thermal pressure which, if not accounted for, consequently imparts a hydrostatic mass bias. Accessing information about turbulent motions is thus of major astrophysical and cosmological interest. Characteristics of turbulent motions can be indirectly accessed through surface brightness fluctuations. This study expands on our pilot investigations of surface brightness fluctuations in the SZ and X-ray by examining, for the first time, a large sample of 60 clusters using both SPT-SZ and XMM-Newton data and span the redshift range $0.2 &lt; z &lt; 1.5$, thus constraining the respective pressure and density fluctuations within 0.6~$R_{500}$. We deem density fluctuations to be of sufficient quality for 32 clusters, finding mild correlations between the peak of the amplitude spectra of density fluctuations and various dynamical parameters. We infer turbulent velocities from density fluctuations with an average Mach number $\mathcal{M}_{\text{3D}} = 0.52 \pm 0.14$, in agreement with numerical simulations. For clusters with inferred turbulent Mach numbers from both pressure, $\mathcal{M}_{\text{P}}$ and density fluctuations, $\mathcal{M}_{\rho}$, we find broad agreement between $\mathcal{M}_{\text{P}}$ and $\mathcal{M}_{\rho}$. Our results suggest a bimodal Mach number distribution, with the majority of clusters being turbulence-dominated (subsonic) while the remainder are shock-dominated (supersonic).</description>

      <title>Probing massive neutrinos and modified gravity with redshift-space morphologies and anisotropies of large-scale structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong degeneracy exists between some modified gravity (MG) models and massive neutrinos because the enhanced structure growth produced by modified gravity can be suppressed due to the free-streaming massive neutrinos. Previous works showed this degeneracy can be broken with non-Gaussian or velocity information. Therefore in this work, we focus on the large-scale structure (LSS) in redshift space and investigate for the first time the possibility of using the non-Gaussian information and velocity information captured by the 3D scalar Minkowski functionals (MFs) and the 3D Minkowski tensors (MTs) to break this degeneracy. Based on the Quijote and Quijote-MG simulations, we find the imprints on redshift space LSS left by the Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ gravity can be discriminated from those left by massive neutrinos with these statistics. With the Fisher information formalism, we first show how the MTs extract information with their perpendicular and parallel elements for both low- and high-density regions; then we compare constraints from the power spectrum monopole and MFs in real space with those in redshift space, and investigate how the constraining power is further improved with anisotropies captured by the quadrupole and hexadecapole of the power spectrum and the MTs; finally, we combine the power spectrum multipoles with MFs plus MTs and find the constraints from the power spectrum multipoles on $\Omega_{\mathrm{m}}, h, \sigma_8$, $M_\nu$, and $f_{R_0}$ can be improved, because they are complemented with non-Gaussian information, by a factor of 3.4, 3.0, 3.3, 3.3, and 1.9 on small scales ($k_{\rm{max}}=0.5~h\rm{Mpc}^{-1},\ R_G=5~h^{-1}\rm{Mpc}$), and 2.8, 2.2, 3.4, 3.4, and 1.5 on large scales ($k_{\rm{max}}=0.25~h\rm{Mpc}^{-1},\ R_G=10~h^{-1}\rm{Mpc}$).</description>

      <title>Hubble Expansion and Entropy Rates in a Cosmological Model with Merging Clusters and Voids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the validity of the generalized second law of thermodynamics and the maximum entropy condition within a novel cosmological model featuring two main components: merging clusters and merging voids. We derive a generalized form of the Hubble parameter for this model, demonstrating that it converges to the standard Hubble parameter in the non-merger case (\(\xi = 0\)). The merging model's equation of state parameters resembles those of evolving dark matter and dark energy, with \(w_c(z) \simeq w_{\rm dm} \simeq 0\) and \(w_v(z) \simeq w_{\rm de} \simeq -1\) at $z\rightarrow 0$, aligning with recent observations. To further assess our model, we analyze and compare the entropy and its first and second derivatives across five models: (I) a general model including merging clusters and voids (MCVM), may reflect the behavior of the current web-like universe; (II) a model with only cluster mergers (MCDM); (III) a model with only void mergers (MVDM); (IV) the $w$CDM model; and (V) the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Our plots indicate that the models incorporating only cluster mergers exhibit greater discrepancies with both observational Hubble parameters and the standard model at $z &gt; 1$. A key finding is that in models featuring only cluster mergers, Hubble and entropy rates consistently decrease. However, models that include both void and cluster mergers show an increase in these rates, indicating that void mergers contribute to cosmic expansion and entropy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the $\Lambda$CDM model with both additive and non-additive entropy violates the convexity condition, whereas the merger voids model aligns with maximizing entropy and at the same time may help avert a \textit{Big Rip} scenario for our universe.</description>

      <title>Constraining the phase shift of relativistic species in DESI BAOs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the early Universe, neutrinos decouple quickly from the primordial plasma and propagate without further interactions. The impact of free-streaming neutrinos is to create a temporal shift in the gravitational potential that impacts the acoustic waves known as baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs), resulting in a non-linear spatial shift in the Fourier-space BAO signal. In this work, we make use of and extend upon an existing methodology to measure the phase shift amplitude $\beta_{\phi}$ and apply it to the DESI Data Release 1 (DR1) BAOs with an anisotropic BAO fitting pipeline. We validate the fitting methodology by testing the pipeline with two publicly available fitting codes applied to highly precise cubic box simulations and realistic simulations representative of the DESI DR1 data. We find further study towards the methods used in fitting the BAO signal will be necessary to ensure accurate constraints on $\beta_{\phi}$ in future DESI data releases. Using DESI DR1, we present individual measurements of the anisotropic BAO distortion parameters and the $\beta_{\phi}$ for the different tracers, and additionally a combined fit to $\beta_{\phi}$ resulting in $\beta_{\phi} = 2.7 \pm 1.7$. After including a prior on the distortion parameters from constraints using \textit{Planck} we find $\beta_{\phi} = 2.7^{+0.60}_{-0.67} $ suggesting $\beta_{\phi} &gt; 0$ at 4.3$\sigma$ significance. This result may hint at a phase shift that is not purely sourced from the standard model expectation for $N_{\rm{eff}}$ or could be a upwards statistical fluctuation in the measured $\beta_{\phi}$; this result relaxes in models with additional freedom beyond $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <title>Constraints of Cosmic Expansion Using an MSF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a modified scale factor (MSF) that allows us to explore the accelerating expansion of the universe without invoking the traditional dark-energy model, as described in the Lambda cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model. Instead, the MSF model introduces parameters that encapsulate the effects traditionally attributed to dark energy. To test the viability of this MSF, we constrained the model using the observational Hubble parameter (OHD), distance modulus measurements (SNIa), and their combined datasets (OHD + SNIa). We implement a Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) simulation to find the best-fit values of the model parameters. The MSF model produced best-fit values for the parameter $p$ associated with the power law of the matter-dominated era and $\beta$, the exponential parameter for the darkenergy-dominated era. For our MSF, these values are $p$ = 0.28 and $\beta$ = 0.52 when using SNIa data, $p$ = 0.63 and $\beta$ = 0.30 for OHD data and $p$ = 0.45 and $\beta$ = 0.53 for a combination of datasets (OHD + SNIa). The numerical results and plots of the deceleration parameter, fractional energy density, Hubble parameter, and luminosity distance are presented which are the key parameters for studying the accelerated expansion of the universe. We compare the results of our model with that of the $\Lambda$CDM model and reconcile them with astronomical observational data. Our results indicate that the MSF model shows promise, demonstrating good compatibility with current astronomical observations and performing comparably to the $\Lambda$CDM model across various datasets, particularly in predicting the accelerating expansion of the universe, while providing a unified framework that incorporates the simultaneous influence of matter and dark energy components.</description>

      <title>Primordial non-Gaussianity -- the effects of relativistic and wide-angle corrections to the power spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wide-angle and relativistic corrections to the Newtonian and flat-sky approximations are important for accurate modelling of the galaxy power spectrum of next-generation galaxy surveys. In addition to Doppler and Sachs-Wolfe relativistic corrections, we include the effects of lensing convergence, time delay and integrated Sachs-Wolfe. We investigate the impact of these corrections on measurements of the local primordial non-Gaussianity parameter $f_{\rm NL}$, using two futuristic spectroscopic galaxy surveys, planned for SKAO2 and MegaMapper. In addition to the monopole, we include the quadrupole of the galaxy Fourier power spectrum. The quadrupole is much more sensitive to the corrections than the monopole. The combination with the quadrupole improves the precision on $f_{\rm NL}$ by $\sim {40}\%$ and $\sim {60}\%$ for SKAO2 and MegaMapper respectively. Neglecting the wide-angle and relativistic corrections produces a shift in $f_{\rm NL}$ of $\sim {0.1}\sigma$ and $\sim {0.2}\sigma$ for SKAO2 and MegaMapper. The shift in $f_{\rm NL}$ is very sensitive to the magnification bias and the redshift evolution of the comoving number density. For these surveys, the contributions to the shift from integrated and non-integrated effects partly cancel. We point out that some of the approximations made in the corrections may artificially suppress the shift in $f_{\rm NL}$.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen intensity mapping with MeerKAT: Preserving cosmological signal by optimising contaminant separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Removing contaminants is a delicate yet crucial step in neutral hydrogen (HI) intensity mapping, often considered the technique's greatest challenge. Here, we address this challenge by analysing HI intensity maps of about $100$ deg$^2$ at redshift $z\approx0.4$ collected by the MeerKAT radio telescope, a SKA Observatory (SKAO) precursor, with a combined 10.5-hour observation. Using unsupervised statistical methods, we remove the contaminating foreground emission and systematically test step-by-step common pre-processing choices to facilitate the cleaning process. We also introduce and test a novel multiscale approach, where data is redundantly decomposed into subsets referring to different spatial scales (large and small), and the cleaning procedure is performed independently. We confirm the detection of the HI cosmological signal in cross-correlation with an ancillary galactic data set without the need to correct for signal loss. In the best set-up reached, we constrain the HI distribution through the combination of its cosmic abundance ($\Omega_{\rm HI}$) and linear clustering bias ($b_{\rm HI}$) up to a cross-correlation coefficient ($r$) and measure $\Omega_{\rm HI}b_{\rm HI}r = [0.93 \pm 0.17]\,\times\,10^{-3}$ with $\approx6\sigma$ confidence. The measurement is independent of scale cuts at both edges of the probed scale range ($0.04 \lesssim k \lesssim 0.3 \,h$Mpc$^{-1}$), corroborating its robustness. Our new pipeline has successfully found an optimal compromise in separating contaminants without incurring a catastrophic signal loss, instilling more confidence in the outstanding science we can deliver with MeerKAT on the path towards HI intensity mapping surveys with the full SKAO.</description>

      <title>Can decaying vacuum solve the H_0 Tension?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06756v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work we analyze two different models of interaction between dark energy and dark matter, also known as vacuum decay models or $\Lambda(t)$CDM models. In both models, when the $H_0$ parameter is constrained by the Planck distance priors, its value is compatible with a higher value of $H_0$, in agreement with SH0ES data, while simultaneously reducing the values of $\Omega_m$ and $\Omega_b$. In both models, we find $H_0=73.1\pm0.86$ at 68\% c.l. by combining Planck+SH0ES data. We also find the decay parameter to be $\varepsilon=0.0197^{+0.0032}_{-0.0027}$ for one model and $\varepsilon=0.0203\pm0.0034$ for the other one. From these analyses, a noninteracting model is excluded at least at $6\sigma$ c.l.! This shows that these types of models are promising in solving or at least alleviating the $H_0$ tension problem. Our analysis also shows a preference for the decay of vacuum into dark matter, in agreement to thermodynamic analyses.</description>

      <title>How Well Do We Know the Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves sourced by amplified scalar perturbations are a common prediction across a wide range of cosmological models. These scalar curvature fluctuations are inherently nonlinear and typically non-Gaussian. We argue that the effects of non-Gaussianity may not always be adequately captured by an expansion around a Gaussian field, expressed through nonlinear parameters such as $f_{\rm{NL}}$. As a consequence, the resulting amplitude of the stochastic gravitational wave background may differ significantly from predictions based on the standard quadratic source model routinely used in the literature.</description>

      <title>Faint Radio Signals from Very High-Frequency Gravitational Waves in the Strong Astrophysical Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) may convert into photons in a magnetic field (MF) through the Gertsenshtein-Zeldovich (GZ) effect. The properties of the MF significantly influence this conversion probability. Although interstellar and interplanetary magnetic fields are vast, their low intensities result in limited conversion probabilities. Here, we confirm that strong MFs in neutron stars significantly increase this conversion probability. We use single-dish telescopes FAST, TMRT, QTT, and GBT, as well as the radio interferometers SKA1-MID and SKA2-MID, to estimate the detection potential of very high-frequency (VHF) GWs. We infer two types of signals in the $10^{6}-10^{11}\mathrm{~Hz}$ radio waveband: transient and persistent signals. We propose three criteria for distinguishing signals from other astrophysical signals while identifying different GW sources. We derive the expected intrinsic spectral line shapes for gravitons by considering their mass and spin in quantum field theory (QFT). These are smooth, continuous lines that don't have any absorption or emission features. FAST has the highest sensitivity in single-dish telescopes for detecting VHF GWs, it provides a bound on the characteristic strain at $h_c&lt;10^{-23}$ near $h_c=10^{-24}$ within $\left[1\mathrm{~GHz}, 3\mathrm{~GHz}\right]$ with 6 hours of observation time. This exceeds the threshold for detecting VHF GWs produced by primordial black holes (PBHs) with over $5\sigma$ confidence and approaches the Big Bang nucleosynthesis bound. Moreover, SKA2-MID has greater detection potential. Detection of such GWs would enhance our understanding of cosmological models, refine the PBH parameter spaces, and serve as a test for QFT.</description>

      <title>The Compton-thick AGN luminosity function in the local Universe: A robust estimate combining BAT detections and NuSTAR spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Compton-thick Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) arguably constitute the most elusive class of sources as they are absorbed by large column densities above logN_H(cm^-2)=24. These extreme absorptions hamper the detection of the central source even in hard X-ray energies. In this work, we use both SWIFT and NuSTAR observations in order to derive the most accurate yet Compton-thick AGN luminosity function. We, first, compile a sample of candidate Compton-thick AGN (logN_H(cm^-2)= 24-25) detected in the Swift BAT all-sky survey in the 14-195 keV band. We confirm that they are Compton-thick sources by using the follow-up NuSTAR observations already presented in the literature. Our sample is composed of 44 sources, consistent with a column density of logN_H(cm^-2)=24-25 at the 90% confidence level. These have intrinsic luminosities higher than L(10-50 keV) ~ 3x10^41 erg/s and are found up to a redshift of z=0.05 (200 Mpc). We derive the luminosity function of Compton-thick AGN using a Bayesian methodology where both the full column density and the luminosity distributions are taken into account. The faint end of the luminosity function is flat, having a slope of 0.01(+0.51,-0.74), rather arguing against a numerous population of low luminosity Compton-thick AGN. Based on our luminosity function, we estimate that the fraction of Compton-thick AGN relative to the total number of AGN is of the order of 24 (+5,-5) % in agreement with previous estimates in the local Universe based on BAT samples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Barrow holographic dark energy model is an extension of holographic dark energy that incorporates modifications to entropy due to quantum gravitational effects. In this work we study the cosmological properties of interacting Barrow holographic dark energy model in the case of non-zero curvature universe. We construct the differential equations governing the evolution of the Barrow holographic dark energy density parameter and the dark matter density parameter in coupled form for both closed and open spatial geometry. Considering three different forms of coupling, we obtain the corresponding analytical expressions for the equation of state parameter for the dark energy component. We confront the scenario using recent observational datasets like cosmic chronometer and Pantheon data. It has been found that the strength of interaction as well as the curvature contribution come out to be nonzero which indicates that a non-flat interacting scenario is preferred by observational data.</description>

      <title>Why Machine Learning Models Systematically Underestimate Extreme Values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A persistent challenge in astronomical machine learning is a systematic bias where predictions compress the dynamic range of true values -- high values are consistently predicted too low while low values are predicted too high. Understanding this bias has important consequences for astronomical measurements and our understanding of physical processes in astronomical inference. Through analytical examination of linear regression, we show that this bias arises naturally from measurement uncertainties in input features and persists regardless of training sample size, label accuracy, or parameter distribution. In the univariate case, we demonstrate that attenuation becomes important when the ratio of intrinsic signal range to measurement uncertainty ($\sigma_{\text{range}}/\sigma_x$) is below O(10) -- a regime common in astronomy. We further extend the theoretical framework to multivariate linear regression and demonstrate its implications using stellar spectroscopy as a case study. Even under optimal conditions -- high-resolution APOGEE-like spectra (R=24,000) with high signal-to-noise ratios (SNR=100) and multiple correlated features -- we find percent-level bias. The effect becomes even more severe for modern-day low-resolution surveys like LAMOST and DESI due to the lower SNR and resolution. These findings have broad implications, providing a theoretical framework for understanding and addressing this limitation in astronomical data analysis with machine learning.</description>

      <title>Why do some Ultra Diffuse Galaxies have Rich Globular Cluster Systems?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Some ultra diffuse galaxies (UDGs) reveal many more globular clusters (GCs) than classical dwarf galaxies of the same stellar mass. These UDGs, with a mass in their GC system (M$_{GC}$) approaching 10\% of their host galaxy stellar mass (M$_{\ast}$), are also inferred to have high halo mass to stellar mass ratios (M$_{halo}$/M$_{\ast}$). They have been dubbed Failed Galaxies. It is unknown what role high GC formation efficiencies and/or low destruction rates play in determining the high M$_{GC}$/M$_{\ast}$ ratios of some UDGs. Here we present a simple model, which is informed by recent JWST observations of lensed galaxies and by a simulation in the literature of GC mass loss and tidal disruption in dwarf galaxies. With this simple model, we aim to constrain the effects of GC efficiency/destruction on the observed GC richness of UDGs and their variation with the integrated stellar populations of UDGs. We assume no ongoing star formation (i.e. quenching at early times) and that the disrupted GCs contribute their stars to those of the host galaxy. We find that UDGs, with high M$_{GC}$/M$_{\ast}$ ratios today, are most likely the result of very high GC formation efficiencies combined with modest rates of GC destruction. The current data loosely follow the model that ranges from the mean stellar population of classical dwarfs to that of metal-poor GCs as M$_{GC}$/M$_{\ast}$ increases. As more data becomes available for UDGs, our simple model can be refined and tested further.</description>

      <title>Aspects of supersymmetry breaking driven inflation in orbifold models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider gravitationally induced corrections to inflaton potentials driven by supersymmetry breaking in a five-dimensional supergravity, compactified on a $ S_1/Z_2 $ orbifold. The supersymmetry breaking takes place on the hidden brane and is transmitted to the visible brane through finite one loop graphs giving rise to an inflaton potential which includes gravitationally induced terms. These corrections are significant for inflationary cosmology and have the potential to modify the predictions of widely studied supergravity models if the latter are embedded in this framework. To explore these effects we examine two classes of models those inspired by no-scale supergravity models and $\alpha$-attractors. Both models are compatible with current cosmological observations but face chalenges in reconciling enhanced values for the scalar power spectrum $ P_\zeta$ with cosmological data, particularly regarding the tensor to scalar ratio $r$. In fact $ P_\zeta \gtrsim 10^{-2}$ results to $ r &gt; \mathcal{O} (0.1) $, outside the limits put by current data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The impact of a fast decaying component of mass-energy, that decreases faster than radiation with the increase of the scale factor, on the evolution of the universe is studied using a hydrodynamic approach. Proceeding from the Hamiltonian formalism, the hydrodynamic-like equations for the velocity and acceleration of the expansion of the universe as a function of conformal time are obtained. The influence of a fast decaying component on the dynamics of the expansion of the universe is determined by the sign of its contribution to the total energy density of the system. The effects of this component are illustrated by figures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06501v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cosmological history and evolution are examined for gravitational models with interaction in the dark sector of the universe. In particular, we consider the dark energy to be described by a phantom scalar field and the dark matter $\rho _{m}$ as a pressureless ideal gas. We introduce the interacting function $Q=\beta \left( t\right) \rho_{m}$, where the function $% \beta \left( t\right) $ is considered to be proportional to $\dot{\phi}, \dot{\phi}^{2}H^{-1},~H$, or a constant parameter with dimensions of $\left[H_{0}\right] $. For the four interacting models, we study in details the phase space by calculating the stationary points. The latter are applied to reconstruct the cosmological evolution. Compactified variables are essential to understand the complete picture of the phase space and to conclude about the cosmological viability of these interacting models. The detailed analysis is performed for the exponential potential $V\left( \phi \right) =V_{0}e^{\lambda \phi }$. The effects of other scalar field potential functions on the cosmological dynamics are examined.</description>

Abstract: Dark matter, one of the fundamental components of the universe, has remained mysterious in modern cosmology and particle physics, and hence, this field is of utmost importance at present moment. One of the foundational questions is the origin of dark matter which directly links with its creation. In the present article we study the gravitational production of dark matter in two distinct contexts: firstly, when reheating occurs through the gravitational particle production, and secondly, when it is driven by the inflaton's decay. We establish a connection between the reheating temperature and the mass of dark matter, and from the reheating bounds, we determine the range of viable dark matter mass values.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A compelling way to address the inflationary period is via the warm inflation scenario, where the interaction of the inflaton field with other degrees of freedom affects its dynamics in such a way that slow-roll inflation is maintained by dissipative effects in a thermal bath. In this context, if a dark matter particle is coupled to the bath due to non-renormalizable interactions, the observed dark matter abundance may be produced during warm inflation via ultra-violet freeze-in. In this work, we propose applying this scenario in the framework of a $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge extension of the Standard Model of Particle Physics, where we also employ the seesaw mechanism for generating neutrino masses.</description>

      <title>PROSPECT: A profile likelihood code for frequentist cosmological parameter inference</title>

Abstract: Cosmological parameter inference has been dominated by the Bayesian approach for the past two decades, primarily due to its computational efficiency. However, the Bayesian approach involves integration of the posterior probability and therefore depends on both the choice of model parametrisation and the choice of prior on the model parameter space. In some cases, this can lead to conclusions which are driven by choice of parametrisation and priors rather than by data. The profile likelihood method provides a complementary frequentist tool which can be used to investigate this effect.
  In this paper, we present the code PROSPECT for computing profile likelihoods in cosmology. We showcase the code using a phenomenological model for converting dark matter into dark radiation that suffers from large volume effects and prior dependence. PROSPECT is compatible with both cobaya and MontePython, and is publicly available at https://github.com/AarhusCosmology/prospect_public.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Constraints from Combining Photometric Galaxy Surveys and Gravitational Wave Observatories</title>

Abstract: Spatial variations in survey properties due to selection effects generate substantial systematic errors in large-scale structure measurements in optical galaxy surveys on very large scales. On such scales, the statistical sensitivity of optical surveys is also limited by their finite sky coverage. By contrast, gravitational wave (GW) sources appear to be relatively free of these issues, provided the angular sensitivity of GW experiments can be accurately characterized. We quantify the expected cosmological information gain from combining the forecast LSST 3$\times$2pt analysis (combination of three 2-point correlations of galaxy density and weak lensing shear fields) with the large-scale auto-correlation of GW sources from proposed next-generation GW experiments. We find that in $\Lambda$CDM and $w$CDM models, there is no significant improvement in cosmological constraints from combining GW with LSST 3$\times$2pt over LSST alone, due to the large shot noise for the former; however, this combination does enable a $\sim6\%$ constraint on the linear galaxy bias of GW sources. More interestingly, the optical-GW data combination provides tight constraints on models with primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG), due to the predicted scale-dependent bias in PNG models on large scales. Assuming that the largest angular scales that LSST will probe are comparable to those in Stage III surveys ($\ell_{\rm min}\sim50$), the inclusion of next-generation GW measurements could improve constraints on the PNG parameter $f_{\rm NL}$ by up to a factor of $\simeq6.6$ compared to LSST alone, yielding $\sigma(f_{\rm NL})=8.5$. These results assume the expected capability of a network of Einstein Telescope-like GW observatories, with a detection rate of $10^6$ events/year. We investigate the sensitivity of our results to different assumptions about future GW detectors as well as different LSST analysis choices.</description>

      <title>Exploiting the diversity of modeling methods to probe systematic biases in strong lensing analyses</title>

Abstract: Challenges inherent to high-resolution and high signal-to-noise data as well as model degeneracies can cause systematic biases in analyses of strong lens systems. In the past decade, the number of lens modeling methods has significantly increased, from purely analytical methods, to pixelated and non-parametric ones, or ones based on deep learning. We embraced this diversity by selecting different software packages and use them to blindly model independently simulated Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging data. To overcome the difficulties arising from using different codes and conventions, we used the COde-independent Organized LEns STandard (COOLEST) to store, compare, and release all models in a self-consistent and human-readable manner. From an ensemble of six modeling methods, we studied the recovery of the lens potential parameters and properties of the reconstructed source. We find that, overall, both lens and source properties are recovered reasonably well, but systematic biases arise in all methods. Interestingly, we do not observe that a single method is significantly more accurate than others, and the amount of bias largely depends on the specific lens or source property of interest. By combining posterior distributions from individual methods using equal weights, the maximal systematic biases on lens model parameters inferred from individual models are reduced by a factor of 5.4 on average. We investigated a selection of modeling effects that partly explain the observed biases, such as the cuspy nature of the background source and the accuracy of the point spread function. This work introduces, for the first time, a generic framework to compare and ease the combination of models obtained from different codes and methods, which will be key to retain accuracy in future strong lensing analyses.</description>

      <title>Consistency tests between SDSS and DESI BAO measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04432v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate whether the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from redshift surveys, like the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), are consistent with each other. We do so by obtaining the Hubble and deceleration parameter, respectively $H(z)$ and $q(z)$, from both datasets using a non-parametric reconstruction, so that our results do not depend on any $\textit{a priori}$ assumptions about the underlying cosmological model. We find that the reconstructed $H(z)$ and $q(z)$ from SDSS are significantly inconsistent with those obtained from DESI, and that both are only marginally consistent with the $\Lambda$CDM model ($\sim 3\sigma$ confidence level). Interestingly, the combined SDSS and DESI dataset reconciles with the standard model. These results are mostly unchanged with respect to different assumptions on the sound horizon scale value, as well as different reconstruction kernels. We also verify the results for the null diagnostic $\mathcal{O}_{\rm m}(z)$, finding that they suggest different trends for dark energy models using DESI and SDSS BAO measurements, and once again the combined dataset strongly agrees with $\Lambda$CDM. Therefore, our results call the attention for further examination of such inconsistency, as they can lead to biased and divergent results regarding the validity of the standard model, or the suggestion of new physics.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the spectral properties of the atypical radio relic in A115 using uGMRT, VLA, and LOFAR</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07574v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mega-parsec scale radio relics at the galaxy cluster periphery are intriguing structures. While textbook examples of relics posit arc-like elongated structures at the clusters' peripheries, several relics display more complex structures deviating from the conventional type. Abell 115 is a galaxy cluster, hosting an atypical radio relic at its northern periphery. Despite the multi-wavelength study of the cluster over the last decades, the origin of the radio relic is still unclear. In this paper, we present a multi-frequency radio study of the cluster to infer the possible mechanism behind the formation of the radio relic. We used new 400 MHz observations with the uGMRT, along with archival VLA 1.5 GHz observations and archival LOFAR 144 MHz observations. Our analysis supports the previous theory on the relic's origin from the passage of a shock front due to an off-axis merger, where the old population of particles from the radio galaxies at the relic location has been re-energised to illuminate the 2 Mpc radio relic.</description>

      <title>Modelling the covariance matrix for the power spectra before and after the BAO reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18524v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) reconstruction plays a crucial role in cosmological analysis for spectroscopic galaxy surveys because it can make the density field effectively more linear and more Gaussian. The combination of the power spectra before and after the BAO reconstruction helps break degeneracies among parameters, then improve the constraints on cosmological parameters. It is therefore important to estimate the covariance matrix between pre- and post-reconstructed power spectra. In this work, we use perturbation theory to estimate the covariance matrix of the related power spectra multipoles, and check the accuracy of the derived covariance model using a large suite of dark matter halo catalogs at $z=0.5$. We find that the diagonal part of the auto covariance is well described by the Gaussian prediction, while the cross covariance deviates from the Gaussian prediction quickly when $k &gt; 0.1\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. Additionally, we find the non-Gaussian effect in the non-diagonal part of the cross covariance is comparable to, or even stronger than the pre-reconstruction covariance. By adding the non-Gaussian contribution, we obtain good agreement between analytical and numerical covariance matrices in the non-diagonal part up to $k \simeq 0.15\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. The agreement in the diagonal part is also improved, but still under-predicts the correlation in the cross covariance block.</description>

      <title>Impacts and Statistical Mitigation of Missing Data on the 21cm Power Spectrum: A Case Study with the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The precise characterization and mitigation of systematic effects is one of the biggest roadblocks impeding the detection of the fluctuations of cosmological 21cm signals. Missing data in radio cosmological experiments, often due to radio frequency interference (RFI), poses a particular challenge to power spectrum analysis as it could lead to the ringing of bright foreground modes in Fourier space, heavily contaminating the cosmological signals. Here we show that the problem of missing data becomes even more arduous in the presence of systematic effects. Using a realistic numerical simulation, we demonstrate that partially flagged data combined with systematic effects can introduce significant foreground ringing. We show that such an effect can be mitigated through inpainting the missing data. We present a rigorous statistical framework that incorporates the process of inpainting missing data into a quadratic estimator of the 21cm power spectrum. Under this framework, the uncertainties associated with our inpainting method and its impact on power spectrum statistics can be understood. These results are applied to the latest Phase II observations taken by the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array, forming a crucial component in power spectrum analyses as we move toward detecting 21cm signals in the ever more noisy RFI environment.</description>

      <title>New analysis of SNeIa Pantheon Catalog: Variable speed of light as an alternative to dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In A&amp;A 412, 35 (2003) Blanchard, Douspis, Rowan-Robinson, and Sarkar (BDRS) slightly modified the primordial fluctuation spectrum and produced an excellent fit to WMAP's CMB power spectrum for an Einstein-de Sitter (EdS) universe, bypassing dark energy. Curiously, they obtained a Hubble value of $H_0\approx46$, in sharp conflict with the canonical range $H_0\sim67-73$. However, we will demonstrate that the reduced value of $H_0\approx46$ achieved by BDRS is fully compatible with the use of variable speed of light in analyzing the late-time cosmic acceleration observed in Type Ia supernovae (SNeIa). In arXiv:2412.04257 [gr-qc] we uncovered a hidden aspect in a generic class of scale-invariant actions: the dynamics of the dilaton can induce a variation in the speed of light as $c\propto\chi^{1/2}$, causing $c$ to vary alongside $\chi$ across spacetime. For an EdS universe with varying $c$, besides the effects of cosmic expansion, light waves emitted from distant SNeIa are further subject to a refraction effect, which alters the Lemaitre redshift relation to $1+z=a^{-3/2}$. Based on this new formula, we achieve a fit to the SNeIa Pantheon Catalog exceeding the quality of the $\Lambda$CDM model. Crucially, our approach does not require dark energy and produces $H_0=47.2$ in strong alignment with the BDRS finding of $H_0\approx46$. Hence, BDRS's analysis of the (early-time) CMB power spectrum and our variable-$c$ analysis of the (late-time) Hubble diagram of SNeIa fully agree on two counts: (i) the dark energy hypothesis is avoided, and (ii) $H_0$ is reduced to $\sim47$, which also yields an age $t_0=2/(3H_0)=13.8$ Gy for an EdS universe, without requiring dark energy. Most importantly, we will demonstrate that the late-time acceleration can be attributed to the declining speed of light in an expanding EdS universe, rather than to a dark energy component.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05936v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on a recently proposed reinterpretation of gravitational wave memory that builds up on the definition of gravitational waves pioneered by Isaacson, we provide a unifying framework to derive both ordinary and null memory from a single well-defined equation at leading order in the asymptotic expansion. This allows us to formulate a memory equation that is valid for any unbound asymptotic energy-flux that preserves local Lorentz invariance. Using Horndeski gravity as a concrete example metric theory with an additional potentially massive scalar degree of freedom in the gravitational sector, the general memory formula is put into practice by presenting the first account of the memory correction sourced by the emission of massive field waves. Throughout the work, physical degrees of freedom are identified by constructing manifestly gauge invariant perturbation variables within an SVT decomposition on top of the asymptotic Minkowski background, which will in particular prove useful in future studies of gravitational wave memory within vector tensor theories.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter production during Warm Inflation via Freeze-In</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17371v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel perspective on the role of inflation in the production of Dark Matter (DM). Specifically, we explore the DM production during Warm Inflation via ultraviolet Freeze-In (WIFI). We demonstrate that in a Warm Inflation (WI) setting the persistent thermal bath, sustained by the dissipative interactions with the inflaton field, can source a sizable DM abundance via the non-renormalizable interactions that connect the DM with the bath. Compared to the (conventional) radiation-dominated (RD) UV freeze-in scenario for the same reheat temperature (after inflation), the resulting DM yield in WIFI is always enhanced showing a strongly positive dependence on the mass dimension of the non-renormalizable operator. Of particular interest, for a sufficiently large mass dimension of the operator, the entirety of the DM abundance of the Universe can be created during the inflationary phase. For the specific models we study, we find that the enhancement in DM yield, relative to RD UV freeze-in, is at least an order of magnitude for an operator of mass dimension 5, and as large as 18 order of magnitudes for an operator of mass dimension 10. Our findings also suggest a broader applicability for producing other cosmological relics, which may have a substantial impact on the evolution of the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Self-interacting axion clouds around rotating black holes in binary systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08349v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superradiant instability can form clouds around rotating black holes (BHs) composed of ultralight bosonic fields, such as axions. A BH with such a cloud in a binary system exhibits rich phenomena, and gravitational waves (GWs) from the BH merger provide a means to probe axions. For the first time, we study the evolution of axion clouds in a binary system during the inspiral phase, including axion self-interaction effects. When the self-interaction is significant, unlike in the negligible case, two types of clouds coexist through mode coupling. We examine the evolution of the system considering the effects of dissipation caused by both self-interaction and tidal interaction. For tidal interaction, in addition to the processes of emission to infinity and absorption by the BH, indirect emission via transitions (both resonant and off-resonant) is also considered as a second-order perturbation. Our results demonstrate that the signatures of axion self-interaction are imprinted in the modification of the GW phase. Furthermore, we find the possibility of a dynamical instability called bosenova during the binary inspiral phase.</description>

      <title>Hydrostatic mass of galaxy clusters within some theories of gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14280v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mass of galaxy clusters (GCs) can be determined by calculating the hydrostatic equilibrium equation. In this work, we derive the hydrostatic mass of GCs within Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld (EiBI) theory, beyond Horndeski gravity (BHG), and modified emergent Newtonian gravity (MENG) with generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) correction. We apply the formulations on the masses of 10 GCs. We compare our results with the Newtonian mass of GCs. Within a regime, we get an insight that all formulations could match the Newtonian mass. Thus, the impact of the modified theories of gravity used in this work can be neglected in this regime. The noteworthy impact starts if we set $\kappa=5\times10^{40}$ m$^2$ for EiBI theory, $\Upsilon=-0.1655\times10^{69}$ for BHG, and $\beta_0=-1.656\times10^{110}$ for MENG. We also compare our results from EiBI theory and BHG with the baryonic masses $M_{bar}$ of the GCs. A better linear fit is achieved by EiBI theory with $\kappa=5.80\times10^{40}$ m$^2$, which gives the slope $\mathcal{M}$ of $0.126\pm0.086$. This value is closer to unity than the one of BHG. This leads us to the fact that EiBI theory is more effective than BHG in alleviating the mass discrepancy between hydrostatic mass and baryonic mass in GCs. Nevertheless, neither EiBI theory nor BHG completely addresses the mass discrepancy problem.</description>

      <title>Implications of cosmologically coupled black holes for pulsar timing arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01801v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been argued that realistic models of (singularity-free) black holes (BHs) embedded within an expanding Universe are coupled to the large-scale cosmological dynamics, with striking consequences, including pure cosmological growth of BH masses. In this pilot study, we examine the consequences of this growth for the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) produced by inspiraling supermassive cosmologically coupled BHs. We show that the predicted SGWB amplitude is enhanced relative to the standard uncoupled case, while maintaining the $\Omega_{\text{gw}} \propto f^{2/3}$ frequency scaling of the spectral energy density. For the case where BH masses grow with scale factor as $M_{\text{bh}} \propto a^3$, thus contributing as a dark energy component to the cosmological dynamics, $\Omega_{\text{gw}}$ can be enhanced by more than an order of magnitude. This has important consequences for the SGWB signal detected by pulsar timing arrays, whose measured amplitude is slightly larger than most theoretical predictions for the spectrum from inspiraling binary BHs, a discrepancy which can be alleviated by the cosmological mass growth mechanism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06168v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the thermodynamic properties and stability of two newly introduced gas models, namely the Modified Chaplygin-Jacobi gas and the Modified Chaplygin-Abel gas. To achieve this, we examine the behavior of relevant physical parameters to gain in depth information about the evolution of the universe. The specific heat formalism is employed to verify the applicability of the third law of thermodynamics. Furthermore, the equation of state for the thermal system is obtained by applying thermodynamic variables. The stability of the gas models is investigated within the framework of classical thermodynamics, focusing on adiabatic processes, specific heat capacities, and isothermal conditions. It is inferred that the proposed fluid configurations exhibit thermodynamic stability and undergo adiabatic expansion for suitable parameter choices. We then perform observational analysis using CC+BAO and Pantheon+SH0ES datasets to impose constraints on our model parameters using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) process.</description>

      <title>Imprints of Early Universe Cosmology on Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09757v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the potential of gravitational waves (GWs) to probe the pre-BBN era of the early universe, focusing on the effects of energy injection. Specifically, we examine a hidden sector alongside the Standard Model that undergoes a strong first-order phase transition (FOPT), producing a GW signal. Once the phase transition has completed, energy injection initiates reheating in the hidden sector, which positions the hidden sector field so that additional phase transitions can occur. This can result in a total of three distinct phase transitions with a unique three-peak GW spectrum. Among these transitions, the first and third are of the standard type, while the intermediate second transition is inverted, moving from a broken to an unbroken phase. Using polynomial potentials as a framework, we derive analytical relations among the phase transition parameters and the resulting GW spectrum. Our results indicate that the second and third transitions generate GWs with higher amplitudes than the first, with a peak frequency ratio differing by up to an order of magnitude. This three-peak GW spectrum is detectable by upcoming facilities such as LISA, BBO, and UDECIGO. Notably, the phenomenon is robust across various potentials and model parameters, suggesting that hidden sector GWs provide a powerful tool for exploring new physics scenarios in the pre-BBN era.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Dark Matter Production in Supergravity $\alpha$-Attractor Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15030v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider gravitational particle production (GPP) of dark matter (DM) under a supergravity framework, where the $\alpha$-attractor inflation model is used. The particle spectrum is computed numerically and the DM number density is obtained. We show how the DM mass, gravitino mass and inflation model parameters modify the results, and find the reheating temperature which leads to sufficient DM production. In our setup, supergravity corrections suppress the efficiency of GPP, and make the isocurvature constraint much weaker compared with the normal case. With tensor-to-scalar ratio ranging from $10^{-3}-10^{-4}$ and DM mass from $10^{-2} m_\phi - m_\phi$, the required reheating temperature should be around $10^3 \textrm{GeV} - 10^7 \textrm{GeV}$.</description>

      <title>A long freeze is hard to achieve in the presence of matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16344v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Certain holographic dark energy (HDE) models allow for the possibility of a ``long freeze,'' in which the scale factor evolves to a constant in the long-time limit. Here we extend previous calculations by adding a nonrelativistic matter component. The addition of a matter component tends to destroy the long freeze behavior, driving the universe to recollapse. Long freeze evolution is still possible, but only for a limited set of HDE models.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the Pre-Big Bang scenario from a cosmological interpretation of the NANOGrav data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01734v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss a recently proposed fit of the 15-year data set obtained from the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) in terms of a relic stochastic background of primordial gravitons, produced in the context of the string cosmology pre-big bang scenario. We show that such interpretation cannot be reconciled with a phenomenologically viable minimal version of such scenario, while it can be allowed if one considers an equally viable but generalised, non-minimal version of pre-big bang evolution. Maintaining the $S$-duality symmetry throughout the high-curvature string phase is possible although somewhat disfavoured. The implications of this non-minimal scenario for the power spectrum of curvature perturbations are also briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>The neutron veto of the XENONnT experiment: Results with demineralized water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05264v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radiogenic neutrons emitted by detector materials are one of the most challenging backgrounds for the direct search of dark matter in the form of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs). To mitigate this background, the XENONnT experiment is equipped with a novel gadolinium-doped water Cherenkov detector, which encloses the xenon dual-phase time projection chamber (TPC). The neutron veto (NV) tags neutrons via their capture on gadolinium or hydrogen, which release $\gamma$-rays that are subsequently detected as Cherenkov light. In this work, we present the key features and the first results of the XENONnT NV when operated with demineralized water in the initial phase of the experiment. Its efficiency for detecting neutrons is $(82\pm 1)\,\%$, the highest neutron detection efficiency achieved in a water Cherenkov detector. This enables a high efficiency of $(53\pm 3)\,\%$ for the tagging of WIMP-like neutron signals, inside a tagging time window of $250\,\mathrm{\mu s}$ between TPC and NV, leading to a livetime loss of $1.6\,\%$ during the first science run of XENONnT.</description>
