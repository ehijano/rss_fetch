      <title>Quasispins of vacancy defects and their interactions in disordered antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vacancy defects in disordered magnetic materials are known to act as effective spins, ``quasispins'', in response to an external magnetic field. In the dilute limit, the contributions of such ``quasispins'' to the magnetic susceptibility $\chi_\text{vac}(T)\propto N_\text{vac}/T$ are singular in the limit of low temperatures $T$ and match those of free spins. With increasing the density of vacancies, their interactions may become essential. Motivated by frustrated and quasi-one-dimensional magnetic materials, we study analytically quasispins and their interactions in a generic system that has short-range antiferromagnetic order and lacks long-range order. We predict that if the vacancy defect does not disrupt the short-range antiferromagnetic order around it, the quasispin value matches the value of spins of the magnetic atoms in the material, and the correlators of the quasispins of different vacancies match the spin-spin correlators in the vacancy-free material. We confirm our conclusions by exact calculations for Ising chains with nearest-neighbour and next-to-nearest-neighbour interactions. We also compute the first virial correction to the susceptibility of a magnetic material due to the interactions of vacancy quasispins.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the Dirac spectrum from chiral symmetry restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I derive constraints on the Dirac spectrum in the chirally symmetric phase of a gauge theory with two massless fermion flavors. Using only general properties of correlation functions of scalar and pseudoscalar bilinears, I prove that in the chiral limit of vanishing quark mass $m$ all the corresponding susceptibilities must be power series in $m^2$ with finite coefficients, from which spectral constraints follow. I then use them to show that effective breaking of the anomalous $\mathrm{U}(1)_A$ symmetry is allowed in the $\mathrm{SU}(2)_A$ symmetric phase in the chiral limit, and leads to distinctive spectral features: (i) the spectral density must develop a singular $m^4/\lambda$ peak as $m\to 0$, (ii) the two-point eigenvalue correlator of near-zero modes must be singular, and (iii) near-zero modes cannot be localized. Moreover, in the symmetric phase the topological charge distribution must be indistinguishable from that of an ideal gas of instantons and anti-instantons of vanishing density, to leading order in the fermion mass.</description>

      <title>Dynamical stability and chaos in artificial neural network trajectories along training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The process of training an artificial neural network involves iteratively adapting its parameters so as to minimize the error of the network's prediction, when confronted with a learning task. This iterative change can be naturally interpreted as a trajectory in network space -- a time series of networks -- and thus the training algorithm (e.g. gradient descent optimization of a suitable loss function) can be interpreted as a dynamical system in graph space. In order to illustrate this interpretation, here we study the dynamical properties of this process by analyzing through this lens the network trajectories of a shallow neural network, and its evolution through learning a simple classification task. We systematically consider different ranges of the learning rate and explore both the dynamical and orbital stability of the resulting network trajectories, finding hints of regular and chaotic behavior depending on the learning rate regime. Our findings are put in contrast to common wisdom on convergence properties of neural networks and dynamical systems theory. This work also contributes to the cross-fertilization of ideas between dynamical systems theory, network theory and machine learning</description>

      <title>The Overlap Gap Property limits limit swapping in QAOA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a quantum algorithm designed for combinatorial optimization problem. We show that under the assumption that the Overlap Gap Property (OGP) in the solution space for the Max-$q$-XORSAT is a monotonic increasing function, the swapping of limits in QAOA leads to suboptimal results limited by the OGP. Furthermore, since the performance of QAOA for the pure $q$-spin model matches asymptotically for Max-$q$-XORSAT on large-girth regular hypergraph, we show that the average-case value obtained by QAOA for the pure $q$-spin model for even $q\ge 4$ is bounded away from optimality even when the algorithm runs indefinitely. This suggests that a necessary condition for the validity of limit swapping in QAOA is the absence of OGP in a given combinatorial optimization problem. A corollary of this is that the spectral gap of a Hamiltonian exhibiting the OGP will close in the thermodynamic limit resulting in a limitation of the quantum adiabatic theorem and efficient optimization of QAOA parameters. Furthermore, the results suggests that even when sub-optimised, the performance of QAOA on spin glass is equal in performance to Montanari's classical algorithm in solving the mean field spin glass problem, the best known classical algorithm.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of large oscillator populations with random interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore large populations of phase oscillators interacting via random coupling functions. Two types of coupling terms, the Kuramoto-Daido coupling and the Winfree coupling, are considered. Under the assumption of statistical independence of the phases and the couplings, we derive reduced averaged equations with effective non-random coupling terms. As a particular example, we study interactions that have the same shape but possess random coupling strengths and random phase shifts. While randomness in coupling strengths just renormalizes the interaction, a distribution of the phase shifts in coupling reshapes the coupling function.</description>

      <title>Message Passing Variational Autoregressive Network for Solving Intractable Ising Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many deep neural networks have been used to solve Ising models, including autoregressive neural networks, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and graph neural networks. Learning a probability distribution of energy configuration or finding the ground states of a disordered, fully connected Ising model is essential for statistical mechanics and NP-hard problems. Despite tremendous efforts, a neural network architecture with the ability to high-accurately solve these fully connected and extremely intractable problems on larger systems is still lacking. Here we propose a variational autoregressive architecture with a message passing mechanism, which can effectively utilize the interactions between spin variables. The new network trained under an annealing framework outperforms existing methods in solving several prototypical Ising spin Hamiltonians, especially for larger spin systems at low temperatures. The advantages also come from the great mitigation of mode collapse during the training process of deep neural networks. Considering these extremely difficult problems to be solved, our method extends the current computational limits of unsupervised neural networks to solve combinatorial optimization problems.</description>

      <title>A Constant self-consistent scattering lifetime in superconducting Strontium Ruthenate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this numerical work, we find a self-consistent constant scattering superconducting lifetime for two different values of the disorder parameters, the inverse atomic strength, and the stoichiometric impurity in the triplet paired unconventional super-conductor strontium ruthenate. This finding is relevant for experimentalists given that the expressions for the ultrasound attenuation and the electronic thermal conductivity depend on the superconducting scattering lifetime, and a constant lifetime fits well nonequilibrium experimental data. Henceforth, this work helps experimentalists in their interpretation of the acquired data. Additionally, we encountered tiny imaginary parts of the self-energy that resembles the Miyake-Narikiyo tiny gap out-side the unitary elastic scattering limit, and below the threshold zero gap value of 1.0 meV.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we discuss communities of densely connected structures and k-clique percolation phenomenon as related to the human structural connectome. We observe the existence of k-clique communities of high orders. The comparison of 426 connectomes shows that individual connections form a bulk of large k-clique communities and are critical for k-clique percolation phenomena. We have also shown the existence of a subnetwork of more frequent connections, considered as a core, which plays a key role in the formation of large-order cliques, connectivity within communities of such structures and their sustainability. The Erdos-Renyi model, for which the k-clique percolation phenomenon is well described, was shown to be inconsistent with modeling the formation of k-clique communities in the human structural connectome.for which the k-clique percolation phenomenon is well described, was shown to be inconsistent with modeling the formation of k-clique communities in the human structural connectome.</description>

      <title>Correlated volumes for extended wavefunctions on a random-regular graph</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the ergodic properties of a metallic wavefunction for the Anderson model in a disordered random-regular graph with branching number $k=2.$ A few q-moments $I_q$ associated with the zero energy eigenvector are numerically computed up to sizes $N=4\times 10^6.$ We extract their corresponding fractal dimensions $D_q$ in the thermodynamic limit together with correlated volumes $N_q$ that control finite-size effects. At intermediate values of disorder $W,$ we obtain ergodicity $D_q=1$ for $q=1,2$ and correlation volumes that increase fast upon approaching the Anderson transition $\log(\log(N_q))\sim W.$ We then focus on the extraction of the volume $N_0$ associated with the typical value of the wavefunction $e^{&lt;\log|\psi|^2&gt;},$ which follows a similar tendency as the ones for $N_1$ or $N_2.$ Its value at intermediate disorders is close, but smaller, to the so-called ergodic volume previously found via the super-symmetric formalism and belief propagator algorithms. None of the computed correlated volumes shows a tendency to diverge up to disorders $W\approx 15$, specifically none with exponent $\nu=1/2$. Deeper in the metal, we characterize the crossover to system sizes much smaller than the first correlated volume $N_1\gg N.$ Once this crossover has taken place, we obtain evidence of a scaling in which the derivative of the first fractal dimension $D_1$ behaves critically with an exponent $\nu=1.$</description>

      <title>Catching thermal avalanches in the disordered XXZ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the XXZ model with a random magnetic field in contact with a weakly disordered spin chain, acting as a finite thermal bath. We revise Fermi's golden rule description of the interaction between the thermal bath and the XXZ spin chain, contrasting it with a nonperturbative quantum avalanche scenario for the thermalization of the system. We employ two-point correlation functions to define the extent $\xi_d$ of the thermalized region next to the bath. Unbounded growth of $\xi_d$ proportional to the logarithm of time or faster is a signature of an avalanche. Such behavior signifies the thermalization of the system, as we confirm numerically for a generic initial state in the ergodic and critical regimes of the XXZ spin chain. In the many-body localized regime, a clear termination of avalanches is observed for specifically prepared initial states and, surprisingly, is not visible for generic initial product states. Additionally, we extract the localization length of the local integrals of motion and show that a bath made out of a weakly disordered XXZ chain has a similar effect on the system as a bath modeled by a Hamiltonian from a Gaussian orthogonal ensemble of random matrices. We also comment on the result of the earlier study (Phys. Rev. B 108, L020201 (2023)), arguing that the observed thermalization is due to external driving of the system and does not occur in the autonomous model. Our work reveals experimentally accessible signatures of quantum avalanches and identifies conditions under which termination of the avalanches may be observed.</description>

Abstract: In recent years, predictive machine learning methods have gained prominence in various scientific domains. However, due to their black-box nature, it is essential to establish trust in these models before accepting them as accurate. One promising strategy for assigning trust involves employing explanation techniques that elucidate the rationale behind a black-box model's predictions in a manner that humans can understand. However, assessing the degree of human interpretability of the rationale generated by such methods is a nontrivial challenge. In this work, we introduce interpretation entropy as a universal solution for assessing the degree of human interpretability associated with any linear model. Using this concept and drawing inspiration from classical thermodynamics, we present Thermodynamics-inspired Explainable Representations of AI and other black-box Paradigms (TERP), a method for generating accurate, and human-interpretable explanations for black-box predictions in a model-agnostic manner. To demonstrate the wide-ranging applicability of TERP, we successfully employ it to explain various black-box model architectures, including deep learning Autoencoders, Recurrent Neural Networks, and Convolutional Neural Networks, across diverse domains such as molecular simulations, text, and image classification.</description>

      <title>Quantized perfect transmission in graphene nanoribbons with random hollow adsorbates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04607v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Impurities exist inevitably in two-dimensional materials as they spontaneously adsorb onto the surface during fabrication, usually exerting detrimental effects on electronic transport. Here, we focus on a special type of impurities that preferentially adsorb onto the hollow regions of graphene nanoribbons (GNRs), and study how they affect the quantum transport in GNRs. Contrary to previous knowledge that random adatoms should localize electrons, the so-called Anderson localization, noteworthy quantized conductance peaks (QCPs) are observed at specific electron energies. These QCPs are remarkably robust against variations in system size, GNR edge, and adatom properties, and they can reappear at identical energies following an arithmetic sequence of device width. Further investigation of wavefunction reveals a unique transport mode at each QCP energy which transmits through disordered GNRs reflectionlessly, while all the others become fully Anderson localized, indicating the survival of quantum ballistic transport in the localized regime. Our findings highlight the potential utility of hollow adatoms as a powerful tool to manipulate the conductivity of GNRs, and deepen the understanding of the interplay between impurities and graphene.</description>
