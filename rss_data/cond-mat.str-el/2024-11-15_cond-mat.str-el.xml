      <title>Many-Body Photon Blockade and Quantum Light Generation from Cavity Quantum Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The strong coupling regime of photons and quantum materials inside optical cavities has emerged as a promising environment for manipulating states of matter with light. Here, in turn, we show that photons bear witness to cavity quantum-electrodynamical modifications of the material, leading to profoundly non-classical properties of light passing through the cavity. By generalizing quantum-optical input-output relations to correlated quantum materials, we study the second-order photon coherence g2(t) and demonstrate that antibunching of transmitted photons serves as direct evidence of light-induced changes to the cavity-embedded material. We show that materials near a quantum critical point can realize a collective many-body photon blockade, enabling the generation of single photons or Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen pairs via leveraging strong matter fluctuations. Our findings provide new routes for interrogating and harnessing cavity-embedded quantum materials as quantum light sources, as a resource for photon-based computation and quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>Emergent inductors in non-helical magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergent inductor, which is a concept of inductor employing quantum mechanics on helical magnets, has been studied actively from both theoretical and experimental aspects. Interestingly, finite inductance has been observed not only in spiral magnetic phases but also across various other magnetic phases although the underlying mechanism behind emergent inductance in non-helical magnets remains unresolved. In this study, we broaden the concept of emergent inductance to encompass non-helical magnets and establish a comprehensive formalism of the emergent inductance generated by magnetization dynamics. Using a diagrammatic approach, we derive the linear response of current density mediated by magnetization dynamics and formulate impedance and inductance for general magnetic materials. We reveal that the emergent inductance is composed of two distinct components, each contributing positively or negatively. Notably, the positive inductance arises from Ohmic dissipation including the effect of the emergent electric field (Berry phase in real space) while the negative inductance arises from the polarization of itinerant electrons (Berry curvature in $k$-$t$ space). We also apply the present method to quasi 1D models and show the numerical results of the inductance, the spin dynamics, the impedance, and the Q-value.</description>

      <title>Large anomalous Hall effect and \textit{A}-phase in hexagonal polar magnet Gd$_3$Ni$_8$Sn$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While recent theoretical studies have positioned noncollinear polar magnets with $C_{nv}$ symmetry as compelling candidates for realizing topological magnetic phases and substantial intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity, experimental realizations of the same in strongly correlated systems remain rare. Here, we present a large intrinsic anomalous Hall effect and extended topological magnetic ordering in Gd$_3$Ni$_8$Sn$_4$ with hexagonal $C_{6v}$ symmetry. Observation of topological Hall response, corroborated by metamagnetic anomalies in isothermal magnetization, peak/hump features in field-evolution of ac susceptibility and longitudinal resistivity, attests to the stabilization of skyrmion $A$-phase. The anomalous Hall effect is quantitatively accounted for by the intrinsic Berry curvature-mediated mechanism. Our results underscore polar magnets as a promising platform to investigate a plethora of emergent electrodynamic responses rooted in the interplay between magnetism and topology.</description>

      <title>Gapped Spin Excitation in Magnetic Ordered State on Yb-Based Zigzag Chain Compound YbAgSe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the 77Se-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) results of trivalent Yb zigzag chain compound YbAgSe2, which is a sister compound of YbCuS2. The 77Se-NMR spectrum was reproduced by considering two different Se sites with negative Knight shifts and three-axis anisotropy. Above the Neel temperature TN, the Knight shift is proportional to the bulk magnetic susceptibility. Below TN, the extremely broad signal with weak intensity and the relatively sharp signal coexist, suggesting that one is strongly influenced by internal magnetic fields and the other remains relatively unaffected by these fields in the magnetic ordered state. The nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/T1 remains almost constant above TN and abruptly decreases below TN. In contrast to YbCuS2, a T-linear behavior of 1/T1 at low temperatures was not observed at least down to 1.0 K in YbAgSe2. Our results indicate that the gapless excitation is unique to YbCuS2, or is immediately suppressed in the magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions in the presence of fluctuating charge-density wave in two-dimensional film of kagome metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the nature of a phase transition in a model describing an interaction of multiple charge density waves in a two dimensional film. The model was introduced by two of the authors in Phys. Rev. B {\bf 108}, 045119 (2023) to describe fluctuations in charge density wave order in the kagome metals AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A=K, Rb, Cs) in two dimensions. The situation is nontrivial since the transition occurs in the region of phase diagram where the unbound vortices compete with the interaction between charge density waves. Here, we study the nature of the phase transition via Metropolis Monte Carlo simulations. The 3-component order parameter, the susceptibility, the energy per site, and the specific heat are measured for a range of temperatures for different lattice sizes $L=8,16,24,32$. The finite size scaling analysis indicates the presence of a second-order transition.</description>

      <title>Entropy dynamics of the binary bond disordered Heisenberg chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the quench dynamics of the binary bond disordered Heisenberg spin chain. First, we develop a new algorithm, the ancilla TEBD method, which combines the purification technique and the time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) algorithm to study the entanglement dynamics of binary bonded disordered spin chains. With the support of exact diagonalization (ED), we calculate the the multifaractal dimension of the binary bond disordered Heisenberg spin model and study its dependence on the strength of the disorder potential; we find no critical behavior which rules out the existence of the many body localization transition. Then, we reproduce the long time scaling of the von Neumann entropy at the time scale that is beyond the reach of typical TEBD and time dependent density matrix renormalization group (tDMRG) algorithms. Based on the numerical analysis, we propose that such a long time scaling is due to the competition of the spin interaction and the disorder which can be seen as a new mechanism for the generating of long time scale entropy dynamics. At last, we numerically proved the existence of the transient Mpemba effect in the bond disordered Heisenberg chain.</description>

      <title>Phase diagram of the disordered Kitaev chain with long range pairing connected to external baths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the interplay between topology and disorder in the disodered Kitaev model with long range pairing, connected to two metallic leads exchanging particles with external Lindblad baths. We study how the phase diagram of the system is affected by the disorder by monitoring the subgap modes at increasing disorder, by computing the current flowing across the superconductor at a finite voltage bias between the baths, and by looking at the normal, single particle lead correlations across the Kitaev long range chain. In particular, we evidence the reentrant behavior of the massive, topological phase at limited values of the disorder strength, that has no analog in the disordered, short range pairing Kitaev model, thus rising the question of whether it is possible to recover a disorder triggered direct transition between the massive and the short range topological phase of the long range pairing Kitaev model.</description>

      <title>Charge-Neutral Electronic Excitations in Quantum Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experiments on quantum materials have uncovered many interesting quantum phases ranging from superconductivity to a variety of topological quantum matter including the recently observed fractional quantum anomalous Hall insulators. The findings have come in parallel with the development of approaches to probe the rich excitations inherent in such systems. In contrast to observing electrically charged excitations, the detection of charge-neutral electronic excitations in condensed matter remains difficult, though they are essential to understanding a large class of strongly correlated phases. Low-energy neutral excitations are especially important in characterizing unconventional phases featuring electron fractionalization, such as quantum spin liquids, spin ices, and insulators with neutral Fermi surfaces. In this perspective, we discuss searches for neutral fermionic, bosonic, or anyonic excitations in unconventional insulators, highlighting theoretical and experimental progress in probing excitonic insulators, new quantum spin liquid candidates and emergent correlated insulators based on two-dimensional layered crystals and moir\'e materials. We outline the promises and challenges in probing and utilizing quantum insulators, and discuss exciting new opportunities for future advancements offered by ideas rooted in next-generation quantum materials, devices, and experimental schemes.</description>

      <title>Magnetization process of a quasi-two-dimensional quantum magnet: Two-step symmetry restoration and dimensional reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on a comprehensive thermodynamic study of a quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) quantum magnet Cu$_2$(OH)$_3$Br which in the 2D layer can be viewed as strongly coupled alternating antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic chains. In an applied magnetic field transverse to the ordered spins below $T_N=9.3$ K, a field-induced phase transition from the 3D ordered to a disordered phase occurs at $B_c=16.3$ T for the lowest temperature, which is featured by an onset of a one-half plateau-like magnetization. By performing quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the relevant 2D model, we find that the plateau-like magnetization corresponds to a partial symmetry restoration and the full polarization in the ferromagnetic chains. Our numerical simulations also show that the magnetization saturation occurs with full symmetry restoration at a much higher field of $B_s \simeq 95$ T, corresponding to a 1D quantum phase transition in the antiferromagnetic chains. We argue that the experimentally observed field-induced phase transition at $B_c$ follows from the partial symmetry restoration and the concomitant dimensional reduction.</description>

      <title>Spin Liquid Landscapes in the Kagome Lattice: A Variational Monte Carlo Study of the Chiral Heisenberg Model and Experimental Consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral spin liquids, which break time-reversal symmetry, are of great interest due to their topological properties and fractionalized excitations (anyons). In this work, we investigate chiral spin liquids (CSL) on the kagome lattice arising from the competition between the third-nearest-neighbor Heisenberg interaction across hexagons ($J_d$) and a staggered scalar spin chirality term ($J_\chi$). Using variational Monte Carlo methods, we map out the phase diagram and identify various gapped and gapless CSL phases, each characterized by a distinct flux pattern. Notably, the interplay between $J_d$ and $J_\chi$ induces a tricritical point, which we analyze using Landau-Ginzburg theory. Additionally, we identify potential signatures of these CSLs-including distinctive spin-spin correlations, anomalies in the static spin structure factor, longitudinal thermal conductivity, and magnetoelectric effects-which offer practical guidance for their future experimental detection.</description>

      <title>Origin of the suppression of magnetic order in MnSi under hydrostatic pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally study the evolution of the magnetic moment $m$ and exchange interaction $J$ as a function of hydrostatic pressure in the zero-field helimagnetic phase of the strongly correlated electron system MnSi. The suppression of magnetic order at $\approx 1.5$~GPa is shown to arise from the $J$ collapse and not from a quantum fluctuations induced reduction of $m$. Our work provides benchmarks for first principles theories that are challenged by the presence of strong correlations and the possible role of Hund's coupling. In addition, our experimental data are consistent with a reorientation of the magnetic propagation wavevector recently evidenced above $\approx 1.2$~GPa. This result calls for a thorough investigation of the crystal structure in this pressure range.</description>

      <title>On the Ferrimagnetic State of CrCl$_2$(pyz)$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van der Waals layered ferromagnetic compounds with high two-dimensional electronic conductivity holds strong potential for quantum computing, future unconventional superconductors, catalysts, batteries, and fuel cells. We suggest a minimal theoretical model to understand the magnetic properties of the metal-organic framework CrCl$_2$(pyz)$_2$ (pyz=pyrazine). Using a Hubbard model we show that the groundstate is dominated by a specific configuration of delocalized electrons on the pyz sites with a ferrimagnetic coupling to the localized spins on the Cr sites. This model suggests a magnetic moment of $2\mu_B$ which is remarkably close to the experimental value of $1.8 \mu_B$ [K. S. Pedersen et al., Nat. Chem. 10, 1056-1061 (2018)]. From Weiss mean-field theory we predict a weak ferromagnetic Cr-Cr coupling of $\approx 0.9$ meV. This is consolidated by second order perturbation theory of the RKKY interaction yielding a Cr-Cr coupling of $\approx 5$ meV. Understanding the interactions in these types of compounds can facilitate designs of metal-organic compounds with tailored magnetic properties.</description>

      <title>Layered Multiple Scattering Approach to Hard X-ray Photoelectron Diffraction: Theory and Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photoelectron diffraction (PED) is a powerful and essential experimental technique for resolving the structure of surfaces with sub-angstrom resolution. In the high energy regime, researchers in angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) observe modulating patterns attributed to X-ray-PED (XPD) effects. This is accompanied by other challenges such as low cross-sections, significant photon momentum transfer, and non-negligible phonon scattering. Overall, XPD is not only an advantageous approach but also exhibits unexpected effects. To disentangle these diffraction influences, we present a PED implementation for the SPRKKR package that utilizes multiple scattering theory and a one-step model in the photoemission process. Unlike real-space implementations of the multiple scattering XPD formalism, we propose a k-space implementation based on the layer KKR method. The main advantage of this method is its ability to address a very broad kinetic energy range (20-8000 eV) without convergence problems related to angular momentum and cluster size. Furthermore, the so-called alloy analogy model can be used to simulate XPD at finite temperatures as well as XPD effects observed in soft and hard X-ray ARPES. For practical applications, we have calculated the circular dichroism in angular distributions (CDAD) associated with core-level photoemission of 2p from Si(100) and 3p from Ge(100). Photoelectrons are excited by hard X-rays (6000 eV) with right and left circularly polarized radiation (RCP and LCP, respectively).</description>

      <title>Spectral decomposition and high-accuracy Greens functions: Overcoming the Nyquist-Shannon limit via complex-time Krylov expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accurate computation of low-energy spectra of strongly correlated quantum many-body systems, typically accessed via Greens-functions, is a long-standing problem posing enormous challenges to numerical methods. When the spectral decomposition is obtained from Fourier transforming a time series, the Nyquist-Shannon theorem limits the frequency resolution $\Delta\omega$ according to the numerically accessible time domain size $T$ via $\Delta\omega = 2/T$. In tensor network methods, increasing the domain size is exponentially hard due to the ubiquitous spread of correlations, limiting the frequency resolution and thereby restricting this ansatz class mostly to one-dimensional systems with small quasi-particle velocities. Here, we show how this fundamental limitation can be overcome using complex-time Krylov spaces. At the example of the critical $S-1/2$ Heisenberg model and light bipolarons in the two-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, we demonstrate the enormous improvements in accuracy, which can be achieved using this method.</description>

      <title>Cubic Dirac Semimetals: General Theory and Application to Rare-Earth Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rare-earth magnets with parent cubic symmetry exhibit unique topological properties. However, the origin of these behaviors remains presently unclear. Here, we develop minimal models for Dirac semimetals (DSMs) with accidental band crossings and higher-order topology in cubic systems, incorporating candidate magnetic order to analyze bulk, surface, and hinge state characteristics. In certain cubic-symmetric DSMs, we identify an effective Z2 chiral symmetry which significantly impacts surface and hinge-localized states. Our results highlight distinct features in surface state dispersions, Fermi arcs, polarization dependence, and band splitting that correlate with photoe- mission data in rare-earth monopnictides. We also suggest candidate materials and experimental tests for further validation. These findings advance our understanding of surface states in rare-earth magnets with parent cubic symmetries and illuminate the role of DSM physics in these systems.</description>

      <title>Fermion-qubit fault-tolerant quantum computing</title>

Abstract: Simulating the dynamics of electrons and other fermionic particles in quantum chemistry, material science, and high-energy physics is one of the most promising applications of fault-tolerant quantum computers. However, the overhead in mapping time evolution under fermionic Hamiltonians to qubit gates renders this endeavor challenging. We introduce fermion-qubit fault-tolerant quantum computing, a framework which removes this overhead altogether. Using native fermionic operations we first construct a repetition code which corrects phase errors only. We then engineer a fermionic color code which corrects for both phase and loss errors. We show how to realize a universal fermionic gate set in this code, including transversal Clifford gates. Interfacing with qubit color codes we realize qubit-fermion fault-tolerant computation, which allows for qubit-controlled fermionic time evolution, a crucial subroutine in state-of-the-art quantum algorithms for simulating fermions. We show how our framework can be implemented in neutral atoms, overcoming the apparent inability of neutral atoms to implement non-number-conserving gates by introducing a neutral-atom braiding gate using photodissociation of bosonic molecules. As an application, we consider the fermionic fast Fourier transform, an important subroutine for simulating crystalline materials, finding an exponential improvement in circuit depth from $\mathcal{O}(N)$ to $\mathcal{O}(\log(N))$ with respect to lattice site number $N$ and a linear improvement from $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(N\log(N))$ in Clifford gate complexity compared to state-of-the-art qubit-only approaches. Our work opens the door to fermion-qubit fault-tolerant quantum computation in platforms with native fermions such as neutral atoms, quantum dots and donors in silicon, with applications in quantum chemistry, material science, and high-energy physics.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Kohn-Luttinger topological superconductivity in bands with nontrivial geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the effect of the electron wavefunction on Kohn-Luttinger superconductivity. The role of the wavefunction is encoded in a complex form factor describing the topology and geometry of the bands. We show that the electron wavefunction significantly impacts the superconducting transition temperature and superconducting order parameter. We illustrate this using the lowest Landau level form factor and find exponential enhancement of $T_c$ for the resulting topological superconductor. We find that the ideal band geometry, which favors a fractional Chern insulator in the flat band limit, has an optimal $T_c$. Finally, we apply this understanding to a model relevant to rhombohedral graphene multilayers and unravel the importance of the band geometry for achieving robust superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Non-Invertible Symmetries in 6d from Green-Schwarz Automorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct non-invertible symmetries in 6d $\mathcal{N}=(2,0)$ superconformal field theories that arise from Green-Schwarz (GS) automorphisms, which form abelian or non-abelian groups. Applied to $\mathbb{Z}_2$, $\mathbb{Z}_3$ and $S_3$ GS automorphisms, gives rise to non-invertible duality, triality and $S_3$-ality defects, respectively, once combined with stacking symmetry protected topological phases (SPTs) and gauging 2-form symmetries. We derive the defects and their fusion rules from two distinct perspectives: from half-space gauging as well as from the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT). This is the first concrete construction of symmetry defects in 6d forming a fusion 5-category whose fusions are intrinsically non-invertible and non-abelian.</description>

      <title>A Universal Circuit Set Using the $S_3$ Quantum Double</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One potential route toward fault-tolerant universal quantum computation is to use non-Abelian topological codes. In this work, we investigate how to achieve this goal with the quantum double model $\mathcal{D}(S_3)$ -- a specific non-Abelian topological code. By embedding each on-site Hilbert space into a qubit-qutrit pair, we give an explicit construction of the circuits for creating, moving, and locally measuring all non-trivial anyons. We also design a specialized anyon interferometer to measure the total charge remotely for well-separated anyons; this avoids fusing them together. These protocols enable the implementation of a universal gate set proposed by Cui et al. and active quantum error correction of the circuit-level noise during the computation process. To further reduce the error rate and facilitate error correction, we encode each physical degree of freedom of $\mathcal{D}(S_3)$ into a novel, quantum, error-correcting code, enabling fault-tolerant realization, at the logical level, of all gates in the anyon manipulation circuits. Our proposal offers a promising path to realize universal topological quantum computation in the NISQ era.</description>

      <title>Twisted coupled wire model for a moir\'e sliding Luttinger liquid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04070v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent experiments in twisted bilayer WTe$_2$ revealed the existence of anisotropic Luttinger liquid behavior. To generically characterize such anisotropic twisted bilayer systems, we study a model of a twisted bilayer of two-dimensional (2D) arrays of coupled wires, which effectively form an array of coupled moir\'e wires. We solve the model by the transfer matrix method, and identify quasi-1D electron bands in the system at small twist angles. With electron interactions added, we show that the moir\'e wires have an effective Luttinger parameter $g_\text{eff}$ much lower than that of the microscopic wires. This leads to a sliding Luttinger liquid (SLL) temperature regime, in which power-law current voltage relations arise. For parameters partly estimated from WTe$_2$, a microscopic interaction $U\sim0.7$eV yields a temperature regime of SLL similar to that in the WTe$_2$ experiments.</description>

      <title>Unveiling UV/IR Mixing via Symmetry Defects: A View from Topological Entanglement Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09425v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Some topological lattice models in two spatial dimensions exhibit intricate lattice size dependence in their ground state degeneracy (GSD). This and other features such as the position-dependent anyonic excitations are manifestations of UV/IR mixing. In the first part of this paper, we perform an exact calculation of the topological entanglement entropy (TEE) for a specific model, the rank-2 toric code. This analysis includes both contractible and non-contractible boundaries, with the minimum entropy states identified specifically for non-contractible boundaries. Our results show that TEE for a contractible boundary remains independent of lattice size, whereas TEE for non-contractible boundaries, similarly to the GSD, shows intricate lattice-size dependence. In the latter part of the paper we focus on the fact that the rank-2 toric code is an example of a translation symmetry-enriched topological phase, and show that viewing distinct lattice size as a consequence of different translation symmetry defects can explain both our TEE results and the GSD of the rank-2 toric code. Our work establishes the translation symmetry defect framework as a robust description of the UV/IR mixing in topological lattice models.</description>

      <title>Emergence of high-mobility carriers in topological kagome bad metal Mn$_3$Sn by intense photoexcitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12339v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kagome-lattice materials offer novel playgrounds of exploring topologically nontrivial states of electrons under influence of many-body interactions. A noncollinear kagome antiferromagnet Mn$_3$Sn has attracted particular interest for application in spintronics owing to the large anomalous Hall effect related to the Weyl dispersion near the Fermi energy. In addition, strong electronic correlation suggesting the Kondo physics has also been implied. However, the effect of correlation on the band topology and their interplay remains elusive. Here, we investigate nonequilibrium Hall transport in a photoexcited Mn$_3$Sn using time-resolved terahertz Faraday rotation spectroscopy. In equilibrium, Mn$_3$Sn is a bad metal close to the Mott-Ioffe-Regal limit with low carrier mobility, and thus only the anomalous Hall effect is discerned. By contrast, intense photoexcitation beyond an approximate threshold gives rise to a clear cyclotron resonance, namely the normal Hall effect, indicating the emergence of unusual carriers with 50 times lighter effective mass and 40 times less scattering. The lifetime of high-mobility carriers as long as a few tens of picoseconds and a threshold-like behavior for the pump fluence are hardly explained by contribution of photoexcited hot carriers. Instead, the emergence of unusual carriers may be accounted for by dielectric screening of the on-site Coulomb interaction by high-density delocalized photocarriers. A possible role of electronic correlation in equilibrium transport in Mn$_3$Sn beyond the single-particle picture is discussed.</description>

      <title>Human-machine collaboration: ordering mechanism of rank-2 spin liquid on breathing pyrochlore lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning algorithms thrive on large data sets of good quality. Here we show that they can also excel in a typical research setting with little data of limited quality, through an interplay of insights coming from machine, and human researchers. The question we address is the unsolved problem of ordering out of a spin-liquid phase described by an emergent rank-2 $U(1)$ gauge theory, as described by [H. Yan it et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 124, 127203 (2020)]. Published Monte Carlo simulations for this problem are consistent with a strong first-order phase transition, out of the R2-U1 spin liquid, but were too noisy for the form of low-temperature order to be identified. Using a highly-interpretable machine learning approach based on a support vector machine with a tensorial kernel (TKSVM), we re-analyze this Monte Carlo data, gaining new information about the form of order that could in turn be interpreted by traditionally-trained physicists. We find that the low-temperature ordered phase is a form of hybrid nematic order with emergent $Z_2$ symmetry, which allows for a sub-extensive set of domain walls at zero energy. This complex form of order arises due to a subtle thermal order-by-disorder mechanism, that can be understood from the fluctuations of the tensor electric field of the parent rank-2 gauge theory. These results were obtained by a back-and-forth process which closely resembles a collaboration between human researchers and machines. We argue that this "collaborative" approach may provide a blueprint for solving other problems that have not yielded to human insights alone.</description>

      <title>Mechanism of magnetic phase transition in correlated magnetic metal: insight into itinerant ferromagnet Fe$_{3-\delta}$GeTe$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04957v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Developing a comprehensive magnetic theory for correlated itinerant magnets poses challenges due to the difficulty in reconciling both local moments and itinerant electrons. In this work, we investigate the microscopic process of magnetic phase transition in ferromagnetic metal Fe$_{3-\delta}$GeTe$_2$. We find that Hund's coupling is crucial for establishing ferromagnetic order. During the ferromagnetic transition, we observe the formation of quasiparticle flat bands and an opposing tendency in spectral weight transfer, primarily between the lower and upper Hubbard bands, across the two spin channels. Moreover, our results indicate that one of the inequivalent Fe sites exhibits Mott physics, while the other Fe site exhibits Hund's physics, attributable to their distinct atomic environments. We suggest that ferromagnetic order reduces spin fluctuations and makes flat bands near the Fermi level more distinct. The hybridization between the distinctly flat bands and other itinerant bands offers a possible way to form heavy fermion behavior in ferromagnets. The complex interactions of competing orders drive correlated magnetic metals to a new frontier for discovering outstanding quantum states.</description>

      <title>Layer-dependent evolution of electronic structures and correlations in rhombohedral multilayer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent discovery of superconductivity and magnetism in trilayer rhombohedral graphene (RG) establishes an ideal, untwisted platform to study strong correlation electronic phenomena. However, the correlated effects in multilayer RG have received limited attention, and, particularly, the evolution of the correlations with increasing layer number remains an unresolved question. Here, we show the observation of layer-dependent electronic structures and correlations, under surprising liquid nitrogen temperature, in RG multilayers from 3 to 9 layers by using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy. We explicitly determine layer-enhanced low-energy flat bands and interlayer coupling strengths. The former directly demonstrates the further flattening of low-energy bands in thicker RG, and the latter indicates the presence of varying interlayer interactions in RG multilayers. Moreover, we find significant splittings of the flat bands, ranging from ~50-80 meV, at 77 K when they are partially filled, indicating the emergence of interaction-induced strongly correlated states. Particularly, the strength of the correlated states is notably enhanced in thicker RG and reaches its maximum in the six-layer, validating directly theoretical predictions and establishing abundant new candidates for strongly correlated systems. Our results provide valuable insights into the layer dependence of the electronic properties in RG and demonstrate it as a suitable system for investigating robust and highly accessible correlated phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10186v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In CFTs, the partition function of a line defect with a cusp depends logarithmically on the size of the line with an angle-dependent coefficient: the cusp anomalous dimension. In the first part of this work, we study the general properties of the cusp anomalous dimension. We relate the small cusp angle limit to the effective field theory of defect fusion, making predictions for the first couple of terms in the expansion. Using a concavity property of the cusp anomalous dimension we argue that the Casimir energy between a line defect and its orientation reversal is always negative ("opposites attract"). We use these results to determine the fusion algebra of Wilson lines in $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM as well as pinning field defects in the Wilson-Fisher fixed points. In the second part of the paper we obtain nonperturbative numerical results for the cusp anomalous dimension of pinning field defects in the Ising model in $d=3$, using the recently developed fuzzy-sphere regularization. We also compute the pinning field cusp anomalous dimension in the $O(N)$ model at one-loop in the $\varepsilon$-expansion. Our results are in agreement with the general theory developed in the first part of the work, and we make several predictions for impurities in magnets.</description>

      <title>Predicting quantum learnability from landscape fluctuation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11805v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The conflict between trainability and expressibility is a key challenge in variational quantum computing and quantum machine learning. Resolving this conflict necessitates designing specific quantum neural networks (QNN) tailored for specific problems, which urgently needs a general and efficient method to predict the learnability of QNNs without costly training. In this work, we demonstrate a simple and efficient metric for learnability by comparing the fluctuations of the given training landscape with standard learnable landscapes. This metric shows surprising effectiveness in predicting learnability as it unifies the effects of insufficient expressibility, barren plateaus, bad local minima, and overparametrization. Importantly, it can be estimated efficiently on classical computers via Clifford sampling without actual training on quantum devices. We conduct extensive numerical experiments to validate its effectiveness regarding physical and random Hamiltonians. We also prove a compact lower bound for the metric in locally scrambled circuits as analytical guidance. Our findings enable efficient predictions of learnability, allowing fast selection of suitable QNN architectures for a given problem without training, which can greatly improve the efficiency especially when access to quantum devices is limited.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07578v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study two-dimensional systems with Galilean invariance gapped under magnetic fields. When such quantum Hall systems are coupled with external sources for charge, energy, and momentum currents, they exhibit invariance under the Milne boost as well as under the gauge and general coordinate transformations. We construct the most general effective action consistent with all the symmetries in the derivative expansion, where an electric field is regarded as order of unity so as to allow for nonlinear responses. The resulting action is shown to consist of four terms proportional to the Hall conductivity and viscosity and the energy density and magnetization. We then compute the local currents induced by electromagnetic fields, revealing universal relations among distinct kinds of responses. In particular, we find the Hall conductivity determining the longitudinal conductivity at nonzero frequency and the Hall viscosity contributing to the nonlinear electrothermal conductivity at nonzero wave number.</description>

      <title>Two-doublon Bloch oscillations in the mass-imbalanced extended Fermi-Hubbard model</title>

Abstract: Interactions between particles normally induce the decay of the particles Bloch oscillations (BOs) in a periodic lattice. In the limit of strong on-site interactions, spin-$1/2$ fermions may form doublon bound states and undergo BOs in the presence of a tilted potential. Here we investigate the impact of nearest-neighbor interaction $V$ on the multi-doublon BOs in a mass-imbalanced extended Fermi-Hubbard model. We derive an effective Hamiltonian for doublons, and show that a slight change in $V$ can qualitatively alter their dynamic behaviors. Notably, at a resonance point, the doublons behave like free hard-core bosons. Under a tilted potential, the system may exhibit different types of multi-doublon BOs at or deviation from the resonance point. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate our conclusions in both one- and two-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Simulating real-time molecular electron dynamics efficiently using the time-dependent density matrix renormalization group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05959v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Compared to ground state electronic structure optimizations, accurate simulations of molecular real-time electron dynamics are usually much more difficult to perform. To simulate electron dynamics, the time-dependent density matrix renormalization group (TDDMRG) has been shown to offer an attractive compromise between accuracy and cost. However, many simulation parameters significantly affect the quality and efficiency of a TDDMRG simulation. So far, it is unclear whether common wisdom from ground state DMRG carries over to the TDDMRG, and a guideline on how to choose these parameters is missing. Here, in order to establish such a guideline, we investigate the convergence behavior of the main TDDMRG simulation parameters, such as time integrator, the choice of orbitals, and the choice of matrix-product-state representation for complex-valued non-singlet states. In addition, we propose a method to select orbitals that are tailored to optimize the dynamics. Lastly, we showcase the TDDMRG by applying it to charge migration ionization dynamics in furfural, where we reveal a rapid conversion from an ionized state with a $\sigma$ character to one with a $\pi$ character within less than a femtosecond.</description>

      <title>Variational formulation of dynamical electronic response functions in Bethe-Salpeter, (screened) Hartree-Fock, Hybrid-DFT approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22889v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the large class of systems described via a time-dependent self-consistent mean field Hamiltonian including (screened) Hartree-Fock exchange, we demonstrate that any electronic linear response function allows for a formulation which is variational in the electronic density matrix. To achieve our goal, we consider the usual form of a response function, written in terms of a screened and a bare electronic vertices (`bare-screen'), and perform an exact rewriting in terms of purely screened electronic vertices (`screen-screen'). Within the `screen-screen' formulation, the response function can be written as a stationary point of a functional of the exact density matrix. Further, we show that the imaginary part of any electronic response can be written in the form of a generalized Fermi Golden Rule, by introducing an exact complementary rewriting in terms of vertices related by complex conjugation (`screen*-screen'). The proposed approach encompasses different levels of linear response theory, such as time-dependent DFT with hybrid functionals, time-dipendent Hartree-Fock, and the Bethe-Salpeter Equation with the frequency independent approximation of the screened interaction. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our formalism by calculating the optical conductivity of graphene, which exhibits strong excitonic effects, using a tight-binding model including exchange effects in the response. Our findings show the advantages of the variationality of the screen-screen formulation over the others both in convergence properties and robustness with density-matrix approximations.</description>
