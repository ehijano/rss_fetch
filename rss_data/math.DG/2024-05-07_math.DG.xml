      <title>Differential spinors and Kundt three-manifolds with skew-torsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the theory of spinorial polyforms associated with bundles of irreducible Clifford modules of non-simple real type, obtaining a precise characterization of the square of an irreducible real spinor in signature $(p-q) = 1\,\mathrm{mod(8)}$ as a polyform belonging to a semi-algebraic real set. We use this formalism to study differential spinors on Lorentzian three-manifolds, proving that in this dimension and signature, every differential spinor is equivalent to an isotropic line preserved in a given direction by a metric connection with prescribed torsion. We apply this result to investigate Lorentzian three-manifolds equipped with a skew-torsion parallel spinor, namely a spinor parallel with respect to a metric connection with totally skew-symmetric torsion. We obtain several structural results about this class of Lorentzian three-manifolds, which are necessarily Kundt, and in the compact case, we obtain an explicit differential condition that guarantees geodesic completeness. We further elaborate on these results to study the supersymmetric solutions of three-dimensional NS-NS supergravity, which involve skew-torsion parallel spinors whose torsion is given by the curvature of a curving on an abelian bundle gerbe. In particular, we obtain a correspondence between NS-NS supersymmetric solutions and null coframes satisfying an explicit exterior differential system that we solve locally.</description>

      <title>Topological regularity and stability of noncollapsed spaces with Ricci curvature bounded below</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the topological regularity and stability of noncollapsed Ricci limit spaces $(M_i^n,g_i,p_i)\to (X^n,d)$. We confirm a conjecture proposed by Colding and Naber in dimension $n=4$, showing that the cross-sections of tangent cones at a given point $x\in X^4$ are all homeomorphic to a fixed spherical space form $S^3/\Gamma_x$, and $\Gamma_x$ is trivial away from a $0$-dimensional set. In dimensions $n&gt;4$, we show an analogous statement at points where all tangent cones are $(n-4)$-symmetric. Furthermore, we prove that $(n-3)$-symmetric noncollapsed Ricci limits are topological manifolds, thus confirming a particular case of a conjecture due to Cheeger, Colding, and Tian. Our analysis relies on two key results, whose importance goes beyond their applications in the study of cross-sections of noncollapsed Ricci limit spaces: (i) A new manifold recognition theorem for noncollapsed ${\rm RCD}(-2,3)$ spaces. (ii) A cone rigidity result ruling out noncollapsed Ricci limit spaces of the form $\mathbb{R}^{n-3}\times C(\mathbb{RP}^2)$.</description>

      <title>Quasi-positive curvature and vanishing theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider mixed curvature $\mathcal{C}_{a,b}$, which is a convex combination of Ricci curvature and holomorphic sectional curvature introduced by Chu-Lee-Tam. We prove that if a compact complex manifold M admits a K\"{a}hler metric with quasi-positive mixed curvature and $3a+2b\geq0$, then it is projective. If $a,b\geq0$, then M is rationally connected. As a corollary, the same result holds for k-Ricci curvature. We also show that any compact K\"{a}hler manifold with quasi-positive 2-scalar curvature is projective. Lastly, we generalize the result to the Hermitian case. In particular, any compact Hermitian threefold with quasi-positive real bisectional curvature have vanishing Hodge number $h^{2,0}$. Furthermore, if it is K\"{a}hlerian, it is projective.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we use stable capillary surfaces (analogous to the $\mu$-bubble construction) to study manifolds with strictly mean convex boundary and nonnegative scalar curvature. We give an obstruction to filling 2-manifolds by such 3-manifolds based on the Urysohn width. We also obtain a bandwidth estimate and establish other geometric properties of such manifolds.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As proven in a celebrated theorem due to Vaisman, pure locally conformally K\"ahler metrics do not exist on compact K\"ahler manifolds. In a previous paper, we extended this result to the singular setting, more precisely to K\"ahler spaces which are locally irreducible. Without the additional assumption of local irreducibility, there are counterexamples for which Vaisman's theorem does not hold. In this article, we give a much broader sufficient condition under which Vaisman's theorem still holds for compact K\"ahler spaces which are locally reducible.</description>

      <title>Collapsing immortal K\"ahler-Ricci flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the K\"ahler-Ricci flow on compact K\"ahler manifolds with semiample canonical bundle and intermediate Kodaira dimension, and show that the flow collapses to a canonical metric on the base of the Iitaka fibration in the locally smooth topology and with bounded Ricci curvature away from the singular fibers. This follows from an asymptotic expansion for the evolving metrics, in the spirit of recent work of the first and third-named authors on collapsing Calabi-Yau metrics, and proves two conjectures of Song and Tian.</description>

      <title>The Penrose Inequality for Metrics with Singular Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Penrose inequality and its rigidity for metrics with singular sets. Our result could be viewed as a complement of Theorem 1.1 of Lu and Miao (J. Funct. Anal. 281, 2021) and Theorem 1.2 of Shi, Wang and Yu (Math. Z. 291, 2019), in which they assume the singular set is a hypersurface and assume an additional condition on the mean curvature. As a complement, this paper study the case of singular set of dimensional less than n-1, without any additional conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that all non-developable ruled surfaces endowed with Ricci metrics in the three-dimensional Euclidean space may be constructed using curves of constant torsion and its binormal. This allows us to give characterizations of the helicoid as the only surface of this kind that admits a parametrization with plane line of striction, and as the only with constant mean curvature.</description>

      <title>Classification of solutions to the isotropic horospherical $p$-Minkowski problem in hyperbolic plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In \cite{LX}, the first author and Xu introduced and studied the horospherical $p$-Minkowski problem in hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^{n+1}$. In particular, they established the uniqueness result for solutions to this problem when the prescribed function is constant and $p\ge -n$. This paper focuses on the isotropic horospherical $p$-Minkowski problem in hyperbolic plane $\mathbb{H}^{2}$, which corresponds to the equation \begin{equation}\label{0}
  \varphi^{-p}\left(\varphi_{\theta\theta}-\frac{\varphi_{\theta}^2}{2\varphi}+\frac{\varphi-\varphi^{-1}}{2}\right)=\gamma\quad\text{on}\ \mathbb{S}^1, \end{equation} where $\gamma$ is a positive constant. We provide a classification of solutions to the above equation for $p\ge -7$, as well as a nonuniqueness result of solutions for $p&lt;-7$. Furthermore, we extend this problem to the isotropic horospherical $q$-weighted $p$-Minkowski problem in hyperbolic plane and derive some uniqueness and nonuniqueness results.</description>

      <title>Geometric Structures for the $G_2'$-Hitchin Component</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give an explicit geometric structures interpretation of the $G_2'$-Hitchin component $Hit(S, G_2') \subset \chi(\pi_1S,G_2')$ of a closed oriented surface $S$ of genus $g \geq 2$. In particular, we prove $Hit(S, G_2')$ is naturally homeomorphic to a moduli space $\mathscr{M}$ of $(G,X)$-structures for $G = G_2'$ and $X = Ein^{2,3}$ on a fiber bundle $\mathscr{C}$ over $S$ via the descended holonomy map. Explicitly, $\mathscr{C}$ is the direct sum of fiber bundles $\mathscr{C} = UTS \oplus UTS \oplus \underline{\mathbb{R}_+}$ with fiber $\mathscr{C}_p = UT_p S \times UT_p S \times \mathbb{R}_+$, where $UT S$ denotes the unit tangent bundle.
  The geometric structure associated to a $G_2'$-Hitchin representation $\rho$ is explicitly constructed from the unique associated $\rho$-equivariant alternating almost-complex curve $\hat{\nu}: \tilde{S} \rightarrow \hat{\mathbb{S}}^{2,4}$; we critically use recent work of Collier-Toulisse on the moduli space of such curves. Our explicit geometric structures are examined in the $G_2'$-Fuchsian case and shown to be unrelated to the $(G_2', Ein^{2,3})$-structures of Guichard-Wienhard.</description>

Abstract: Let $X \subset \mathbb P^{n+c}$ be a nondegenerate smooth projective variety of dimension $n$ defined by quadratic equations. For such varieties, P. Ionescu and F. Russo proved the Hartshorne conjecture on complete intersections, which states that X is a complete intersection provided that $n\geq 2c+1$. As the extremal case, they also classified $X$ with $n=2c$. In this paper, we classify $X$ with $n=2c-1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct nontrivial unbounded domains $\Omega$ in the hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^N$, $N \in \{2,3,4\}$, bifurcating from the complement of a ball, such that the overdetermined elliptic problem \begin{equation} -\Delta_{\mathbb{H}^N} u+u-u^p=0\,\, \text{in}\,\,\Omega, \,\, u=0,\,\,\partial_\nu u=\text{const}\,\,\text{on}\,\,\partial\Omega\nonumber \end{equation} has a positive bounded solution in $C^{2,\alpha}\left(\Omega\right) \cap H^1\left(\Omega\right)$. We also give a condition under which this construction holds for larger dimensions $N$. This is linked to the Berestycki-Caffarelli-Nirenberg conjecture on overdetermined elliptic problems, and, as far as we know, is the first nontrivial example of solution to an overdetermined elliptic problem in the hyperbolic space.</description>

      <title>Geodesic connectivity and rooftop envelopes in the Cegrell classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study examines geodesics and plurisubharmonic envelopes within the Cegrell classes on bounded hyperconvex domains in $\mathbb{C}^n$. We establish that solutions possessing comparable singularities to the complex Monge-Amp\`ere equation are identical, affirmatively addressing a longstanding open question raised by Cegrell. This achievement furnishes the most general form of the Bedford-Taylor comparison principle within the Cegrell classes. Building on this foundational result, we explore plurisubharmonic geodesics, broadening the criteria for geodesic connectivity among plurisubharmonic functions with connectable boundary values. Our investigation also delves into the notion of rooftop envelopes, revealing that the rooftop equality condition and the idempotency conjecture are valid under substantially weaker conditions than previously established, a finding made possible by our proven uniqueness result. The paper concludes by discussing the core open problems within the Cegrell classes related to the complex Monge-Amp\`ere equation.</description>

      <title>On full asymptotics of analytic torsions for compact locally symmetric orbifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.02055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2005.02055v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a certain sequence of flat vector bundles on a compact locally symmetric orbifold, and we evaluate explicitly the associated asymptotic Ray-Singer real analytic torsion. The basic idea is to computing the heat trace via Selberg's trace formula, so that a key point in this paper is to evaluate the orbital integrals associated with nontrivial elliptic elements. For that purpose, we deduce a geometric localization formula, so that we can rewrite an elliptic orbital integral as a sum of certain identity orbital integrals associated with the centralizer of that elliptic element. The explicit geometric formula of Bismut for semisimple orbital integrals plays an essential role in these computations.</description>

Abstract: We provide a good dynamical framework allowing to generalize Thurston's asymmetric metric and the associated Finsler norm from Teichm\"uller space to large classes of Anosov representations. In many cases, including the space of Hitchin representations, this gives a (possibly asymmetric) Finsler distance. In some cases we explicitly compute the associated Finsler norm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.08807v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a 3-dimensional (para-)CR structure, its family of chains define a 3-dimensional path geometry. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions that determine whether a path geometry in dimension three arises from chains of a CR or para-CR 3-manifold. We demonstrate how our characterization can be verified computationally for a given 3-dimensional path geometry and discuss a few examples.</description>

      <title>Envelopes of straight line families in the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.07232v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is a widespread method to represent the envelope when a given hyperplane family creates an envelope. However, one sometimes encounters cases when the widespread method fails to represent the desired envelope precisely, and is confused. At the same time, one wants to find a correct method to draw the envelope precisely.
  In this article, focused on straight line families in the plane, an easy to understand explanation is given on the recently discovered correct method to represent the envelope precisely. Moreover, it is explained when and why the widespread method fails to represent the precise shape of envelope as well.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12712v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The higher order contact of a quadric with a surface in $3$-space at a non-degenerate point is obtained by the Moutard quadric in the Darboux direction. In this paper, we discuss the extension of this result to hypersurfaces in arbitrary dimensions.</description>

      <title>Generalized double bracket vector fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By introducing a metriplectic tensor, we generalize the double bracket vector fields defined on semi-simple Lie algebras to the case of Poisson manifolds endowed with a pseudo-Riemannian metric. We also construct a generalization of the normal metric on an adjoint orbit of a compact semi-simple Lie algebra such that the above vector fields, when restricted to a symplectic leaf, become gradient vector fields. We illustrate the newly introduced objects to a variety of examples and carefully discuss complications that arise when the pseudo-Riemannian metric does not induce a non-degenerate metric on parts of the symplectic leaves.</description>

      <title>Gradient estimates for positive eigenfunctions of $ \mathcal{L} $-operator on conformal solitons and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10417v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a local gradient estimate for positive eigenfunctions of $ \mathcal{L} $-operator on conformal solitons given by a general conformal vector field. As an application, we obtain a Liouville type theorem for $ \mathcal{L} u = 0 $, which improves the one of Li--Sun (Acta Math. Sin. (Engl. Ser.), 37(11): 1768--1782, 2021.). We also consider applications where manifolds are special conformal solitons. Especially in the case of self-shrinkers, a better Liouville type theorem is obtained.</description>

      <title>Coupled $\operatorname{G}_2$-instantons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the coupled instanton equations for a metric, a spinor, a three-form, and a connection on a bundle, over a spin manifold. Special solutions in dimensions $6$ and $7$ arise, respectively, from the Hull--Strominger and the heterotic $\operatorname{G}_2$ system. The equations are motivated by recent developments in theoretical physics and can be recast using generalized geometry; we investigate how coupled instantons relate to generalized Ricci-flat metrics and also to Killing spinors on a Courant algebroid. We present two open questions regarding how these different geometric conditions are intertwined, for which a positive answer is expected from recent developments in the physics literature by De la Ossa, Larfors and Svanes, and in the mathematics literature on Calabi--Yau manifolds, in recent work by the second-named author with Gonz\'alez Molina. We give a complete solution to the first of these problems, providing a new method for the construction of instantons in arbitrary dimensions. For $\operatorname{G}_2$-structures with torsion coupled to $\operatorname{G}_2$-instantons, in dimension $7$, we also establish results around the second problem. The last part of the present work carefully studies the approximate solutions to the heterotic $\operatorname{G}_2$-system constructed by the third and fourth authors on contact Calabi--Yau $7$-manifolds, for which we prove the existence of approximate coupled $\operatorname{G}_2$-instantons and generalized Ricci-flat metrics.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we define a set of good basic invariants for a finite complex reflection group under certain conditions. We show that a set of good basic invariants for a finite real reflection group gives a set of the flat invariants obtained by Saito and the Taylor coefficients of these good basic invariants give the structure constants of the multiplication of the Frobenius structure obtained by Dubrovin.</description>

      <title>Dynamical instability of minimal surfaces at flat singular points</title>

      <description>arXiv:2008.13728v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Suppose that a countably $n$-rectifiable set $\Gamma_0$ is the support of a multiplicity-one stationary varifold in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ with a point admitting a flat tangent plane $T$ of density $Q \geq 2$. We prove that, under a suitable assumption on the decay rate of the blow-ups of $\Gamma_0$ towards $T$, there exists a non-constant Brakke flow starting with $\Gamma_0$. This shows non-uniqueness of Brakke flow under these conditions, and suggests that the stability of a stationary varifold with respect to mean curvature flow may be used to exclude the presence of flat singularities.</description>

      <title>Geometry of fundamental shadow link complements and applications to the 1-loop conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.06643v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a geometric ideal triangulation for every fundamental shadow link complement and solve the gluing equation explicitly in terms of the logarithmic holonomies of the meridians of the link for any generic character in the distinguished component of the $\mathrm{PSL}(2;\mathbb{C})$-character variety of the link complement. As immediate applications, we obtain a new formula for the volume of a hyperideal tetrahedron in terms of its dihedral angles, and a formula for the volume of hyperbolic 3-manifolds obtained by doing Dehn-fillings to some of the boundary components of fundamental shadow link complements. Moreover, by using these ideal triangulations, we verify the 1-loop conjecture proposed by Dimofte and Garoufalidis for every fundamental shadow link complement. By using the result of Kalelkar-Schleimer-Segerman \cite{KSS}, we also prove the topological invariance of the 1-loop invariant and show that the 1-loop invariant satisfies a surgery formula. As a result, we prove the 1-loop conjecture for manifolds obtained by doing sufficiently long Dehn-fillings on boundary components of any fundamental shadow link complement. This verifies the 1-loop conjecture for a large class of hyperbolic 3-manifolds.</description>
