      <title>Combining physics-based and data-driven models: advancing the frontiers of research with Scientific Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) is a recently emerged research field which combines physics-based and data-driven models for the numerical approximation of differential problems. Physics-based models rely on the physical understanding of the problem at hand, subsequent mathematical formulation, and numerical approximation. Data-driven models instead aim to extract relations between input and output data without arguing any causality principle underlining the available data distribution. In recent years, data-driven models have been rapidly developed and popularized. Such a diffusion has been triggered by a huge availability of data (the so-called big data), an increasingly cheap computing power, and the development of powerful machine learning algorithms. SciML leverages the physical awareness of physics-based models and, at the same time, the efficiency of data-driven algorithms. With SciML, we can inject physics and mathematical knowledge into machine learning algorithms. Yet, we can rely on data-driven algorithms' capability to discover complex and non-linear patterns from data and improve the descriptive capacity of physics-based models. After recalling the mathematical foundations of digital modelling and machine learning algorithms, and presenting the most popular machine learning architectures, we discuss the great potential of a broad variety of SciML strategies in solving complex problems governed by partial differential equations. Finally, we illustrate the successful application of SciML to the simulation of the human cardiac function, a field of significant socio-economic importance that poses numerous challenges on both the mathematical and computational fronts. The corresponding mathematical model is a complex system of non-linear ordinary and partial differential equations describing the electromechanics, valve dynamics, blood circulation, perfusion in the coronary tree, and torso potential. Despite the robustness and accuracy of physics-based models, certain aspects, such as unveiling constitutive laws for cardiac cells and myocardial material properties, as well as devising efficient reduced order models to dominate the extraordinary computational complexity, have been successfully tackled by leveraging data-driven models.</description>

      <title>Preconditioning without a preconditioner: faster ridge-regression and Gaussian sampling with randomized block Krylov subspace methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a randomized variant of the block conjugate gradient method for solving a single positive-definite linear system of equations. Our method provably outperforms preconditioned conjugate gradient with a broad-class of Nystr\"om-based preconditioners, without ever explicitly constructing a preconditioner. In analyzing our algorithm, we derive theoretical guarantees for new variants of Nystr\"om preconditioned conjugate gradient which may be of separate interest. We also describe how our approach yields state-of-the-art algorithms for key data-science tasks such as computing the entire ridge regression regularization path and generating multiple independent samples from a high-dimensional Gaussian distribution.</description>

      <title>Simple numerical scheme for solving the impregnation equations in a porous pellet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a numerical scheme for solving a system of convection-reaction-diffusion equations describing the process of preparing a catalyst on a porous support by the impregnation method. In the case of a considered porous spherical pellet, the equations are defined on an interval, one end of which, associated with the front of the impregnating liquid, moves according to a given law. The law of front motion is used to create a consistent space-time grid for discretizing the system. Examples of numerical solutions of the impregnation problem are given, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.</description>

      <title>Polytopal discontinuous Galerkin methods for low-frequency poroelasticity coupled to unsteady Stokes flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We focus on the numerical analysis of a polygonal discontinuous Galerkin scheme for the simulation of the exchange of fluid between a deformable saturated poroelastic structure and an adjacent free-flow channel. We specifically address wave phenomena described by the low-frequency Biot model in the poroelastic region and unsteady Stokes flow in the open channel, possibly an isolated cavity or a connected fracture system. The coupling at the interface between the two regions is realized by means of transmission conditions expressing conservation laws. The spatial discretization hinges on the weak form of the two-displacement poroelasticity system and a stress formulation of the Stokes equation with weakly imposed symmetry. We present a complete stability analysis for the proposed semi-discrete formulation and derive a-priori hp-error estimates.</description>

      <title>Convergence of the micro-macro Parareal Method for a Linear Scale-Separated Ornstein-Uhlenbeck SDE: extended version</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-parallel methods can reduce the wall clock time required for the accurate numerical solution of differential equations by parallelizing across the time-dimension. In this paper, we present and test the convergence behavior of a multiscale, micro-macro version of a Parareal method for stochastic differential equations (SDEs). In our method, the fine propagator of the SDE is based on a high-dimensional slow-fast microscopic model; the coarse propagator is based on a model-reduced version of the latter, that captures the low-dimensional, effective dynamics at the slow time scales. We investigate how the model error of the approximate model influences the convergence of the micro-macro Parareal algorithm and we support our analysis with numerical experiments.

      <title>chebgreen: Learning and Interpolating Continuous Empirical Green's Functions from Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a mesh-independent, data-driven library, chebgreen, to mathematically model one-dimensional systems, possessing an associated control parameter, and whose governing partial differential equation is unknown. The proposed method learns an Empirical Green's Function for the associated, but hidden, boundary value problem, in the form of a Rational Neural Network from which we subsequently construct a bivariate representation in a Chebyshev basis. We uncover the Green's function, at an unseen control parameter value, by interpolating the left and right singular functions within a suitable library, expressed as points on a manifold of Quasimatrices, while the associated singular values are interpolated with Lagrange polynomials.</description>

      <title>A deterministic particle method for the porous media equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with the deterministic particle method for the equation of porous media (with p = 2). We establish a convergence rate in the Wasserstein-2 distance between the approximate solution of the associated nonlinear transport equation and the solution of the original one. This seems to be the first quantitative rate for diffusion-velocity particle methods solving diffusive equations and is achieved using a novel commutator estimate for the Wasserstein transport map.</description>

      <title>BCAT: A Block Causal Transformer for PDE Foundation Models for Fluid Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce BCAT, a PDE foundation model designed for autoregressive prediction of solutions to two dimensional fluid dynamics problems. Our approach uses a block causal transformer architecture to model next frame predictions, leveraging previous frames as contextual priors rather than relying solely on sub-frames or pixel-based inputs commonly used in image generation methods. This block causal framework more effectively captures the spatial dependencies inherent in nonlinear spatiotemporal dynamics and physical phenomena. In an ablation study, next frame prediction demonstrated a 2.9x accuracy improvement over next token prediction. BCAT is trained on a diverse range of fluid dynamics datasets, including incompressible and compressible Navier-Stokes equations across various geometries and parameter regimes, as well as the shallow-water equations. The model's performance was evaluated on 6 distinct downstream prediction tasks and tested on about 8K trajectories to measure robustness on a variety of fluid dynamics simulations. BCAT achieved an average relative error of 1.92% across all evaluation tasks, outperforming prior approaches on standard benchmarks.</description>

      <title>On the efficiency of explicit and semi-explicit immersed boundary finite element methods for wave propagation problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Immersed boundary methods have attracted substantial interest in the last decades due to their potential for computations involving complex geometries. Often these cannot be efficiently discretized using boundary-fitted finite elements. Immersed boundary methods provide a simple and fully automatic discretization based on Cartesian grids and tailored quadrature schemes that account for the geometric model. It can thus be described independently of the grid, e.g., by image data obtained from computed tomography scans. The drawback of such a discretization lies in the potentially small overlap between certain elements in the grid and the geometry. These badly cut elements with small physical support pose a particular challenge for nonlinear and/or dynamic simulations. In this work, we focus on problems in structural dynamics and acoustics and concentrate on solving them with explicit time-marching schemes. In this context, badly cut elements can lead to unfeasibly small critical time step sizes. We investigate the performance of implicit-explicit time marching schemes and two stabilization methods developed in previous works as potential remedies. While these have been studied before with regard to their effectiveness in increasing the critical time step size, their numerical efficiency has only been considered in terms of accuracy per degree of freedom. In this paper, we evaluate the computation time required for a given accuracy, which depends not only on the number of degrees of freedom but also on the selected spatial discretization, the sparsity patterns of the system matrices, and the employed time-marching scheme.</description>

      <title>A single-loop SPIDER-type stochastic subgradient method for expectation-constrained nonconvex nonsmooth optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many real-world problems, such as those with fairness constraints, involve complex expectation constraints and large datasets, necessitating the design of efficient stochastic methods to solve them. Most existing research focuses on cases with no {constraint} or easy-to-project constraints or deterministic constraints. In this paper, we consider nonconvex nonsmooth stochastic optimization problems with expectation constraints, for which we build a novel exact penalty model. We first show the relationship between the penalty model and the original problem. Then on solving the penalty problem, we present a single-loop SPIDER-type stochastic subgradient method, which utilizes the subgradients of both the objective and constraint functions, as well as the constraint function value at each iteration. Under certain regularity conditions (weaker than Slater-type constraint qualification or strong feasibility assumed in existing works), we establish an iteration complexity result of $O(\epsilon^{-4})$ to reach a near-$\epsilon$ stationary point of the penalized problem in expectation, matching the lower bound for such tasks. Building on the exact penalization, an $(\epsilon,\epsilon)$-KKT point of the original problem is obtained. For a few scenarios, our complexity of either the {objective} sample subgradient or the constraint sample function values can be lower than the state-of-the-art results by a factor of $\epsilon^{-2}$. Moreover, on solving two fairness-constrained problems, our method is significantly (up to 466 times) faster than the state-of-the-art algorithms, including switching subgradient method and inexact proximal point methods.</description>

Abstract: We formulate and analyze a multiscale method for an elliptic problem with an oscillatory coefficient based on a skeletal (hybrid) formulation. More precisely, we employ hybrid discontinuous Galerkin approaches and combine them with the localized orthogonal decomposition methodology to obtain a coarse-scale skeletal method that effectively includes fine-scale information. This work is the first step in reliably merging hybrid skeletal formulations and localized orthogonal decomposition to unite the advantages of both strategies. Numerical experiments are presented to illustrate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Nearly Optimal Approximation Rates for Deep Super ReLU Networks on Sobolev Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10766v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces deep super ReLU networks (DSRNs) as a method for approximating functions in Sobolev spaces measured by Sobolev norms $W^{m,p}$ for $m\in\mathbb{N}$ with $m\ge 2$ and $1\le p\le +\infty$. Standard ReLU deep neural networks (ReLU DNNs) cannot achieve this goal. DSRNs consist primarily of ReLU DNNs, and several layers of the square of ReLU added at the end to smooth the networks output. This approach retains the advantages of ReLU DNNs, leading to the straightforward training. The paper also proves the optimality of DSRNs by estimating the VC-dimension of higher-order derivatives of DNNs, and obtains the generalization error in Sobolev spaces via an estimate of the pseudo-dimension of higher-order derivatives of DNNs.</description>

      <title>On the recovery of two function-valued coefficients in the Helmholtz equation for inverse scattering problems via neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01041v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, deep neural networks (DNNs) have become powerful tools for solving inverse scattering problems. However, the approximation and generalization rates of DNNs for solving these problems remain largely under-explored. In this work, we introduce two types of combined DNNs (uncompressed and compressed) to reconstruct {two function-valued coefficients} in the Helmholtz equation for inverse scattering problems from the scattering data at two different frequencies. An analysis of the approximation and generalization capabilities of the proposed neural networks for simulating the regularized pseudo-inverses of the linearized forward operators in direct scattering problems is provided. The results show that, with sufficient training data and parameters, the proposed neural networks can effectively approximate the inverse process with desirable generalization. Preliminary numerical results show the feasibility of the proposed neural networks for recovering two types of isotropic inhomogeneous media. Furthermore, the trained neural network is capable of reconstructing the isotropic representation of certain types of anisotropic media.</description>

      <title>Variational Multiscale Evolve and Filter Strategies for Convection-Dominated Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The evolve-filter (EF) model is a filter-based numerical stabilization for under-resolved convection-dominated flows. EF is a simple, modular, and effective strategy for both full-order models (FOMs) and reduced-order models (ROMs). It is well-known, however, that when the filter radius is too large, EF can be overdiffusive and yield inaccurate results. To alleviate this, EF is usually supplemented with a relaxation step. The relaxation parameter, however, is very sensitive with respect to the model parameters. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy to alleviate the EF overdiffusivity for a large filter radius. Specifically, we leverage the variational multiscale (VMS) framework to separate the large resolved scales from the small resolved scales in the evolved velocity, and we use the filtered small scales to correct the large scales. Furthermore, in the new VMS-EF strategy, we use two different ways to decompose the evolved velocity: the VMS Evolve-Filter-Filter-Correct (VMS-EFFC) and the VMS Evolve-Postprocess-Filter-Correct (VMS-EPFC) algorithms. The new VMS-based algorithms yield significantly more accurate results than the standard EF in both the FOM and the ROM simulations of a flow past a cylinder at Reynolds number Re = 1000.</description>

      <title>On orthogonality sampling method for Maxwell's equations and its applications to experimental data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11825v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the inverse scattering problem for Maxwell's equations. We first show that a bianisotropic scatterer can be uniquely determined from multi-static far-field data through the factorization analysis of the far-field operator. Next, we investigate a modified version of the orthogonality sampling method, as proposed in Le [2022 Inverse Problems 38 025007], for the numerical reconstruction of the scatterer. Finally, we apply this sampling method to invert unprocessed 3D experimental data obtained from the Fresnel Institute. Numerical examples with synthetic scattering data for bianisotropic targets are also presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.</description>

      <title>The Numerical Approximation of Caputo Fractional Derivative of Higher Orders Using A Shifted Gegenbauer Pseudospectral Method: Two-Point Boundary Value Problems of the Bagley Torvik Type Case Study</title>

Abstract: This work presents a new framework for approximating Caputo fractional derivatives (FDs) of any positive order using a shifted Gegenbauer pseudospectral (SGPS) method. By transforming the Caputo FD into a scaled integral of the $m$th-derivative of the Lagrange interpolating polynomial (with $m$ being the ceiling of the fractional order $\alpha$), we mitigate the singularity near zero, improving stability and accuracy. The method links $m$th-derivatives of shifted Gegenbauer (SG) polynomials with SG polynomials of lower degrees, allowing for precise integration using SG quadratures. We employ orthogonal collocation and SG quadratures in barycentric form to obtain an accurate and efficient approach for solving fractional differential equations. We provide error analysis showing that the SGPS method is convergent in a semi-analytic framework and conditionally convergent with exponential rate for smooth functions in finite-precision arithmetic. This exponential convergence improves accuracy compared to wavelet-based, operational matrix, and finite difference methods. The SGPS method is flexible, with adjustable SG parameters for optimal performance. A key contribution is the fractional SG integration matrix (FSGIM), which enables efficient computation of Caputo FDs via matrix-vector multiplications and accelerates the SGPS method through pre-computation and storage. The method remains within double-precision limits, making it computationally efficient. It handles any positive fractional order $\alpha$ and outperforms existing schemes in solving Caputo fractional two-point boundary value problems (TPBVPs) of the Bagley-Torvik type.</description>

      <title>Port-Hamiltonian Realizations of Nonminimal Linear Time Invariant Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.05355v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The question when a general linear time invariant control system is equivalent to a port-Hamiltonian system is answered. Several equivalent characterizations are derived which extend the characterizations of Willems to the general non-minimal case and to the case where the feedthrough term does not have an invertible symmetric part. An explicit construction of the transformation matrices is presented in terms of the computation of invariant subspaces of even matrix pencils. {\color{black} This construction includes the potential of incorporating a perturbation to a nearby port-Hamiltonian system, when such a transformation does not otherwise exist.} Results are illustrated via numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Wellposedness, exponential ergodicity and numerical approximation of fully super-linear McKean--Vlasov SDEs and associated particle systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.05133v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a class of McKean--Vlasov Stochastic Differential Equations (MV-SDEs) with drifts and diffusions having super-linear growth in measure and space -- the maps have general polynomial form but also satisfy a certain monotonicity condition. The combination of the drift's super-linear growth in measure (by way of a convolution) and the super-linear growth in space and measure of the diffusion coefficient requires novel technical elements in order to obtain the main results. We establish wellposedness, propagation of chaos (PoC), and under further assumptions on the model parameters, we show an exponential ergodicity property alongside the existence of an invariant distribution. No differentiability or non-degeneracy conditions are required.
  Further, we present a particle system based Euler-type split-step scheme (SSM) for the simulation of this type of MV-SDEs. The scheme attains, in stepsize, the strong error rate $1/2$ in the non-path-space root-mean-square error metric and we demonstrate the property of mean-square contraction. Our results are illustrated by numerical examples including: estimation of PoC rates across dimensions, preservation of periodic phase-space, and the observation that taming appears to be not a suitable method unless strong dissipativity is present.</description>

      <title>Hutchinson's Estimator is Bad at Kronecker-Trace-Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04952v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of estimating the trace of a matrix $\mathbf{A}$ that can only be accessed through Kronecker-matrix-vector products. That is, for any Kronecker-structured vector $\mathrm{x} = \otimes_{i=1}^k \mathrm{x}_i$, we can compute $\mathbf{A}\mathrm{x}$. We focus on the natural generalization of Hutchinson's Estimator to this setting, proving tight rates for the number of matrix-vector products this estimator needs to find a $(1\pm\varepsilon)$ approximation to the trace of $\mathbf{A}$.
  We find an exact equation for the variance of the estimator when using a Kronecker of Gaussian vectors, revealing an intimate relationship between Hutchinson's Estimator, the partial trace operator, and the partial transpose operator. Using this equation, we show that when using real vectors, in the worst case, this estimator needs $O(\frac{3^k}{\varepsilon^2})$ products to recover a $(1\pm\varepsilon)$ approximation of the trace of any PSD $\mathbf{A}$, and a matching lower bound for certain PSD $\mathbf{A}$. However, when using complex vectors, this can be exponentially improved to $\Theta(\frac{2^k}{\varepsilon^2})$. Further, if the $\mathrm{x}_i$ vectors are low-dimensional and if we instead build $\mathrm{x}$ as the Kronecker product of (scaled) random unit vectors on the complex sphere, then as few as $\frac{1.33^k}{\varepsilon^2}$ samples suffice. We show that Hutchinson's Estimator converges slowest when $\mathbf{A}$ itself also has Kronecker structure. We conclude with some theoretical evidence suggesting that, by combining Hutchinson's Estimator with other techniques, it may be possible to avoid the exponential dependence on $k$.</description>

      <title>Structure-preserving quantum algorithms for linear and nonlinear Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03599v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hamiltonian systems of ordinary and partial differential equations are fundamental across modern science and engineering, appearing in models that span virtually all physical scales. A critical property for the robustness and stability of computational methods in such systems is the symplectic structure, which preserves geometric properties like phase-space volume over time and energy conservation over an extended period. In this paper, we present quantum algorithms that incorporate symplectic integrators, ensuring the preservation of this key structure. We demonstrate how these algorithms maintain the symplectic properties for both linear and nonlinear Hamiltonian systems. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the computational complexity, showing that our approach offers both accuracy and improved efficiency over classical algorithms. These results highlight the potential application of quantum algorithms for solving large-scale Hamiltonian systems while preserving essential physical properties.</description>
