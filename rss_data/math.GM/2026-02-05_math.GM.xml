      <title>Some Stability Results on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The primary objective of this paper is to introduce Hyers-Ulam-type stability results for monotone, subadditive, and convex graphs. We consider their standard definitions in an approximate sense and demonstrate the existence of a corresponding graph with the same vertex and edge sets bearing the exact ideal structural property. We prove that the weight difference on the two graphs depends on the associated error and does not vary significantly.</description>

      <title>Pulse waves in the viscoelastic Kelvin-Voigt model: a revisited approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the mechanical response $r(x,t$) of an initially quiescent semi-infinite homogeneous medium to a pulse applied at the origin, and this is achieved within the framework of the Kelvin-Voigt model. Although this problem has been extensively studied in the literature because of its wide range of applications -- particularly in seismology -- here, we present a solution in a novel integral form. This integral solution avoids the numerical computation of the solution in terms of the inverse Laplace transform; that is, numerical integration in the complex plane. In particular, we derive integral form expressions for both delta-pulse and step-pulse excitations which are simpler and more computationally efficient than those previously reported in the literature. Furthermore, the obtained expressions allow us to obtain simple asymptotic formulas for $r(x,t$ as $x,t \to 0,\infty$ for both step- and delta-type pulses.</description>

      <title>Frequency Sensitive Duplicate Detection Using Multi-Metric Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical metric spaces often fail to model data-intensive systems where repetition and frequency of values are meaningful. In applications such as transactional databases, sensor logs, and record linkage, conventional distance measures ignore multiplicity information, leading to information loss and incorrect similarity judgments. This paper introduces multi-metric spaces defined on multisets and valued in the multi-real number system, providing a principled way to incorporate frequency into distance computations. We demonstrate the usefulness of multi-metrics through a frequency sensitive duplicate detection example, showing improved accuracy over classical metric based approaches.</description>

      <title>On Extremal Family Trees $(\mathcal{T}_n)_{n\geqslant 3}$ Beyond Caterpillars and Greedy Constructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates topological indices for the greedy tree $\mathcal{T}_\mathscr{D}$ associated with a graphic degree sequence $\mathscr{D} = (d_1 \geqslant d_2 \geqslant \dots \geqslant d_n)$ of a tree. A fundamental challenge in the study of topological indices lies in establishing precise bounds, as such findings illuminate intrinsic relationships among diverse indices. We investigate the extremal properties of the graph invariant $\sigma$ over the family $\mathcal{T}_n$ of all trees on $n \ge 3$ vertices. Specifically, we compare the minimum values of $\sigma$ attained in restricted subclasses -- including caterpillar trees and greedy trees -- with the global minimum over $\mathcal{T}_n$. We prove that caterpillar trees do not achieve the minimum value of $\sigma$ among all trees, whereas greedy trees attain values no smaller than this global minimum. Moreover, we show that certain trees, which are neither caterpillars nor greedy trees, have $\sigma$-values strictly between the global minimum over $\mathcal{T}_n$ and the minimum among caterpillar trees. These results highlight structural limitations of these common tree classes in extremal problems and offer new insights into the role of non-caterpillar, non-greedy trees in minimizing graph invariants.</description>

      <title>Some Geometric Properties of the Yff Points of a Triangle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Yff points of a triangle were introduced by Peter Yff in 1963. Since then, very few new facts have been discovered about these points. We present some geometrical properties of the Yff points of various shaped triangles which were discovered and proved by computer.</description>
