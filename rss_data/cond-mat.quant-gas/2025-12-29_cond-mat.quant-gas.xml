      <title>Bethe-ansatz study of the Bose-Fermi mixture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a one-dimensional mixture of bosons and spinless fermions with contact interactions. In this system, the excitations at low energies are described by four linearly dispersing modes characterized by two excitation velocities. Here we study the velocities in a system with equal interaction strengths and equal masses of bosons and fermions. The resulting model is integrable and admits an exact Bethe-ansatz solution. We analyze it and analytically derive various exact results, which include the Drude weight matrix. We show that the excitation velocities can be calculated from the knowledge of the matrices of compressibility and the Drude weights, as their squares are the eigenvalues of the product of the two matrices. The elements of the Drude weight matrix obey certain sum rules as a consequence of Galilean invariance. Our results are consistent with the presence of a momentum-momentum coupling term between the two subsystems of bosons and fermions in the effective low-energy Hamiltonian. The analytical method developed in the present study can be extended to other models that possess a nested Bethe-ansatz structure.</description>

      <title>Effect of Population Imbalance on Vortex Mass in Superfluid Fermi Gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the fundamental parameters associated with quantized vortices in superfluids is the vortex mass, which is the inertia of a vortex. As of yet, this mass has not been observed in a superfluid. However, ultracold Fermi gases provide a promising platform in which recently much experimental progress was made, offering tunability of the interaction as well as control on the single-vortex level. Not only can the scattering length be freely tuned, allowing exploration of the BEC-BCS crossover, but also an imbalance between different pseudospin states can be introduced. We study the effect of introducing this imbalance on the vortex mass, using a method based on an effective field theory for superfluid Fermi gases. We find that it is crucial to consider the imbalance in conjunction with nonzero temperatures; at some temperatures, the vortex mass is significantly enhanced while at others, the vortex mass is diminished. This pronounced temperature dependence highlights the need for careful tuning of experimental conditions and identifies favorable parameter regimes in which the vortex mass is likely to be observed.</description>

      <title>Bose polarons as relativistic Unruh-DeWitt detectors: Entanglement harvesting from Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that a bound impurity in a Bose-Einstein condensate can be directly mapped to an Unruh-DeWitt detector interacting with a relativistic quantum field. We provide explicit experimental parameters for an implementation using ${}^{39}\text{K}$ impurities coupled to a ${}^{87}\text{Rb}$ condensate via finite-time Feshbach tuning. As an application, we study the extraction of vacuum entanglement from distant regions of the condensate and find viable parameters for the implementation of entanglement harvesting.</description>

      <title>Hybrid digital-analog protocols for simulating quantum multi-body interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While quantum simulators promise to explore quantum many-body physics beyond classical computation, their capabilities are limited by the available native interactions in the hardware. On many platforms, accessible Hamiltonians are largely restricted to one- and two-body interactions, limiting access to multi-body Hamiltonians and to systems governed by simultaneous, non-commuting interaction terms that are central to condensed matter, quantum chemistry, and high-energy physics. We introduce and experimentally demonstrate a hybrid digital-analog protocol that overcomes these limitations by embedding analog evolution between shallow entangling-gate layers. This method produces effective Hamiltonians with simultaneous non-commuting three- and four-body interactions that are generated non-perturbatively and without Trotter error -- capabilities not practically attainable on near-term hardware using purely digital or purely analog schemes. We implement our scheme on a trapped-ion quantum processor and use it to realize a topological spin chain exhibiting prethermal strong zero modes persisting at high temperature, as well as models featuring three- and four-body interactions. Our hardware-agnostic and scalable method opens new routes to realizing complex many-body physics across quantum platforms.</description>

      <title>High-Temperature Quantum Oscillations of a Non-equilibrium Non-Fermi Liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A periodically driven Fermi gas coupled to a simple boson bath reaches a non-equilibrium steady-state occupation with sharp non-analyticities at certain momenta. Here, we demonstrate that these non-analyticities behave as emergent Fermi surfaces by showing that they give rise to quantum oscillations of observables with a period controlled by the effective Fermi surface area enclosed by these non-analyticities. However, these oscillations have several striking differences with standard equilibrium quantum oscillations. For example, they remain non-analytic at finite temperatures, their amplitude can survive up to extremely high temperatures comparable to the frequency of the drive, and they can display non-monotonic temperature dependence completely at odds with standard Lifshits-Kosevich behavior.</description>

      <title>Quantum Breakdown Condensate as a Disorder-Free Quantum Glass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the phase diagram of a one-dimensional spin quantum breakdown model, which has an exponential $U(1)$ symmetry with charge unit decaying as $2^{-j}$ with site position $j$. By exact diagonalization (ED), we show that the model with spin $S\ge2$ exhibits an exponential $U(1)$ spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) phase dubbed a quantum breakdown condensate. It exhibits a bulk gap violating the Goldstone theorem, and an edge mode only on the left edge if in open boundary condition. In a length $L$ lattice, the condensate has $\mathcal{O}(2^L)$ number of SSB ground states originating from the $\mathcal{O}(2^L)$ number of exponential $U(1)$ charge sectors, leading to a finite entropy density $\ln 2$. This enforces a first order SSB phase transition into this phase, as observed in ED and verified in the large $S$ limit on an exactly solvable Rokhsar-Kivelson line. The condensate has an SSB order parameter being the local in-plane spin, which points in angles related by the chaotic Bernoulli (dyadic) map and thus is effectively random. Moreover, we show the condensate exhibits non-decaying local autocorrelations, and does not have an off-diagonal long-range order. The quantum breakdown condensate thus behaves as a disorder-free quantum glass and is beyond the existing classifications of phases of matter.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectricity in magnon Bose-Einstein condensate: non-reciprocal superfluidity, exceptional points and Majorana bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a ferroelectric instability of a magnon Bose-Einstein condensate, mediated by its interaction with an electric field through a geometric Aharonov-Casher (AC) phase. A distinct feature of the system is the positive feedback loop in which an electric field induces magnon orbital motion via the AC phase, generating electric polarization that in turn enhances the original field. Based on bosonic Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) mean-field theory, we show that this feedback drives a spontaneous ferroelectric transition in the magnon superfluid, accompanied by a persistent magnon supercurrent. In the resulting ferroelectric phase, the quasiparticle excitation spectrum becomes nonreciprocal, reflecting spontaneous breaking of spatial inversion symmetry. At the critical point of the transition, the bosonic BdG Hamiltonian exhibits coalescence of both eigenvalues and eigenvectors, forming an exceptional point. The corresponding eigenvector is an equally weighted superposition of bosonic quasiparticle and quasihole states and is invariant under particle-hole transformation, allowing it to be interpreted as a bosonic analog of a Majorana fermion.</description>

      <title>General Construction of Quantum Error-Correcting Codes from Multiple Classical Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hypergraph product (HGP) construction of quantum error-correcting codes (QECC) offers a general and explicit method for building a QECC from two classical codes, thereby paving the way for the discovery of good quantum low-density parity-check codes. In this letter, we propose a general and explicit construction recipe for QECCs from a total of D classical codes for arbitrary D. Following this recipe guarantees the obtainment of a QECC within the stabilizer formalism and nearly exhausts all possible constructions. As examples, we demonstrate that our construction recovers the HGP construction when D = 2 and leads to four distinct types of constructions for D = 3, including a previously studied case as one of them. When the input classical codes are repetition codes, our D = 3 constructions unify various three-dimensional lattice models into a single framework, encompassing the three-dimensional toric code model, a fracton model, and two other intriguing models not previously investigated. Among these, two types of constructions exhibit a trade-off between code distance and code dimension for a fixed number of qubits by adjusting the lengths of the different classical codes, and the optimal choice can simultaneously achieve relatively large values for both code distance and code dimension. Our general construction protocol provides another perspective for enriching the structure of QECCs and enables the exploration of richer possibilities for good codes.</description>

      <title>Spin-Depairing-Induced Exceptional Fermionic Superfluidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19525v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the non-Hermitian (NH) attractive Hubbard model with spin depairing, which is a spin-resolved asymmetric hopping that nonreciprocally operates spins in the opposite direction. We find that spin depairing stabilizes a superfluid state unique to the NH system. This phase is characterized not only by a finite order parameter, but also by the emergence of exceptional points (EPs) in the momentum space - a feature that starkly contrasts with previously discussed NH fermionic superfluidity, where EPs are absent within the superfluid state and emerge only at the onset of the superfluid breakdown. We uncover the rich mechanism underlying this ``exceptional fermionic superfluidity'' by analyzing the interplay between EPs and the effective density of states of the complex energy dispersion. Furthermore, we reveal that the exceptional superfluid state breaks down induced by strong spin depairing on the cubic lattice, while it remains robust on the square lattice.</description>

      <title>Structure of the mean-field yrast spectrum of a two-component Bose gas in a ring: role of interaction asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16756v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mean-field yrast spectrum of an SU(2)-symmetric two-component Bose gas confined to a ring geometry is known to exhibit an intricate nonanalytic structure that is absent in single-component systems. In particular, due to the interplay between the species concentration and the atomic interactions, a sequence of plane-wave states can emerge as yrast states at fractional values of the angular momentum per particle. This behavior stands in sharp contrast to the single-component case, where plane-wave states occur only at integer angular momenta. In this paper, we investigate how the structure of the yrast spectrum in a two-component Bose gas is modified by interaction asymmetry. By numerically solving the coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations for propagating soliton states, we compute the mean-field yrast spectrum and, in particular, determine the critical curves associated with the emergence of various plane-wave yrast states. We find that both the behavior of these critical curves and the mechanisms by which plane-wave yrast states arise depend sensitively on the relative strengths of the inter- and intra-component interactions. When the inter-component interaction is weaker, the plane-wave yrast states replace soliton states through a continuous evolution, as in the SU(2)-symmetric case, although the conditions for their existence become more restrictive. In contrast, when the inter-component interaction is stronger, plane-wave yrast states emerge by overtaking soliton states via branch crossings, and their stability is significantly enhanced. Our results have important implications for the existence and stability of persistent currents in asymmetric, two-component Bose gases.</description>

      <title>Multicritical quantum sensors driven by symmetry-breaking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum criticality has been demonstrated as a useful quantum resource for parameter estimation. This includes second-order, topological and localization transitions. In all these works reported so far, gap-to-gapless transition at criticality has been identified as a crucial resource for achieving the quantum-enhanced sensing, although there are several important concepts associated with criticality, such as long-range correlation, symmetry breaking. In this work, we show that symmetry-breaking alone can drive a quantum-enhanced sensing, even without any gap-to-gapless transition. We analytically demonstrate that the estimation of the superconducting pairing amplitude in the one-dimensional Kitaev model achieves Heisenberg scaling when the system is prepared near a multicritical point and is varied along a gapless critical line, implying symmetry breaking as a standalone metrological resource. Extending our analysis in the realm of simultaneous multiparameter estimation of both the pairing term and the chemical potential, we show that it is possible to obtain $L^6$ scaling in a narrow parameter range, but with definite observable consequence, where the quantum advantage is assisted by gap-to-gapless transition as well. Our work thus identifies a new resource for criticality-enhanced quantum sensing, and also suggests multicritical systems as useful platform for multiparameter sensing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03534v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a dissipative lattice gauge model that exhibits the many-body version of the non-Hermitian skin effect. The dissipative couplings between dynamical gauge fields on the lattice links and the surrounding environment generate chiral motions of particles residing on lattice sites. Despite the complexity arising from many-body interactions, the local gauge symmetry enables the exact construction of a steady state that displays the many-body non-Hermitian skin effect. Furthermore, our approach can be generalized to realize a new type of many-body non-Hermitian skin effect, dubbed the hierarchical skin effect, where different subsystem degrees of freedom exhibit boundary accumulation of multiple moments at different orders. Our findings can be readily observed by engineering dissipation in state-of-the-art lattice gauge simulators.</description>

      <title>Generalized pulse design in Floquet engineering: Application to interacting spin systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20154v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Floquet engineering in quantum simulation employs externally applied high-frequency pulses to dynamically design steady-state effective Hamiltonians. Such protocols can be used to enlarge the space of Hamiltonians but approximations often limit pulse profile shapes and therefore the space of available effective Hamiltonians. We consider a nonstroboscopic high-frequency expansion formalism for Floquet engineering. We generalize the pulse profiles available by rigorously keeping all necessary terms to lowest order in inverse frequency expansions used to derive the effective Hamiltonians. Our approach allows wide tunability in application of external driving fields. We apply our method to long-range interacting XXZ spin Hamiltonians. We model an example application where we derive conditions on specific pulse shapes to engineer effective Ising models from XXZ models. Our method allows the space of continuous pulse profiles, relevant to experimental control fields, to better and more accurately explore possible effective Hamiltonians available for Floquet engineering.</description>
