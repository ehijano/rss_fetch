      <title>Chiral effects on radiation and energy loss in quark-gluon plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergent axion excitations in the quark-gluon plasma are generated by the sphaleron transitions. Their interactions with the photon and gluon fields are governed by the axion electro- and chromodynamics respectively. We discuss the effect of the emergent axion on the photon production and energy loss in the quark-gluon plasma. In particular, we review the Chiral Cherenkov effect, and the impact of the chiral anomaly on bremsstrahlung.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian Domain Walls and Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of domain walls arising from non-Abelian discrete symmetries, which we refer to as non-Abelian domain walls. We focus on $S_4$, one of the most commonly used groups in lepton flavour mixing models. The spontaneous breaking of $S_4$ leads to distinct vacua preserving a residual $Z_2$ or $Z_3$ symmetry. Five types of domain walls are found, labelled as SI, SII, TI, TII, and TIII, respectively, the former two separating $Z_2$ vacua and the latter three separating $Z_3$ vacua. We highlight that SI, TI and TIII may be unstable for some regions of the parameter space and decay to stable domain walls. Stable domain walls can collapse and release gravitational radiation for a suitable size of explicit symmetry breaking. A symmetry-breaking scale of order 100 TeV may explain the recent discovery of nanohertz gravitational waves by PTA experiments. For the first time, we investigate the properties of these domain walls, which we obtain numerically with semi-analytical formulas applied to compute the tension and thickness across a wide range of parameter space. We estimate the resulting gravitational wave spectrum and find that, thanks to their rich vacuum structure, non-Abelian domain walls manifest in a very interesting and complex phenomenology.</description>

      <title>On the CP Properties of Spin-0 Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aiming to uncover the CP properties of spin-0 particle Dark Matter (DM), we explore a two-component DM scenario within the framework of 3-Higgs Doublet Models (3HDMs), a well-motivated set-up previously studied due to the complementarity of its collider and astrophysical probes. We devise benchmark points in which the two components of DM have same CP in one case and opposite CP in another. We then show several cross section distributions of observables at collider experiments where the two cases are clearly distinguishable.</description>

      <title>Threshold resummation for $Z$-boson pair production at NNLO+NNLL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The production of a pair of on-shell $Z$-bosons is an important process at the Large Hadron Collider. Owing to its large production cross section at the LHC, this process is very useful for SM precision studies, electroweak symmetry breaking sector as well as to unravel the possible new physics. In this work, we have performed the threshold resummation of the large logarithms that arise in the partonic threshold limit $z \to 1$, up to Next-to-Next-to-Leading Logarithmic (NNLL) accuracy. The presence of the two-loop contributions in the process dependent resummation coefficient $g_0$ makes the numerical computation a non-trivial task. After matching the resummed predictions to the Next-to-Next-to-Leading order (NNLO) fixed order results, we present the invariant mass distribution to NNLO+NNLL accuracy in QCD for the current LHC energies. We find that in the high invariant mass region ($Q=1$ TeV), while the NNLO corrections are as large as $83\%$ with respect to the leading order, the NNLL contribution enhances the cross section by additional few percent, about $4\%$ for $13.6$ TeV LHC. In this invariant mass region, the conventional scale uncertainties in the fixed order results get reduced from $3.4\%$ at NNLO to about $2.6\%$ at NNLO+NNLL, and this reduction is expected to be more for higher $Q$ values.</description>

      <title>KrkNLO matching for colour-singlet processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matched calculations combining perturbative QCD with parton showers are an indispensable tool for LHC physics. Two methods for NLO matching are in widespread use: MC@NLO and POWHEG. We describe an alternative, KrkNLO, reformulated to be easily applicable to any colour-singlet process. The primary distinguishing characteristic of KrkNLO is its use of an alternative factorisation scheme, the 'Krk' scheme, to achieve NLO accuracy. We describe the general implementation of KrkNLO in Herwig 7, using diphoton production as a test process. We systematically compare its predictions to those produced by MC@NLO with several different choices of shower scale, both truncated to one-emission and with the shower running to completion, and to ATLAS data from LHC Run 2.</description>

      <title>Radioactivity of Quark Nuggets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quark nuggets $^A_ZQ$, as Fermionic non-topological solitons, could have their mass per baryon smaller than ordinary nuclei and behave as exotic nuclei with different relations of atomic number and atomic mass number. Using both the degenerate Fermi gas model and the Friedberg-Lee shell model, we calculate the properties of quark nuggets made of up and down quarks. Similar to ordinary nuclei, quark nuggets could exhibit their own radioactivity, including gamma decay, beta decay, and (explosive) spontaneous fission, with the qualitative properties presented here. These quark nugget properties may provide guidance for searching for quark nuggets in situ from binary neutron star mergers.</description>

      <title>Disoriented isospin condensates in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anomalous neutral to charged kaon correlations measured by the ALICE collaboration have defied usual explanations. We propose that the large fluctuations could arise because of a disoriented isospin condensate where there is an imbalance between up and down condensates at the time kaons hadronize. This could happen in heavy-ion collisions when the quark condensate re-forms as the system cools and the approximate chiral symmetry of QCD is broken. Within the linear sigma model, we show that the energy cost of forming a disoriented isospin condensate is small making it very plausible.</description>

      <title>Spinodal decomposition in Bjorken flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The QCD first-order phase transition at large baryon densities is expected to proceed by spinodal decomposition. This spinodal phase is likely to leave its signatures on the experimental observables measured in heavy-ion collision experiments. Identifying these signatures requires phenomenological models integrating surface effects resulting from the phase transition into the hydrodynamical description of the expanding quark gluon plasma. We write the equations of relativistic hydrodynamics with spinodal decomposition and solve it in on a background of Bjorken flow relevant for heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Single Production of Doubly Charged Higgs at Muon Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the single production of doubly charged Higgs $H^{\pm\pm}$ in the type-II seesaw at the high energy muon collider. Compared with the pair production channel $\mu^+\mu^-\to H^{++} H^{--}$, the single production channel $\mu^+\mu^-\to \mu^\mp\ell^\mp H^{\pm\pm}$ in principle could probe the mass region above the threshold $m_{H^{\pm\pm}}&gt;\sqrt{s}/2$. The single production channel depends on the Yukawa coupling $h$, which is related to the neutrino oscillation parameters. We show that the Majorana phases $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$ have great impact on the individual cross section of the single production. We find that the same sign dilepton signature from $H^{\pm\pm}\to \ell^\pm\ell^\pm$ could probe $m_{H^{\pm\pm}}\lesssim2.6(7.1)$ TeV at the 3 (10) TeV muon collider when the triplet VEV $v_\Delta\lesssim3$ eV.</description>

      <title>Lepton-flavor violation in the left-right supersymmetric standard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Standard Model (SM), the charged lepton-flavor violation (CLFV) processes are forbidden, so the observation of CLFV represents a clear signal of new physics that goes beyond the Standard Model. In this work, we focus on the CLFV processes $l_{j}^{-}\to l_{i}^{-}\gamma $ and $l_{j}^{-}\to l_{i}^{-}l_{i}^{-}l_{i}^{+}$ in LRSSM. Considering the constraints of the updated experimental datas, the numerical results show that the new contributions of $SU{{\left( 2 \right)}_{R}}$ gauge interaction and a large number of other new particles, such as ${{Z}^{'}}$ boson, double-charged Higgs-bosons in LRSSM can make significant contributions to the CLFV processes $l_{j}^{-}\to l_{i}^{-}\gamma $ and $l_{j}^{-}\to l_{i}^{-}l_{i}^{-}l_{i}^{+}$, which is much different from the ones predicted in other SUSY models. This work provide a theoretical base for finding the LFV phenomena in new physics.</description>

      <title>Determination of the $K^{+}\bar{K}^{0}$ scattering length and effective range and its relation to the $a_{0}^{+}(980)$ from the $\chi_{c1}\to\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\eta$ reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the clean cusp, seen in the $\eta \pi$ mass distribution with high precision of the $\chi_{c1} \to \eta \pi^+ \pi^-$ reaction in the BESIII experiment, with the aim of making a precise determination of the scattering length $a$ and effective range $r_0$ of $K^+ \bar{K}^{0}$. For that, we follow a previous theoretical work that gave a good reproduction of these data using the chiral unitary approach for the meson-meson interaction, and allow some flexibility in the input to carry a better fit to the data. The important task of determining the uncertainties in the scattering parameters is done using the resampling method and an accuracy in $a$ and $r_0$ is obtained better than $20\%$. The effective range is determined for the first time with this analysis.</description>

      <title>Inclusive and diffractive neutrino-nucleus scattering at high energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the energy dependence of inclusive and diffractive neutrino-nucleus deep-inelastic scattering cross sections within the dipole picture, focusing on the ultra-high-energy regime. We predict an up to $\sim 10\%$ nuclear suppression in the inclusive neutrino-Oxygen scattering originating from the non-linear QCD dynamics in the small-$x$ Balitsky-Kovchegov evolution. Diffraction is found to be a small $1\dots 4\%$ contribution to the total cross section across a wide range of neutrino energies relevant for current and near-future experiments. The diffractive cross section is calculated separately for the coherent and incoherent channels that are found to be of equal importance. Additionally, we include the dominant contribution from the $|q\bar q g\rangle$ Fock state of the $W^\pm$ and $Z$ bosons in the high-$Q^2$ limit, along with the lowest-order $|q\bar q\rangle$ contribution. The $|q\bar{q}g\rangle$ contribution is found to be numerically significant, reaching up to 40\% of the diffractive cross section.</description>

      <title>From angular coefficients to quantum observables: a phenomenological appraisal in di-boson systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the growing interest in accessing the spin structure of multi-boson processes and in measuring quantum entanglement at high energies, we study polarisation and spin-correlation coefficients in di-boson systems. We show that higher-order corrections of QCD and electroweak type, off-shell modelling, and realistic effects such as fiducial selections and neutrino reconstruction are unavoidable to properly determine such coefficients, and consequently to provide a sound interpretation of observables sensitive to quantum entanglement and Bell-inequality violation. Our findings are based on a detailed phenomenological analysis of boson pairs at the LHC, either in inclusive electroweak production or coming from Higgs-boson decays.</description>

      <title>Lectures on scattering theory in partial-wave amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These lectures treat scattering theory from a non-perturbative point of view. The course begins with a review of formal aspects in scattering theory, discussing the in/out states and the $S$ matrix that connects them. Unitarity relations, phase space, and the Lippmann-Schwinger equation for the $T$ matrix are discussed. The calculation of cross sections, the optical theorem and Boltzmann $H$-theorem from unitarity of the $S$ matrix are also explained. Special emphasis is given to expansions in partial-wave amplitudes of two-body scattering amplitudes, both for massive and massless particles, and to unitarity in partial-wave amplitudes. In this way, partial-wave expansions in terms of $\ell SJ$ states, and using helicity states with definite total angular momentum $J$ are discussed. Crossing symmetry is also explained, and connected to crossed channels, analyticity and crossed-channel cuts in partial-wave amplitudes. Different non-perturbative techniques and general parameterizations are developed for partial-wave amplitudes that satisfy unitarity and are consistent with the analyticity properties that they must have. Then, the $N/D$ method and additional solutions generated by adding CDD poles are covered in detail. The change to different non-physical Riemann sheets and the search for resonant poles is discussed as well. A differentiation is made between dynamically generated resonances by the degrees of freedom explicitly accounted for versus pre-existing resonances derived from short-distance dynamics. We exemplify it with the cases of the $\sigma/f_0(500)$ and the $\rho(770)$ resonances in $\pi\pi$ scattering. The reader is also introduced to final-state interactions, Watson's theorem, and general parameterizations to take them into account. It ends with an appendix dedicated to the Sugawara-Kanazawa theorem regarding the number of subtractions in dispersion relations.</description>

      <title>Correlative study of flavor anomalies and dark matter in the light of scalar leptoquark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore $U(1)_{L_e-L_\mu}$ gauge extension of the Standard Model with particle content enlarged by three neutral fermions, of which the lightest one contributes to dark matter content of the Universe. The scalar sector is enriched with a $\tilde{R}_2$ scalar leptoquark doublet to investigate flavor anomalies in $B$-meson sector, an additional inert scalar doublet to realize neutrino mass at one loop and a scalar singlet to spontaneously break the new $U(1)$. We discuss dark matter relic density and direct detection cross section in scalar and gauge portals. New physics contribution for $b \to s$ transition comes from penguin diagrams with $Z^\prime$, leptquark and new fermions. We analyze the constraints on the model parameters from the established observables of $B \to K^{(*)} \mu^+ \mu^-$ and $B_s\to \phi \mu^+ \mu^-$ decay channels. Utilizing the permissible parameter space consistent with both flavor and dark sectors, we discuss the impact on various observables such as branching ratio, forward-backward asymmetry, longitudinal polarisation asymmetry, and also lepton non-universality of $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda ^* (1520) (\to pK) \ell ^+\ell ^-$ decay channel.</description>

      <title>A singlet scalar assisted $N_{2}$ Leptogenesis and Pseudo-Scalar Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Leptogenesis and Dark Matter in the presence of an extra singlet complex scalar field in an extended discrete $\mathcal{Z_{\rm 3}}$ symmetry. The vacuum expectation value of the new scalar spontaneously breaks the $\mathcal{Z_{\rm 3}}$ symmetry. A remnant CP-like $\mathcal{Z_{\rm 2}}$ symmetry stabilizes the imaginary part of the complex scalar field which can act as a pseudo-Goldstone DM. The real part of the complex scalar couples to RHN opens up new decay channels which can lead to a larger CP-violation in generating the lepton asymmetry. Thus the singlet complex scalar plays a crucial role in understanding the Leptogenesis and Dark Matter parameter space. This singlet complex scalar is also responsible for the First-Order Phase Transition (FOPT) which may provide observable stochastic Gravitational wave signatures. We discuss the possible correlations among these three phenomena.</description>

      <title>Relativistic and Recoil Corrections to Vacuum polarization in muonic systems: Three--photon exchange, gauge invariance and numerical values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an accurate theoretical description of muonic bound systems, it is crucial to consistently treat relativistic and recoil corrections to vacuum polarization. The one-loop vacuum-polarization effect is by far the dominant quantum electrodynamic (QED) energy correction for bound muons, being of order $\alpha (Z\alpha)^2 m_r$, where $\alpha$ is the fine-structure constant, $Z$ is the nuclear charge number, and $m_r$ is the reduced mass. Gauge invariance of the relativistic and recoil corrections to vacuum polarization of order $\alpha (Z\alpha)^4 m_r$ is investigated with respect to nonretarded and standard, renormalized variants of Coulomb gauge. The invariance is shown after including three-photon exchange diagrams. Our derivation is based on an adapted form of Nonrelativistic Quantum Electrodynamics for bound muon systems (NRQED$_\mu$), which is a version of NRQED where the hard scale is set at the muon mass instead of the electron mass. Updated values for the gauge-independent corrections for one-muon ions with nuclear charge numbers $Z = 1,2,6$ are presented.</description>

      <title>Refereeing the Referees: Evaluating Two-Sample Tests for Validating Generators in Precision Sciences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a robust methodology to evaluate the performance and computational efficiency of non-parametric two-sample tests, specifically designed for high-dimensional generative models in scientific applications such as in particle physics. The study focuses on tests built from univariate integral probability measures: the sliced Wasserstein distance and the mean of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics, already discussed in the literature, and the novel sliced Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic. These metrics can be evaluated in parallel, allowing for fast and reliable estimates of their distribution under the null hypothesis. We also compare these metrics with the recently proposed unbiased Fr\'echet Gaussian Distance and the unbiased quadratic Maximum Mean Discrepancy, computed with a quartic polynomial kernel. We evaluate the proposed tests on various distributions, focusing on their sensitivity to deformations parameterized by a single parameter $\epsilon$. Our experiments include correlated Gaussians and mixtures of Gaussians in 5, 20, and 100 dimensions, and a particle physics dataset of gluon jets from the JetNet dataset, considering both jet- and particle-level features. Our results demonstrate that one-dimensional-based tests provide a level of sensitivity comparable to other multivariate metrics, but with significantly lower computational cost, making them ideal for evaluating generative models in high-dimensional settings. This methodology offers an efficient, standardized tool for model comparison and can serve as a benchmark for more advanced tests, including machine-learning-based approaches.</description>

      <title>The Unknowns of the Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background Hinder New Physics Searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutrinos traveling over cosmic distances are ideal probes of new physics. We leverage on the approaching detection of the diffuse supernova neutrino background (DSNB) to explore whether, if the DSNB showed departures from theoretical predictions, we could attribute such modifications to new physics unequivocally. In order to do so, we focus on visible neutrino decay. Many of the signatures from neutrino decay are degenerate with astrophysical unknowns entering the DSNB modeling. Next generation neutrino observatories, such as Hyper-Kamiokande, JUNO, as well as DUNE, will set stringent limits on a neutrino lifetime over mass ratio $\tau/m \sim 10^{9}$-$10^{10}$ s eV$^{-1}$ at $90\%$ C.L., if astrophysical uncertainties and detector backgrounds were to be fully under control. However, if the lightest neutrino is almost massless and the neutrino mass ordering is normal, constraining visible decay will not be realistically possible in the coming few decades. We also assess the challenges of distinguishing among different new physics scenarios (such as visible decay, invisible decay, and quasi-Dirac neutrinos), all leading up to similar signatures in the DSNB. This work shows that the DSNB potential for probing new physics strongly depends on an improved understanding of the experimental backgrounds at next generation neutrino observatories as well as progress in the DSNB modeling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have generated an updated version of the $p\Omega$ potential for low-energy interactions based on an effective field theory approach at leading order. This potential, together with other potentials based either on different parametrizations or lattice QCD calculations, have been used to solve the Schr\"odinger equation numerically, obtaining the scattering wave functions for different values of the relative momentum. Using these wave functions, we have computed the $p \Omega$ femtoscopic correlation functions, comparing the results with those published by the ALICE collaboration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parton distribution functions (PDFs) describe universal properties of bound states and allow us to calculate scattering amplitudes in processes with large momentum transfer. Calculating PDFs involves the evaluation of matrix elements with a Wilson line in a light-cone direction. In contrast to Monte Carlo methods in Euclidean spacetime, these matrix elements can be directly calculated in Minkowski-space using the Hamiltonian formalism. The necessary spatial- and time-evolution can be efficiently applied using established tensor network methods. We present PDFs in the Schwinger model calculated with matrix product states.</description>

Abstract: We show that a universe with a non-minimally coupled scalar field can fit current measurements of the expansion rate of the Universe better than the standard $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter model or other minimally coupled dark energy models. While we find a clear improvement in the goodness of fit for this dark energy model with respect to others that have been considered in the recent literature, using various information theoretic criteria, we show that the evidence for it is still inconclusive.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a comprehensive framework for extracting the pole position and properties of the doubly-charmed tetraquark $T_{\rm cc}^+(3875)$ from lattice QCD data using the relativistic three-particle formalism. This approach incorporates the effect of the one-pion exchange diagram in $DD\pi$ and $DD^*$ scattering, making it applicable at energies coinciding with the left-hand cut in the partial-wave projected $DD^*$ amplitude. We present an example application of this framework to existing lattice QCD data at $m_\pi = 280$ MeV. We solve the integral equations describing the $DD\pi$ reaction, use LSZ reduction to determine the corresponding $DD^*$ amplitude, and find the values of the infinite-volume two- and three-body $K$ matrices that lead to agreement with lattice $DD^*$ phase shifts within their uncertainties. Using these $K$ matrices in the three-particle quantization condition, we describe the finite-volume $DD^*$ spectrum and find good agreement with the lattice QCD energies. Our results suggest that, at this pion mass, the tetraquark appears as a pair of subthreshold complex poles whose precise location strongly depends on the value of the $DD\pi$ three-particle $K$ matrix.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Dark Energy Beyond Planck? Constraints from multiple CMB probes, DESI BAO and Type-Ia Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration, when combined with Planck satellite Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data and Type Ia Supernovae, suggest a preference for Dynamical Dark Energy (DDE) at a significance level ranging from $2.5\sigma$ to $3.9\sigma$. In this work, I test whether, and to what extent, this preference is supported by CMB experiments other than Planck. I analyze the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and South Pole Telescope (SPT) temperature, polarization, and lensing spectra at small scales, eventually combining them with Planck or WMAP 9-year observations at large angular scales. My analysis shows that ACT and WMAP data, when combined with DESI BAO and Pantheon-plus Supernovae, yield independent constraints with a precision comparable to Planck. Notably, in this case, the cosmological constant value is recovered within two standard deviations. A preference for DDE reappears when Pantheon-plus is replaced with distance moduli measurements from the Dark Energy Survey Supernova Program (DESy5). However, it remains less pronounced compared to the Planck-based results. When considering SPT data, no clear preference for DDE is found, although the parameter uncertainties are significantly larger compared to both Planck- and ACT-based constraints. Overall, CMB experiments other than Planck generally weaken the evidence for DDE. I argue that the subsets of Planck data that strengthen the shift toward DDE are the temperature and E-mode polarization anisotropy measurements at large angular scales $\ell \lesssim 30$.</description>

      <title>The effect of causality constraints on Bayesian analyses of heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There have long been questions about the limits to the validity of relativistic fluid dynamics, and whether it is being used outside its regime of validity in modern simulations of relativistic heavy-ion collisions. An important new tool for answering this question is a causality analysis in the nonlinear regime -- if the solutions of the evolution equations do not respect relativistic causality, they are not a faithful representation of the underlying relativistic theory (in this case, quantum chromodynamics). Using this non-linear criterion, it has recently been shown that hydrodynamics is indeed being used outside its regime of validity in simulations, at least sometimes. Here we explore the phenomenological implications, particularly the quantitative effects of demanding limits on acausality in modern Bayesian parameter estimation. We find that, while typically only a small fraction of the system's energy is initially in an acausal regime, placing strict limits on the allowed energy fraction significantly changes the preferred properties of the initial condition, which in turn alters the extracted medium properties such as bulk viscosity, where large values are no longer favored. These findings highlight the importance of developing better theoretical descriptions of the early-time, out-of-equilibrium dynamics of relativistic heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.19703v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is shown that the covariance of Lagrangians always taking place results in a distortion of any electric and magnetic fields by a pseudoscalar field of axions and axion-like particles. As a result, electric and magnetic fields acquire oscillating magnetic and electric components, respectively. One can also use the equivalent approach based on an introduction of effective oscillating magnetic charges and electric dipole moments in undistorted electromagnetic fields. The determined relations between the magnetic charges and electric dipole moments and the axion-photon coupling constant open a possibility to compare a sensitivity of search for axions in optical experiments and experiments with massive particles. The inverse (dual) Witten effect defining effective magnetic charges of electrically charged particles opens new exciting possibilities to search for axions and axion-like particles with very small masses in nonresonance experiments. The study of a passage of strongly decelerated electrons or positrons through a solenoid is proposed.</description>

      <title>W boson mass in the NP models with extra $U(1)$ gauge group</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05304v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The precise measurement of the W boson mass is closely related to the contributions of new physics (NP), which can significantly constrain the parameter space of NP models, particularly those with an additional $U(1)$ local gauge group. The inclusion of a new $Z'$ gauge boson and gauge couplings in these models can contribute to the oblique parameters $S$, $T$, $U$ and W boson mass at tree level. Taking into account the effects of kinetic mixing, we calculate and analyze the oblique parameters $S$, $T$, $U$ and W boson mass in such NP models in this study. It is found that the kinetic mixing effects can make significant contributions to the W boson mass, which can satisfy the recently measured W boson mass at CDF II or ATLAS by choosing appropriate values of gauge coupling constants and extra $U(1)$ group charges of leptons or scalar doublets. In addition, if the leptonic Yukawa couplings are invariant under the extra $U(1)$ local gauge group, these contributions can be eliminated by redefining the gauge boson fields through eliminating the neutral currents involving charged leptons, even with nonzero kinetic mixing effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17027v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present new results of next-to-leading order (NLO) electroweak corrections to doubly-polarized cross sections of $W^+W^-$ production at the LHC. The calculation is performed for the leptonic final state of $e^+\mu_e \mu^- \bar{\nu}_\mu$ using the double-pole approximation in the diboson center-of-mass frame. NLO QCD corrections and subleading contributions from the $gg$, $b\bar{b}$, $\gamma\gamma$ induced processes are taken into account in the numerical results. We found that NLO EW corrections are small for angular distributions but can reach tens of percent for transverse momentum distributions at high energies, e.g. reaching $-40\%$ at $p_{T,e}\approx 300$ GeV. In these high $p_T$ regions, EW corrections are largest for the doubly-transverse mode.</description>

      <title>Improvement and generalization of ABCD method with Bayesian inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To find New Physics or to refine our knowledge of the Standard Model at the LHC is an enterprise that involves many factors. We focus on taking advantage of available information and pour our effort in re-thinking the usual data-driven ABCD method to improve it and to generalize it using Bayesian Machine Learning tools. We propose that a dataset consisting of a signal and many backgrounds is well described through a mixture model. Signal, backgrounds and their relative fractions in the sample can be well extracted by exploiting the prior knowledge and the dependence between the different observables at the event-by-event level with Bayesian tools. We show how, in contrast to the ABCD method, one can take advantage of understanding some properties of the different backgrounds and of having more than two independent observables to measure in each event. In addition, instead of regions defined through hard cuts, the Bayesian framework uses the information of continuous distribution to obtain soft-assignments of the events which are statistically more robust. To compare both methods we use a toy problem inspired by $pp\to hh\to b\bar b b \bar b$, selecting a reduced and simplified number of processes and analysing the flavor of the four jets and the invariant mass of the jet-pairs, modeled with simplified distributions. Taking advantage of all this information, and starting from a combination of biased and agnostic priors, leads us to a very good posterior once we use the Bayesian framework to exploit the data and the mutual information of the observables at the event-by-event level. We show how, in this simplified model, the Bayesian framework outperforms the ABCD method sensitivity in obtaining the signal fraction in scenarios with $1\%$ and $0.5\%$ true signal fractions in the dataset. We also show that the method is robust against the absence of signal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study dark matter, assumed to be composed by weak interacting massive particles (WIMPs), scattering off ${}^2$H and ${}^4$He nuclei. In order to parameterize the WIMP-nucleon interaction the chiral effective field theory approach is used. Considering only interactions invariant under parity, charge conjugation and time reversal, we examine five interaction types: scalar, pseudoscalar, vector, axial and tensor. Scattering amplitudes between two nucleons and a WIMP are determined up to second order of chiral perturbation theory. We apply this program to calculate the interaction rate as function of the WIMP mass and of the magnitude of the WIMP-quark coupling constants. From our study, we conclude that the scalar nuclear response functions result much greater than the others due to theirs large combination of low energy constants. We verify that the leading order contributions are dominant in this low energy processes. We also provide an estimate for the background due to atmospheric neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Exploring interference effects between two ALP effective operators at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14833v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We observe that most studies of axion-like particle (ALP) production channels at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) focus on a single type of ALP operator for each process in the effective field theory framework. In this work, we propose an alternative approach that considers two or more types of relevant ALP effective operators together in some specific ALP production channels and study their interference effects. Using the $p p\rightarrow t j a$ process with $a\rightarrow\gamma\gamma$ as an example, we show that this approach allows us to constrain the ALP interactions with both the $W$ boson and the top quark, as well as their interference in a single process. For the final state with two isolated photons and a top quark decaying semi-leptonically, we predict that the future bounds on the ALP decay constant can reach around $f_a \sim 10\;(20) $ TeV for $25$ GeV $&lt; M_a &lt; 100$ GeV at the LHC with 300 (3000) fb$^{1}$ luminosity.</description>

      <title>Angular correlations in associated top-quark and dark matter production at Large Hadron Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the paper, we consider the processes of single top-quark production in association with dark matter particles through the t-channel in simplified models with scalar and pseudoscalar mediators. Within the framework of these models, we analyze the angular correlations that arise in the top quark production process in association with dark matter, comparing them with the production of a top quark in the Standard Model. We consider angular correlations of kinematic variables, which define admissible regions in momentum space and can be used experimentally to distinguish between the fraction of the total momentum carried away by the scalar or pseudoscalar mediator. We demonstrate that scalar mediator significantly changes the rest frame of the well-known angular correlation observable and changes the distributions. In this case, this variable provides clear separation between the SM and DM contribution and can be used to increase the sensitivity of future DM analyses.</description>

      <title>Testing the equivalence between the planar Gross-Neveu and Thirring models at $N=1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that the Fierz identities predict that the Gross-Neveu and Thirring models should be equivalent when describing systems composed of a single fermionic flavor, $N=1$. Here, we consider the planar version of both models within the framework of the optimized perturbation theory at the two-loop level, in order to verify if the predicted equivalence emerges explicitly when different temperature and density regimes are considered. At vanishing densities, our results indicate that both models indeed describe exactly the same thermodynamics, provided that $N=1$. However, at finite chemical potentials we find that the $N=1$ Fierz equivalence no longer holds. After examining the relevant free energies, we have identified the contributions which lead to this puzzling discrepancy. Finally, we discuss different frameworks in which this (so far open) problem could be further understood and eventually circumvented.</description>

      <title>Application of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks in high energy physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01724v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks represent a recent advancement in machine learning, with the potential to outperform traditional perceptron-based neural networks across various domains as well as provide more interpretability with the use of symbolic formulas and pruning. This study explores the application of KANs to specific tasks in high-energy physics. We evaluate the performance of KANs in distinguishing multijet processes in proton-proton collisions and in reconstructing missing transverse momentum in events involving dark matter.</description>

      <title>Dark QCD perspective inspired by strong CP problem at QCD scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss a QCD-scale composite axion model arising from dark QCD coupled to QCD. The presently proposed scenario not only solves the strong CP problem, but also is compatible with the preheating setup for the QCD baryogenesis. The composite axion is phenomenologically required to mimic the QCD pion, but can generically be flavorful, which could be testable via the induced flavor changing processes at experiments. Another axionlike particle (ALP) is predicted to achieve the axion relaxation mechanism, which can phenomenologically act as the conventional QCD axion. This ALP can be ultralight, having the mass less than 1 eV, to be a dark matter candidate. The QCD $\times$ dark QCD symmetry structure constrains dark QCD meson spectra, so that the dark $\eta'$-like meson would only be accessible at the collider experiments. Still, the Belle II and Electron ion collider experiments can have a high enough sensitivity to probe the dark $\eta'$-like meson in the diphoton channel, which dominantly arises from the mixing with the QCD $\eta'$ and the pionic composite axion. We also briefly address nontrivial cosmological aspects, such as those related to the dark-chiral phase transition, the dark matter production, and an ultraviolet completion related to the ultralight ALP.</description>

      <title>Simulation of a (3+1)D glasma in Milne coordinates: Topological charge, eccentricity, and angular momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08742v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply the 3D glasma simulation method using Milne coordinates, proposed in our previous work [1], to the early stage of the Au-Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=200$ GeV. The nucleus model prior to the collisions, which offers the initial condition for the 3D glasma simulation is constructed to account for the longitudinal structure of the nucleus, the finite thickness of nucleons and their random positions along the collision axis. We investigate rapidity profiles for a wide range of physical quantities of the glasma, including energy, pressure, fluctuations of topological charge, eccentricity, and angular momentum. In particular, we elucidate the behavior of eccentricity and angular momentum, which are physical quantities dependent on the geometric shape of the glasma, across a wide range of impact parameter regions.</description>

      <title>Capability of Cosmic Gravitational Focusing on Identifying the Neutrino Mass Ordering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cosmic gravitational focusing (CGF) of relic neutrinos can provide an independent measurement of the absolute neutrino masses $m_i$ with fourth-power dependence ($m^4_i$). We demonstrate in this paper for the first time how this can help identifying the neutrino mass ordering (NMO). Upon incorporating the projected CGF sensitivity at DESI, the preference for the normal ordering (NO) with a prior $\sum m_\nu &gt; 0.059\,{\rm eV}$ would increase from the original 89.9\% of the current clustering method with both DESI BAO and CMB to 98.2\% while the inverted ordering (IO) is further disfavored from 10.1\% to 1.8\%. We also show how this can affect the prospects of the neutrinoless double beta decay and single beta decay measurements.</description>

      <title>Boosted top quark inspired leptoquark searches at the muon collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15992v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The proposed muon collider presents a promising avenue to explore various classes of beyond the Standard Model (BSM) particles. In this paper, we investigate the discovery prospects of the scalar leptoquark (LQ) $S_1$ at a muon collider. We consider two benchmark center-of-mass (C.O.M.) energy scenarios: 5 TeV and 10 TeV. We assume that the LQ decays into a top quark and a muon. The collider analysis for an LQ decaying into a top quark is distinct from that of lighter quarks. A TeV-scale LQ decaying into a top quark can produce an exotic, boosted fat-jet signature. In addition to the usual searches based on pair production of LQs, we also examine the single production mode, which depends on the $S_1 t \mu$ coupling. We demonstrate that systematically combining the pair and single production modes significantly enhances the discovery potential of the LQ at the muon collider. Our signal topology includes at least one hadronically decaying top fat-jet and two oppositely charged muons, thereby enabling the incorporation of the single production mode. We show that even with single production alone, it is possible to probe LQs as heavy as 4.5 TeV (9.0 TeV) in the 5 TeV (10 TeV) C.O.M. scenario for $\mathcal{O}(1)$ couplings.</description>

      <title>Smeared quasidistributions in perturbation theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:1710.04607v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quasi and pseudo distributions provide a new approach to determining parton distribution functions (PDFs) from first principles' calculations of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Here I calculate the flavor nonsinglet unpolarized quasi distribution at one loop in perturbation theory, using the gradient flow to remove ultraviolet divergences. I demonstrate that, as expected, the gradient flow does not change the infrared structure of the quasi distribution at one loop and use the results to match the smeared matrix elements to those in the $\ms$ scheme. This matching calculation is required to relate numerical results obtained from nonperturbative lattice QCD computations to light-front PDFs extracted from global analyses of experimental data.</description>

      <title>A simple explanation of the absence of the spherical nuclei with the hidden-color states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05723v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the EMC effect, the Cd puzzle and the SU3-IBM, a hypothesis can be given for a nucleus, that only the nucleus itself is a trivial (0,0) representation of the SU(3) group, which leads to the simple conclusion that spherical nucleus does not exist and the spherical mean field is not allowed. The key conclusion is that the color degree of freedom is required even at the low energy excitation of the nucleus, and the whole nucleus should have many hidden-color states.</description>
