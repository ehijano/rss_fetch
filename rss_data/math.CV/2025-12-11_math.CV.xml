      <title>Growth, Distortion, Pre-Schwarzian and Schwarzian norm estimates for Generalized Robertson class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the geometric properties of functions within the generalized Robertson class which consists of alpha-starlike functions of order beta. The study's significance lies in providing a deeper understanding of the univalence and geometric behavior of these functions, which are fundamental in complex analysis and geometric function theory. The primary objective is to derive sharp bounds for the norms of the Schwarzian and pre-Schwarzian derivatives for functions in this class. These bounds are expressed in terms of the initial coefficient of the function, specifically focusing on the important case where this initial coefficient is zero. Additionally, the paper establishes sharp distortion and growth theorems for the functions belonging to this generalized class. Finally, the research addresses the radius problem for this function class by determining the sharp radius of concavity and the sharp radius of convexity.</description>

      <title>Local Banach Space Theoretic Approach to Bohr's Theorem for Vector Valued Holomorphic and Pluriharmonic Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Bohr's theorem for vector valued holomorphic and operator valued pluriharmonic functions on complete Reinhardt domains in $\mathbb{C}^n$. Using invariants from local Banach space theory, we show that the associated Bohr radius is always strictly positive and obtain its asymptotic behavior separately in the finite- and infinite-dimensional settings. The framework developed here includes the classical Minkowski-space setting as a special case and applies to a wide class of Banach sequence spaces, including mixed Minkowski, Lorentz, and Orlicz spaces. We further establish a coefficient-type Schwarz-Pick lemma for operator valued pluriharmonic maps on complete Reinhardt domains.</description>

      <title>Complex exponential integral means spectrums of univalent functions and Brennan conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the complex exponential integral means spectrums of univalent functions in the unit disk. We show that all integral means spectrum (IMS) functionals for complex exponents on the universal Teichm\"uller space, the closure of the universal Teichm\"uller curve, and the universal asymptotic Teichm\"uller space are continuous. We also show that the complex exponential integral means spectrum of any univalent function admitting a quasiconformal extension to the extended complex plane is strictly less than the universal integral means spectrum. These results extend some related ones in our recent work \cite{Jin}. Here we employ a different and more direct approach to prove the continuity of IMS functional on the universal asymptotic Teichm\"uller space. Additionally, we completely determine the integral means spectrums of all univalent rational functions in the unit disk. As a consequence, we show that the Brennan conjecture is true for this class of univalent functions. Finally, we present some remarks and raise some problems and conjectures regarding IMS functionals on Teichm\"uller spaces, univalent rational functions, and a multiplier operator whose norm is closely related to the Brennan conjecture.</description>

      <title>The real analytic structure of the Teichm\"uller space of circle diffeomorphisms with Zygmund continuous derivatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the methods of simultaneous uniformization and composition operators on Besov spaces to the Teichm\"uller space $T^Z$ of circle diffeomorphisms with Zygmund continuous derivatives. As consequences, we obtain the following: (1) a new proof of the correspondence between quasiconformal self-homeomorphisms of the unit disk with complex dilatations of linear decay order and their quasisymmetric extensions to the unit circle with regularity in the Zygmund continuously differentiable class; (2) a real-analytic equivalence of $T^Z$ with the real Banach space of Zygmund continuous functions on the unit circle.</description>

      <title>Meromorphic maps from ${\Bbb C}^{p}$ into semi-abelian varieties and general projective varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1953, W. Stoll proposed a method of studying holomorphic functions of several complex variables by reducing them to one variable through fiber integration. In this paper, we use this method to extend some important Nevanlinna-type results for holomorphic curves into projective varieties to meromorphic maps from ${\Bbb C}^{p}$ to projective varieties. This includes Bloch's theorem and Noguchi-Winklemann-Yamanoi's Second Main Theorem for holomorphic maps into semi-abelian varieties intersecting an effective divisor, as well as Huynh-Vu-Xie's Second Main Theorem for meromorphic maps into projective space intersecting with a generic hypersurface with sufficiently high degree.</description>

      <title>Gehring-Hayman Inequality for Meromorphic Univalent Mappings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $f$ be a meromorphic univalent function on the open unit disk having a simple pole at $p\in (0,1)$ that extends continuously to the left half $\IT^{-}$ of the unit circle. In this article, we prove that the ratio of the length of the image of the vertical diameter $\IA$ of the unit disk to the length of the image of $\IT^{-}$ under the mapping $f$ is bounded by a constant depending only on $p.$ Next, we extend this result by considering any hyperbolic geodesic and any Jordan curve in $\D$ sharing the same endpoints. These results extend the classical Gehring-Hayman inequality to meromorphic univalent functions and also prove a conjecture posed by Bhowmik and Maity [Bull. Sci. Math. \textbf{199} (2025), \# 103583].</description>

      <title>On the Zeros of $q$-Hankel Transform by Using P\'{o}lya-Hurwitz Partial Fraction Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The technique of P\'{o}lya-Hurwitz of partial fractions is implemented to investigate the zeros of finite $q$-Hankel transforms, which are defined in terms of the third $q$-Bessel function of Jackson. The new approach, which is a $q$-counterpart of P\'{o}lya-Hurwitz technique relaxes the restrictive conditions imposed on $q$ in the previously obtained results. In the present study, we use the $q$-type sampling theorems of the $q$-Hankel transforms, which lead directly to $q$-partial fractions. Various experimental examples are established.</description>

Abstract: We show that a bounded planar simply connected domain $\Omega$ is a $W^{1,\,1}$-extension domain if and only if for every pair $x,y$ of points in $\Omega^c$ there exists a curve $\gamma \subset \Omega^c$ connecting $x$ and $y$ with $$ \int_\gamma \frac{1}{\chi_{\mathbb R^2\setminus \partial\Omega}(z)}\,ds(z) \le C|x-y|.$$ Consequently, a planar Jordan domain $\Omega$ is a $W^{1,\,1}$-extension domain if and only if it is a $BV$-extension domain, and if and only if its complementary domain $\tilde \Omega$ is a $W^{1,\,\infty}$-extension domain.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic foliated entropy of suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the hyperbolic entropies of foliations obtained by suspensions of a representation, in the sense of Dinh, Nguy\^en and Sibony (topological and measure-theoretic). We establish a link between this type of entropy and an adapted version of an entropy defined by Ghys, Langevin and Walczak for pseudo-groups of homeomorphisms.
  Such a link has various consequences. Among them, it implies that the hyperbolic entropy of foliations is not invariant by diffeomorphisms, and that a minimal entropy suspension admits an invariant measure. Finally, this allows us to study thoroughly the simple case in which the image of the representation is isomorphic to~$\mathbb{Z}$. In that case, we give the first exact estimate of the hyperbolic entropy, and prove a Brin--Katok type theorem and a variational principle, relying strongly on the standard ones for the entropy of maps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study attracting orbits escaping to infinity in natural families of transcendental entire functions. We show that, if an attracting fixed point escapes to infinity while its multiplier tends to one, then the limiting function has a doubly parabolic Baker domain. Conversely, we show that any function with an invariant doubly parabolic Baker domain can be approximated locally uniformly by functions in its quasiconformal equivalence class having an attracting fixed point whose multiplier tends to one.</description>

      <title>Interpolation and random interpolation in de Branges-Rovnyak spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to characterize universal and multiplier interpolating sequences for de Branges-Rovnyak spaces H (b) where the defining function b is a general non-extreme rational function. Our results carry over to recently introduced higher order local Dirichlet spaces and thus generalize previously known results in classical local Dirichlet spaces. In this setting, we also investigate random interpolating sequences with prescribed radii, providing a 0 -1 law.  This condition is automatic when b is rational non inner so that we can assume H (b) = M(a). By standard results in functional analysis, the corresponding norms are equivalent. In [18], the authors demonstrated that the decomposition (1) is orthogonal in the metric of M(a).</description>

      <title>Geometric Solution of the Loop Equation and Quark Confinement in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13688v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an exact analytic confining area law for pure $\mathrm{SU}(N_c)$ Yang--Mills theory, satisfying the hierarchy of multiloop equations for arbitrary regular loops and any number of colors $N_c$. The solution is constructed using a quaternionic Hodge-dual minimal surface in a 16-dimensional auxiliary space. Unlike random surfaces, this construction defines an effectively topological string theory where the bulk dynamics reduces to the area of a conformal map of the 2D disk, with all nontrivial dynamics encoded in the boundary loop.
  The Wilson loop factorizes into a confining dressing factor and a perturbative term: $W[C] = W_{\text{pert}}[C]\, e^{-\kappa S[C]}$. We show that the geometric factor $e^{-\kappa S[C]}$ is an exact multiplicative zero mode of the loop-space diffusion operator and of the full MM multiloop hierarchy for any finite $N_c$, extending the planar area law to the physical case $N_c=3$. The functional $S[C]$ obeys the inequality $S[C] \ge \sqrt{2}\,A[C]$ (where $A[C]$ is the Euclidean minimal area), providing a sufficient condition for confinement.
  The area law is given explicitly by the spectral formula $S[C] = 2\sqrt{2}\,(\lambda_3 + \lambda_4)$, using the two largest eigenvalues of the Douglas--Gram matrix. We demonstrate that this functional is an exact additive zero mode of the loop diffusion operator, protected algebraically by the Bianchi identity, and globally defined for regular loops $C \in H^{1/2}(\mathbb{S}^1,\mathbb{R}^4)$. Matching this factor with the gluon condensate via the OPE determines the physical string tension $\kappa \sim \Lambda_{\text{QCD}}^2$. This framework yields a first-principles derivation of confinement in QCD and new tools for the high-lying meson spectrum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06472v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by our study of the complex Banach conjecture, we characterize a complex ellipsoids $\mathcal E$ as compact subsets of $\mathbb C^n$, with the property that every complex line intersect $\mathcal E$ either in a single point or in the complex affine image of the unit disk. This characterization leads to the main interest of this paper. We study the topological behavior of compact subsets of $\mathbb{CP}^n$ with the property that any complex line that intersects them does either at a single point, at the boundary of a complex disk, or along the entire line. In particular, we are interested in quadratic $\R$-algebraic subsets of $\mathbb{CP}^n$.</description>
