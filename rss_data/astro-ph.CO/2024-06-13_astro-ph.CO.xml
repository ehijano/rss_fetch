      <title>Warm Hawking Relics From Primordial Black Hole Domination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the cosmological impact of warm, dark-sector relic particles produced as Hawking radiation in a primordial-black-hole-dominated universe before big bang nucleosynthesis. If those dark-sector particles are stable, they would survive to the present day as "Hawking relics" and modify the subsequent growth of cosmological structure. We show that such relics are produced with much larger momenta, but in smaller quantities than the familiar thermal relics considered in standard cosmology. Consequently, Hawking relics with keV-MeV masses affect the growth of large-scale structure in a similar way to eV-scale thermal relics like massive neutrinos. We model their production and evolution, and show that their momentum distributions are broader than comparable relics with thermal distributions. Warm Hawking relics affect the growth of cosmological perturbations and we constrain their abundance to be less than $2\%$ of the dark matter over a broad range of their viable parameter space. Finally, we examine how future measurements of the matter power spectrum can distinguish Hawking relics from thermal particles.</description>

      <title>A high-resolution view of the source-plane magnification near cluster caustics in wave dark matter models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the highest resolution images to date of caustics formed by wave dark matter ($\psi$DM) fluctuations near the critical curves of cluster gravitational lenses. We describe the basic magnification features of $\psi$DM in the source plane at high macromodel magnification and discuss specific differences between the $\psi$DM and standard cold dark matter (CDM) models. The unique generation of demagnified counterimages formed outside the Einstein radius for $\psi$DM is highlighted. Substructure in CDM cannot generate such demagnified images of positive parity, thus providing a definitive way to distinguish $\psi$DM from CDM. Highly magnified background sources with sizes $r\approx 1pc$, or approximately a factor of ten smaller than the expected de Broglie wavelength of $\psi$DM, offer the best possibility of discriminating between $\psi$DM and CDM. These include objects such as very compact stellar clusters at high redshift that JWST is finding in abundance.</description>

      <title>Evolution mapping II: describing statistics of the non-linear cosmic velocity field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the evolution mapping approach, originally proposed by Sanchez (2022) to describe non-linear matter density fluctuations, to statistics of the cosmic velocity field. This framework classifies cosmological parameters into shape parameters, which determine the shape of the linear matter power spectrum, $P_L(k, z)$, and evolution parameters, which control its amplitude at any given redshift. Evolution mapping leverages the fact that density fluctuations in cosmologies with identical shape parameters but different evolution parameters exhibit remarkably similar non-linear evolutions when expressed as a function of the clustering amplitude. We use a suite of N-body simulations sharing identical shape parameters but spanning a wide range of evolution parameters. Using an efficient method for estimating the volume-weighted velocity field based on the Voronoi tesselation of the simulation particles, we study the non-linear evolution of the power spectra of the velocity divergence, $P_{\theta\theta}(k)$, and its cross-power spectrum with the density field, $P_{\delta\theta}(k)$. By analysing snapshots at redshifts where the linear matter perturbations have the same amplitude, we demonstrate that evolution mapping accurately applies to $P_{\theta\theta}(k)$ and $P_{\delta\theta}(k)$. Deviations at small scales can be modelled in terms of differences in the suppression factor, $g(a) = D(a)/a$, akin to those observed for the density field. Evolution mapping simplifies the description of the cosmological dependence of non-linear density and velocity statistics, streamlining the sampling of large cosmological parameter spaces for the analysis of cosmological observables.</description>

      <title>Ray-tracing vs. Born approximation in full-sky weak lensing simulations of the MillenniumTNG project</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weak gravitational lensing is a powerful tool for precision tests of cosmology. As the expected deflection angles are small, predictions based on non-linear N-body simulations are commonly computed with the Born approximation. Here we examine this assumption using ${\small DORIAN}$, a newly developed full-sky ray-tracing scheme applied to high-resolution mass-shell outputs of the two largest simulations in the MillenniumTNG suite, each with a 3000 Mpc box containing almost 1.1 trillion cold dark matter particles in addition to 16.7 billion particles representing massive neutrinos. We examine simple two-point statistics like the angular power spectrum of the convergence field, as well as statistics sensitive to higher order correlations such as peak and minimum statistics, void statistics, and Minkowski functionals of the convergence maps. Overall, we find only small differences between the Born approximation and a full ray-tracing treatment. While these are negligibly small at power-spectrum level, some higher order statistics show more sizable effects; ray-tracing is necessary to achieve percent level precision. At the resolution reached here, full-sky maps with 0.8 billion pixels and an angular resolution of 0.43 arcmin, we find that interpolation accuracy can introduce appreciable errors in ray-tracing results. We therefore implemented an interpolation method based on nonuniform fast Fourier transforms (NUFFT) along with more traditional methods. Bilinear interpolation introduces significant smoothing, while nearest grid point sampling agrees well with NUFFT, at least for our fiducial source redshift, $z_s=1.0$, and for the 1 arcmin smoothing we use for higher-order statistics.</description>

      <title>Investigating Mutual Coupling in the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array and Mitigating its Effects on the 21-cm Power Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interferometric experiments designed to detect the highly redshifted 21-cm signal from neutral hydrogen are producing increasingly stringent constraints on the 21-cm power spectrum, but some k-modes remain systematics-dominated. Mutual coupling is a major systematic that must be overcome in order to detect the 21-cm signal, and simulations that reproduce effects seen in the data can guide strategies for mitigating mutual coupling. In this paper, we analyse 12 nights of data from the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array and compare the data against simulations that include a computationally efficient and physically motivated semi-analytic treatment of mutual coupling. We find that simulated coupling features qualitatively agree with coupling features in the data; however, coupling features in the data are brighter than the simulated features, indicating the presence of additional coupling mechanisms not captured by our model. We explore the use of fringe-rate filters as mutual coupling mitigation tools and use our simulations to investigate the effects of mutual coupling on a simulated cosmological 21-cm power spectrum in a "worst case" scenario where the foregrounds are particularly bright. We find that mutual coupling contaminates a large portion of the "EoR Window", and the contamination is several orders-of-magnitude larger than our simulated cosmic signal across a wide range of cosmological Fourier modes. While our fiducial fringe-rate filtering strategy reduces mutual coupling by roughly a factor of 100 in power, a non-negligible amount of coupling cannot be excised with fringe-rate filters, so more sophisticated mitigation strategies are required.</description>

      <title>Primordial magnetic relics and their signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primordial black holes bearing magnetic charges may bypass the constraints imposed by Hawking radiation, thereby enabling reasonable present-day populations, even for masses below $10^{15}\,\text{g}$ -- a range previously considered improbable. They could, therefore, conceivably contribute to a component of dark matter. We investigate novel Faraday rotation signatures exhibited by primordial magnetic black holes while also establishing new Parker-type bounds on their populations. For the latter, we bound the dark matter fraction from intergalactic magnetic fields in cosmic voids $\left(f_{\text{DM}} \lesssim 10^{-8}\right)$ and cosmic web filaments $\left(f_{\text{ DM}} \lesssim 10^{-4}\right)$, notably eclipsing previous bounds. Exploring Faraday rotation effects, we discern a pronounced rotation of the polarization angle and the rotation measure values for extremal primordial magnetic black holes with masses $M^{\text{ ex.}}_{\text{ BH}}\gtrsim 10^{-6}~ \text{M}_\odot$. This makes them potentially detectable in current observations. A comparative investigation finds that the effects are notably greater than for a neutron star, like a Magnetar, with a similar magnetic field at the surface. Moreover, the polarization angle maps for primordial magnetic black holes exhibit unique features, notably absent in other astrophysical magnetic configurations. In this context, we also introduce a simple integral measure, offering a quantitative measure for their discrimination in many scenarios. These traits potentially suggest a robust avenue for their observational detection and differentiation.</description>

      <title>A New Model-Independent Precision Test of General Relativity using LISA Bright Standard Sirens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The upcoming Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), set for launch in the mid-2030s, will enhance our capability to probe the universe through gravitational waves (GWs) emitted from binary black holes (BBHs) across a broad range of cosmological distances. LISA is projected to observe three classes of BBHs: massive BBHs (MBBHs), extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), and stellar mass BBHs. This study focuses on MBBHs, which are anticipated to occur in gas-rich environments conducive to producing powerful electromagnetic (EM) counterparts. This capability to precisely localize MBH events in the sky positions them as excellent candidates for bright sirens. By combining GW luminosity distance measurements from these bright sirens with Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements derived from galaxy clustering and sound horizon measurements from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), we propose a data-driven model-independent method to reconstruct deviations in the variation of the effective Planck mass (in conjunction with the Hubble constant) as a function of cosmic redshift. Using this multi-messenger technique, we achieve precise measurements of deviations in the effective Planck mass variation with redshift (z), with a precision ranging from approximately $2.4\%$ to $7.2\%$ from redshift $z=1$ to $z=6$ with a single event. Additionally, we achieved a measurement of the Hubble constant with a precision of about $1.3\%$, accounting for variations in the effective Planck mass over 4 years of observation time ($T_{\mathrm{obs}}$). This assumes that EM counterparts are detected for $75\%$ of the events. This precision improves with observation time as $T_{\mathrm{obs}}^{-1/2}$. This approach not only has the potential to reveal deviations from General Relativity but also to significantly expand our understanding of the universe's fundamental physical properties.</description>

      <title>Strong gravitational lenses from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Like many areas of astrophysics and cosmology, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory will be transformational for almost all the applications of strong lensing, thanks to the dramatic increase in the number of known strong lenses by two orders of magnitude or more and the readily available time-domain data for the lenses with transient sources. In this article, we provide an overview of the forecasted number of discovered lenses of different types and describe the primary science cases these large lens samples will enable. We provide an updated forecast on the joint constraint for the dark energy equation-of-state parameters, $w_0$ and $w_a$, from combining all strong lensing probes of dark energy. We update the previous forecast from the Rubin Observatory Dark Energy Science Collaboration's Science Review Document by adding two new crucial strong lensing samples: lensed Type Ia supernovae and single-deflector lenses with measured stellar kinematics. Finally, we describe the current and near-future activities and collaborative efforts within the strong lensing community in preparation for the arrival of the first real dataset from Rubin in early 2026.</description>

      <title>Primordial black hole formation from self-resonant preheating?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the question of how generic is the formation of primordial black holes via self-resonant growth of inflaton fluctuations in the post-inflationary, preheating phase. Using analytical and lattice calculations, we find that primordial black hole production is far from being a generic outcome. Also, in most of the parameter space of viable inflationary models, the metric preheating term is subleading to the anharmonic terms and the approximation of a quadratic potential for describing the resonance dynamics is inadequate. Nonetheless, the anharmonicity of the potential cannot be used to rescue the mechanism: The generic outcome of the non-linear evolution of the scalar field in this case is the formation of metastable transients or oscillons, that do not generically collapse into black holes.</description>

      <title>Extending MGCAMB tests of gravity to nonlinear scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modified Growth with CAMB (MGCAMB) is a patch for the Einstein-Boltzmann solver CAMB for cosmological tests of gravity. Until now, MGCAMB was limited to scales well-described by linear perturbation theory. In this work, we extend the framework with a phenomenological model that can capture nonlinear corrections in a broad range of modified gravity theories. The extension employs the publicly available halo model reaction code ReACT, developed for modeling the nonlinear corrections to cosmological observables in extensions of the $\Lambda$CDM model. The nonlinear extension makes it possible to use a wider range of data from large scale structure surveys, without applying a linear scale cut. We demonstrate that, with the 3$\times$2pt Dark Energy Survey data, we achieve a stronger constraint on the linear phenomenological functions $\mu$ and $\Sigma$, after marginalizing over the additional nonlinear parameter $p_1$, compared to the case without the nonlinear extension and using a linear cut. The new version of MGCAMB is now forked with CAMB on GitHub allowing for compatibility with future upgrades.</description>

      <title>Acceleration of the Universe without the Hubble tension with Kaniadakis holographic dark energy using the Hubble horizon as the IR cut-off</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a holographic dark energy model that incorporates the first-order approximate Kaniadaski entropy, utilizing the Hubble horizon, $1/H$, as the infrared cutoff. We investigate the cosmological evolution within this framework. The model introduces an extra parameter relative to the $\Lambda$CDM model. It posits a Universe that is initially dominated by dark matter, which then evolves to a phase where dark energy becomes the predominant component, with this transition occurring at a redshift of approximately $z \sim 0.419$. The energy density of dark energy is ultimately expected to become constant, thereby circumventing the potential issue of a "big rip". Employing the most recent Type Ia supernova and Hubble parameter data, we constrain the model's parameters and find a Hubble constant of $H_0=72.8$ km/s/Mpc, thereby resolving the Hubble tension issue. The estimated age of the Universe, based on the best-fit parameter values, is $14.2$ Gyr. Furthermore, we predict the number of strong gravitational lenses and conduct statefinder and $Om$ diagnostic analyses to validate and characterize the model.</description>

      <title>CMB bounds on primordial black holes with dark matter mini-halos: the role of radiative feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of the cosmic microwave background constrain the abundance of primordial black holes, as these would accrete gas and inject energy into the cosmological medium. We have revisited these constraints, taking into account the local heating and ionisation of the gas around the black holes. While constraints for \textit{naked} black holes are not significantly affected, bounds including dark matter mini-halos are drastically relaxed. This result suggests that previous analysis may have significantly overestimated the role of dark matter mini-halos in boosting the accretion rates.</description>

      <title>The Stability of the BAO Linear Point under Modified Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAOs) are crucial in cosmological analysis, providing a standard ruler, as well as constraints on dark energy. In General Relativity models, the BAO Linear Point - the midpoint between the dip and the peak in the correlation function - has been shown to be rather robust to evolution and redshift space distortions. We show that this remains true even when the gravity model is not General Relativity, at least for $f(R)$ and DGP gravity models which have the same expansion history as the standard $\Lambda$CDM. For the Linear Point to be able to distinguish between modified gravity (MG) and $\Lambda$CDM, survey volumes of order tens of cubic Gpc are required.</description>

      <title>ODIN: Identifying Protoclusters and Cosmic Filaments Traced by Ly$\alpha$-emitting Galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To understand the formation and evolution of massive cosmic structures, studying them at high redshift, in the epoch when they formed the majority of their mass is essential. The One-hundred-deg$^2$ DECam Imaging in Narrowbands (ODIN) survey is undertaking the widest-area narrowband program to date, to use Ly$\alpha$-emitting galaxies (LAEs) to trace the large-scale structure (LSS) of the Universe at three cosmic epochs. In this work, we present results at $z$ = 3.1 based on early ODIN data in the COSMOS field. We identify and characterize protoclusters and cosmic filaments using multiple methods and discuss their strengths and weaknesses. We then compare our observations against the IllustrisTNG suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. The two are in excellent agreement, with a similar number and angular size of structures identified above a specified density threshold. We are able to recover the simulated protoclusters with $\log$(M$_{z=0}$/$M_\odot$) $\gtrsim$ 14.4 in $\sim$ 60\% of the cases. With these objects we show that the descendant masses of the protoclusters in our sample can be estimated purely based on our 2D measurements, finding a median $z$ = 0 mass of $\sim10^{14.5}$M$_\odot$. The lack of information on the radial extent of each protocluster introduces a $\sim$0.4~dex uncertainty in its descendant mass. Finally, we show that the recovery of the cosmic web in the vicinity of protoclusters is both efficient and accurate. The similarity of our observations and the simulations imply that our structure selection is likewise robust and efficient, demonstrating that LAEs are reliable tracers of the LSS.</description>

      <title>Dark Neutrino Moments From Light Loops</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active and sterile neutrinos may acquire "dark moments" via one-loop diagrams with a massless dark photon and new light particles in the loop. Due to the kinetic mixing between the dark photon and the Standard Model photon, neutrinos would obtain effective electromagnetic moments. This mechanism allows for enhanced electromagnetic moments that can evade constraints on particles directly charged under electromagnetism. We show that in a wide region of parameter space, the model features testable predictions for the anapole and magnetic moment of active and sterile neutrinos with dark matter direct detection experiments sensitive to the solar neutrino flux.</description>

      <title>Exponential gravity with logarithmic corrections in the presence of axion dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An exponential modified gravity with additional logarithmic corrections is considered with the presence of an axion-like scalar field in the role of dark matter. Axion fields are thought to become important at late-times when the axion-like scalar field oscillates around its vacuum expectation value, mimicking dark matter behaviour. The model is compared with the usual pressureless fluid description of dark matter. Both models are tested with observational data including some of the latest sources, providing similar fits in comparison with the $\Lambda$CDM model. Despite results are not statistically relevant to rule out any model, the number of free parameters still favours $\Lambda$CDM model, as shown by computing the goodness of the fits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate thermodynamics of apparent horizon in the $f(Q)$ universe with trivial and nontrivial connections. We first explore the perspectives of the first law, generalized second law and $P-V$ phase transition with trivial connection. We show that the lowest-order correction of entropy has the same form as that in loop quantum gravity, and the critical exponents of the phase transition caused by the lowest-order correction are consistent with those in mean field theory. We then examine the thermodynamic implication of nontrivial connections. We find that nontrivial connections in the $f(Q)$ universe imply non-equilibrium states from the perspective of thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone Boson Production from Inflaton Coupling during Reheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The existence of pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson (pNGB) fields is a common feature in many models beyond the Standard Model, characterized by their exclusive derivative couplings. This paper investigates a scenario where a pNGB is coupled to the inflaton field during the reheating phase of the early universe. We calculate the perturbative decay rate of a coherently oscillating inflaton into pNGBs on a general basis, considering both constant and field-dependent couplings with monomial potentials at the minimum. As a concrete application, we explore the production of axions when the radial mode of the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) scalar serves as the inflaton, particularly in the presence of a large gravitational non-minimal coupling. Our findings suggest that the presence of pNGBs during reheating can lead to significant non-thermal relics, offering new constraints on inflationary reheating models and providing potential observational signatures in the form of dark radiation.</description>

      <title>To curve, or not to curve: Is curvature-assisted quintessence observationally viable?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-field models of accelerated expansion with nearly flat potentials, despite being able to provide observationally viable explanations for the early-time cosmic inflation and the late-time cosmic acceleration, are in strong tension with string theory evidence and the associated de Sitter swampland constraints. It has recently been argued that in an open universe, where the spatial curvature is negative (i.e., with $\Omega_k&gt;0$), a new stable fixed point arises, which may lead to viable single-field-based accelerated expansion with an arbitrarily steep potential. Here we show, through a dynamical systems analysis and a Bayesian statistical inference of cosmological parameters, that the additional cosmological solutions based on the new fixed point do not render steep-potential, single-field, accelerated expansion observationally viable. We mainly focus on quintessence models of dark energy, but we also argue that a similar conclusion can be drawn for cosmic inflation.</description>

      <title>Measuring gravitational wave memory with LISA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) astronomy has revolutionized our capacity to explore nature. The next generation of observatories, among which the space-borne detector Laser Interferometer Space Antenna LISA, is expected to yield orders of magnitude of signal-to-noise ratio improvement, and reach fainter and novel features of General Relativity. Among them, an exciting possibility is the detection of GW memory. Interpreted as a permanent deformation of the background spacetime after a GW perturbation has passed through the detector, GW memory offers a novel avenue to proof-test General Relativity, access the non-linear nature of gravity, and provide complementary information for a better characterization of the GW source. Previous studies have shown that GW memory detection from individual mergers of massive black hole binaries is expected with LISA. However, these works have not simulated the proper time domain response of the detector to the GW memory. This work is filling this gap and presents the detection prospects of LISA regarding GW memory and the expected signature of GW memory on the data-streams using the most up-to-date LISA consortium simulations of the response, as well as GW memory time-series computation inherited from numerical relativity. We will confront the LISA observation window to massive black hole binary mergers' population forecasted with the state-of-the-art population models and evaluate the odds and the expected accuracies regarding GW memory observations in the LISA lifetime. We conclude that GW memory will be a key feature of several events detected by LISA, and will help to exploit the scientific potential of the mission fully.</description>

      <title>Measuring the CMB spectral distortions with COSMO: the multi-mode antenna system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present the design and manufacturing of the two multi-mode antenna arrays of the COSMO experiment and the preliminary beam pattern measurements of their fundamental mode compared with simulations.
  COSMO is a cryogenic Martin-Puplett Fourier Transform Spectrometer that aims at measuring the isotropic y-type spectral distortion of the Cosmic Microwave Background from Antarctica, by performing differential measurements between the sky and an internal, cryogenic reference blackbody. To reduce the atmospheric contribution, a spinning wedge mirror performs fast sky-dips at varying elevations while fast, low-noise Kinetic Inductance detectors scan the interferogram.
  Two arrays of antennas couple the radiation to the detectors. Each array consists of nine smooth-walled multi-mode feed-horns, operating in the $120-180$ GHz and $210-300$ GHz range, respectively. The multi-mode propagation helps increase the instrumental sensitivity without employing large focal planes with hundreds of detectors. The two arrays have a step-linear and a linear profile, respectively, and are obtained by superimposing aluminum plates made with CNC milling. The simulated multi-mode beam pattern has a $\sim 20^{\circ} - 26^{\circ}$ FWHM for the low-frequency array and $\sim 16^{\circ}$ FWHM for the high-frequency one. The side lobes are below $-15$ dB.
  To characterize the antenna response, we measured the beam pattern of the fundamental mode using a Vector Network Analyzer, in far-field conditions inside an anechoic chamber at room temperature. We completed the measurements of the low-frequency array and found a good agreement with the simulations. We also identified a few non-idealities that we attribute to the measuring setup and will further investigate. A comprehensive multi-mode measurement will be feasible at cryogenic temperature once the full receiver is integrated.</description>

      <title>Interacting light thermal-relic dark matter: self-consistent cosmological bounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14223v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze cosmic microwave background (CMB) data to constrain the mass and interaction strengths of thermally-produced dark matter (DM) in a self-consistent manner, simultaneously taking into account the cosmological effects of its mass and interactions. The presence of a light thermal-relic particle contributes non-negligibly to the radiation density during Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), altering the light-element yields, as well as the the effective number of relativistic particle species. On the other hand, DM interactions with the Standard Model can affect distribution of matter in later universe. Both mass and interactions alter CMB anisotropy on sub-degree scales. To understand and quantify the interplay of these effects, we consider elastic DM-baryon scattering with a momentum-transfer cross section that scales as a power law of the relative velocity between the scattering particles. In the range of thermal-relic DM masses relevant for BBN ($\lesssim$ 20 MeV), we find that the reconstruction of the DM mass and the scattering cross section from the CMB data features strong degeneracies; modeling the two effects simultaneously increases the sensitivity of the CMB measurements to both fundamental properties of DM. Additionally, we study the effects of late-time residual annihilation of a light thermal relic and provide improved CMB constraints on the DM mass and annihilation cross section. To examine degeneracy between DM mass, cross section for elastic scattering with baryons, and annihilation cross section, we consider a specific case of DM with an electric and magnetic dipole moments. We present new, self-consistent cosmological bounds for this model and discuss implications for future searches.</description>

      <title>Mass calibration of DES Year-3 clusters via SPT-3G CMB cluster lensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02153v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We measure the stacked lensing signal in the direction of galaxy clusters in the Dark Energy Survey Year 3 (DES Y3) redMaPPer sample, using cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature data from SPT-3G, the third-generation CMB camera on the South Pole Telescope (SPT). We estimate the lensing signal using temperature maps constructed from the initial 2 years of data from the SPT-3G 'Main' survey, covering 1500 deg$^2$ of the Southern sky. We then use this signal as a proxy for the mean cluster mass of the DES sample. In this work, we employ three versions of the redMaPPer catalogue: a Flux-Limited sample containing 8865 clusters, a Volume-Limited sample with 5391 clusters, and a Volume&amp;Redshift-Limited sample with 4450 clusters. For the three samples, we find the mean cluster masses to be ${M}_{200{\rm{m}}}=1.66\pm0.13$ [stat.]$\pm0.03$ [sys.], $1.97\pm0.18$ [stat.]$\pm0.05$ [sys.], and $2.11\pm0.20$ [stat.]$\pm0.05$ [sys.]$\times{10}^{14}\ {\rm{M}}_{\odot }$, respectively. This is a factor of $\sim2$ improvement relative to the precision of measurements with previous generations of SPT surveys and the most constraining cluster mass measurements using CMB cluster lensing to date. Overall, we find no significant tensions between our results and masses given by redMaPPer mass-richness scaling relations of previous works, which were calibrated using CMB cluster lensing, optical weak lensing, and velocity dispersion measurements from various combinations of DES, SDSS and Planck data. We then divide our sample into 3 redshift and 3 richness bins, finding no significant tensions with optical weak-lensing calibrated masses in these bins. We forecast a $5.7\%$ constraint on the mean cluster mass of the DES Y3 sample with the complete SPT-3G surveys when using both temperature and polarization data and including an additional $\sim1400$ deg$^2$ of observations from the 'Extended' SPT-3G survey.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Cosmological Models from Quasars Calibrated with Type Ia Supernova by a Gaussian Process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15913v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we use quasars calibrated from type Ia supernova (SN Ia) to constrain cosmological models. We consider three different X-ray luminosity ($L_{X}$) - ultraviolet luminosity ($L_{UV}$) relations of quasars, i.e., the standard $L_{X}$-$L_{UV}$ relation and two redshift-evolutionary relations (Type I and Type II) respectively constructed from copula and considering a redshift correction to the luminosity of quasars. Only in the case of the Type I relation, quasars can always provide effective constraints on the $\Lambda$CDM model. Furthermore, we show that, when the observational Hubble data (OHD) are added, the constraints on the absolute magnitude $M$ of SN Ia and the Hubble constant $H_0$ can be obtained. In the $\Lambda$CDM model, the OHD measurements plus quasars with the Type I relation yields $M$ =$-19.321^{+0.085}_{-0.076}$, which is in good agreement with the measurement from SH0ES ($M=-19.253\pm{0.027}$), and $H_0$ = $70.80\pm3.6~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}Mpc^{-1}}$, falling between the measurements from SH0ES and the Planck cosmic microwave background radiation data.</description>

      <title>Joint Modelling of Astrophysical Systematics for Cosmology with LSST</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel framework for jointly modelling the weak lensing source galaxy redshift distribution and the intrinsic alignment of galaxies via a shared luminosity function (LF). Considering this framework within the context of a Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) Year 1 and Year 10 cosmic shear analysis, we first demonstrate the substantial impact of the LF on both source galaxy redshift distributions and the intrinsic alignment contamination. We establish how the individual parameters of a Schechter LF model impact the redshift distribution of a magnitude-limited sample, and we demonstrate the effect of marginalising over the LF parameters as incorporated in the intrinsic alignment modelling of a standard cosmic shear analysis set-up. We forecast the impact of our joint modelling framework on cosmological parameter constraints. Our preliminary results are promising, indicating that this framework can yield cosmological constraints consistent with those expected from standard analyses, enhanced by the flexibility of not fixing LF parameters. We plan to further validate these findings with comprehensive Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations to robustly quantify bias avoidance and underscore the framework's efficacy. Taking advantage of our forecasting results and the parameter degeneracies, we identify the specific impact of the shape of the LF of source galaxies on the cosmic shear data vector. We also discuss the potential of this method in providing a way to model generic selection functions in redshift distribution estimation, as well as its possibilities for extension to a 3x2pt analysis, particularly with respect to incorporating galaxy bias in this luminosity-function-based framework. Although we consider the context of LSST cosmic shear in this work, the proposed joint modelling framework is generically applicable to weak lensing surveys.</description>

Abstract: We present a new paradigm for the production of the dark matter (DM) relic abundance based on the evaporation of early Universe primordial black holes (PBHs) themselves formed from DM particles. As a concrete realization, we consider a minimal model of the dark sector in which a first-order phase transition results in the formation of Fermiball remnants that collapse to PBHs, which then emit DM particles. We show that the regurgitated DM scenario allows for DM in the mass range $\sim1$ GeV $- \,10^{16}$ GeV, thereby unlocking parameter space considered excluded.</description>

Abstract: By using the ultra-deep \textit{JWST}/MIRI image at 5.6 $\mu m$ in the Hubble eXtreme Deep Field, we constrain the role of strong H$\alpha$-emitters (HAEs) during Cosmic Reionization at $z\simeq7-8$. Our sample of HAEs is comprised of young ($&lt;35\;\rm Myr$) galaxies, except for one single galaxy ($\approx 300\;\rm Myr$), with low stellar masses ($\lesssim 10^{9}\;\rm M_{\odot}$). These HAEs show a wide range of UV-$\beta$ slopes, with a median value of $\beta = -2.15\pm0.21$ which broadly correlates with stellar mass. We estimate the ionizing photon production efficiency ($\xi_{ion,0}$) of these sources (assuming $f_{esc,LyC} = 0\%$), which yields a median value $\rm log_{10}(\xi_{ion,0}/(Hz\;erg^{-1})) = 25.50^{+0.10}_{-0.12}$. We show that $\xi_{ion,0}$ positively correlates with EW$_{0}$(H$\alpha$) and specific star formation rate (sSFR). Instead $\xi_{ion,0}$ weakly anti-correlates with stellar mass and $\beta$. Based on the $\beta$ values, we predict $f_{esc, LyC}=4\%^{+3}_{-2}$, which results in $\rm log_{10}(\xi_{ion}/(Hz\;erg^{-1})) = 25.55^{+0.11}_{-0.13}$. Considering this and related findings from the literature, we find a mild evolution of $\xi_{ion}$with redshift. Additionally, our results suggest that these HAEs require only modest escape fractions ($f_{esc, rel}$) of 6$-$15\% to reionize their surrounding intergalactic medium. By only considering the contribution of these HAEs, we estimated their total ionizing emissivity ($\dot{N}_{ion}$) as $\dot{N}_{ion} = 10^{50.53 \pm 0.45}; \text{s}^{-1}\text{Mpc}^{-3}$. When comparing their $\dot{N}_{ion}$ with "non-H$\alpha$ emitter" galaxies across the same redshift range, we find that that strong, young, and low-mass emitters may have played an important role during Cosmic Reionization.</description>

      <title>A minimal solution to the axion isocurvature problem from a non-minimal coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06441v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main limitation for pre-inflationary breaking of Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry is the upper bound on the Hubble rate during inflation from axion isocurvature fluctuations. This leads to a tension between high scale inflation and QCD axions with Grand Unified Theory (GUT) scale decay constants, which reduces the potential for a detection of tensor modes at next generation CMB experiments. We propose a mechanism that excplicitly breaks PQ symmetry via non-minimal coupling to gravity, that lifts the axion mass above the Hubble scale during inflation and has negligible impact on today's axion potential. The initially heavy axion gets trapped at an intermediate minimum during inflation given by the phase of the non-minimal coupling, before it moves to its true CP-conserving minimum after inflation. During this stage it undergoes coherent oscillations around an adiabatically decreasing minimum, which slightly dilutes the axion energy density, while still being able to explain the observed dark matter relic abundance. This scenario can be tested by the combination of next generation CMB surveys like CMB-S4 and LiteBIRD with haloscopes such as ABRACADABRA or CASPEr-Electric.</description>

      <title>Constraints and Time Evolution in Generic $f$(Riemann) Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12037v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a detailed canonical analysis of the $n$-dimensional $f$(Riemann) gravity, correcting the earlier results in the literature. We also write the field equations in the Fischer-Marsden form which is amenable to identifying the non-stationary energy on a spacelike hypersurface. We give pure $R^{2}$ theory as an example.</description>
