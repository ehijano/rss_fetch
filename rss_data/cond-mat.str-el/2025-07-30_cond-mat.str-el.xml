      <title>Anomalies of global symmetries on the lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 't Hooft anomalies of global symmetries play a fundamental role in quantum many-body systems and quantum field theory (QFT). In this paper, we make a systematic analysis of lattice anomalies - the analog of 't Hooft anomalies in lattice systems - for which we give a precise definition. Crucially, a lattice anomaly is not a feature of a specific Hamiltonian, but rather is a topological invariant of the symmetry action. The controlled setting of lattice systems allows for a systematic and rigorous treatment of lattice anomalies, shorn of the technical challenges of QFT. We find that lattice anomalies reproduce the expected properties of QFT anomalies in many ways, but also have crucial differences. In particular, lattice anomalies and QFT anomalies are not, contrary to a common expectation, in one-to-one correspondence, and there can be non-trivial anomalies on the lattice that are infrared (IR) trivial: they admit symmetric trivial gapped ground states, and map to trivial QFT anomalies at low energies. Nevertheless, we show that lattice anomalies (including IR-trivial ones) have a number of interesting consequences in their own right, including connections to commuting projector models, phases of many-body localized (MBL) systems, and quantum cellular automata (QCA). We make substantial progress on the classification of lattice anomalies and develop several theoretical tools to characterize their consequences on symmetric Hamiltonians. Our work places symmetries of quantum many-body lattice systems into a unified theoretical framework and may also suggest new perspectives on symmetries in QFT.</description>

      <title>Magnetically ordered yet topologically robust phases emerging in concurrent Kitaev spin liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-orbital generalizations of Kitaev model, such as Yao-Lee model, have attracted recent attention due to their enhanced stability of spin liquid phases against perturbations. Motivated by microscopic calculations for the realization of Yao-Lee model showing additional interactions, we study the phase diagram of the Yao-Lee model with added Kitaev and Heisenberg terms. While the plaquette operator is conserved even in the presence of added perturbations, the model becomes no longer exactly solvable. Using perturbation and Majorana mean-field theory, we find magnetic order can arise in the spin sector while the orbital sector remains a liquid for dominant Kitaev interactions, whereas both sectors form liquid phases when Yao-Lee interactions dominate. Additional Heisenberg exchange can enhance or suppress the magnetic order, revealing a rich coexistence of magnetic and topological phases.</description>

      <title>Anomaly-free symmetries with obstructions to gauging and onsiteability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present counterexamples to the lore that symmetries that cannot be gauged or made on-site are necessarily anomalous. Specifically, we construct unitary, internal symmetries of two-dimensional lattice models that cannot be consistently coupled to background or dynamical gauge fields or disentangled to a tensor product of on-site operators. These symmetries are nevertheless anomaly-free in the sense that they admit symmetric, gapped Hamiltonians with unique, invertible ground states. We show that symmetries of this kind are characterized by an index $[\omega]\in H^2(G,\mathbb{Q}_+)$, where $\mathbb{Q}_+$ is the multiplicative group of rational numbers labeling one-dimensional quantum cellular automata.</description>

      <title>Charge-Transfer Complex $\kappa$-(BEST)$_2$Cu$_2$(CN)$_3$ Analogous to Organic Spin Liquid Candidate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the structural, electrical, and magnetic properties of the organic conductor $\kappa$-(BEST)$_2$Cu$_2$(CN)$_3$ (BEST: bis(ethylenediseleno)tetrathiafulvalene; abbreviated as $\kappa$-BEST-CN), which is isostructural with the quantum spin liquid candidate $\kappa$-(ET)$_2$Cu$_2$(CN)$_3$ (ET: bis(ethylenedithio)tetrathiafulvalene; abbreviated as $\kappa$-ET-CN). Resistivity measurements demonstrate that $\kappa$-BEST-CN exhibits semiconducting behavior, governed by the same conducting mechanism as $\kappa$-ET-CN. Under a pressure of ~0.1 GPa, $\kappa$-BEST-CN undergoes a superconducting transition with an onset temperature of ~4 K. From the comparison of the critical pressures of superconductivity between $\kappa$-ET-CN and $\kappa$-BEST-CN, $\kappa$-BEST-CN can be regarded as a chemically pressurized analogue of $\kappa$-ET-CN. Therefore, $\kappa$-BEST-CN, in which only the effective pressure changes without altering the anion structure, is considered a valuable reference material for elucidating the enigmatic properties observed in $\kappa$-ET-CN. Furthermore, the spin susceptibility of $\kappa$-BEST-CN is slightly larger than that of $\kappa$-ET-CN and shows weaker temperature dependence, which cannot be explained by the localized spin model. This behavior clarifies the anomalous magnetic properties of a system with frustration near the Mott transition, serving to stimulate future theoretical research.</description>

      <title>High-resolution Measurements of Thermal Conductivity Matrix and Search for Thermal Hall Effect in La$_2$CuO$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the longitudinal thermal conductivity $\kappa_{xx}$ and thermal hall conductivity $\kappa_{xy}$ in La$_2$CuO$_4$ at temperatures $T$ between 2 and 20 K in magnetic fields $H$ up to 10 T. Within the temperature and field intervals studied, we do not resolve any thermal Hall signal with a conservative upper bound of $|\kappa_{xy}/T| &lt;1\times10^{-4}$ ${\rm Wm^{-1}K^{-2}}$. The longitudinal thermal conductivity $\kappa_{xx}/T$ agrees well with previous studies, in both magnitude and $T$ dependence. In both channels, we performed measurements using the field-sweep protocol. To achieve high resolution, we carefully took into account relaxation effects after each step-increase in $H$. At low $T$, we find a linear decrease in $\kappa/T$ vs. $H$, as well as weak hysteresis near the meta-magnetic transition of the spin degrees.</description>

      <title>Magneto-cubic and magneto-linear dependence observed in an in-plane anomalous Hall magnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hall effect, particularly that arising from in-plane magnetic field, has recently emerged as a sensitive probe of quantum geometric properties in solids. Especially in trigonal systems, in-plane anomalous Hall effect (AHE) can be explicitly induced by nontrivial off-diagonal coupling between the magnetic field and the Hall vector on the principal plane. Here we elucidate multipolar dependence of the off-diagonal coupling in the in-plane AHE, by systematically measuring on the (001) principal plane of trigonal antiferromagnet EuCd2Sb2 thin films for each magnetic phase. Around zero field, magneto-cubic dependence of anomalous Hall resistivity is clearly observed not only in the paramagnetic phase but also even in the antiferromagnetic phase. An off-diagonal component of the octupolar tensor also exhibits unconventional decay above the magnetic ordering temperature, roughly depending on the inverse temperature to the third power. In the forced ferromagnetic phase, on the other hand, magneto-linear dependence dominantly appears and notably persists up to very high fields. Our findings clarify key aspects of the off-diagonal coupling in the in-plane AHE, paving the way for its future investigations and potential applications beyond conventional expectations about the Hall effect.</description>

      <title>Detecting the Largest Correlations using the Correlation Density Matrix: a Quantum Monte Carlo Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a quantum Monte Carlo-based approach to detect and compute the most dominant correlations for many-body systems without prior knowledge. It is based on the measurement and analysis of the correlation density matrix between two (small) subsystems embedded in the full (large) sample. In order to benchmark this procedure, we investigate zero-temperature quantum phase transitions in one- and two-dimensional quantum Ising model as well as the two-dimensional bilayer Heisenberg antiferromagnet. The method paves the way for a systematic identification of unknown or exotic order parameters in unexplored phases on large systems accessible to quantum Monte Carlo methods.</description>

      <title>Static and Dynamical Characterization of Ground State Phases Induced by Frustration and Magnetic Field in the Spin-1 Orthogonal Dimer Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spin-$1$ orthogonal dimer chain is investigated using the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm. A transformation to a basis that uses the local eigenstates of the orthogonal dimers, while retaining the local spin states for the parallel spins, allows for more effective implementation of the symmetries, as well as mitigating the entanglement bias of DMRG. A rich ground state phase diagram is obtained in the parameter space spanned by the ratio of inter- to intra-dimer interaction (which measures the degree of frustration) and an external magnetic field. Some ground state phases exhibit effective Haldane chain character, whereas others exhibit fragmentation of the ground state wavefunction, or clustering. The phases are characterized by their static properties, including (local) spin quantum number, entanglement entropy, and the spin-spin correlation function. Detailed characterization of a carefully selected set of representative states is presented. The static properties are complemented by exploring the low-energy dynamics through the calculation of the dynamic structure factor. The results provide crucial insight into the emergence of complex ground state phases from the interplay between strong interactions, geometric frustration, and external magnetic field for interacting S=1 Heisenberg spins.</description>

      <title>Heating Dynamics of Correlated Fermions under Dephasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dissipative dynamics of correlated fermions evolving in presence of a local dephasing bath. To this extent we consider the infinite coordination limit of the corresponding Lindblad master equation, provided by Dynamical Mean-Field Theory for open quantum systems. We solve the resulting quantum impurity problem, describing an Anderson impurity coupled to a local dephasing, using weak-coupling perturbation theory in interaction and dephasing. We show that the dissipative dynamics describes heating towards infinite temperature, with a relaxation rate that depends strongly on interaction. The resulting steady-state spectral functions are however non-trivial and show an interplay between coherent quasiparticle peak and local dephasing. We then discuss how thermalization towards infinite temperature emerges within DMFT, by solving the impurity problem throughout its self-consistency. We show that thermalization under open quantum system dynamics is qualitatively different from the closed system case. In particular, the thermalization front found in the unitary is strongly modified, a signature of the irreversibility of the open system dynamics.</description>

      <title>Effect of applied pressure on the non-relativistic spin-splitting (NRSS) of FeSb2 altermagnet: A first-principles study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have investigated the pressure-dependent electronic structure, phonon stability, and anomalous Hall response of the recently discovered altermagnet FeSb2 from density functional theory (DFT) and Wannier function analysis. From density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) calculations, we have found that FeSb2 remains dynamically stable up to 10 GPa, evidenced by positive phonon frequencies. Our spin-polarised band structure shows that the node of band crossing between spin-up and spin-down bands around the Fermi energy exactly lies at the Gamma and A-symmetry points. The Fermi crossing is mostly exhibited by band-24, band-25 and band-26. The non-relativistic spin-splitting (NRSS) along M'-Gamma-M and A-Z-A' symmetry is attributed to the broken time-reversal (PT ) symmetry. There are significant changes in the band profile under applied pressure, as one can see the shifting of the node of band-24 and band-26 towards the lower energy side. The NRSS exhibited by band-24 along M'-Gamma-M symmetry is notably small. Although the strength of NRSS of band-26 along A-Z-A' symmetry is significant but reduces under applied pressure. The anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) values are prominent in -1 to 1 eV range. A sharp peaked and positive AHC values at ambient pressure, becomes spectrally broadened and negative at 10 GPa due to pressure-induced band crossings and redistribution of Berry curvature near the Fermi level. We have observed that the values of spin hall conductivity (SHC) are around 2-2.5 times lower as compared to AHC and prominent in between -1.0 eV to 1.0 eV. Our results establish FeSb2 as a tunable altermagnetic candidate where pressure can modulate both topological transport and dynamic stability, offering opportunities for strain-engineered Hall responses in compensated magnetic systems.</description>

      <title>Robust qubit interactions mediated by photonic topological edge states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the coupling of two spatially separated qubits via topologically protected edge states in a two-dimensional Hofstadter lattice. In this hybrid platform, the qubits are coupled to distinct edge sites of the lattice, enabling long-range interactions mediated by topological edge modes. We solve the full system Hamiltonian and analyze the resulting eigenstate structure to uncover the conditions under which coherent qubit interactions emerge. Our analysis reveals that the effective coupling is highly sensitive to the qubit placement, energy detuning, and the topological character of the edge spectrum. We obtain an analytical solution that goes beyond the perturbative regime, capturing the full interplay between the qubits and edge modes. These results provide a foundation for exploring information transport and many-body effects in engineered quantum systems where interactions are mediated by topological edge modes.</description>

      <title>Excitation and tunneling spectra of a fractional quantum Hall system in the thin cylinder limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The excitations of fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) states have been largely inaccessible to experimental probes until recently. New electron scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) results from Hu et.al. (2023) show promise in detecting and identifying these excited states via the local density of states (LDOS) spectrum. On a torus, there exists a mapping to a 1D lattice Hamiltonian with center-of-mass or dipole moment conservation. In this work, we apply perturbation theory starting from the thin cylinder limit ($L_x \rightarrow \infty, L_y &lt;l_B$ for torus dimensions $L_x$ and $L_y$) to obtain an analytical approach to the low-lying neutral and charged excitations of the $\nu =1/3$ FQHE state. Notably, in the thin cylinder we can systematically enumerate all the low-lying excitations by the patterns of 'dipoles' formed by the electron occupation pattern on the 1D lattice. We find that the thin-cylinder limit predicts a significant dispersion of the low-lying neutral excitations but sharpness of the LDOS spectra, which measure charged excitations. We also discuss connections between our work and several different approaches to the FQHE STM spectra, including those using the composite fermion theory. Numerical exact diagonalization beyond the thin-cylinder limit suggests that the energies of charged excitations remain largely confined to a narrow range of energies, which in experiments might appear as a single peak.</description>

      <title>Non-interacting fractional topological Stark insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fractional topological phases, such as the fractional quantum Hall state, usually rely on strong interactions to generate ground state degeneracy with gap protection and fractionalized topological response. Here, we propose a fractional topological phase without interaction in $(1+1)$-dimension, which is driven by the Stark localization on top of topological flat bands, different from the conventional mechanism of the strongly correlated fractional topological phases. A linear potential gradient applied to the flat bands drives the Stark localization, under which the Stark localized states may hybridize and leads to a new gap in the real space, dubbed the real space energy gap (RSEG). Unlike the integer topological band insulator obtained in the weak linear potential regime without closing the original bulk gap, the fractional topological Stark insulating phase is resulted from the RSEG when the linear potential gradient exceeds a critical value. We develop a theoretical formalism to characterize the fractional topological Stark insulator, and further show that the many-body state under topological pumping returns to the initial state only after multiple $2\pi$ periods of evolution, giving the fractional charge pumping, similar to that in fractional quantum Hall state. Finally, we propose how to realize the fractional topological Stark insulator in real experiment.</description>

      <title>A Hierarchy of Topological and Superconducting States in Rhombohedral Hexalayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconductivity and the quantum Hall effect are conventionally viewed as mutually exclusive: the former is suppressed by magnetic fields, while the latter relies on them. Here, we report the surprising coexistence of these two phenomena in rhombohedral hexalayer graphene. In this system, a superconducting phase is not destroyed -- but instead stabilized -- by an out-of-plane magnetic field. Strikingly, this superconducting state coexists and competes with a sequence of quantum Hall states that appear at both integer and half-integer Landau level fillings. Both the superconducting and quantum Hall states exhibit sharply defined thermal transitions or crossovers, with nearly identical onset temperatures -- pointing to a shared underlying mechanism. Taken together, our observations uncover an unprecedented interplay between superconducting and topological phases, challenging conventional paradigms and opening a new frontier in condensed matter physics.</description>

      <title>Manipulating non-abelian anyons of Kitaev quantum spin liquids with local magnetic fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.11092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-abelian anyonic excitations of quantum spin liquids have potential for application to topological quantum computation, but designing logical operations requires developing protocols to faithfully create, move, and read-out such quasiparticles. In this paper, we present a protocol that manipulates the $Z_2$ fluxes (``visons''), and their bound Majorana zero mode, of the Kitaev model. This is achieved by adiabatically switching-off and -on interaction terms in the Hamiltonian, and applying a local magnetic field. We test our protocol by exchanging two Majorana zero modes, analysing the errors it produces. We find that the error rate of our protocol can be suppressed exponentially by increasing the adiabatic turn-on time and the size of the system. However, realistic implementations must consider the trade off between different error sources.</description>

      <title>Disentangling real space fluctuations: the diagnostics of metal-insulator transitions beyond single-particle spectral functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The destruction of metallicity due to the mutual Coulomb interaction of quasiparticles gives rise to fascinating phenomena of solid state physics such as the Mott metal-insulator transition and the pseudogap. A key observable characterizing their occurrences is the single-particle spectral function, determined by the fermionic self-energy. In this paper we investigate in detail how real space fluctuations are responsible for a self-energy that drives the Mott-Hubbard metal-insulator transition. To this aim we first introduce a real space fluctuation diagnostics approach to the Hedin equation, which connects the fermion-boson coupling vertex $\lambda$ to the self-energy $\Sigma$. Second, by using cellular dynamical mean-field theory calculations for $\lambda$ we identify the leading physical processes responsible for the destruction of metallicity across the transition.</description>

      <title>Dispersion of neutral collective modes in partonic fractional quantum Hall states and its applications to paired states of composite fermions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02686v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Moore-Read Pfaffian (Pf) state exhibits two distinct neutral excitation modes, the bosonic magnetoroton mode, and the neutral fermion mode. These two modes have been conjectured to be supersymmetric (SUSY) partners in the long-wavelength limit. Previous studies on these neutral excitations of the Pf state have shown evidence in favor of SUSY in the vicinity of the second Landau level (SLL) Coulomb interaction. Inspired by that, using the framework of parton theory, we test the SUSY conjecture for a state that lies in the same universality class as the particle-hole conjugate of the Pf, namely the anti-Pf (aPf) state, by constructing explicit wave functions for its magnetoroton and neutral fermion excitations and evaluating them for very large system sizes. As with the previous studies on the Pf state, we find that the long-wavelength gaps of the neutral modes of the parton state belonging to the same topological class as the aPf are close to each other for the SLL Coulomb interaction. Furthermore, using the parton wave functions, we compute the dispersion of various neutral collective excitations, including the magnetoroton, neutral fermion, and parton-excitons, for several notable non-Abelian and Abelian states. Finally, we propose a parton-exciton ansatz for the gapped neutral excitation of the composite fermion Fermi liquid at quarter filling and compute its dispersion for the Coulomb interaction in the lowest Landau level.</description>

      <title>Coherent cellular dynamical mean-field theory: a real-space quantum embedding approach to disorder in strongly correlated electron systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate a quantum embedding algorithm in real-space for the simultaneous theoretical treatment of nonlocal electronic correlations and disorder, the coherent cellular dynamical mean-field theory (C-CDMFT). This algorithm combines the molecular coherent potential approximation with the cellular dynamical mean-field theory. After a pedagogical review of quantum embedding theories for disordered and interacting electron systems, and a detailed discussion of its work flow, we present first results from C-CDMFT for the half-filled two-dimensional Anderson-Hubbard model on a square lattice: (i) the analysis of its Mott metal-insulator transition as a function of disorder strength, and (ii) the impact of different types of disorder on its magnetic phase diagram. For the latter, by means of a ``disorder diagnostics'', we are able to precisely identify the contributions of different disorder configurations to the system's magnetic response.</description>

      <title>Single-Particle Dispersion and Density of States of the Half-Filled 2D Hubbard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Implementing an improved method for analytic continuation and working with imaginary-time correlation functions computed using quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we resolve the single-particle dispersion relation and the density of states (DOS) of the two-dimensional Hubbard model at half-filling. At intermediate interactions of $U/t = 4,6$, we find quadratic dispersion around the gap minimum at wave-vectors $\mathbf{k} = (\pm \pi/2, \pm \pi/2)$ (the $\Sigma$ points). We find saddle points at $\mathbf{k} = (\pm \pi,0),(0,\pm \pi)$ (the X points) where the dispersion is approximately quartic, leading to a sharp DOS maximum above the almost flat ledge arising from the states close to $\Sigma$. The fraction of quasiparticle states within the ledge is $n_{\rm ledge} \approx 0.15$. Upon doping away from half-filling, within the rigid-band approximation, these results support Fermi pockets around the $\Sigma$ points, with states around the X points becoming filled only at doping fractions $x \ge n_{\rm ledge}$. The high density of states away from the $\Sigma$ gap edge may be an important clue for a finite minimum doping level for superconductivity and other instabilities of doped Mott insulators.</description>

      <title>Ordered phases and superconductivity in two-dimensional electron systems subject to pair spin-orbit interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06190v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pair spin-orbit interaction can emerge in strongly-interacting systems characterized by a large spin-orbit coupling. Here we study the role of this interaction in stabilizing ordered and unconventional superconducting phases. We find that, if the system avoids superconductivity, the order realized is a combination of charge-density and spin-vorticity waves. The latter is reminiscent of a loop-current state, albeit in the spin, rather in the charge, channel. If the system becomes superconducting, the order parameter assumes the form of a paired density wave, i.e. pairing occurs at finite momentum. Intriguingly, one of the possible pairings acquires a form analogous to Amperean superconductivity. However, the order parameter here is always a blend of paired density wave and Amperean pairing, rather than being purely one or the other.</description>

      <title>Pressure-enhanced $f$-electron orbital weighting in UTe2 mapped by quantum interferometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03946v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The phase landscape of UTe$_2$ features a remarkable diversity of superconducting phases under applied pressure and magnetic field. Recent quantum oscillation studies at ambient pressure have revealed the quasi-2D Fermi surface of this material. However, the pressure-dependence of the Fermi surface remains an open question. Here we track the evolution of the UTe$_2$ Fermi surface as a function of pressure up to 19.5 kbar by measuring quantum interference oscillations. We find that in sufficient magnetic field to suppress both superconductivity at low pressures and incommensurate antiferromagnetism at higher pressures, the quasi-2D Fermi surface found at ambient pressure smoothly connects to that at 19.5 kbar, with no signs of a reconstruction over this pressure interval. We observe a smooth increase in oscillatory frequency with increasing pressure, indicating that the warping of the cylindrical Fermi sheets continuously increases with pressure. By computing a tight-binding model, we show that this enhanced warping indicates increased $f$-orbital contribution at the Fermi level - up to and beyond the critical pressure at which superconductivity is truncated. These findings highlight the value of high-pressure quantum interference measurements as a new probe of the electronic structure in heavy fermion materials.</description>

      <title>Separable ellipsoids around multipartite states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05400v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that, in finite dimensions, around any $m$-partite product state $\rho_{\rm prod}=\rho_1\otimes...\otimes\rho_m$, there exists an ellipsoid of separable states centered around $\rho_{\rm prod}$. This separable ellipsoid contains the separable ball proposed in previous works, and the volume of the ellipsoid is typically exponentially larger than that of the ball, due to the hierarchy of eigenvalues in typical states. We further generalize this ellipsoidal criterion to a trace formula that yields separable region around all separable states, and further study biseparability. Our criteria not only help numerical procedures to rigorously detect separability, but they also lead to a nested hierarchy of SLOCC-stable subsets that cover the separable set. We apply the procedure for separability detection to 3-qubit X states, genuinely entangled 4-qubit states mixed with noise, and the 1d transverse field Ising model at finite temperature to illustrate the power of our procedure for understanding entanglement in physical systems.</description>

      <title>Chirality-induced orbital Edelstein effect in an analytically solvable model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04978v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS), a phenomenon wherein chiral structures selectively determine the spin polarization of electron currents flowing through the material, has garnered significant attention due to its potential applications in areas such as spintronics, enantioseparation, and catalysis. The underlying physical effect is the Edelstein effect that converts charge to angular momentum. Besides a spin contribution there exists a contribution based on the orbital angular momentum but the precise mechanism for its generation remains yet to be understood. Here, we introduce the minimal model for explaining the phenomenon based on the orbital Edelstein effect. We consider non-local inter-site contributions to the current-induced orbital angular momentum and reveal the underlying mechanism by analytically calculating the Edelstein susceptibilities in a tight-binding and Boltzmann approach. While the orbital angular momentum is directly generated by the chirality of the crystal, the spin contribution of each spin-split band pair relies on spin-orbit coupling. Using tellurium as an example, we show that the orbital contribution surpasses the spin contribution by orders of magnitude.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24223v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using a Drinfeld twist of Jordanian type, we construct a deformation of the non-compact and $\mathfrak{sl}_2$-invariant $XXX_{-1/2}$ spin-chain. Before the deformation, the seed model can be understood as a sector of the $\mathfrak{psu}(2,2|4)$-invariant spin-chain encoding the spectral problem of $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills at one loop in the planar limit. The deformation gives rise to interesting features because, while being integrable, the Hamiltonian is non-hermitian and non-diagonalisable, so that it only admits a Jordan decomposition. Moreover, the eigenvalues of the deformed Hamiltonian coincide with those of the original undeformed spin-chain. We use explicit examples as well as the techniques of the coordinate and of the algebraic Bethe ansatz to discuss the construction of the (generalised) eigenvectors of the deformed model. We also show that the deformed spin-chain is equivalent to an undeformed one with twisted boundary conditions, and that it may be derived from a scaling limit of the non-compact $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$-invariant $XXZ_{-1/2} $ spin-chain.</description>

      <title>Coulomb Interaction-Stabilized Isolated Narrow Bands with Chern Numbers $\mathcal{C} &gt; 1$ in Twisted Rhombohedral Trilayer-Bilayer Graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, fractional quantum anomalous Hall effects have been discovered in two-dimensional moir\'{e} materials when a topologically nontrivial band with Chern number $\mathcal{C}=1$ is partially doped. Remarkably, superlattice Bloch bands can carry higher Chern numbers that defy the Landau-level paradigm and may even host exotic fractionalized states with non-Abelian quasiparticles. Inspired by this exciting possibility, we propose twisted \textit{rhombohedral} trilayer-bilayer graphene at $\theta \sim 1.2^\circ$ as a field-tunable quantum anomalous Chern insulator that features spectrally-isolated, kinetically-quenched, and topologically-nontrivial bands with $\mathcal{C} = 2,3$ favorable for fractional phases once fractionally doped, as characterized by their quantum geometry. Based on extensive self-consistent mean-field calculations, we show that these phases are stabilized by Coulomb interactions and are robust against variations in dielectric environment, tight-binding hopping parameters, and lattice relaxation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11590v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report theoretical best estimates of vertical transition energies (VTEs) for a large number of excited states and molecules: the \textsc{quest} database. This database includes 1489 \emph{aug}-cc-pVTZ VTEs (731 singlets, 233 doublets, 461 triplets, and 64 quartets) for both valence and Rydberg transitions occurring in molecules containing from 1 to 16 non-hydrogen atoms. \textsc{Quest} also includes a significant list of VTEs for states characterized by a partial or genuine double-excitation character, known to be particularly challenging for many computational methods. The vast majority of the reported values are deemed chemically-accurate, that is, are within $\pm0.05$ eV of the FCI/\emph{aug}-cc-pVTZ estimate. This allows for a balanced assessment of the performance of popular excited-state methodologies. We report the results of such benchmarks for various single- and multi-reference wavefunction approaches, and provide extensive supporting information allowing testing of other models. All corresponding data associated with the \textsc{quest} database, along with analysis tools, can be found in the associated \textsc{GitHub} repository at the following URL: https://github.com/pfloos/QUESTDB.</description>
