      <title>Nonabelian shift operators and shifted Yangians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce nonabelian analogs of shift operators in the enumerative theory of quasimaps. We apply them on the one hand to strengthen the emerging analogy between enumerative geometry and the geometric theory of automorphic forms, and on the other hand to obtain results about quantized Coulomb branch algebras. In particular, we find a short and direct proof that the equivariant convolution homology of the affine Grassmannian of $GL_n$ is a quotient of a shifted Yangian.</description>

      <title>An explicit derived McKay correspondence for some complex reflection groups of rank two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the derived McKay correspondence for several reflection groups, namely reflection groups of rank two generated by reflections of order two. We prove that for each of the reflection groups $G=G(2m,m,2)$, $G_{12}$, $G_{13}$, or $G_{22}$, there is a semiorthogonal decomposition of the following form, where $B_1,\ldots,B_r$ are the normalizations of the irreducible components of the branch divisor $\mathbb{C}^2\to \mathbb{C}^2/G$ and $E_1,\ldots,E_n$ are exceptional objects: $$D^G(\mathbb{C}^2)\cong \langle E_1,\ldots,E_n,D(B_1),\ldots, D(B_r), D(\mathbb{C}^2/G)\rangle.$$ We verify that the pieces of this decomposition correspond to the irreducible representations of $G$, verifying the Orbifold Semiorthogonal Decomposition Conjecture of Polishchuk and Van den Bergh. Due to work of Potter on the group $G(m,m,2)$, this conjecture is now proven for all finite groups $G\leq \mathrm{GL}(2,\mathbb{C})$ that are generated by order $2$ reflections. Each of these groups contains, as a subgroup of index $2$, a distinct finite group $H\leq \mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$. A key part of our work is an explicit computation of the action of $G/H$ on the $H$-Hilbert scheme $\textrm{$H$-Hilb}(\mathbb{C}^2)$.</description>

      <title>On computing local monodromy and the numerical local irreducible decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Similarly to the global case, the local structure of a holomorphic subvariety at a given point is described by its local irreducible decomposition. Following the paradigm of numerical algebraic geometry, an algebraic subvariety at a point is represented by a numerical local irreducible decomposition comprised of a local witness set for each local irreducible component. The key requirement for obtaining a numerical local irreducible decomposition is to compute the local monodromy action of a generic linear projection at the given point, which is always well-defined on any small enough neighborhood. We characterize some of the behavior of local monodromy action of linear projection maps under analytic continuation, allowing computations to be performed beyond a local neighborhood. With this characterization, we present an algorithm to compute the local monodromy action and corresponding numerical local irreducible decomposition for algebraic varieties. The results are illustrated using several examples facilitated by an implementation in an open source software package.</description>

      <title>Tensor t-structures, perversity functions and weight structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of tensor t-structures on the bounded derived categories of schemes. For a Noetherian scheme $X$ admitting a dualizing complex, Bezrukavnikov-Deligne, and then independently Gabber and Kashiwara have shown that given a monotone comonotone perversity function on $X$ one can construct a t-structure on $\mathbf{D}^b (X)$. We show that such t-structures are tensor t-structures and conversely every tensor t-structure on $\mathbf{D}^b (X)$ arises in this way. We achieve this by first characterising tensor t-structures in terms of Thomason-Cousin filtrations which generalises earlier results of Alonso, Jerem\'ias and Saor\'in, from Noetherian rings to schemes. We also show that for a smooth projective curve $C$, the derived category $\mathbf{D}^b (C)$ has no non-trivial tensor weight structures, this extends our earlier result on the projective line to higher genus curves.</description>

      <title>On solvability of linear differential equations in finite terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of solvability of linear differential equations over a differential field~$K$. We introduce a class of special differential field extensions, which widely generalizes the classical class of extensions of differential fields by integrals and by exponentials of integrals and which has similar properties. We announce the following result: if a linear differential equation over $K$ can not be solved by generalized quadratures, then no special extension can help solve it. In the paper we prove a weaker version of this result in which we consider only pure transcendental extensions of $K$. Our paper is self-contained and understandable for beginners. It demonstrates the power of Liouville's original approach to problems of solvability of equations in finite terms.</description>

      <title>K-stability of Thaddeus' moduli of stable bundle pairs on genus two curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The moduli space of bundle stable pairs $\overline{M}_C(2,\Lambda)$ on a smooth projective curve $C$, introduced by Thaddeus, is a smooth Fano variety of Picard rank two. Focusing on the genus two case, we show that its K-moduli space is isomorphic to a GIT moduli of lines in quartic del Pezzo threefolds. Additionally, we construct a natural forgetful morphism from the K-moduli of $\overline{M}_C(2,\Lambda)$ to that of the moduli spaces of stable vector bundles $\overline{N}_C(2,\Lambda)$. In particular, Thaddeus' moduli spaces for genus two curves are all K-stable.</description>

      <title>Tropical Lagrangian coamoebae and free resolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the coamoebae of Lagrangian submanifolds of $(\mathbb{C}^\times)^n$, specifically how the combinatorics of their degenerations encodes the homological algebra of mirror coherent sheaves. Concretely, to a minimal free resolution $F^\bullet$ of a module $M$ over $\mathbb{C}[z_1^{\pm 1}, \dotsc, z_n^{\pm 1}]$ we associate a simplicial complex $T(F^\bullet) \subset T^n$. We call $T(F^\bullet)$ a tropical Lagrangian coamoeba. We show that the discrete information in $F^\bullet$ can often be recovered from $T(F^\bullet)$, and that more generally $M$ is mirror to a certain constructible sheaf supported on $T(F^\bullet)$. The resulting interplay between coherent sheaves on $(\mathbb{C}^\times)^n$ and simplicial complexes in $T^n$ provides a higher-dimensional generalization of the spectral theory of dimer models in $T^2$, as well as a symplectic counterpart to the theory of brane brick models.</description>

      <title>Effective faithful tropicalizations and embeddings for abelian varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A$ be an abelian variety over an algebraically closed field $k$ that is complete with respect to a nontrivial nonarchimedean absolute value. Let $A^{\mathrm{an}}$ denote the analytification of $A$ in the sense of Berkovich, and let $\Sigma$ be the canonical skeleton of $A^{\mathrm{an}}$. In this paper, we obtain a faithful tropicalization of $\Sigma$ by nonarchimedean theta functions, giving a tropical version of the classical theorem of Lefschetz on abelian varieties. Key ingredients of the proof are (1) faithful embeddings of tropical abelian varieties by tropical theta functions and (2) lifting of tropical theta functions to nonarchimedean theta functions, and they will be of independent interest. For (1), we use some arguments similar to the case of complex abelian varieties as well as Voronoi cells of lattices. For (2), we use Fourier expansions of nonarchimedean theta functions over the Raynaud extensions of abelian varieties.</description>

      <title>Toward the Universal Mumford form on Sato Grassmannians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a local universal Mumford form on a product of Sato Grassmannians using the flow of the Virasoro algebra. The existence of this universal Mumford form furthers the proposal that the Sato Grassmannian provides a universal moduli space with applications to string theory. Our approach using the Virasoro flow is an alternative to using the KP flow, which in particular allows for a bosonic universal Mumford form to be constructed. Applying the same method, we construct a local universal super Mumford form on a product of super Sato Grassmannians using the flow of the Neveu-Schwarz algebra.</description>

      <title>The Neveu-Schwarz group and Schwarz's extended super Mumford form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1987, Albert Schwarz suggested a formula which extends the super Mumford form from the moduli space of super Riemann surfaces into the super Sato Grassmannian. His formula is a remarkably simple combination of super tau functions. We compute the Neveu-Schwarz action on super tau functions, and show that Schwarz's extended Mumford form is invariant under the the super Heisenberg-Neveu-Schwarz action, which strengthens Schwarz's proposal that a locus within the Grassmannian can serve as a universal moduli space with applications to superstring theory. Along the way, we construct the Neveu-Schwarz, super Witt, and super Heisenberg formal groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a topological description of Ext groups between simple representations of categories via a nerve type construction. We use it to show that the Koszulity of indiscretely based category algebras is equivalent to the locally Cohen-Macaulay property of this nerve. We also provide a class of functors which preserve the Koszulity of category algebras called almost discrete fibrations. Specializing from categories to posets, we show that the equivalence relations of V. Reiner and D. Stamate in arXiv:0904.1683 [math.AC] are exactly almost discrete fibrations and recover their results. As an application, we classify when a shifted dual collection to a full strong exceptional collection of line bundles on a toric variety is strong.</description>

      <title>Efficiently Checking Separating Indeterminates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we continue the development of a new technique for computing elimination ideals by substitution which has been called $Z$-separating re-embeddings. Given an ideal $I$ in the polynomial ring $K[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ over a field $K$, this method searches for tuples $Z=(z_1,\dots,z_s)$ of indeterminates with the property that $I$ contains polynomials of the form $f_i = z_i - h_i$ for $i=1,\dots,s$ such that no term in $h_i$ is divisible by an indeterminate in $Z$. As there are frequently many candidate tuples $Z$, the task addressed by this paper is to efficiently check whether a given tuple $Z$ has this property. We construct fast algorithms which check whether the vector space spanned by the generators of $I$ or a somewhat enlarged vector space contain the desired polynomials $f_i$. We also extend these algorithms to Boolean polynomials and apply them to cryptoanalyse round reduced versions of the AES cryptosystem faster.</description>

Abstract: We determine the generic consistency, dimension and nondegeneracy of the zero locus over $\mathbb{C}^*$, $\mathbb{R}^*$ and $\mathbb{R}_{&gt;0}$ of vertically parametrized systems: parametric polynomial systems consisting of linear combinations of monomials scaled by free parameters. These systems generalize sparse systems with fixed monomial support and freely varying parametric coefficients. As our main result, we establish the equivalence among three key properties: the existence of nondegenerate zeros, the zero set having generically the expected dimension, and the system being generically consistent. Importantly, we prove that checking whether a vertically parametrized system has these properties amounts to an easily computed matrix rank condition.</description>

Abstract: This paper provides a complete classification of torus-invariant curves in Cherkis bow varieties of type A. We develop combinatorial codes for compact and noncompact invariant curves involving the butterfly diagrams, Young diagrams, and binary contingency tables. As a key intermediate step, we also develop a novel tangent weight formula. Finally, we apply this new machinery to example bow varieties to demonstrate how to obtain their 1-skeletons (union of fixed points and invariant curves).</description>

      <title>Roots of unity and projective equivalence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing results of Fu show that, if two finite sets of roots of unity are projectively equivalent by a projective automorphism that does not act bijectively on the set of all roots of unity, then these sets consist of at most 14 points. Moreover, Fu constructs the two possible maximal sets, which are unique up to projective equivalence. In this article, we give an elementary proof that the cardinality of two such sets is at most 18 using the methods of Beukers and Smyth. Moreover, we show precisely how their method fails to give the tightest bound in the maximal cases of Fu.</description>

      <title>Derived equivalence for the simple flop of type $G_2^{\dagger}$ via tilting bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14314v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this article is to prove the derived equivalence for a local model of the simple flop of type $G_2^{\dagger}$, which was found by Kanemitsu. This flop is the only known simple flop that comes from a non-homogeneous roof. The proof of the derived equivalence is done by using tilting bundles, and also produces a noncommutative crepant resolution of the singularity that is derived equivalent to both sides of the flop.</description>

      <title>Equidistribution in Families of Abelian Varieties and Uniformity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.10272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2101.10272v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using equidistribution techniques from Arakelov theory as well as recent results obtained by Dimitrov, Gao, and Habegger, we deduce uniform results on the Manin-Mumford and the Bogomolov conjecture. For each given integer $g \geq 2$, we prove that the number of torsion points lying on a smooth complex algebraic curve of genus $g$ embedded into its Jacobian is uniformly bounded. Complementing recent works of Dimitrov, Gao, and Habegger, we obtain a rather uniform version of the Mordell conjecture as well. In particular, the number of rational points on a smooth algebraic curve defined over a number field can be bounded solely in terms of its genus and the Mordell-Weil rank of its Jacobian.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09181v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We solve the dynamical Mordell-Lang conjecture for bounded-degree dynamical systems in positive characteristic. The answer in this case disproves the original version of the pDML conjecture.</description>

      <title>Partitioning Theorems for Sets of Semi-Pfaffian Sets, with Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02961v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize the seminal polynomial partitioning theorems of Guth and Katz to a set of semi-Pfaffian sets. Specifically, given a set $\Gamma \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ of $k$-dimensional semi-Pfaffian sets, where each $\gamma \in \Gamma$ is defined by a fixed number of Pfaffian functions, and each Pfaffian function is in turn defined with respect to a Pfaffian chain $\vec{q}$ of length $r$, for any $D \ge 1$, we prove the existence of a polynomial $P \in \mathbb{R}[X_1, \ldots, X_n]$ of degree at most $D$ such that each connected component of $\mathbb{R}^n \setminus Z(P)$ intersects at most $\sim \frac{|\Gamma|}{D^{n - k - r}}$ elements of $\Gamma$. Also, under some mild conditions on $\vec{q}$, for any $D \ge 1$, we prove the existence of a Pfaffian function $P'$ of degree at most $D$ defined with respect to $\vec{q}$, such that each connected component of $\mathbb{R}^n \setminus Z(P')$ intersects at most $\sim \frac{|\Gamma|}{D^{n-k}}$ elements of $\Gamma$. To do so, given a $k$-dimensional semi-Pfaffian set $\mathcal{X} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$, and a polynomial $P \in \mathbb{R}[X_1, \ldots, X_n]$ of degree at most $D$, we establish a uniform bound on the number of connected components of $\mathbb{R}^n \setminus Z(P)$ that $\mathcal{X}$ intersects; that is, we prove that the number of connected components of $(\mathbb{R}^n \setminus Z(P)) \cap \mathcal{X}$ is at most $\sim D^{k+r}$. Finally as applications, we derive Pfaffian versions of Szemer\'edi-Trotter type theorems, and also prove bounds on the number of joints between Pfaffian curves.</description>
