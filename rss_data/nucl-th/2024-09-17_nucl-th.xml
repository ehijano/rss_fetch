      <title>Multiple-models prediction for light neutron-rich isotopes cross section by $Q_g$ systematics in $^{40}$Ar projectile fragmentation reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise predictions for nuclei near drip lines are crucial for experiments in new generation of rare isotope facilities. A multi-models investigation of the $Q_g$ systematics for fragments production cross sections, with $Q_g$ defined as the difference of mass excess (ME) between the projectile ($Z_{p}, A_{p}$) and the fragment ($Z_{f}, A_{f}$) nuclei $Q_{g}=ME(Z_{p}, A_{p})-ME(Z_{f}, A_{f})$, has been performed to verify the model prediction abilities for light neutron-rich isotopes in measured $^{40}$Ar + $^9$Be projectile fragmentation reactions from 57$A$ MeV to 1$A$ GeV. The models used are the FRACS parametrizations and the newly developed Bayesian neural networks (BNN) model. %method The results show that FRACS, BNN, and $Q_g$ extrapolations are generally consistent, except for fragments near the nuclear mass of the projectile. Additionally, both measured data and model extrapolations provide evidence for a shell closure at $N=$ 16 in fluorine and neon, as well as the disappearance of the traditional magic number $N=$ 20 in neon, sodium and magnesium.</description>

      <title>Pion-nucleon scattering with decuplet contribution in heavy baryon SU(3) chiral perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the complete $T$ matrices with decuplet contributions for pion-nucleon scattering to order $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^3)$ in heavy baryon SU(3) chiral perturbation theory. The baryon mass in the chiral limit $M_0$ and the low-energy constants are determined by fitting to phase shifts of $\pi N$, the experimental octet-baryon masses, and the value of $\sigma_{\pi N}$ simultaneously. By using these constants, we obtain the accurate $KN$ $\sigma$ terms, $\sigma_{KN}^{(1)}=(375.07\pm33.02)$ MeV and $\sigma_{KN}^{(2)}=(275.32\pm32.24)$ MeV. An excellent description of the phase shifts is obtained for all partial waves. We also present results for scattering lengths and scattering volumes. In addition, the convergence of the approach is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Effect of Magnetic Fields on Urca Rates in Neutron Star Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Isospin-equilibrating weak processes, called ``Urca" processes, are of fundamental importance in astrophysical environments like (proto-)neutron stars, neutron star mergers, and supernovae. In these environments, matter can reach high temperatures of tens of MeVs and be subject to large magnetic fields. We thus investigate Urca rates at different temperatures and field strengths by performing the full temperature and magnetic-field dependent rate integrals for different equations of state. We find that the magnetic fields play an important role at temperatures of a few MeV, especially close to or below the direct Urca threshold, which is softened by the magnetic field. At higher temperatures, the effect of the magnetic fields can be overshadowed by the thermal effects. We observe that the magnetic field more strongly influences the neutron decay rates than the electron capture rates, leading to a shift in chemical equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Ab initio calculation of the $^3$He$(\alpha,\gamma)^7$Be astrophysical S factor with chiral two- and three-nucleon forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $^3$He$(\alpha,\gamma)^7$Be radiative capture reaction plays a key role in the creation of elements in stars as well as in the production of solar neutrinos, the observation of which is one of the main tools to study the properties of our sun. Since accurate experimental measurements of this fusion cross section at solar energies are difficult due to the strong Coulomb repulsion between the reactants, the onus falls on theory to provide a robust means for extrapolating from the region where experimental data is available down to the desired astrophysical regime. We present the first microscopic calculations of $^3$He$(\alpha,\gamma)^7$Be with explicit inclusion of three-nucleon forces. Our prediction of the astrophysical $S$ factor qualitatively agrees with experimental data. We further incorporate experimental bound-state and scattering information in our calculation to arrive at a more quantitative description. This process reveals that our current model lacks sufficient repulsion in the $1/2^+$ channel of our model space to simultaneously reproduce elastic-scattering data. This deficit suggests that $^3$He$(\alpha,\gamma)^7$Be probes aspects of the nuclear force that are not currently well-constrained.</description>

      <title>Fuzzy logic for reconstructing arbitrary moments of multiplicity distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Identity Method is a statistical technique developed to reconstruct moments of multiplicity distributions of particles produced in high-energy nuclear collisions. The method leverages principles from fuzzy logic, allowing for a more nuanced representation of particle identification by assigning degrees of membership to different particle types based on detector signals. In this contribution, a mathematical framework, based on a multivariate moment generation function, is developed that allows the derivation of the formulas used in the Identity Method in a more robust way. Moreover, within the introduced framework, the Identity Method is easily extended to cope with arbitrarily higher-order moments. The techniques developed here offer significant potential for improving the accuracy of multiplicity distribution analyses in high-energy nuclear collisions. While the primary focus of the work presented is on applications in high-energy and nuclear physics, it can also be applied in other areas where signal identification is probabilistic and data are noisy, such as medical imaging, remote sensing, and various other fields of experimental science.</description>

      <title>Quantum-mechanical description of angular motion of fission fragments at scission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum-mechanical description of the collective angular motion in a system of two touching fission fragments is proposed. The main peculiarities of excitation spectrum and the structure of the wave functions are investigated. As found, the angular motion approximately corresponds to independent vibrations of fragments around the pole-to-pole configuration. The model allows us to explain the experimentally observed lack of correlation between the angular momenta of fission fragments. Additionally the correlation between angular momentum and fragment mass is primarily linked to the change of fragments deformation. The saw-tooth behavior of angular momentum distribution with respect to the fragment mass is well explained.</description>

      <title>Multiple rescattering effects in the hard knockout reaction $\mathbf{^2\mbox{H}(p,2p)n}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction of a proton with a deuteron is the simplest nuclear reaction. However, it allows the study of precursors of nuclear medium effects such as initial-state/final-state interactions (ISI/FSI). In case of hard proton knockout, the deviation of ISI/FSI from the 'standard' values may carry a signal of color transparency. In this regard, it is important to define the 'standard' as precisely as possible. This work continues previous studies within the framework of the Generalized Eikonal Approximation (GEA). The focus is on processes where the participating protons experience multiple soft rescattering on the spectator neutron. It is shown that correct treatment of deviations of the trajectories of outgoing protons from the longitudinal direction leads to a significant modification of partial amplitudes with soft rescattering of two outgoing protons and non-vanishing amplitudes with rescattering of incoming and outgoing protons. The new treatment of multiple rescattering is important in kinematics with a forward spectator neutron.</description>

      <title>Ab initio calculations of anomalous seniority breaking in the $\pi g_{9/2}$ shell for the $N=50$ isotones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We performed \textit{ab initio} valence-space in-medium similarity renormalization group (VS-IMSRG) calculations based on chiral two-nucleon and three-nucleon interactions to investigate the anomalous seniority breaking in the neutron number $N=50$ isotones: $^{92}$Mo, $^{94}$Ru, $^{96}$Pd, and $^{98}$Cd. Our calculations well reproduced the measured low-lying spectra and electromagnetic $E2$ transitions in these nuclei, supporting partial seniority conservation in the first $\pi g_{9/2}$ shell. Recent experiments have revealed that, compared to the symmetric patterns predicted under the conserved seniority symmetry, the $4^+_1\to2^+_1$ $E2$ transition strength in $^{94}$Ru is significantly enhanced and that in $^{96}$Pd is suppressed. In contrast, the $6^+_1\to 4^+_1$ and $8^+_1\to6^+_1$ transitions exhibit the opposite trend. We found that this anomalous asymmetry is sensitive to subtle seniority breaking effects, providing a stringent test for state-of-the-art nucleon-nucleon interactions and nuclear models. We analyzed the anomalous asymmetry using VS-IMSRG calculations across various valence spaces. Our \textit{ab initio} results suggest that core excitations of both proton and neutron across the $Z=50$ shell are ascribed to the observed anomalous seniority breaking in the $N=50$ isotones.</description>

      <title>L\'evy walk of pions in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The process of L\'evy walk, i.e., movement patterns described by heavy-tailed random walks, play a role in many different phenomena, from chemical and microbiological systems through marine predators to climate change. Recent experiments have suggested that this phenomenon also appears in heavy-ion collisions. However, the theoretical background is not yet well understood. In high-energy collisions of heavy nuclei, the strongly interacting Quark Gluon Plasma is created, which, similarly to the early Universe, undergoes a rapid expansion and transition back to normal hadronic matter. In the subsequent expanding hadron gas, particles interact until kinetic freeze-out, when their momenta become fixed, and they freely transition toward the detectors. Measuring spatial freeze-out distributions is a crucial tool in understanding the dynamics of the created matter as well as the interactions among its constituents. In this paper, we present a novel three-dimensional analysis of the spatial freeze-out distribution of pions (the most abundant particles in such collisions). Utilizing Monte-Carlo simulations of high-energy collisions, we show that the chain of processes ending in a final state pion has a step length distribution leading to L\'evy-stable distributions. Subsequently, we show that pion freeze-out distributions indeed exhibit heavy tails and can be described by a three-dimensional elliptically contoured symmetric L\'evy-stable distribution.</description>

      <title>Predictions for photon-jet correlations at forward rapidities in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study for the first time jet-medium interactions in heavy-ion collisions with introduction of saturation and Sudakov effects with parameters tuned for upcoming forward calorimeter acceptances in experiments, in particular the ALICE FoCal detector. We focus on $\gamma +$jet correlations by taking into account in-medium parton evolution using the BDIM equation that describes jet interactions with the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) combined with vacuum-like emissions (VLE). We systematically introduce the early time gluon saturation dynamics through the small-$x$ Improved Transverse Momentum Dependent factorization (ITMD). For our purpose, we use Monte Carlo programs KATIE and TMDICE to generate hard events and in-medium parton evolution, respectively. We present results of azimuthal correlations and nuclear modification ratios to gauge the impact of the gluon saturation effects at early time for the in-medium jet energy loss.</description>

      <title>N$^{\mathbf{3}}$LL + $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^2)$ predictions of lepton-jet azimuthal angular distribution in deep-inelastic scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an analysis of lepton-jet azimuthal decorrelation in deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) at next-to-next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic (N$^{3}$LL) accuracy, combined with fixed-order corrections at $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^2)$. In this study, jets are defined in the lab frame using the anti-$k_T$ clustering algorithm and the winner-take-all recombination scheme. The N$^{3}$LL resummation results are derived from the transverse-momentum dependent factorization formula within the soft-collinear effective theory, while the $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^2)$ fixed-order matching distribution is calculated using the {\tt NLOJET++} event generator. The azimuthal decorrelation between the jet and electron serves as a critical probe of the three-dimensional structure of the nucleon. Our numerical predictions provide a robust framework for precision studies of QCD and the nucleon's internal structure through jet observables in DIS. These results are particularly significant for analyses involving jets in HERA data and the forthcoming electron-ion collider experiments.</description>

      <title>Neutral pion to two-photons transition form factor revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based upon a combined formalism of Schwinger-Dyson and Bethe-Salpeter equations in quantum chromodynamics (QCD), we propose a QCD kindred algebraic model for the dressed quark propagator, for the Bethe-Salpeter amplitude of the pion and the electromagnetic quark-photon interaction vertex. We then compute the $\gamma^{*}\pi^0\gamma$ transition form factor $G^{\gamma^{*}\pi^0\gamma}(Q^2)$ for a wide range of photon momentum transfer squared $Q^2$. The quark propagator is expanded out in its perturbative functional form but with dynamically generated dressed quark mass. It has complex conjugate pole singularities in the complex-momentum plane which is motivated by the solution of the quark gap equation with rainbow-ladder truncation of the infinite set of Schwinger-Dyson equations. This complex pole singularity structure of the quark propagator can be associated with a signal of confinement which prevents quarks to become stable asymptotic states. The Bethe-Salpeter amplitude is expressed without a spectral density function, which encapsulate its low and large momentum behaviour. The QCD evolution of the distribution amplitude is also incorporated into our model through the direct implementation of Efremov-Radyushkin-Brodsky-Lepage evolution equations. We include the effects of the quark anomalous magnetic moment in the description of the quark-photon vertex whose infrared enhancement is known to dictate hadronic properties. Once the QCD kindred model is constructed, we calculate the form factor $G^{\gamma^{*}\pi^0\gamma}(Q^2)$ and find it consistent with direct QCD-based studies as well as most available experimental data. It slightly exceeds the conformal limit for large $Q^2$ which might be attributed to the scaling violations in QCD. The associated interaction radius and neutral pion decay width turn out to be compatible with experimental data.</description>

      <title>The Current State of the Controversy over Screening in Nuclear Reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A controversy about the possibility of dynamic effects in nuclear screening has been around for several decades. On the one hand, there is the claim that there are no dynamic effects, and that the classic Salpeter correction based on static Debye screening is all that is needed for astrophysical applications. The size of the correction is on the order of 5% in typical solar fusion reactions. On the other hand, numerical simulations have shown that there is a dynamical effect, which essentially cancels the Salpeter correction. The results of the numerical simulations were later independently confirmed. The astrophysical community, however, has so far largely ignored the possibility of dynamical screening. The present paper is meant to serve as a reminder of the controversy. Not only does the claim of an absence of a dynamical effect equally warrant an independent confirmation, but there is motivation for further investigation, such as the assessment of current laboratory experiments and a quantitative study of the dynamical effect in case it will turn out to be real.</description>

      <title>Beth-Uhlenbeck equation for the thermodynamics of fluctuations in a generalised 2+1D Gross-Neveu model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a generalised version of Gross-Neveu model in 2+1 dimensions. The model is inspired from graphene which shows a linear dispersion relation near the Dirac points. The phase structure and the thermodynamic properties in the mean field approximation have been studied before. Here we go beyond the mean field level by deriving a Beth-Uhlenbeck equation for Gaussian fluctuations, solutions of which we explore numerically, for the first time including their momentum dependence. We discuss the excitonic mass, fluctuation pressure and phase shifts. We also perform a comparison with the NJL model in 3+1 dimension and discuss its implication for graphene.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty quantification in $(p,n)$ reactions</title>

Abstract: Charge-exchange reactions are versatile probes for nuclear structure. In particular, when populating isobaric analog states, these reactions are used to study isovector nuclear densities and neutron skins. The quality of the information extracted from charge-exchange data depends on the accuracy of the reaction models and their inputs; this work addresses these two points. First, we quantify the uncertainties due to effective nucleon-nucleus interactions by propagating the parameter posterior distributions of the recent global optical model KDUQ [1] to $(p,n)$ reaction observables populating the isobaric analogue state, at beam energies in the range of $25-160$ MeV. Our analysis, focusing on $^{48}$Ca, shows that the total parametric uncertainties on the cross sections are around 60-100%. The source of this uncertainty is mainly the transition operator as the uncertainties from the distorted waves alone are less than about 15%. Second, we perform a comparison between two- and three-body models that both describe the dynamics of the reaction within the DWBA. The predictions from these two models are similar and generally agree with the available data, suggesting that 1-step DWBA is sufficient to describe the reaction process. Only at a beam energy of 25 MeV there are possibly signs that a 1-step assumption is not fully correct. This work provides motivation for the quantification of uncertainties associated with the transition operator in three-body model. It also suggests that further constraint of the optical potential parameters is needed for increased model precision.</description>

      <title>Heavy-flavor mesons in a strong electric field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Very strong electromagnetic field can be generated in peripheral relativistic heavy ion collisions. This work is devoted to exploring the interplay between the effects of a constant external electric field and confining potential on heavy-flavor mesons. As the corresponding vector potential linearly depends on one spatial coordinate for a constant electric field, it might be able to overcome the linear confining potential of QCD and induce deconfinement. To perform analytic calculations and for comparison, one and two dimensional systems are studied together with the realistic three dimensional systems. The one dimensional Schr$\ddot{\text o}$dinger equation can be solved analytically with the help of Airy functions, and deconfinement is indeed realized when the electric field is larger than the string tension. Focus on the confining case, the two and three dimensional Schr$\ddot{\text o}$dinger equations can be solved analytically in large $r$ limit with the help of elliptic cosine/sine functions, and the wave functions are dominated by the region antiparallel to the electric field. When a more realistic potential is applied, a non-monotonic feature is found for $\Upsilon(2S)$ and $\Upsilon(3S)$-like mesons with increasing electric field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the EMC effect, the Cd puzzle and the SU3-IBM, a hypothesis can be given for a nucleus, that only the nucleus itself is a trivial (0,0) representation of the SU(3) group, which leads to a simple conclusion that spherical nucleus does not exist and the spherical mean field is not allowed. The key conclusion is that the color degree of freedom is required even at the low energy excitation of the nucleus.</description>

      <title>Applicability of Hydrodynamics in Hadronic Phase of Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.14792v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The hadronic phase and its dynamics in relativistic heavy-ion collisions are topics of immense discussion. The hadronic phase contains various massive hadrons with an abundance of the lightest hadron, i.e., $\pi$-mesons. In this work, we consider that pions are in the thermal equilibrium in the hadronic phase and use second-order massive viscous hydrodynamics to obtain its expansion to the boundary of the kinetic freeze-out. We achieve the kinetic freeze-out boundary with the Knudsen number ($Kn$) limit: $Kn&gt;1$. When this condition is met, hydrodynamics expansion breaks down, and the mean free path becomes sufficiently large in comparison with the system size so that the particle yields get preserved. Further, we investigate the effect of the massive fluid on the resonance particle yields, including re-scattering and regeneration, along with their natural decay width. These resonances can play an important role in determining the characteristics of the hadronic phase as they have sufficiently small lifetimes, which may be comparable to the hadronic phase lifetime. In the current study, we predict the hadronic phase lifetime, which is further used to determine the $K^*(892)^0/K$, $\phi(1020)/K$, and $\rho(770)^0/\pi$ ratios at the kinetic freeze-out. We obtain these ratios as a function of charged particle multiplicity and transverse momentum and compare our findings with experimental data. Our results qualitatively agree with the experimental data indicating the possible hydrodynamical evolution of the hadronic phase.</description>

      <title>Liouvillian Dynamics of the Open Schwinger Model: String Breaking and Kinetic Dissipation in a Thermal Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03878v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of bound state formation is one of the fundamental questions in confining quantum field theories such as Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). One hadronization mechanism that has garnered significant attention is the breaking of a string initially connecting a fermion and an anti-fermion. Deepening our understanding of real-time string-breaking dynamics with simpler, lower dimensional models like the Schwinger model can improve our understanding of the hadronization process in QCD and other confining systems found in condensed matter and statistical systems. In this paper, we consider the string-breaking dynamics within the Schwinger model and investigate its modification inside a thermal medium, treating the Schwinger model as an open quantum system coupled to a thermal environment. Within the regime of weak coupling between the system and environment, the real-time evolution of the system can be described by a Lindblad evolution equation. We analyze the Liouvillian gaps of this Lindblad equation and the time dependence of the system's von Neumann entropy. We observe that the late-time relaxation rate decreases as the environment correlation length increases. Moreover, when the environment correlation length is infinite, the system exhibits two steady states, one in each of the sectors with definite charge-conjugation-parity (CP) quantum numbers. For parameter regimes where an initial string breaks in vacuum, we observe a delay of the string breaking in the medium, due to kinetic dissipation effects. Conversely, in regimes where an initial string remains intact in vacuum time evolution, we observe string breaking (melting) in the thermal medium. We further discuss how the Liouvillian dynamics of the open Schwinger model can be simulated on quantum computers and provide an estimate of the associated Trotter errors.</description>

      <title>Quantum vortices in fermionic superfluids: from ultracold atoms to neutron stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14158v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superfluid dilute neutron matter and ultracold gas, close to the unitary regime, exhibit several similarities. Therefore, to a certain extent, fermionic ultracold gases may serve as emulators of dilute neutron matter, which forms the inner crust of neutron stars and is not directly accessed experimentally. Quantum vortices are one of the most significant properties of neutron superfluid, essential for comprehending neutron stars' dynamics. The structure and dynamics of quantum vortices as a function of pairing correlations' strength are being investigated experimentally and theoretically in ultracold gases. Certain aspects of these studies are relevant to neutron stars. We provide an overview of the characteristics of quantum vortices in s-wave-type fermionic and electrically neutral superfluids. The main focus is on the dynamics of fermionic vortices and their intrinsic structure.</description>

      <title>Fundamental physical constants set the observability and operation of phase and other transitions and increase entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03773v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Approaching the problem of understanding fundamental physical constants (FPCs) started with discussing the role these constants play in high-energy nuclear physics and astrophysics. Condensed matter physics was relatively unexplored in this regard. More recently, it was realised that FPCs set lower or upper bounds on key condensed matter properties. In this Perspective, we discuss a wider role played by FPCs in condensed matter physics: at given environmental conditions, FPCs set the observability and operation of entire physical effects and phenomena. We discuss second-order phase transitions including structural and superconducting transitions and first-order transitions including melting and boiling. We also discuss metastable states, transitions between them, chemical reactions and their products. An interesting byproduct of this discussion is that the order of magnitude of the transition temperature can be calculated from FPCs. We show that the new states emerging as a result of various transitions increase the phase space and entropy. Were FPCs to take different values, these transitions would become inoperative at our environmental conditions and the new states due to these transitions would not emerge. This suggests that the current values of FPCs, by enabling various transitions and reactions which give rise to new states, promote entropy increase. We propose that this is a general effect that applies to different levels of structure in the Universe.</description>

      <title>Baryon stopping and charge deposition in heavy-ion collisions due to gluon saturation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06788v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute baryon and electric charge deposition in high-energy heavy-ion collisions using the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) Effective Field Theory, where at leading order charge is deposited through multiple scatterings of valence quarks with a saturated gluon target. A simplified phenomenological formula is derived to describe charge deposition, from which the parametrical dependence with collisional energy and geometry can be extracted. We present an approximate analytical prediction of the so-called baryon stopping parameter $\alpha_B$, which shows excellent agreement with the state-of-the art extractions of $\alpha_B$ from experimental data. These results are further validated using the McDIPPER framework, by computing charge deposition at midrapidity across a range of collision energies ($\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}= 62.4 - 5020$ GeV).</description>

      <title>Radii of Mirror Nuclei and Isobaric Triplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08193v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a review of absolute root-mean-square charge radii of stable nuclei up to $Z=32$, which includes a previously overlooked uncertainty in the combined analysis of muonic x-ray and electron scattering experiments. From these \textit{reference radii} and isotope shift measurements, we obtain those of 12 mirror pairs with a traceable and realistic uncertainty budget. The difference in radii between mirror nuclei is found to be proportional to the isospin asymmetry, confirming recent calculations by Novario \emph{et al.} [PRL~130, 032501]. From the fitted proportionality constant and its uncertainty, the radii of 73 previously unknown mirror partners are predicted. These are useful e.g. for benchmarking atomic and nuclear theory, calibrating entire chains, and as an input to nuclear beta-decay calculations. The radii of $(T=1,T_z=0)$ nuclei are interpolated assuming negligible isospin symmetry breaking. This completes a model-independent, high-precision extraction of the charge and weak radii of all nuclei involved in the testing of the unitarity of the CKM matrix.</description>
