      <title>Estimating Customers' Perception of Service Value and Potential Demand in a Two-station Service System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The potential demand in the market and customers' perception of service value are crucial factors in pricing strategies, resource allocation, and other operational decisions. However, this information is typically private and not readily accessible. In this paper, we analyze a service system operating across two stations, each with its own customer flow. Customers arriving at the system are informed of the waiting times at both stations and can choose to either join the local station, switch to the other station by incurring an immediate switching fee, or balk. Our objective is to estimate the arrival rates at each station and customers' perceived service value based on the observed workloads at both stations. A significant challenge arises from the inability to observe balking customers and the lack of distinction between local arrivals and customers switching from the other station, as the switching cost is unknown. To address this issue, we employ maximum likelihood estimation and validate the effectiveness of the estimator through a series of simulations.</description>

      <title>A CAV-based perimeter-free regional traffic control strategy utilizing existing parking infrastructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel perimeter-free regional traffic management strategy for traffic networks under a connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) environment. The proposed strategy requires CAVs, especially those with long remaining travel distances, to temporarily wait at nearby parking facilities when the network is congested. After a designated holding time, these CAVs are allowed to re-enter the network. Doing so helps reduce congestion and improve overall operational efficiency. Unlike traditional perimeter control approaches that restrict inflows to congested regions, the proposed holding strategy leverages existing parking infrastructure to temporarily hold vehicles in a way that partially avoids local queue accumulation issues. The proposed method can be easily integrated with existing signal control methods and retains the maximum stability property of the original traffic signal control methods. Simulation results show that the proposed strategy not only reduces travel time for vehicles that are not held, but can also reduce travel times for some of the held vehicles as well, which serves as another key merit of the proposed approach. Compared to the two benchmark perimeter control algorithms, the proposed strategy is more robust against demand patterns and generates stronger improvements in the operational efficiency. Importantly, since the proposed strategy requires existing parking infrastructure, its performance has been demonstrated under various configurations of parking locations and capacities. Lastly, the proposed strategy is shown to be beneficial in a partial CAV environment where only a subset of vehicles are available for holding.</description>

      <title>Learning for Layered Safety-Critical Control with Predictive Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safety filters leveraging control barrier functions (CBFs) are highly effective for enforcing safe behavior on complex systems. It is often easier to synthesize CBFs for a Reduced order Model (RoM), and track the resulting safe behavior on the Full order Model (FoM) -- yet gaps between the RoM and FoM can result in safety violations. This paper introduces \emph{predictive CBFs} to address this gap by leveraging rollouts of the FoM to define a predictive robustness term added to the RoM CBF condition. Theoretically, we prove that this guarantees safety in a layered control implementation. Practically, we learn the predictive robustness term through massive parallel simulation with domain randomization. We demonstrate in simulation that this yields safe FoM behavior with minimal conservatism, and experimentally realize predictive CBFs on a 3D hopping robot.</description>

      <title>Tuning Trains Speed in Railway Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Railway scheduling consists in ensuring that a set of trains evolve in a shared rail network without collisions, while meeting schedule constraints. This problem is notoriously difficult, even more in the case of uncertain or even unknown train speeds. We propose here a modeling and verification approach for railway scheduling in the presence of uncertain speeds, encoded here as uncertain segment durations. We formalize the system and propose a formal translation to parametric timed automata. As a proof of concept, we apply our approach to benchmarks, for which we synthesize using IMITATOR suitable valuations for the segment durations.</description>

      <title>Recursive Projection-Free Identification with Binary-Valued Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with parameter identification problem for finite impulse response (FIR) systems with binary-valued observations under low computational complexity. Most of the existing algorithms under binary-valued observations rely on projection operators, which leads to a high computational complexity of much higher than O(n^2). In response, this paper introduces a recursive projection-free identification algorithm that incorporates a specialized cut-off coefficient to fully utilize prior information, thereby eliminating the need for projection operators. The algorithm is proved to be mean square and almost surely convergent. Furthermore, to better leverage prior information, an adaptive accelerated coefficient is introduced, resulting in a mean square convergence rate of O(1/k) , which matches the convergence rate with accurate observations. Inspired by the structure of the Cramer-Rao lower bound, the algorithm can be extended to an information-matrix projection-free algorithm by designing adaptive weight coefficients. This extension is proved to be asymptotically efficient for first-order FIR systems, with simulations indicating similar results for high order FIR systems. Finally, numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the main results.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed Gaussian Processes as Linear Model Predictive Controller</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel algorithm for controlling linear time invariant systems in a tracking problem. The controller is based on a Gaussian Process (GP) whose realizations satisfy a system of linear ordinary differential equations with constant coefficients. Control inputs for tracking are determined by conditioning the prior GP on the setpoints, i.e. control as inference. The resulting Model Predictive Control scheme incorporates pointwise soft constraints by introducing virtual setpoints to the posterior Gaussian process. We show theoretically that our controller satisfies asymptotical stability for the optimal control problem by leveraging general results from Bayesian inference and demonstrate this result in a numerical example.</description>

      <title>Multi-Bin Batching for Increasing LLM Inference Throughput</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) grow in popularity for their diverse capabilities, improving the efficiency of their inference systems has become increasingly critical. Batching LLM requests is a critical step in scheduling the inference jobs on servers (e.g. GPUs), enabling the system to maximize throughput by allowing multiple requests to be processed in parallel. However, requests often have varying generation lengths, causing resource underutilization, as hardware must wait for the longest-running request in the batch to complete before moving to the next batch. We formalize this problem from a queueing-theoretic perspective, and aim to design a control policy which is throughput-optimal. We propose Multi-Bin Batching, a simple yet effective method that can provably improve LLM inference throughput by grouping requests with similar (predicted) execution times into predetermined bins. Through a combination of theoretical analysis and experiments, including real-world LLM inference scenarios, we demonstrate significant throughput gains compared to standard batching approaches.</description>

      <title>MoD-ART: Modal Decomposition of Acoustic Radiance Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling late reverberation at interactive speeds is a challenging task when multiple sound sources and listeners are present in the same environment. This is especially problematic when the environment is geometrically complex and/or features uneven energy absorption (e.g. coupled volumes), because in such cases the late reverberation is dependent on the sound sources' and listeners' positions, and therefore must be adapted to their movements in real time. We present a novel approach to the task, named modal decomposition of Acoustic Radiance Transfer (MoD-ART), which can handle highly complex scenarios with efficiency. The approach is based on the geometrical acoustics method of Acoustic Radiance Transfer, from which we extract a set of energy decay modes and their positional relationships with sources and listeners. In this paper, we describe the physical and mathematical meaningfulness of MoD-ART, highlighting its advantages and applicability to different scenarios. Through an analysis of the method's computational complexity, we show that it compares very favourably with ray-tracing. We also present simulation results showing that MoD-ART can capture multiple decay slopes and flutter echoes.</description>

      <title>LiveNet: Robust, Minimally Invasive Multi-Robot Control for Safe and Live Navigation in Constrained Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robots in densely populated real-world environments frequently encounter constrained and cluttered situations such as passing through narrow doorways, hallways, and corridor intersections, where conflicts over limited space result in collisions or deadlocks among the robots. Current decentralized state-of-the-art optimization- and neural network-based approaches (i) are predominantly designed for general open spaces, and (ii) are overly conservative, either guaranteeing safety, or liveness, but not both. While some solutions rely on centralized conflict resolution, their highly invasive trajectories make them impractical for real-world deployment. This paper introduces LiveNet, a fully decentralized and robust neural network controller that enables human-like yielding and passing, resulting in agile, non-conservative, deadlock-free, and safe, navigation in congested, conflict-prone spaces. LiveNet is minimally invasive, without requiring inter-agent communication or cooperative behavior. The key insight behind LiveNet is a unified CBF formulation for simultaneous safety and liveness, which we integrate within a neural network for robustness. We evaluated LiveNet in simulation and found that general multi-robot optimization- and learning-based navigation methods fail to even reach the goal, and while methods designed specially for such environments do succeed, they are 10-20 times slower, 4-5 times more invasive, and much less robust to variations in the scenario configuration such as changes in the start states and goal states, among others. We open-source the LiveNet code at https://github.com/srikarg89/LiveNet{https://github.com/srikarg89/LiveNet.</description>

      <title>Learning-based Control for Tendon-Driven Continuum Robotic Arms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a learning-based approach for centralized position control of Tendon Driven Continuum Robots (TDCRs) using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), with a particular focus on the Sim-to-Real transfer of control policies. The proposed control method employs the Modified Transpose Jacobian (MTJ) control strategy, with its parameters optimally tuned using the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm. Classical model-based controllers encounter significant challenges due to the inherent uncertainties and nonlinear dynamics of continuum robots. In contrast, model-free control strategies require efficient gain-tuning to handle diverse operational scenarios. This research aims to develop a model-free controller with performance comparable to model-based strategies by integrating an optimal adaptive gain-tuning system. Both simulations and real-world implementations demonstrate that the proposed method significantly enhances the trajectory-tracking performance of continuum robots independent of initial conditions and paths within the operational task-space, effectively establishing a task-free controller.</description>

      <title>Exact Model Reduction for Continuous-Time Open Quantum Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider finite-dimensional many-body quantum systems described by time-independent Hamiltonians and Markovian master equations, and present a systematic method for constructing smaller-dimensional, reduced models that exactly reproduce the time evolution of a set of initial conditions or observables of interest. Our approach exploits Krylov operator spaces and their extension to operator algebras, and may be used to obtain reduced linear models of minimal dimension, well-suited for simulation on classical computers, or reduced quantum models that preserve the structural constraints of physically admissible quantum dynamics, as required for simulation on quantum computers. Notably, we prove that the reduced quantum-dynamical generator is still in Lindblad form. By introducing a new type of observable-dependent symmetries, we show that our method provides a non-trivial generalization of techniques that leverage symmetries, unlocking new reduction opportunities. We quantitatively benchmark our method on paradigmatic open many-body systems of relevance to condensed-matter and quantum-information physics. In particular, we demonstrate how our reduced models can quantitatively describe decoherence dynamics in central-spin systems coupled to structured environments, magnetization transport in boundary-driven dissipative spin chains, and unwanted error dynamics on information encoded in a noiseless quantum code.</description>

      <title>Immersive Human-Machine Teleoperation Framework for Precision Agriculture: Integrating UAV-based Digital Mapping and Virtual Reality Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07231v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In agricultural settings, the unstructured nature of certain production environments, along with the high complexity and inherent risks of production tasks, poses significant challenges to achieving full automation and effective on-site machine control. Remote control technology, which leverages human intelligence and precise machine movements, ensures operator safety and boosts productivity. Recently, virtual reality (VR) has shown promise in remote control applications by overcoming single-view limitations and providing three-dimensional information, yet most studies have not focused on agricultural settings. Therefore, to bridge the gap, this study proposes a large-scale digital mapping and immersive human-machine teleoperation framework specifically designed for precision agriculture. In this research, a DJI unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) was utilized for data collection, and a novel video segmentation approach based on feature points was introduced. To accommodate the variability of complex textures, this method proposes an enhanced Structure from Motion (SfM) approach. It integrates the open Multiple View Geometry (OpenMVG) framework with Local Features from Transformers (LoFTR). The enhanced SfM produces a point cloud map, which is further processed through Multi-View Stereo (MVS) to generate a complete map model. For control, a closed-loop system utilizing TCP/IP for VR control and positioning of agricultural machinery was introduced. This system offers a fully visual-based method for immersive control, allowing operators to utilize VR technology for remote operations. The experimental results demonstrate that the user-friendly remote control method also showcases its advantages over traditional video streaming-based remote operations, providing operators with a more comprehensive and immersive experience and a higher level of situational awareness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a framework for adapting the controller's parameters based on learning optimal solutions from contextual black-box optimization problems. We consider a class of control design problems for dynamical systems operating in different environments or conditions represented by contextual parameters. The overarching goal is to identify the controller parameters that maximize the controlled system's performance, given different realizations of the contextual parameters.We formulate a contextual Bayesian optimization problem in which the solution is actively learned using Gaussian processes to approximate the controller adaptation strategy. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework with a sim-to-real example. We learn the optimal weighting strategy of a model predictive control for connected and automated vehicles interacting with human-driven vehicles from simulations and then deploy it in a real-time experiment.</description>

      <title>A new platooning model for connected and autonomous vehicles to improve string stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18791v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to coordinated vehicle platooning, where the platoon followers communicate solely with the platoon leader. A dynamic model is proposed to account for driving safety under communication delays. General linear stability results are mathematically proven, and numerical simulations are performed to analyze the impact of model parameters in two scenarios: a ring road with initial disturbance and an infinite road with periodic disturbance. The simulation outcomes align with the theoretical analysis, demonstrating that the proposed "look-to-the-leader" platooning strategy significantly outperforms conventional car-following strategies, such as following one or two vehicles ahead, in terms of traffic flow stabilization. This paper introduces a new perspective on organizing platoons for autonomous vehicles, with implications for enhancing traffic stability.</description>

      <title>Data-driven harmonic output regulation of a class of nonlinear systems</title>

Abstract: The paper deals with the data-based design of state-feedback controllers that solve the output regulation problem for a class of nonlinear systems. Inspired by recent developments in model-based output regulation design techniques and in data-driven control design for nonlinear systems, we derive a data-dependent semidefinite program that, when solved, directly returns a controller that steers the regulation error to a periodic signal whose Fourier series has identically zero coefficients up to a certain order set by the controller. When specialized to the case of linear systems, the result appears to improve upon existing work. Numerical results illustrate the findings</description>

      <title>Upstream Allocation of Bidirectional Load Demand by Power Packetization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02352v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The power packet dispatching system has been studied for power management with strict tie to an accompanying information system through power packetization. In the system, integrated units of transfer of power and information, called power packets, are delivered through a network of apparatuses called power packet routers. This paper proposes upstream allocation of a bidirectional load demand represented by a sequence of power packets to power sources. We first develop a scheme of power packet routing for upstream allocation of load demand with full integration of power and information transfer. The routing scheme is then proved to enable packetized management of bidirectional load demand, which is of practical importance for applicability to, e.g., electric drives in motoring and regenerating operations. We present a way of packetizing the bidirectional load demand and realizing the power and information flow under the upstream allocation scheme. The viability of the proposed methods is demonstrated through experiments.</description>

      <title>Multi-platoon car-following models with flexible platoon sizes and communication levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend a single platoon car-following (CF) model to some multi-platoon CF models for connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) with flexible platoon size and communication level. Specifically, we consider forward and backward communication methods between platoons with delays. Some general results of linear stability are mathematically proven, and numerical simulations are performed to illustrate the effects of platoon sizes and communication levels, as well as to demonstrate the potential for stabilizing human-driven vehicles (HDVs) in mixed traffic conditions. The simulation results are consistent with theoretical analysis, and demonstrate that in the ring road scenario, CAV platoons can stabilize certain percentage of HDVs. This paper can provide suggestions for the design of communication system of autonomous vehicles (AVs), and management of mixed traffic flow of CAVs and HDVs.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Freeway Lane-Change Regulation via Connected Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lane change decision-making is a complex task due to intricate vehicle-vehicle and vehicle-infrastructure interactions. Existing algorithms for lane-change control often depend on vehicles with a certain level of autonomy (e.g., autonomous or connected autonomous vehicles). To address the challenges posed by low penetration rates of autonomous vehicles and the high costs of precise data collection, this study proposes a dynamic lane change regulation design based on multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to enhance freeway traffic efficiency. The proposed framework leverages multi-lane macroscopic traffic models that describe spatial-temporal dynamics of the density and speed for each lane. Lateral traffic flow between adjacent lanes, resulting from aggregated lane-changing behaviors, is modeled as source terms exchanged between the partial differential equations (PDEs). We propose a lane change regulation strategy using MARL, where one agent is placed at each discretized lane grid. The state of each agent is represented by aggregated vehicle attributes within its grid, generated from the SUMO microscopic simulation environment. The agent's actions are lane-change regulations for vehicles in its grid. Specifically, lane-change regulation signals are computed at a centralized traffic management center and then broadcast to connected vehicles in the corresponding lane grids. Compared to vehicle-level maneuver control, this approach achieves a higher regulation rate by leveraging vehicle connectivity while introducing no critical safety concerns, and accommodating varying levels of connectivity and autonomy within the traffic system. The proposed model is simulated and evaluated in varied traffic scenarios and demand conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that the method improves overall traffic efficiency with minimal additional energy consumption while maintaining driving safety.</description>

      <title>Performance Bounds for Quantum Feedback Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.03366v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The limits of quantum feedback control have immediate consequences for quantum information science at large, yet remain largely unexplored. Here, we combine quantum filtering theory and moment-sum-of-squares techniques to construct a hierarchy of convex optimization problems that furnish monotonically improving, computable bounds on the best attainable performance for a broad class of quantum feedback control problems. These bounds may serve as witnesses of fundamental limitations, optimality certificates, or performance targets. We prove convergence of the bounds to the optimal control performance under technical conditions and demonstrate the practical utility of our approach by designing certifiably near-optimal controllers for a qubit in a cavity subjected to photon counting and homodyne detection measurements.</description>

      <title>Design and Control of a Low-cost Non-backdrivable End-effector Upper Limb Rehabilitation Device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14795v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents GARD, an upper limb end-effector rehabilitation device developed for stroke patients. GARD offers assistance force along or towards a 2D trajectory during physical therapy sessions. GARD employs a non-backdrivable mechanism with novel motor velocity-control-based algorithms, which offers superior control precision and stability. To our knowledge, this innovative technical route has not been previously explored in rehabilitation robotics. In alignment with the new design, GARD features two novel control algorithms: Implicit Euler Velocity Control (IEVC) algorithm and a generalized impedance control algorithm. These algorithms achieve O(n) runtime complexity for any arbitrary trajectory. The system has demonstrated a mean absolute error of 0.023mm in trajectory-following tasks and 0.14mm in trajectory-restricted free moving tasks. The proposed upper limb rehabilitation device offers all the functionalities of existing commercial devices with superior performance. Additionally, GARD provides unique functionalities such as area-restricted free moving and dynamic Motion Restriction Map interaction. This device holds strong potential for widespread clinical use, potentially improving rehabilitation outcomes for stroke patients.</description>

      <title>An anisotropic traffic flow model with look-ahead effect for mixed autonomy traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20554v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we extend the Aw-Rascle-Zhang (ARZ) non-equilibrium traffic flow model to take into account the look-ahead capability of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs), and the mixed flow dynamics of human driven and autonomous vehicles. The look-ahead effect of CAVs is captured by a non-local averaged density within a certain distance (the look-ahead distance). We show, using wave perturbation analysis, that increased look-ahead distance loosens the stability criteria. Our numerical experiments, however, showed that a longer look-ahead distance does not necessarily lead to faster convergence to equilibrium states. We also examined the impact of spatial distributions and market penetrations of CAVs and showed that increased market penetration helps stabilizing mixed traffic while the spatial distribution of CAVs have less effect on stability. The results revealed the potential of using CAVs to stabilize traffic, and may provide qualitative insights on speed control in the mixed autonomy environment.</description>

      <title>Energy-based, geometric, and compositional formulation of fluid and plasma models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00009v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fluid dynamics plays a crucial role in various multiphysics applications, including energy systems, electronics cooling, and biomedical engineering. Developing models for complex coupled systems can be challenging and time-consuming. In particular, ensuring the consistent integration of models from diverse physical domains requires meticulous attention. Considering the example of (electro-)magneto hydrodynamics (on a fixed spatial domain and with linear polarization and magnetization), this article demonstrates how relatively complex models can be composed from simpler parts by means of a formal language for multiphysics modeling. The Exergetic Port-Hamiltonian Systems (EPHS) modeling language features a simple graphical syntax for expressing the energy-based interconnection of subsystems. This reduces cognitive load and facilitates communication, especially in multidisciplinary environments. As the example demonstrates, existing models can be easily integrated as subsystems of new models. Specifically, an ideal fluid model is used as a subsystem of a Navier-Stokes-Fourier fluid model, which in turn is reused as a subsystem of an (electro-)magneto hydrodynamics model. The energy-based, compositional approach simplifies understanding complex models, and it makes it easy to encapsulate, reuse, and replace (parts of) models. Moreover, structural properties of EPHS models guarantee fundamental properties of thermodynamic systems, such as conservation of energy, non-negative entropy production, and Onsager reciprocal relations.</description>

      <title>Linear Supervision for Nonlinear, High-Dimensional Neural Control and Differential Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02033v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the dimension of a system increases, traditional methods for control and differential games rapidly become intractable, making the design of safe autonomous agents challenging in complex or team settings. Deep-learning approaches avoid discretization and yield numerous successes in robotics and autonomy, but at a higher dimensional limit, accuracy falls as sampling becomes less efficient. We propose using rapidly generated linear solutions to the partial differential equation (PDE) arising in the problem to accelerate and improve learned value functions for guidance in high-dimensional, nonlinear problems. We define two programs that combine supervision of the linear solution with a standard PDE loss. We demonstrate that these programs offer improvements in speed and accuracy in both a 50-D differential game problem and a 10-D quadrotor control problem.</description>
