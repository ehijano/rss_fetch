      <title>Solving Quantified Boolean Formulas with Few Existential Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantified Boolean formula (QBF) problem is an important decision problem generally viewed as the archetype for PSPACE-completeness. Many problems of central interest in AI are in general not included in NP, e.g., planning, model checking, and non-monotonic reasoning, and for such problems QBF has successfully been used as a modelling tool. However, solvers for QBF are not as advanced as state of the art SAT solvers, which has prevented QBF from becoming a universal modelling language for PSPACE-complete problems. A theoretical explanation is that QBF (as well as many other PSPACE-complete problems) lacks natural parameters} guaranteeing fixed-parameter tractability (FPT).
  In this paper we tackle this problem and consider a simple but overlooked parameter: the number of existentially quantified variables. This natural parameter is virtually unexplored in the literature which one might find surprising given the general scarcity of FPT algorithms for QBF. Via this parameterization we then develop a novel FPT algorithm applicable to QBF instances in conjunctive normal form (CNF) of bounded clause length. We complement this by a W[1]-hardness result for QBF in CNF of unbounded clause length as well as sharper lower bounds for the bounded arity case under the (strong) exponential-time hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Time complexity for deterministic string machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Algorithms which learn environments represented by automata in the past have had complexity scaling with the number of states in the automaton, which can be exponentially large even for automata recognizing regular expressions with a small description length. We thus formalize a compositional language that can construct automata as transformations between certain types of category, representable as string diagrams, which better reflects the description complexity of various automata. We define complexity constraints on this framework by having them operate on categories enriched over filtered sets, and using these constraints, we prove elementary results on the runtime and expressivity of a subset of these transformations which operate deterministically on finite state spaces. These string diagrams, or "string machines," are themselves morphisms in a category, so it is possible for string machines to create other string machines in runtime to model computations which take more than constant memory. We prove sufficient conditions for polynomial runtime guarantees on these, which can help develop complexity constraints on string machines which also encapsulate runtime complexity.</description>

      <title>Beyond Bell sampling: stabilizer state learning and quantum pseudorandomness lower bounds on qudits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bell sampling is a simple yet powerful measurement primitive that has recently attracted a lot of attention, and has proven to be a valuable tool in studying stabiliser states. Unfortunately, however, it is known that Bell sampling fails when used on qu\emph{d}its of dimension $d&gt;2$. In this paper, we explore and quantify the limitations of Bell sampling on qudits, and propose new quantum algorithms to circumvent the use of Bell sampling in solving two important problems: learning stabiliser states and providing pseudorandomness lower bounds on qudits. More specifically, as our first result, we characterise the output distribution corresponding to Bell sampling on copies of a stabiliser state and show that the output can be uniformly random, and hence reveal no information. As our second result, for $d=p$ prime we devise a quantum algorithm to identify an unknown stabiliser state in $(\mathbb{C}^p)^{\otimes n}$ that uses $O(n)$ copies of the input state and runs in time $O(n^4)$. As our third result, we provide a quantum algorithm that efficiently distinguishes a Haar-random state from a state with non-negligible stabiliser fidelity. As a corollary, any Clifford circuit on qudits of dimension $d$ using $O(\log{n}/\log{d})$ auxiliary non-Clifford single-qudit gates cannot prepare computationally pseudorandom quantum states.</description>

      <title>Nearest Neighbor Representations of Neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Nearest Neighbor (NN) Representation is an emerging computational model that is inspired by the brain. We study the complexity of representing a neuron (threshold function) using the NN representations. It is known that two anchors (the points to which NN is computed) are sufficient for a NN representation of a threshold function, however, the resolution (the maximum number of bits required for the entries of an anchor) is $O(n\log{n})$. In this work, the trade-off between the number of anchors and the resolution of a NN representation of threshold functions is investigated. We prove that the well-known threshold functions EQUALITY, COMPARISON, and ODD-MAX-BIT, which require 2 or 3 anchors and resolution of $O(n)$, can be represented by polynomially large number of anchors in $n$ and $O(\log{n})$ resolution. We conjecture that for all threshold functions, there are NN representations with polynomially large size and logarithmic resolution in $n$.</description>

      <title>Nearest Neighbor Representations of Neural Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural networks successfully capture the computational power of the human brain for many tasks. Similarly inspired by the brain architecture, Nearest Neighbor (NN) representations is a novel approach of computation. We establish a firmer correspondence between NN representations and neural networks. Although it was known how to represent a single neuron using NN representations, there were no results even for small depth neural networks. Specifically, for depth-2 threshold circuits, we provide explicit constructions for their NN representation with an explicit bound on the number of bits to represent it. Example functions include NN representations of convex polytopes (AND of threshold gates), IP2, OR of threshold gates, and linear or exact decision lists.</description>

      <title>Conformal Hypergraphs: Duality and Implications for the Upper Clique Transversal Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00098v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a hypergraph $\mathcal{H}$, the dual hypergraph of $\mathcal{H}$ is the hypergraph of all minimal transversals of $\mathcal{H}$. The dual hypergraph is always Sperner, that is, no hyperedge contains another. A special case of Sperner hypergraphs are the conformal Sperner hypergraphs, which correspond to the families of maximal cliques of graphs. All these notions play an important role in many fields of mathematics and computer science, including combinatorics, algebra, database theory, etc. In this paper we study conformality of dual hypergraphs and prove several results related to the problem of recognizing this property. In particular, we show that the problem is in co-NP and can be solved in polynomial time for hypergraphs of bounded dimension. In the special case of dimension $3$, we reduce the problem to $2$-Satisfiability. Our approach has an implication in algorithmic graph theory: we obtain a polynomial-time algorithm for recognizing graphs in which all minimal transversals of maximal cliques have size at most $k$, for any fixed $k$.</description>

      <title>Twisted conjugacy in dihedral Artin groups I: Torus Knot groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16671v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we provide an alternative solution to a result by Juh\'{a}sz that the twisted conjugacy problem for odd dihedral Artin groups is solvable, that is, groups with presentation $G(m) = \langle a,b \; | \; _{m}(a,b) = {}_{m}(b,a) \rangle$, where $m\geq 3$ is odd, and $_{m}(a,b)$ is the word $abab \dots$ of length $m$, is solvable. Our solution provides an implementable linear time algorithm, by considering an alternative group presentation to that of a torus knot group, and working with geodesic normal forms. An application of this result is that the conjugacy problem is solvable in extensions of odd dihedral Artin groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04705v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this second paper we solve the twisted conjugacy problem for even dihedral Artin groups, that is, groups with presentation $G(m) = \langle a,b \mid {}_{m}(a,b) = {}_{m}(b,a) \rangle$, where $m \geq 2$ is even, and $_{m}(a,b)$ is the word $abab\dots$ of length $m$. Similar to odd dihedral Artin groups, we prove orbit decidability for all subgroups $A \leq \mathrm{Aut}(G(m))$, which then implies that the conjugacy problem is solvable in extensions of even dihedral Artin groups.</description>
