      <title>High Frequency Radar Observing System Simulation Experiment in the Western Mediterranean Sea: a Lagrangian assessment approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impact of the expansion of a high-frequency radar (HFR) system in the Ibiza Channel (Western Mediterranean Sea) is evaluated through an Observing System Simulation Experiment (OSSE). The installation of two new antennas in the Iberian Peninsula would complement the existing ones in the islands of Ibiza and Formentera, providing surface currents observations of the full channel. Two different configuration of the same model, validated to give realistic simulations, are used: i) a Nature Run (NR) which is considered as the real ocean state and that is used to generate pseudo-observations, and ii) a Control Run (CR) in which we will assimilate the pseudo-observations. The OSSE is first validated by comparison against a previous Observing System Experiment (OSE). The effect of the new antennas for forecasting surface currents is evaluated in two different periods. The effect of the new antennas is relatively small when the NR and CR depict a similar circulation. However, in situations where both models present higher differences, the error reduction with respect to the use of only the actual system can be of up to 19%. The effects on the transport in the area are also analyzed from a Lagrangian perspective, showing that DA can help to better represent the Lagrangian Coherent Structures present in the NR and constrain the ocean dynamics.</description>

      <title>WaveCastNet: A Deep Learning Ocean Wave Model with Energy Conservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional wave forecasting models, although based on energy conservation equations, are computationally expensive. On the other hand, existing deep learning geophysical fluid models, while computationally efficient, often suffer from issues such as energy dissipation in long-term forecasts. This paper proposes a novel energy-balanced deep learning wave forecasting model called WaveCastNet (WCN). By incorporating wind fields at the current, previous, and future time steps, as well as wave fields at the current and previous time steps as input variables, WCN maintains energy balance within the model. Furthermore, the model employs adaptive Fourier operators as its core components and designs a masked loss function to better handle the impact of land-sea boundaries. A series of experiments on the ERA5 dataset demonstrate that WCN can achieve short-term forecast accuracy comparable to traditional models while exhibiting an understanding of the wave generation process. In comparative experiments under both normal and extreme conditions, WCN consistently outperforms the widely used WaveWatch III model in the industry. Even after long-term forecasting, WCN maintains a stable and energy-rich state. By further constructing a simple meteorological model, WCN-wind, which considers energy balance, this paper confirms the importance of energy constraints for improving the long-term forecast performance of deep learning meteorological models. This finding provides new ideas for future research on deep learning geophysical fluid models.</description>

      <title>Applications of Deep Learning parameterization of Ocean Momentum Forcing</title>

Abstract: Mesoscale eddies are of utmost importance in understanding ocean dynamics and the transport of heat, salt, and nutrients. Accurate representation of these eddies in ocean models is essential for improving model predictions. However, accurately representing these mesoscale features in numerical models is challenging due to their relatively small size. In this study, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) that combines data-driven techniques with physical principles to develop a robust and interpretable parameterization scheme for mesoscale eddies in ocean modeling. We first analyze a high-resolution reanalysis dataset to extract subgrid eddy momentum and use machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and correlations. To ensure physical consistency, we have introduced conservation of momentum constraints in our CNN parameterization scheme through soft and hard constraints. The interpretability analysis illustrate that the pre-trained CNN parameterization shows promising results in accurately solving the resolved mean velocity at the local scale and effectively capturing the representation of unresolved subgrid turbulence processes at the global scale. Furthermore, to validate the CNN parameterization scheme offline, we conduct simulations using the MITgcm ocean model. A series of experiments is conducted to compare the performance of the model with the CNN parameterization scheme and high-resolution simulations. The offline validation using MITgcm simulations demonstrates the effectiveness of the CNN parameterization scheme in improving the representation of mesoscale eddies in the ocean model. Incorporating the CNN parameterization scheme leads to better agreement with high-resolution simulations and a more accurate representation of the kinetic energy spectra.</description>

      <title>Impact of ageostrophic dynamics on the predictability of Lagrangian trajectories in surface-ocean turbulence</title>

Abstract: Turbulent flows at the surface of the ocean deviate from geostrophic equilibrium on scales smaller than about 10 km. These scales are associated with important vertical transport of active and passive tracers, and should play a prominent role in the heat transport at climatic scales and for plankton dynamics. Measuring velocity fields on such small scales is notoriously difficult but new, high-resolution satellite altimetry is starting to reveal them. However, the satellite-derived velocities essentially represent the geostrophic flow component, and the impact of unresolved ageostrophic motions on particle dispersion needs to be understood to properly characterize transport properties. Here, we investigate ocean fine-scale turbulence using a model that represents some of the processes due to ageostrophic dynamics. We take a Lagrangian approach and focus on the predictability of the particle dynamics, comparing trajectories advected by either the full flow or by its geostrophic component only. Our results indicate that, over long times, relative dispersion is marginally affected by the filtering of the ageostrophic component. Nevertheless, advection by the filtered flow leads to an overestimation of the typical pair-separation rate, and to a bias on trajectories (in terms of displacement from the actual ones), whose importance grows with the Rossby number. We further explore the intensity of the transient particle clustering induced by ageostrophic motions and find that it can be significant, even for small flow compressibility. Indeed, we show that clustering is here due to the interplay between compressibility and persistent flow structures that trap particles, enhancing their aggregation.</description>

      <title>Towards Physically Consistent Deep Learning For Climate Model Parameterizations</title>

Abstract: Climate models play a critical role in understanding and projecting climate change. Due to their complexity, their horizontal resolution of ~40-100 km remains too coarse to resolve processes such as clouds and convection, which need to be approximated via parameterizations. These parameterizations are a major source of systematic errors and large uncertainties in climate projections. Deep learning (DL)-based parameterizations, trained on computationally expensive, short high-resolution simulations, have shown great promise for improving climate models in that regard. However, their lack of interpretability and tendency to learn spurious non-physical correlations result in reduced trust in the climate simulation. We propose an efficient supervised learning framework for DL-based parameterizations that leads to physically consistent models with improved interpretability and negligible computational overhead compared to standard supervised training. First, key features determining the target physical processes are uncovered. Subsequently, the neural network is fine-tuned using only those relevant features. We show empirically that our method robustly identifies a small subset of the inputs as actual physical drivers, therefore, removing spurious non-physical relationships. This results in by design physically consistent and interpretable neural networks while maintaining the predictive performance of standard black-box DL-based parameterizations. Our framework represents a crucial step in addressing a major challenge in data-driven climate model parameterizations by respecting the underlying physical processes, and may also benefit physically consistent deep learning in other research fields.</description>

      <title>Abyssal Slope Currents</title>

Abstract: Realistic computational simulations in different oceanic basins reveal prevalent prograde mean flows (i.e. in the direction of topographic Rossby wave propagation along isobaths; a.k.a. topostrophy) on topographic slopes in the deep ocean, consistent with the barotropic theory of eddy-driven mean flows. Attention is focused on the Western Mediterranean Sea with strong currents and steep topography. These prograde mean currents induce an opposing bottom drag stress and thus a turbulent boundary-layer mean flow in the downhill direction, evidenced by a near-bottom negative mean vertical velocity. The slope-normal profile of diapycnal buoyancy mixing results in down-slope mean advection near the bottom (a tendency to locally increase the mean buoyancy) and up-slope buoyancy mixing (a tendency to decrease buoyancy) with associated buoyancy fluxes across the mean isopycnal surfaces (diapycnal downwelling). In the upper part of the boundary layer and nearby interior, the diapycnal turbulent buoyancy flux divergence reverses sign (diapycnal upwelling), with upward Eulerian mean buoyancy advection across isopycnal surfaces. These near-slope tendencies abate with further distance from the boundary. An along-isobath mean momentum balance shows an advective acceleration and a bottom-drag retardation of the prograde flow. The eddy buoyancy advection is significant near the slope, and the associated eddy potential energy conversion is negative, consistent with mean vertical shear flow generation for the eddies. This cross-isobath flow structure differs from previous proposals, and a new one-dimensional model is constructed for a topostrophic, stratified, slope bottom boundary layer. The broader issue of the return pathways of the global thermohaline circulation remains open, but the abyssal slope region is likely to play a dominant role.</description>
