      <title>Beyond Binary Screens: A Continuous Shariah Compliance Index for Asset Pricing and Portfolio Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary Shariah screens vary across standards and apply hard thresholds that create discontinuous classifications. We construct a Continuous Shariah Compliance Index (CSCI) in $[0,1]$ by mapping standard screening ratios to smooth scores between conservative ``comfort'' bounds and permissive outer bounds, and aggregating them conservatively with a sectoral activity factor. Using CRSP/Compustat U.S. equities (1999-2024) with lagged accounting inputs and monthly rebalancing, we find that CSCI-based long-only portfolios have historical risk-adjusted performance similar to an emulated binary Islamic benchmark. Tightening the minimum compliance threshold reduces the investable universe and diversification and is associated with lower Sharpe ratios. The framework yields a practical compliance gradient that supports portfolio construction, constraint design, and cross-standard comparisons without reliance on pass/fail screening.</description>

      <title>Squeezed Covariance Matrix Estimation: Analytic Eigenvalue Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit Gerber's Informational Quality (IQ) framework, a data-driven approach for constructing correlation matrices from co-movement evidence, and address two obstacles that limit its use in portfolio optimization: guaranteeing positive semidefinite ness (PSD) and controlling spectral conditioning. We introduce a squeezing identity that represents IQ estimators as a convex-like combination of structured channel matrices, and propose an atomic-IQ parameterization in which each channel-class matrix is built from PSD atoms with a single class-level normalization. This yields constructive PSD guarantees over an explicit feasibility region, avoiding reliance on ex-post projection. To regulate conditioning, we develop an analytic eigen floor that targets either a minimum eigenvalue or a desired condition number and, when necessary, repairs PSD violations in closed form while remaining compatible with the squeezing identity. In long-only tangency back tests with transaction costs, atomic-IQ improves out-of-sample Sharpe ratios and delivers a more stable risk profile relative to a broad set of standard covariance estimators.</description>

      <title>Quantum Stochastic Walks for Portfolio Optimization: Theory and Implementation on Financial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03963v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Financial markets are noisy yet contain a latent graph-theoretic structure that can be exploited for superior risk-adjusted returns. We propose a quantum stochastic walk (QSW) optimizer that embeds assets in a weighted graph: nodes represent securities while edges encode the return-covariance kernel. Portfolio weights are derived from the walk's stationary distribution. Three empirical studies support the approach. (i) For the top 100 S\&amp;P 500 constituents over 2016-2024, six scenario portfolios calibrated on 1- and 2-year windows lift the out-of-sample Sharpe ratio by up to 27\% while cutting annual turnover from 480\% (mean-variance) to 2-90%. (ii) A $5^{4}=625$-point grid search identifies a robust sweet spot, $\alpha,\lambda\lesssim0.5$ and $\omega\in[0.2,0.4]$, that delivers Sharpe $\approx0.97$ at $\le 5\%$ turnover and Herfindahl-Hirschman index $\sim0.01$. (iii) Repeating the full grid on 50 random 100-stock subsets of the S\&amp;P 500 adds 31\,350 back-tests: the best-per-draw QSW beats re-optimised mean-variance on Sharpe in 54\% of cases and always wins on trading efficiency, with median turnover 36\% versus 351\%. Overall, QSW raises the annualized Sharpe ratio by 15\% and cuts turnover by 90\% relative to classical optimisation, all while respecting the UCITS 5/10/40 rule. These results show that hybrid quantum-classical dynamics can uncover non-linear dependencies overlooked by quadratic models and offer a practical, low-cost weighting engine for themed ETFs and other systematic mandates.</description>

      <title>Not All Factors Crowd Equally: Modeling, Measuring, and Trading on Alpha Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11913v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a specific functional form for factor alpha decay -- hyperbolic decay alpha(t) = K/(1+lambda*t) -- from a game-theoretic equilibrium model, and test it against linear and exponential alternatives. Using eight Fama-French factors (1963--2024), we find: (1) Hyperbolic decay fits mechanical factors. Momentum exhibits clear hyperbolic decay (R^2 = 0.65), outperforming linear (0.51) and exponential (0.61) baselines -- validating the equilibrium foundation. (2) Not all factors crowd equally. Mechanical factors (momentum, reversal) fit the model; judgment-based factors (value, quality) do not -- consistent with a signal-ambiguity taxonomy paralleling Hua and Sun's "barriers to entry." (3) Crowding accelerated post-2015. Out-of-sample, the model over-predicts remaining alpha (0.30 vs. 0.15), correlating with factor ETF growth (rho = -0.63). (4) Average returns are efficiently priced. Crowding-based factor selection fails to generate alpha (Sharpe: 0.22 vs. 0.39 factor momentum benchmark). (5) Crowding predicts tail risk. Out-of-sample (2001--2024), crowded reversal factors show 1.7--1.8x higher crash probability (bottom decile returns), while crowded momentum shows lower crash risk (0.38x, p = 0.006). Our findings extend equilibrium crowding models (DeMiguel et al.) to temporal dynamics and show that crowding predicts crashes, not means -- useful for risk management, not alpha generation.</description>

      <title>The Aligned Economic Index &amp; The State Switching Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20460v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A growing empirical literature suggests that equity-premium predictability is state dependent, with much of the forecasting power concentrated around recessionary periods (Henkel et al., 2011; Dangl and Halling, 2012; Devpura et al., 2018). I study U.S. stock return predictability across economic regimes and document strong evidence of time-varying expected returns across both expansionary and contractionary states. I contribute in two ways. First, I introduce a state-switching predictive regression in which the market state is defined in real time using the slope of the yield curve. Relative to the standard one-state predictive regression, the state-switching specification increases both in-sample and out-of-sample performance for the set of popular predictors considered by Welch and Goyal (2008), improving the out-of-sample performance of most predictors in economically meaningful ways. Second, I propose a new aggregate predictor, the Aligned Economic Index, constructed via partial least squares (PLS). Under the state-switching model, the Aligned Economic Index exhibits statistically and economically significant predictive power in sample and out of sample, and it outperforms widely used benchmark predictors and alternative predictor-combination methods.</description>
