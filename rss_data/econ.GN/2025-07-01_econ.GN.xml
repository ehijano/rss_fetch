      <title>Beyond Code: The Multidimensional Impacts of Large Language Models in Software Development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are poised to significantly impact software development, especially in the Open-Source Software (OSS) sector. To understand this impact, we first outline the mechanisms through which LLMs may influence OSS through code development, collaborative knowledge transfer, and skill development. We then empirically examine how LLMs affect OSS developers' work in these three key areas. Leveraging a natural experiment from a temporary ChatGPT ban in Italy, we employ a Difference-in-Differences framework with two-way fixed effects to analyze data from all OSS developers on GitHub in three similar countries, Italy, France, and Portugal, totaling 88,022 users. We find that access to ChatGPT increases developer productivity by 6.4%, knowledge sharing by 9.6%, and skill acquisition by 8.4%. These benefits vary significantly by user experience level: novice developers primarily experience productivity gains, whereas more experienced developers benefit more from improved knowledge sharing and accelerated skill acquisition. In addition, we find that LLM-assisted learning is highly context-dependent, with the greatest benefits observed in technically complex, fragmented, or rapidly evolving contexts. We show that the productivity effects of LLMs extend beyond direct code generation to include enhanced collaborative learning and knowledge exchange among developers; dynamics that are essential for gaining a holistic understanding of LLMs' impact in OSS. Our findings offer critical managerial implications: strategically deploying LLMs can accelerate novice developers' onboarding and productivity, empower intermediate developers to foster knowledge sharing and collaboration, and support rapid skill acquisition, together enhancing long-term organizational productivity and agility.</description>

      <title>Temperature Sensitivity of Residential Energy Demand on the Global Scale: A Bayesian Partial Pooling Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper contributes to the limited literature on the temperature sensitivity of residential energy demand on a global scale. Using a Bayesian Partial Pooling model, we estimate country-specific intercepts and slopes, focusing on non-linear temperature response functions. The results, based on data for up to 126 countries spanning from 1978 to 2023, indicate a higher demand for residential electricity and natural gas at temperatures below -5 degrees Celsius and a higher demand for electricity at temperatures above 30 degrees Celsius. For temperatures above 23.5 degrees Celsius, the relationship between power demand and temperature steepens. Demand in developed countries is more sensitive to high temperatures than in less developed countries, possibly due to an inability to meet cooling demands in the latter.</description>

      <title>Tracking the affordability of least-cost healthy diets helps guide intervention for food security and improved nutrition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This Policy Comment describes how the Food Policy article entitled 'Cost and affordability of nutritious diets at retail prices: Evidence from 177 countries' (first published October 2020) and 'Retail consumer price data reveal gaps and opportunities to monitor food systems for nutrition' (first published September 2021) advanced the use of least-cost benchmark diets to monitor and improve food security. Those papers contributed to the worldwide use of least-cost diets as a new diagnostic indicator of food access, helping to distinguish among causes of poor diet quality related to high prices, low incomes, or displacement by other food options, thereby guiding intervention toward universal access to healthy diets.</description>

      <title>Digital Transformation and the Restructuring of Employment: Evidence from Chinese Listed Firms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines how digital transformation reshapes employment structures within Chinese listed firms, focusing on occupational functions and task intensity. Drawing on recruitment data classified under ISCO-08 and the Chinese Standard Occupational Classification 2022, we categorize jobs into five functional groups: management, professional, technical, auxiliary, and manual. Using a task-based framework, we construct routine, abstract, and manual task intensity indices through keyword analysis of job descriptions. We find that digitalization is associated with increased hiring in managerial, professional, and technical roles, and reduced demand for auxiliary and manual labor. At the task level, abstract task demand rises, while routine and manual tasks decline. Moderation analyses link these shifts to improvements in managerial efficiency and executive compensation. Our findings highlight how emerging technologies, including large language models (LLMs), are reshaping skill demands and labor dynamics in Chinas corporate sector.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism with a Quantitative Trade Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the economic and environmental impacts of the European Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM). We develop a multi-country, multi-sector general equilibrium model with input-output linkages and characterise the general equilibrium response of trade flows, welfare and emissions. As far as we know, this is the first quantitative trade model that jointly endogenises the Emission Trading Scheme (ETS) allowances and CBAM prices. We find that the CBAM increases by 0.005\% the EU Gross National Expenditure (GNE), while trade shifts towards domestic cleaner production. Notably, emissions embodied in direct EU imports fall by almost 4.80\%, but supply chain's upstream substitution effects imply a decrease in emissions embodied in EU indirect imports by about 3\%. The latter involves a dampening effect that we can detect only by explicitly incorporating the production network. In contrast, extra-EU countries experience a slight decline in GNE (0.009\%) and a reduction in emissions leakage (0.11\%).</description>

      <title>From Model Design to Organizational Design: Complexity Redistribution and Trade-Offs in Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Generality-Accuracy-Simplicity (GAS) framework to analyze how large language models (LLMs) are reshaping organizations and competitive strategy. We argue that viewing AI as a simple reduction in input costs overlooks two critical dynamics: (a) the inherent trade-offs among generality, accuracy, and simplicity, and (b) the redistribution of complexity across stakeholders. While LLMs appear to defy the traditional trade-off by offering high generality and accuracy through simple interfaces, this user-facing simplicity masks a significant shift of complexity to infrastructure, compliance, and specialized personnel. The GAS trade-off, therefore, does not disappear but is relocated from the user to the organization, creating new managerial challenges, particularly around accuracy in high-stakes applications. We contend that competitive advantage no longer stems from mere AI adoption, but from mastering this redistributed complexity through the design of abstraction layers, workflow alignment, and complementary expertise. This study advances AI strategy by clarifying how scalable cognition relocates complexity and redefines the conditions for technology integration.</description>

      <title>FairMarket-RL: LLM-Guided Fairness Shaping for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning in Peer-to-Peer Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Peer-to-peer (P2P) trading is increasingly recognized as a key mechanism for decentralized market regulation, yet existing approaches often lack robust frameworks to ensure fairness. This paper presents FairMarket-RL, a novel hybrid framework that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enable fairness-aware trading agents. In a simulated P2P microgrid with multiple sellers and buyers, the LLM acts as a real-time fairness critic, evaluating each trading episode using two metrics: Fairness-To-Buyer (FTB) and Fairness-Between-Sellers (FBS). These fairness scores are integrated into agent rewards through scheduled {\lambda}-coefficients, forming an adaptive LLM-guided reward shaping loop that replaces brittle, rule-based fairness constraints. Agents are trained using Independent Proximal Policy Optimization (IPPO) and achieve equitable outcomes, fulfilling over 90% of buyer demand, maintaining fair seller margins, and consistently reaching FTB and FBS scores above 0.80. The training process demonstrates that fairness feedback improves convergence, reduces buyer shortfalls, and narrows profit disparities between sellers. With its language-based critic, the framework scales naturally, and its extension to a large power distribution system with household prosumers illustrates its practical applicability. FairMarket-RL thus offers a scalable, equity-driven solution for autonomous trading in decentralized energy systems.</description>

      <title>Autonomy by Design: Preserving Human Autonomy in AI Decision-Support</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI systems increasingly support human decision-making across domains of professional, skill-based, and personal activity. While previous work has examined how AI might affect human autonomy globally, the effects of AI on domain-specific autonomy -- the capacity for self-governed action within defined realms of skill or expertise -- remain understudied. We analyze how AI decision-support systems affect two key components of domain-specific autonomy: skilled competence (the ability to make informed judgments within one's domain) and authentic value-formation (the capacity to form genuine domain-relevant values and preferences). By engaging with prior investigations and analyzing empirical cases across medical, financial, and educational domains, we demonstrate how the absence of reliable failure indicators and the potential for unconscious value shifts can erode domain-specific autonomy both immediately and over time. We then develop a constructive framework for autonomy-preserving AI support systems. We propose specific socio-technical design patterns -- including careful role specification, implementation of defeater mechanisms, and support for reflective practice -- that can help maintain domain-specific autonomy while leveraging AI capabilities. This framework provides concrete guidance for developing AI systems that enhance rather than diminish human agency within specialized domains of action.</description>

      <title>The quality of school track assignment decisions by teachers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.10636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper analyzes the effects of educational tracking and the quality of track assignment decisions. We motivate our analysis using a model of optimal track assignment under uncertainty. This model generates predictions about the average effects of tracking at the margin of the assignment process. In addition, we recognize that the average effects do not measure noise in the assignment process, as they may reflect a mix of both positive and negative tracking effects. To test these ideas, we develop a flexible causal approach that separates, organizes, and partially identifies tracking effects of any sign or form. We apply this approach in the context of a regression discontinuity design in the Netherlands, where teachers issue track recommendations that may be revised based on test score cutoffs, and where in some cases parents can overrule this recommendation. Our results indicate substantial tracking effects: between 40% and 100% of reassigned students are positively or negatively affected by enrolling in a higher track. Most tracking effects are positive, however, with students benefiting from being placed in a higher, more demanding track. While based on the current analysis we cannot reject the hypothesis that teacher assignments are unbiased, this result seems only consistent with a significant degree of noise. We discuss that parental decisions, whether to follow or deviate from teacher recommendations, may help reducing this noise.</description>

      <title>Value-transforming financial, carbon and biodiversity footprint accounting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transformative changes in our production and consumption habits are needed to halt biodiversity loss. Organizations are the way we humans have organized our everyday life, and much of our negative environmental impacts, also called carbon and biodiversity footprints, are caused by organizations. Here we explore how the accounts of any organization can be exploited to develop an integrated carbon and biodiversity footprint account. As a metric we utilize spatially explicit potential global loss of species across all ecosystem types and argue that it can be understood as the biodiversity equivalent. The utility of the biodiversity equivalent for biodiversity could be like what carbon dioxide equivalent is for climate. We provide a global country specific dataset that organizations, experts and researchers can use to assess consumption-based biodiversity footprints. We also argue that the current integration of financial and environmental accounting is superficial and provide a framework for a more robust financial value-transforming accounting model. To test the methodologies, we utilized a Finnish university as a living lab. Assigning an offsetting cost to the footprints significantly altered the financial value of the organization. We believe such value-transforming accounting is needed to draw the attention of senior executives and investors to the negative environmental impacts of their organizations.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Remittance Inflows- International Reserves-External Debt Dyad: Exploring Bangladesh's Economic Resilience in Avoiding Sovereign Default Compared to Sri Lanka</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: External debt has been identified as the most liable to cause financial crises in developing countries in Asia and Latin America. One recent example of near bankruptcy in Sri Lanka has raised serious concerns among economists about how to anticipate and tackle external debt-related problems. Bangladesh also faced a decline in export income and a sharp rise in import prices amid the aforementioned global shocks. Nevertheless, the international reserves of Bangladesh have never fallen to the level they did in Sri Lanka. This paper examines the relationship between remittance inflows, international reserves, and external debt in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. Econometric estimations reveal that remittance affects external debt both directly and through international reserves in Bangladesh. The existence of a Dutch Disease effect in the remittance inflows-international reserves relationship has also been confirmed in Bangladesh. We also show that Bangladesh uses international reserves as collateral to obtain more external borrowing, while Sri Lanka, like many other developing countries, accumulates international reserves to deplete in "bad times." Remittances can be seen as one of the significant factors preventing Bangladesh from becoming a sovereign defaulter, whereas Sri Lanka faced that fate.</description>

      <title>The Anatomy of Value Creation: Input-Output Linkages, Policy Shifts, and Economic Impact in India's Mobile Phone GVC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines the economic impact of India's involvement in mobile phone manufacturing in the Global Value Chain (GVC), which is marked by rapid growth and significant policy attention. We specifically quantify the domestic value added, employment generation (direct and indirect, disaggregated by skill and gender), and evidence of upgrading, considering the influence of recent policy shifts. Methodologically, this study pioneers the construction and application of highly disaggregated (7-digit NPCMS) annual Supply-Use Tables (SUTs) and symmetric Input-Output Tables (IOTs) for the Indian manufacturing sector. These tables are derived from plant-level microdata from the Annual Survey of Industries (ASI) from 2016-17 to 2022-23. Applying the Leontief Input-Output framework, we trace inter-sectoral linkages and decompose economic impacts. Our findings reveal a significant expansion in Domestic Value Added (DVA) within the mobile phone sector, with indirect DVA growing exceptionally, indicating a substantial deepening of domestic backward linkages. This sector has become a significant employment generator, supporting over a million direct and indirect jobs on average between 2019-20 and 2022-23, with a notable surge in export-linked employment and increased female participation, alongside a rise in contractual labour. This paper contributes granular, firm-level, data-driven evidence to the debate on the benefits of GVC participation, particularly for economies engaged in assembly-led manufacturing. The results suggest that strategic policy interventions that foster scale and export competitiveness can significantly enhance domestic economic gains, even in the presence of initial import dependencies. The findings provide critical insights for policymakers seeking to maximise value capture and promote sustainable industrial development through deeper Global Value Chain (GVC) integration.</description>
