      <title>Base-extension Semantics for Intuitionistic Modal Logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proof theory and semantics of intuitionistic modal logics have been studied by Simpson in terms of Prawitz-style labelled natural deduction systems and Kripke models. An alternative to model-theoretic semantics is provided by proof-theoretic semantics, which is a logical realization of inferentialism, in which the meaning of constructs is understood through their use. The key idea in proof-theoretic semantics is that of a base of atomic rules, all of which refer only to propositional atoms and involve no logical connectives. A specific form of proof-theoretic semantics, known as base-extension semantics (B-eS), is concerned with the validity of formulae and provides a direct counterpart to Kripke models that is grounded in the provability of atomic formulae in a base. We establish, systematically, B-eS for Simpson's intuitionistic modal logics and, also systematically, obtain soundness and completeness theorems with respect to Simpson's natural deduction systems.</description>

      <title>Results on Colored Tree Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce novel variations on several well-known model-theoretic tree properties, and prove several equivalences to known properties. Motivated by the study of generalized indiscernibles, we introduce the notion of the $\calI$-tree property ($\calI$-TP), for an arbitrary Ramsey index structure $\calI$. We focus attention on the colored linear order index structure \textbf{c}, showing that \textbf{c}-TP is equivalent to instability. After introducing \textbf{c}-$\TPi$ and \textbf{c}-$\TPii$, we prove that \textbf{c}-$\TPi$ is equivalent to $\TPi$, and that \textbf{c}-$\TPii$ is equivalent to IP. We see that these three tree properties give a dichotomy theorem, just as with TP, $\TPi$, and $\TPii$. Along the way, we observe that appropriately generalized tree index structures $\calI^{&lt;\omega}$ are Ramsey, allowing for the use of generalized tree indiscernibles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the isomorphism problem for ergodic actions of locally compact groups. In particular we show that the conjugacy relation is not Borel for ergodic measure preserving actions of indicable groups.</description>

      <title>Minimal sofic shift on a group that is not finitely-generated</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that there exists a group which is not finitely generated, but admits a minimal sofic shift. This answers a question of Doucha, Melleray and Tsankov. The group is of the form $(F_4 \times F_2) \rtimes F_{\infty}$. The construction itself is based on simulation theory and properties of Thompson's~$V$.</description>

      <title>Comparing Dialectical Systems: Contradiction and Counterexample in Belief Change (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dialectical systems are a mathematical formalism for modeling an agent updating a knowledge base seeking consistency. Introduced in the 1970s by Roberto Magari, they were originally conceived to capture how a working mathematician or a research community refines beliefs in the pursuit of truth. Dialectical systems also serve as natural models for the belief change of an automated agent, offering a unifying, computable framework for dynamic belief management.
  The literature distinguishes three main models of dialectical systems: (d-)dialectical systems based on revising beliefs when they are seen to be inconsistent, p-dialectical systems based on revising beliefs based on finding a counterexample, and q-dialectical systems which can do both. We answer an open problem in the literature by proving that q-dialectical systems are strictly more powerful than p-dialectical systems, which are themselves known to be strictly stronger than (d-)dialectical systems. This result highlights the complementary roles of counterexample and contradiction in automated belief revision, and thus also in the reasoning processes of mathematicians and research communities.</description>

      <title>Proof-Theoretic Functional Completeness for the Connexive Logic C</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show the functional completeness for the connectives of the non-trivial negation inconsistent logic C by using a well-established method implementing purely proof-theoretic notions only. Firstly, given that C contains a strong negation, expressing a notion of direct refutation, the proof needs to be applied in a bilateralist way in that not only higher-order rule schemata for proofs but also for refutations need to be considered. Secondly, given that C is a connexive logic we need to take a connexive understanding of inference as a basis, leading to a different conception of (higher-order) refutation than is usually employed.</description>

      <title>On the Borel complexity of the space of left-orderings of nilpotent groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give the first examples of nonabelian left-orderable groups such that the conjugacy orbit equivalence relation on its space of orders has infinity orbits, yet it is smooth in the Borel sense. The examples are all nilpotent groups and we provide a sufficient condition so that the space of orders of a nilpotent group has a smooth conjugacy orbit relation. We also show with different examples that nilpotence is not a sufficient condition for smoothness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09716v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give another bit of evidence that forcing axioms provide proper framework for rigidity of quotient structures, by improving the OCA lifting theorem proved by the author in late 20th century and greatly simplifying its proof. In the assumptions of this theorem. We also extend the conclusion of author's 2004 lifting theorem from a lifting result for countably 3204-determined ideals to one for countably 80-determined ideals and weaken its assumptions.</description>
