      <title>A high-order explicit Runge-Kutta approximation technique for the Shallow Water Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a high-order space-time approximation of the Shallow Water Equations with sources that is invariant-domain preserving (IDP) and well-balanced with respect to rest states. The employed time-stepping technique is a novel explicit Runge-Kutta (ERK) approach which is an extension of the class of ERK-IDP methods introduced by Ern and Guermond (SIAM J. Sci. Comput. 44(5), A3366--A3392, 2022) for systems of non-linear conservation equations. The resulting method is then numerically illustrated through verification and validation.</description>

      <title>Linear Numerical Schemes for a $\textbf{Q}$-Tensor System for Nematic Liquid Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present three linear numerical schemes to model nematic liquid crystals using the Landau-de Gennes $\textbf{Q}$-tensor theory. The first scheme is based on using a truncation procedure of the energy, which allows for an unconditionally energy stable first order accurate decoupled scheme. The second scheme uses a modified second order accurate optimal dissipation algorithm, which gives a second order accurate coupled scheme. Finally, the third scheme uses a new idea to decouple the unknowns from the second scheme which allows us to obtain accurate dynamics while improving computational efficiency. We present several numerical experiments to offer a comparative study of the accuracy, efficiency and the ability of the numerical schemes to represent realistic dynamics.</description>

      <title>A novel directly energy-preserving method for charged particle dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we apply the coordinate increment discrete gradient (CIDG) method to solve the Lorentz force system which can be written as a non-canonical Hamiltonian system. Then we can obtain a new energy-preserving CIDG-I method for the system. The CIDG-I method can combine with its adjoint method CIDG-II which is also a energy-preserving method to form a new method, namely CIDG-C method. The CIDG-C method is symmetrical and can conserve the Hamiltonian energy directly and exactly. With comparison to the well-used Boris method, numerical experiments indicate that the CIDG-C method holds advantage over the Boris method in terms of energy-conserving.
  The Fig. 5(b) in the original paper contains an error. We submit the correct Fig. 5(b) and an errata in this paper, which is described in remark4.1.</description>

      <title>Numerical analysis of a FE/SAV scheme for a Caginalp phase field model with mechanical effects in stereolithography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we propose a phase field model based on a Caginalp system with mechanical effects to study the underlying physical and chemical processes behind stereolithography, which is an additive manufacturing (3D printing) technique that builds objects in a layer-by-layer fashion by using an ultraviolet laser to solidify liquid polymer resins. Existence of weak solutions is established by demonstrating the convergence of a numerical scheme based on a first order scalar auxiliary variable temporal discretization and a finite element spatial discretization. We further establish uniqueness and regularity of solutions, as well as optimal error estimates for the Caginalp system that are supported by numerical simulations. We also present some qualitative two-dimensional simulations of the stereolithography processes captured by the model.</description>

      <title>Stability evaluation of approximate Riemann solvers using the direct Lyapunov method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper presents a new approach of stability evaluation of the approximate Riemann solvers based on the direct Lyapunov method. The present methodology offers a detailed understanding of the origins of numerical shock instability in the approximate Riemann solvers. The pressure perturbation feeding the density and transverse momentum perturbations is identified as the cause of the numerical shock instabilities in the complete approximate Riemann solvers, while the magnitude of the numerical shock instabilities are found to be proportional to the magnitude of the pressure perturbations. A shock-stable HLLEM scheme is proposed based on the insights obtained from this analysis about the origins of numerical shock instability in the approximate Riemann solvers. A set of numerical test cases are solved to show that the proposed scheme is free from numerical shock instability problems of the original HLLEM scheme at high Mach numbers.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic unfolding for image reconstruction and localization problems in fluorescence microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an unfolded accelerated projected-gradient descent procedure to estimate model and algorithmic parameters for image super-resolution and molecule localization problems in image microscopy. The variational lower-level constraint enforces sparsity of the solution and encodes different noise statistics (Gaussian, Poisson), while the upper-level cost assesses optimality w.r.t.~the task considered. In more detail, a standard $\ell_2$ cost is considered for image reconstruction (e.g., deconvolution/super-resolution, semi-blind deconvolution) problems, while a smoothed $\ell_1$ is employed to assess localization precision in some exemplary fluorescence microscopy problems exploiting single-molecule activation. Several numerical experiments are reported to validate the proposed approach on synthetic and realistic ISBI data.</description>

      <title>A new construction of modified equations for variational integrators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The construction of modified equations is an important step in the backward error analysis of symplectic integrator for Hamiltonian systems. In the context of partial differential equations, the standard construction leads to modified equations with increasingly high frequencies which increase the regularity requirements on the analysis. In this paper, we consider the next order modified equations for the implicit midpoint rule applied to the semilinear wave equation to give a proof-of-concept of a new construction which works directly with the variational principle. We show that a carefully chosen change of coordinates yields a modified system which inherits its analytical properties from the original wave equation. Our method systematically exploits additional degrees of freedom by modifying the symplectic structure and the Hamiltonian together.</description>

      <title>Coupled Boundary and Volume Integral Equations for Electromagnetic Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study frequency domain electromagnetic scattering at a bounded, penetrable, and inhomogeneous obstacle $ \Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^3 $. From the Stratton-Chu integral representation, we derive a new representation formula when constant reference coefficients are given for the interior domain. The resulting integral representation contains the usual layer potentials, but also volume potentials on $\Omega$. Then it is possible to follow a single-trace approach to obtain boundary integral equations perturbed by traces of compact volume integral operators with weakly singular kernels. The coupled boundary and volume integral equations are discretized with a Galerkin approach with usual Curl-conforming and Div-conforming finite elements on the boundary and in the volume. Compression techniques and special quadrature rules for singular integrands are required for an efficient and accurate method. Numerical experiments provide evidence that our new formulation enjoys promising properties.</description>

      <title>Normalized B-spline-like representation for low-degree Hermite osculatory interpolation problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with Hermite osculatory interpolating splines. For a partition of a real interval endowed with a refinement consisting in dividing each subinterval into two small subintervals, we consider a space of smooth splines with additional smoothness at the vertices of the initial partition, and of the lowest possible degree. A normalized B-spline-like representation for the considered spline space is provided. In addition, several quasi-interpolation operators based on blossoming and control polynomials have also been developed. Some numerical tests are presented and compared with some recent works to illustrate the performance of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty quantification in the Henry problem using the multilevel Monte Carlo method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the applicability of the well-known multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) method to the class of density-driven flow problems, in particular the problem of salinisation of coastal aquifers. As a test case, we solve the uncertain Henry saltwater intrusion problem. Unknown porosity, permeability and recharge parameters are modelled by using random fields. The classical deterministic Henry problem is non-linear and time-dependent, and can easily take several hours of computing time. Uncertain settings require the solution of multiple realisations of the deterministic problem, and the total computational cost increases drastically. Instead of computing of hundreds random realisations, typically the mean value and the variance are computed. The standard methods such as the Monte Carlo or surrogate-based methods is a good choice, but they compute all stochastic realisations on the same, often, very fine mesh. They also do not balance the stochastic and discretisation errors. These facts motivated us to apply the MLMC method. We demonstrate that by solving the Henry problem on multi-level spatial and temporal meshes, the MLMC method reduces the overall computational and storage costs. To reduce the computing cost further, parallelization is performed in both physical and stochastic spaces. To solve each deterministic scenario, we run the parallel multigrid solver ug4 in a black-box fashion.</description>

      <title>Robust Containment Queries over Collections of Rational Parametric Curves via Generalized Winding Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Point containment queries for regions bound by watertight geometric surfaces, i.e. closed and without self-intersections, can be evaluated straightforwardly with a number of well-studied algorithms. However, when such assumptions on domain geometry are not met, these methods are theoretically unfounded at best and practically unusable at worst. More robust classification schemes utilize generalized winding numbers, a mathematical construction that is indifferent to imperfections in the often human-defined geometric model. We extend this methodology to more general curved shapes, defining a robust containment query for regions whose boundary elements are defined by a collection of rational parametric curves. In doing so, we devise an algorithm that is stable and accurate at arbitrary points in space, circumventing the typical difficulties for queries that are arbitrarily close or coincident with the model. This is done by reducing the generalized winding number problem to an integer winding number problem, which is solved by approximating each curve with a polyline that provably has the same winding number at the point of interest. We demonstrate the improvements in computational complexity granted by this method over conventional techniques, as well as the robustness induced by its application</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.08448v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe fast algorithms for approximating the connection coefficients between a family of orthogonal polynomials and another family with a polynomially or rationally modified measure. The connection coefficients are computed via infinite-dimensional banded matrix factorizations and may be used to compute the modified Jacobi matrices all in linear complexity with respect to the truncation degree. A family of orthogonal polynomials with modified classical weights is constructed that support banded differentiation matrices, enabling sparse spectral methods with modified classical orthogonal polynomials.</description>

      <title>Randomly sampling bipartite networks with fixed degree sequences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.04937v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Statistical analysis of bipartite networks frequently requires randomly sampling from the set of all bipartite networks with the same degree sequence as an observed network. Trade algorithms offer an efficient way to generate samples of bipartite networks by incrementally `trading' the positions of some of their edges. However, it is difficult to know how many such trades are required to ensure that the sample is random. I propose a stopping rule that focuses on the distance between sampled networks and the observed network, and stops performing trades when this distribution stabilizes. Analyses demonstrate that, for over 300 different degree sequences, using this stopping rule ensures a random sample with a high probability, and that it is practical for use in empirical applications.</description>

      <title>Diffraction of acoustic waves by multiple semi-infinite arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analytical methods are fundamental in studying acoustics problems. One of the important tools is the Wiener-Hopf method, which can be used to solve many canonical problems with sharp transitions in boundary conditions on a plane/plate. However, there are some strict limitations to its use, usually the boundary conditions need to be imposed on parallel lines (after a suitable mapping). Such mappings exist for wedges with continuous boundaries, but for discrete boundaries, they have not yet been constructed. In our previous article, we have overcome this limitation and studied the diffraction of acoustic waves by a wedge consisting of point scatterers. Here, the problem is generalised to an arbitrary number of periodic semi-infinite arrays with arbitrary orientations. This is done by constructing several coupled systems of equations (one for every semi-infinite array) which are treated independently. The derived systems of equations are solved using the discrete Wiener-Hopf technique and the resulting matrix equation is inverted using elementary matrix arithmetic. Of course, numerically this matrix needs to be truncated, but we are able to do so such that thousands of scatterers on every array are included in the numerical results. Comparisons with other numerical methods are considered, and their strengths/weaknesses are highlighted.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.17027v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose the unfitted spectral element method for solving elliptic interface and corresponding eigenvalue problems. The novelty of the proposed method lies in its combination of the spectral accuracy of the spectral element method and the flexibility of the unfitted Nitsche's method. We also use tailored ghost penalty terms to enhance its robustness. We establish optimal $hp$ convergence rates for both elliptic interface problems and interface eigenvalue problems. Additionally, we demonstrate spectral accuracy for model problems in terms of polynomial degree.</description>

      <title>A simple GPU implementation of spectral-element methods for solving 3D Poisson type equations on rectangular domains and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known since 1960s that by exploring the tensor product structure of the discrete Laplacian on Cartesian meshes, one can develop a simple direct Poisson solver with an $\mathcal O(N^{\frac{d+1}d})$ complexity in d-dimension, where N is the number of the total unknowns. The GPU acceleration of numerically solving PDEs has been explored successfully around fifteen years ago and become more and more popular in the past decade, driven by significant advancement in both hardware and software technologies, especially in the recent few years. We present in this paper a simple but extremely fast MATLAB implementation on a modern GPU, which can be easily reproduced, for solving 3D Poisson type equations using a spectral-element method. In particular, it costs less than one second on a Nvidia A100 for solving a Poisson equation with one billion degree of freedoms. We also present applications of this fast solver to solve a linear (time-independent) Schr\"odinger equation and a nonlinear (time-dependent) Cahn-Hilliard equation.</description>

      <title>Ensemble learning for Physics Informed Neural Networks: a Gradient Boosting approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.13143v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While the popularity of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) is steadily rising, to this date, PINNs have not been successful in simulating multi-scale and singular perturbation problems. In this work, we present a new training paradigm referred to as "gradient boosting" (GB), which significantly enhances the performance of physics informed neural networks (PINNs). Rather than learning the solution of a given PDE using a single neural network directly, our algorithm employs a sequence of neural networks to achieve a superior outcome. This approach allows us to solve problems presenting great challenges for traditional PINNs. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm through various benchmarks, including comparisons with finite element methods and PINNs. Furthermore, this work also unlocks the door to employing ensemble learning techniques in PINNs, providing opportunities for further improvement in solving PDEs.</description>

Abstract: In this study, the statistical downscaling model (SDSM) is employed for downscaling the precipitation (PREC), maximum temperature (T max ) and minimum temperature (T min ) over Krishna River Basin (KRB). The Canadian Earth System Model, version 2 (CanESM2) General Circulation Model (GCM) outputs were considered as predictor variables. First, the SDSM is calibrated using 30-years (1961-1990) of data and subsequently validated for 15-years (1991-2005). Upon perceiving the satisfactory performance, the SDSM is further used for projecting the predictand variables (PRECP, T max and T min ) for the 21 st century considering three Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios viz. RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. The future period is divided into three 30-year time slices named epoch-1 (2011-2040), epoch-2 (2041-2070) and epoch-3 (2071-2100) respectively. Further, 1976-2005 is considered as baseline period and all the future results are compared with this data. The results were analysed at various temporal scales, i.e., monthly, seasonal and annual. The study reveals that the KRB is going to become wetter during all the seasons. The results are discussed for the worst-case scenario i.e., RCP8.5 epoch-3. The average annual maximum and minimum temperature is expected to increase. The extreme event analysis is also carried out considering the 90 th and 95 th percentile values. It is noticed that the extreme (90 th and 95 th percentiles) are going to increase. There are events more than extreme values. The outcome of this study can be used in flood modelling for the KRB and also for the modelling of future irrigation demands along with the planning of optimal irrigation in the KRB culturable command area.</description>

      <title>Fixed-sparsity matrix approximation from matrix-vector products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09379v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of approximating a matrix $\mathbf{A}$ with a matrix that has a fixed sparsity pattern (e.g., diagonal, banded, etc.), when $\mathbf{A}$ is accessed only by matrix-vector products. We describe a simple randomized algorithm that returns an approximation with the given sparsity pattern with Frobenius-norm error at most $(1+\varepsilon)$ times the best possible error. When each row of the desired sparsity pattern has at most $s$ nonzero entries, this algorithm requires $O(s/\varepsilon)$ non-adaptive matrix-vector products with $\mathbf{A}$. We also prove a matching lower-bound, showing that, for any sparsity pattern with $\Theta(s)$ nonzeros per row and column, any algorithm achieving $(1+\epsilon)$ approximation requires $\Omega(s/\varepsilon)$ matrix-vector products in the worst case. We thus resolve the matrix-vector product query complexity of the problem up to constant factors, even for the well-studied case of diagonal approximation, for which no previous lower bounds were known.</description>
