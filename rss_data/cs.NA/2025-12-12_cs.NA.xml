      <title>Hybrid Finite Element and Least Squares Support Vector Regression Method for solving Partial Differential Equations with Legendre Polynomial Kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A hybrid computational approach that integrates the finite element method (FEM) with least squares support vector regression (LSSVR) is introduced to solve partial differential equations. The method combines FEM's ability to provide the nodal solutions and LSSVR with higher-order Legendre polynomial kernels to deliver a closed-form analytical solution for interpolation between the nodes. The hybrid approach implements element-wise enhancement (super-resolution) of a given numerical solution, resulting in high resolution accuracy, while maintaining consistency with FEM nodal values at element boundaries. It can adapt any low-order FEM code to obtain high-order resolution by leveraging localized kernel refinement and parallel computation without additional implementation overhead. Therefore, effective inference/post-processing of the obtained super-resolved solution is possible. Evaluation results show that the hybrid FEM-LSSVR approach can achieve significantly higher accuracy compared to the base FEM solution. Comparable accuracy is a achieved when comparing the hybrid solution with a standalone FEM result with the same polynomial basis function order. The convergence studies were conducted for four elliptic boundary value problems to demonstrate the method's ability, accuracy, and reliability. Finally, the algorithm can be directly used as a plug-and-play method for super-resolving low-order numerical solvers and for super-resolution of expensive/under-resolved experimental data.</description>

      <title>A Mass Preserving Numerical Scheme for Kinetic Equations that Model Social Phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, kinetic equations have been used to model many social phenomena. A key feature of these models is that transition rate kernels involve Dirac delta functions, which capture sudden, discontinuous state changes. Here, we study kinetic equations with transition rates of the form $$ T(x,y,u) = \delta_{\phi(x,y) - u}. $$ We establish the global existence and uniqueness of solutions for these systems and introduce a fully deterministic scheme, the \emph{Mass Preserving Collocation Method}, which enables efficient, high fidelity simulation of models with multiple subsystems. We validate the accuracy, efficiency, and consistency of the solver on models with up to five subsystems, and compare its performance against two state-of-the-art agent-based methods: Tau-leaping and hybrid methods. Our scheme resolves subsystem distributions captured by these stochastic approaches while preserving mass numerically, requiring significantly less computational time and resources, and avoiding variability and hyperparameter tuning characteristic of these methods.</description>

      <title>Efficient Boys function evaluation using minimax approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an algorithm for efficient evaluation of Boys functions $F_0,\dots,F_{k_\mathrm{max}}$ tailored to modern computing architectures, in particular graphical processing units (GPUs), where maximum throughput is high and data movement is costly. The method combines rational minimax approximations with upward and downward recurrence relations. The non-negative real axis is partitioned into three regions, $[0,\infty\rangle = A\cup B\cup C$, where regions $A$ and $B$ are treated using rational minimax approximations and region $C$ by an asymptotic approximation. This formulation avoids lookup tables and irregular memory access, making it well suited hardware with high maximum throughput and low latency. The rational minimax coefficients are generated using the rational Remez algorithm. For a target maximum absolute error of $\varepsilon_\mathrm{tol} = 5\cdot10^{-14}$, the corresponding approximation regions and coefficients for Boys functions $F_0,\dots,F_{32}$ are provided in the appendix.</description>

      <title>Metric-driven numerical methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the concept of metric-driven numerical methods as a powerful tool for solving various types of multiscale partial differential equations. Our focus is on computing constrained minimizers of functionals - or, equivalently, by considering the associated Euler-Lagrange equations - the solution of a class of eigenvalue problems that may involve nonlinearities in the eigenfunctions. We introduce metric-driven methods for such problems via Riemannian gradient techniques, leveraging the idea that gradients can be represented in different metrics (so-called Sobolev gradients) to accelerate convergence. We show that the choice of metric not only leads to specific metric-driven iterative schemes, but also induces approximation spaces with enhanced properties, particularly in low-regularity regimes or when the solution exhibits heterogeneous multiscale features. In fact, we recover a well-known class of multiscale spaces based on the Localized Orthogonal Decomposition (LOD), now derived from a new perspective. Alongside a discussion of the metric-driven approach for a model problem, we also demonstrate its application to simulating the ground states of spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensates.</description>

      <title>Numerical approximation of the first $p$-Laplace eigenpair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We approximate the first Dirichlet eigenpair of the $p$-Laplace operator for $2 \leq p &lt; \infty$ on both Euclidean and surface domains. We emphasize large $p$ values and discuss how the $p \to \infty$ limit connects to the underlying geometry of our domain. Working with large $p$ values introduces significant numerical challenges. We present a surface finite element numerical scheme that combines a Newton inverse-power iteration with a new domain rescaling strategy, which enables stable computations for large $p$. Numerical experiments in $1$D, planar domains, and surfaces embedded in $\mathbb{R}^3$ demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of our approach and show convergence towards the $p \to \infty$ limiting behavior.</description>

      <title>A robust fully-mixed finite element method with skew-symmetry penalization for low-frequency poroelasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present and analyze a fully-mixed finite element scheme for the dynamic poroelasticity problem in the low-frequency regime. We write the problem as a four-field, first-order, hyperbolic system of equations where the symmetry constraint on the stress field is imposed via penalization. This strategy is equivalent to adding a perturbation to the saddle point system arising when the stress symmetry is weakly-imposed. The coupling of solid and fluid phases is discretized by means of stable mixed elements in space and implicit time advancing schemes. The presented stability analysis is fully robust with respect to meaningful cases of degenerate model parameters. Numerical tests validate the convergence and robustness and assess the performances of the method for the simulation of wave propagation phenomena in porous materials.</description>

      <title>Variational-hemivariational inequalities: A brief survey on mathematical theory and numerical analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational-hemivariational inequalities are an area full of interesting and challenging mathematical problems. The area can be viewed as a natural extension of that of variational inequalities. Variational-hemivariational inequalities are valuable for application problems from physical sciences and engineering that involve non-smooth and even set-valued relations, monotone or non-monotone, among physical quantities. In the recent years, there has been substantial growth of research interest in modeling, well-posedness analysis, development of numerical methods and numerical algorithms of variational-hemivariational inequalities. This survey paper is devoted to a brief account of well-posedness and numerical analysis results for variational-hemivariational inequalities. The theoretical results are presented for a family of abstract stationary variational-hemivariational inequalities and the main idea is explained for an accessible proof of existence and uniqueness. To better appreciate the distinguished feature of variational-hemivariational inequalities, for comparison, three mechanical problems are introduced leading to a variational equation, a variational inequality, and a variational-hemivariational inequality, respectively. The paper also comments on mixed variational-hemivariational inequalities, with examples from applications in fluid mechanics, and on results concerning the numerical solution of other types (nonstationary, history dependent) of variational-hemivariational inequalities.</description>

      <title>Convergence analysis of contrast source inversion type methods for acoustic inverse medium scattering problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The contrast source inversion (CSI) method and the subspace-based optimization method (SOM) are first proposed in 1997 and 2009, respectively, and subsequently modified. The two methods and their variants share several properties and thus are called the CSI-type methods. The CSI-type methods are efficient and popular methods for solving inverse medium scattering problems, but their rigorous convergence remains an open problem. In this paper, we propose two iteratively regularized CSI-type (IRCSI-type) methods with a novel $\ell_1$ proximal term as the iteratively regularized term: the iteratively regularized CSI (IRCSI) method and the iteratively regularized SOM (IRSOM) method, which have a similar computation complexity to the original CSI and SOM methods, respectively, and prove their global convergence under natural and weak conditions on the original objective function. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first convergence result for iterative methods of solving nonlinear inverse scattering problems with a fixed frequency. The convergence and performance of the two IRCSI-type algorithms are illustrated by numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Matrix approach to the fractional calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the new construction of fractional derivatives and integrals with respect to a function, based on a matrix approach. We believe that this is a powerful tool in both analytical and numerical calculations. We begin with the differential operator with respect to a function that generates a semigroup. By discretizing this operator, we obtain a matrix approximation. Importantly, this discretization provides not only an approximating operator but also an approximating semigroup. This point motivates our approach, as we then apply Balakrishnan's representations of fractional powers of operators, which are based on semigroups. Using estimates of the semigroup norm and the norm of the difference between the operator and its matrix approximation, we derive the convergence rate for the approximation of the fractional power of operators with the fractional power of correspondings matrix operators. In addition, an explicit formula for calculating an arbitrary power of a two-band matrix is obtained, which is indispensable in the numerical solution of fractional differential and integral equations.</description>

      <title>Second order reduced model via incremental projection for Navier Stokes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The numerical simulation of incompressible flows is challenging due to the tight coupling of velocity and pressure. Projection methods offer an effective solution by decoupling these variables, making them suitable for large-scale computations. This work focuses on reduced-order modeling using incremental projection schemes for the Stokes equations. We present both semi-discrete and fully discrete formulations, employing BDF2 in time and finite elements in space. A proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) approach is adopted to construct a reduced-order model for the Stokes problem. The method enables explicit computation of reduced velocity and pressure while preserving accuracy. We provide a detailed stability analysis and derive error estimates, showing second-order convergence in time. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate the theoretical results and demonstrate computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Analysis of discrete energy-decay preserving schemes for Maxwell's equations in Cole-Cole dispersive medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the design and analysis of energy-decay preserving numerical schemes for Maxwell's equations in a Cole-Cole (C-C) dispersive medium. A continuous energy-decay law is first established for the C-C model through a modified energy functional. Subsequently, a novel \(\theta\)-scheme is proposed for temporal discretization, which is rigorously proven to preserve a discrete energy dissipation property under the condition \(\theta \in [\frac{\alpha}{2}, \frac{1}{2}]\). The temporal convergence rate of the scheme is shown to be first-order for \(\theta \neq 0.5\) and second-order for \(\theta = 0.5\). Extensive numerical experiments validate the theoretical findings, including convergence tests and energy-decay comparisons. The proposed SFTR-\(\theta\) scheme demonstrates superior performance in maintaining monotonic energy decay compared to an alternative 2nd-order fractional backward difference formula, particularly in long-time simulations, highlighting its robustness and physical fidelity.</description>

      <title>Dynamically consistent finite volume scheme for a bimonomeric simplified model with inflammation processes for Alzheimer's disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A model of progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) incorporating the interactions of A$\beta$-monomers, oligomers, microglial cells and interleukins with neurons is considered. The resulting convection-diffusion-reaction system consists of four partial differential equations (PDEs) and one ordinary differential equation (ODE). We develop a finite volume (FV) scheme for this system, together with non-negativity and a priori bounds for the discrete solution, so that we establish the existence of a discrete solution to the FV scheme. It is shown that the scheme converges to an admissible weak solution of the model. The reaction terms of the system are discretized using a semi-implicit strategy that coincides with a nonstandard discretization of the spatially homogeneous (SH) model. This construction enables us to prove that the FV scheme is dynamically consistent with respect to the spatially homogeneous version of the model. Finally, numerical experiments are presented to illustrate the model and to assess the behavior of the FV scheme.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a mathematical model that combines elastic, viscous and porous effects with growth or shrinkage due to microstructural changes. This phenomenon is important in tissue or tumor growth, as well as in dermal contraction. Although existence results of the solution to the problem are not given, the current study assesses stability of the equilibria for both the continuous and semi-discrete versions of the model. Furthermore, a numerical condition for monotonicity of the numerical solution is described, as well as a way to stabilize the numerical solution so that spurious oscillations are avoided. The derived stabilization result is confirmed by computer simulations. In order to have a more quantitative picture, the total variation has been evaluated as a function of the stabilization parameter.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Learning of Microvascular Flow Models using Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The simulation of microcirculatory blood flow in realistic vascular architectures poses significant challenges due to the multiscale nature of the problem and the topological complexity of capillary networks. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning-based reduced-order modeling strategy, leveraging Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) trained on synthetic microvascular graphs to approximate hemodynamic quantities on anatomically realistic domains. Our method combines algorithms for synthetic vascular generation with a physics-informed training procedure that integrates graph topological information and local flow dynamics. To ensure the physical reliability of the learned surrogates, we incorporate a physics-informed loss functional derived from the governing equations, allowing enforcement of mass conservation and rheological constraints. The resulting GNN architecture demonstrates robust generalization capabilities across diverse network configurations. The GNN formulation is validated on benchmark problems with linear and nonlinear rheology, showing accurate pressure and velocity field reconstruction with substantial computational gains over full-order solvers. The methodology showcases significant generalization capabilities with respect to vascular complexity, as highlighted by tests on data from the mouse cerebral cortex. This work establishes a new class of graph-based surrogate models for microvascular flow, grounded in physical laws and equipped with inductive biases that mirror mass conservation and rheological models, opening new directions for real-time inference in vascular modeling and biomedical applications.</description>

      <title>Error Analysis of Generalized Langevin Equations with Approximated Memory Kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze prediction error in stochastic dynamical systems with memory, focusing on generalized Langevin equations (GLEs) formulated as stochastic Volterra equations. We establish that, under a strongly convex potential, trajectory discrepancies decay at a rate determined by the decay of the memory kernel and are quantitatively bounded by the estimation error of the kernel in a weighted norm. Our analysis integrates synchronized noise coupling with a Volterra comparison theorem, encompassing both subexponential and exponential kernel classes. For first-order models, we derive moment and perturbation bounds using resolvent estimates in weighted spaces. For second-order models with confining potentials, we prove contraction and stability under kernel perturbations using a hypocoercive Lyapunov-type distance. This framework accommodates non-translation-invariant kernels and white-noise forcing, explicitly linking improved kernel estimation to enhanced trajectory prediction. Numerical examples validate these theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>The Radon Transform-Based Sampling Methods for Biharmonic Sources from the Scattered Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents three quantitative sampling methods for reconstructing extended sources of the biharmonic wave equation using scattered field data. The first method employs an indicator function that solely relies on scattered fields $ u^s$ measured on a single circle, eliminating the need for Laplacian or derivative data. Its theoretical foundation lies in an explicit formula for the source function, which also serves as a constructive proof of uniqueness. To improve computational efficiency, we introduce a simplified double integral formula for the source function, at the cost of requiring additional measurements $\Delta u^s$. This advancement motivates the second indicator function, which outperforms the first method in both computational speed and reconstruction accuracy. The third indicator function is proposed to reconstruct the support boundary of extended sources from the scattered fields $ u^s$ at a finite number of sensors. By analyzing singularities induced by the source boundary, we establish the uniqueness of annulus and polygon-shaped sources. A key characteristic of the first and third indicator functions is their link between scattered fields and the Radon transform of the source function. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed sampling methods achieve high-resolution imaging of the source support or the source function itself.</description>

      <title>Indirect methods in optimal control on Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work focuses on indirect descent methods for optimal control problems governed by nonlinear ordinary differential equations in Banach spaces, viewed as abstract models of distributed dynamics. As a reference line, we revisit the classical schemes, rooted in Pontryagin's maximum principle, and highlight their sensitivity to local convexity and lack of monotone convergence. We then develop an alternative method based on exact cost-increment formulas and finite-difference probes of the terminal cost. We show that our method exhibits stable monotone convergence in numerical analysis of an Amari-type neural field control problem.</description>

      <title>Conjugate gradient for ill-posed problems: regularization by preconditioning, preconditioning by regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04695v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates using the conjugate gradient iterative solver for ill-posed problems. We show that preconditioner and Tikhonov-regularization work in conjunction. In particular when they employ the same symmetric positive semi-definite operator, a powerful Ritz analysis allows one to estimate at negligible computational cost the solution for any Tikhonov's weight. This enhanced linear solver is applied to the boundary data completion problem and as the inner solver for the optical flow estimator.</description>

      <title>Deep Operator BSDE: a Numerical Scheme to Approximate Solution Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by dynamic risk measures and conditional $g$-expectations, in this work we propose a numerical method to approximate the solution operator given by a Backward Stochastic Differential Equation (BSDE). The main ingredients for this are the Wiener chaos decomposition and the classical Euler scheme for BSDEs. We show convergence of this scheme under very mild assumptions, and provide a rate of convergence in more restrictive cases. We then implement it using neural networks, and we present several numerical examples where we can check the accuracy of the method.</description>

      <title>L\'{e}vy Score Function and Score-Based Particle Algorithm for Nonlinear L\'{e}vy--Fokker--Planck Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19520v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The score function for the diffusion process, also known as the gradient of the log-density, is a basic concept to characterize the probability flow with important applications in the score-based diffusion generative modelling and the simulation of It\^{o} stochastic differential equations. However, neither the probability flow nor the corresponding score function for the diffusion-jump process are known. This paper delivers mathematical derivation, numerical algorithm, and error analysis focusing on the corresponding score function in non-Gaussian systems with jumps and discontinuities represented by the nonlinear L\'{e}vy--Fokker--Planck equations. We propose the L\'{e}vy score function for such stochastic equations, which features a nonlocal double-integral term, and we develop its training algorithm by minimizing the proposed loss function from samples. Based on the equivalence of the probability flow with deterministic dynamics, we develop a self-consistent score-based transport particle algorithm to sample the interactive L\'{e}vy stochastic process at discrete time grid points. We provide error bound for the Kullback--Leibler divergence between the numerical and true probability density functions by overcoming the nonlocal challenges in the L\'{e}vy score. The full error analysis with the Monte Carlo error and the time discretization error is furthermore established. To show the usefulness and efficiency of our approach, numerical examples from applications in biology and finance are tested.</description>

      <title>Local Convergence Behavior of Extended LOBPCG for Computing Eigenvalues of Hermitian Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08218v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper provides a comprehensive and detailed analysis of the local convergence behavior of an extended variation of the locally optimal preconditioned conjugate gradient method (LOBPCG) for computing the extreme eigenvalue of a Hermitian matrix. The convergence rates derived in this work are either obtained for the first time or sharper than those previously established, including those in Ovtchinnikov's work ({\em SIAM J. Numer. Anal.}, 46(5):2567--2592, 2008). The study also extends to generalized problems, including Hermitian matrix polynomials that admit an extended form of the Rayleigh quotient. The new approach used to obtain these rates may also serve as a valuable tool for the convergence analysis of other gradient-type optimization methods.</description>

      <title>A linear MARS method for three-dimensional interface tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07524v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For explicit interface tracking in three dimensions, we propose a linear MARS method that (a) represents the interface by a partially ordered set of glued surfaces and approximates each glued surface with a triangular mesh, (b) maintains an $(r,h,\theta)$-regularity on each triangular mesh so that the distance between any pair of adjacent markers is within the range $[rh,h]$ and no angle in any triangle is less than $\theta$, (c) applies to three-dimensional continua with arbitrarily complex topology and geometry, (d) preserves topological structures and geometric features of moving phases under diffeomorphic and isometric flow maps, and (e) achieves second-order and third-order accuracy in terms of the Lagrangian and Eulerian length scales, respectively. Results of classic benchmark tests verify the effectiveness of the novel mesh adjustment algorithms in enforcing the $(r,h,\theta)$-regularity and demonstrate the high accuracy and efficiency of the proposed linear MARS method.</description>
