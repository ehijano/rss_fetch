      <title>A dynamical proof of Matui's absorption theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a dynamical, relatively elementary proof of an "absorption theorem" which is closely related to a well-known result due to Matui. The construction is in the spirit of an earlier joint work of the author and S. Robert. In an appendix we explain how to use this result to correct the dynamical proof given by Melleray--Robert of a classification theorem for orbit equivalence of minimal ample groups due to Giordano, Putnam and Skau (the original argument had a gap).</description>

      <title>Dimension of diagonal self-affine measures with exponentially separated projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $ \mu $ be a self-affine measure associated with a diagonal affine iterated function system (IFS) $ \Phi = \{ (x_{1}, \ldots, x_{d}) \mapsto ( r_{i, 1}x_{1} + t_{i,1}, \ldots, r_{i,d}x_{d} + t_{i,d}) \}_{i\in\Lambda} $ on $ \mathbb{R}^{d} $ and a probability vector $ p = (p_{i})_{i\in\Lambda}$. For $ 1 \leq j \leq d $, denote the $ j $-th the Lyapunov exponent by $ \chi_{j} := \sum_{i\in\Lambda} - p_{i} \log | r_{i,j} |$, and define the IFS induced by $ \Phi $ on the $j$-th coordinate as $ \Phi_{j} := \{ x \mapsto r_{i,j}x + t_{i,j}\}_{i\in\Lambda}$. We prove that if $ \chi_{j_{1}} \neq \chi_{j_{2}} $ for $ 1 \leq j_{1} &lt; j_{2} \leq d $, and $ \Phi_{j}$ is exponentially separated for $ 1 \leq j \leq d $, then the dimension of $ \mu $ is the minimum of $ d $ and its Lyapunov dimension. This confirms a conjecture of Rapaport by removing the additional assumption that the linear parts of the maps in $ \Phi $ are contained in a 1-dimensional subgroup. One of the main ingredients of the proof involves disintegrating $ \mu $ into random measures with convolution structure. In the course of the proof, we establish new results on dimension and entropy increase for these random measures.</description>

      <title>Exact new mobility edges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobility edges (ME), defined as critical energies that separate the extended states from the localized states, are a significant topic in quantum physics. In this paper, we demonstrate the existence of two exact new mobility edges for two physically realistic models: the first, referred to as Type II ME, represents the critical energy that separates the critical states from localized states; the second, referred to as Type III ME, marks the critical energy that separate the critical states from extended states. The proof is based on spectral analysis of singular Jacobi operator on the strip.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalise Hochman's theorem on the dimension of self-similar measures to contracting on average measures and show that a weaker condition than exponential separation on all scales is sufficient. Our proof uses a technique we call the variance summation method, avoiding the use of inverse theorems for entropy.</description>

      <title>Even the vague specification property implies density of ergodic measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that if a topological dynamical system $(X,T)$ is surjective and has the vague specification property, then its ergodic measures are dense in the space of all invariant measures. The vague specification property generalises Bowen's classical specification property and encompasses the majority of the extensions of the specification property introduced so far.
  The proof proceeds by first considering the natural extension $X_T$ of $(X,T)$ as a subsystem of the shift action on the space $X^\mathbb{Z}$ of $X$-valued biinfinite sequences. We then construct a sequence of subsystems of $X^\mathbb{Z}$ that approximate $X_T$ in the Hausdorff metric induced by a metric compatible with the product topology on $X^\mathbb{Z}$. The approximating subsystems consist of $\delta$-chains for $\delta$ decreasing to $0$. We show that chain mixing implies that each approximating system possesses the classical periodic specification property. Furthermore, we use vague specification to prove that our approximating subsystems of $X^\mathbb{Z}$ converge to $X_T$ in the Hausdorff metric induced the Besicovitch pseudometric. It follows that the simplices of invariant measures of these subsystems of $\delta$-chains converge to the simplex of invariant measures of $X_T$ with respect to a generalised version of Ornstein's $\bar{d}$ metric. What is more, the density of ergodic measures is preserved in the limit. The proof concludes by observing that the simplices of invariant measures for $X_T$ and $(X,T)$ coincide.
  The approximation technique developed in this paper appears to be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity Analysis of SEIR SEI Model of Dengue Disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dengue is a vector borne infectious disease. The disease is transmitted byAedes mosquitoes. In the present work, SEIR - SEI compartmental epidemiological model is used to describe dengue disease transmission dynamics. The human population is classified into four epidemiological states: Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious and Recovered humans. The mosquito population is divided into three epidemiological states: Susceptible, Exposed and Infectious mosquitoes. Associated basic reproduction number which determines whether the disease will persist or die out, is calculated by Next Generation method. Stability of the equilibrium points of the model is analyzed in terms of basic reproduction number. Sensitivity analysis is carried out to study importance of modelparameters.</description>

      <title>An SIRS-model considering waning efficiency and periodic re-vaccination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the classical SIRS (Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered-Susceptible) model from mathematical epidemiology by incorporating a vaccinated compartment, V, accounting for an imperfect vaccine with waning efficacy over time. The SIRSV-model divides the population into four compartments and introduces periodic re-vaccination for waning immunity. The efficiency of the vaccine is assumed to decay with the time passed since the vaccination. Periodic re-vaccinations are applied to the population. We develop a partial differential equation (PDE) model for the continuous vaccination time and a coupled ordinary differential equation (ODE) system when discretizing the vaccination period. We analyze the equilibria of the ODE model and investigate the linear stability of the disease-free equilibrium (DFE). Furthermore, we explore an optimization framework where vaccination rate, re-vaccination time, and non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are control variables to minimize infection levels. The optimization objective is defined using different norm-based measures of infected individuals. A numerical analysis of the model's dynamic behavior under varying control parameters is conducted using path-following methods. The analysis focuses on the impacts of vaccination strategies and contact limitation measures. Bifurcation analysis reveals complex behaviors, including bistability, fold bifurcations, forward and backward bifurcations, highlighting the need for combined vaccination and contact control strategies to manage disease spread effectively.</description>

      <title>Infinite-dimensional Lagrange-Dirac systems with boundary energy flow I: Foundations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new geometric approach to systems with boundary energy flow is developed using infinite-dimensional Dirac structures within the Lagrangian formalism. This framework satisfies a list of consistency criteria with the geometric setting of finite-dimensional mechanics. In particular, the infinite-dimensional Dirac structure can be constructed from the canonical symplectic form on the system's phase space; the system's evolution equations can be derived equivalently from either a variational perspective or a Dirac structure perspective; the variational principle employed is a direct extension of Hamilton's principle in classical mechanics; and the approach allows for a process of system interconnection within its formulation. This is achieved by developing an appropriate infinite dimensional version of the previously developed Lagrange-Dirac systems. A key step in this construction is the careful choice of a suitable dual space to the configuration space, specifically, a subspace of the topological dual that captures the system's behavior in both the interior and the boundary, while allowing for a natural extension of the canonical geometric structures of mechanics. This paper focuses on systems where the configuration space consists of differential forms on a smooth manifold with a boundary. To illustrate our theory, several examples, including nonlinear wave equations, the telegraph equation, and the Maxwell equations are presented.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Neural Activation in Time-dependent Membrane Capacitance Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most models of neurons incorporate a capacitor to account for the marked capacitive behavior exhibited by the cell membrane. However, such capacitance is widely considered constant, thereby neglecting the possible effects of time-dependent membrane capacitance on neural excitability. This study presents a modified formulation of a neuron model with time-dependent membrane capacitance and shows that action potentials can be elicited for certain capacitance dynamics. Our main results can be summarized as: (a) it is necessary to have significant and abrupt variations in the capacitance to generate action potentials; (b) certain simple and explicitly constructed capacitance profiles with strong variations do generate action potentials; (c) forcing abrupt changes in the capacitance too frequently may result in no action potentials. These findings can have great implications for the design of ultrasound-based or other neuromodulation strategies acting through transiently altering the membrane capacitance of neurons.</description>

      <title>PIETOOLS 2024: User Manual</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The PIETOOLS 2024 User Manual describes all the features of version 2024 of the MATLAB toolbox PIETOOLS for the analysis and control of Partial Integral Equations (PIEs). The manual is aimed to guide, with examples, first-time users to four fundamental features of PIETOOLS: converting coupled ODE-PDEs, DDEs, DDFs, etc., to PIE representation; analysis of stability and input-output properties of PIEs; design of optimal observers and controllers for PIEs; simulation of open- and closed-loop PIE systems. The use of PIETOOLS is not limited to the features described above. However, the manual focuses on these features to provide a holistic understanding of the workflow of PIETOOLS, which will serve as a foundation to develop more complicated programs, for example, the design of boundary feedback controllers, robust observers, robust controllers, etc..</description>

      <title>Tori Approximation of Families of Diagonally Invariant Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.00721v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We approximate any portion of any orbit of the full diagonal group $A$ in the space of unimodular lattices in $\RR^n$ using a fixed proportion of a compact $A$-orbit. Using those approximations for the appropriate sequence of orbits, we prove the existence of non-ergodic measures which are also weak limits of compactly supported $A$-invariant measures. In fact, given any countably many $A$-invariant ergodic measures, our methods show that there exists a sequence of compactly supported periodic $A$-invariant measures such that the ergodic decomposition of its weak limit has these measures as factors with positive weight. Using the same methods, we prove that any compactly supported $A$-invariant and ergodic measure is the weak limit of the restriction of different compactly supported periodic measures to a fixed proportion of the time. In addition, for any $c\in (0,1]$ we find a sequence of compactly supported periodic $A$-invariant measures that converge weakly to $cm_{X_n}$ where $m_{X_n}$ denotes the Haar measure on $X_n$. In particular, we prove the existence of partial escape of mass for compact $A$-orbits. These results give affirmative answers to questions posed by Shapira in ~\cite{ShapiraEscape}. Our proofs are based on a modification of Shapira's proof in ~\cite{ShapiraEscape} and on a generalization of a construction of Cassels, as well as on effective equidistribution estimates of Hecke neighbors by Clozel, Oh and Ullmo, and a number theoretic construction of a special number field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.08280v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The concept of hypocoercivity for linear evolution equations with dissipation is discussed and equivalent characterizations that were developed for the finite-dimensional case are extended to separable Hilbert spaces. Using the concept of a hypocoercivity index, quantitative estimates on the short-time and long-time decay behavior of a hypocoercive system are derived. As a useful tool for analyzing the structural properties, an infinite-dimensional staircase form is also derived and connections to linear systems and control theory are presented. Several examples illustrate the new concepts and the results are applied to the Lorentz kinetic equation.</description>

      <title>On Gibbs measures for almost additive sequences associated to some relative pressure functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a weakly almost additive sequence of continuous functions with bounded variation $\mathcal{F}=\{\log f_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ on a subshift $X$ over finitely many symbols, we study properties of a function $f$ on $X$ such that $\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{n}\int \log f_n d\mu=\int f d\mu$ for every invariant measure $\mu$ on $X$. Under some conditions we construct a function $f$ on $X$ explicitly and study a relation between the property of $\mathcal{F}$ and some particular types of $f$. As applications we study images of Gibbs measures for continuous functions under one-block factor maps. We investigate a relation between the almost additivity of the sequences associated to relative pressure functions and the fiber-wise sub-positive mixing property of a factor map. For a special type of one-block factor maps between shifts of finite type, we study necessary and sufficient conditions for the image of a one-step Markov measure to be a Gibbs measure for a continuous function.</description>

      <title>Efficient pseudometrics for data-driven comparisons of nonlinear dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18681v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computationally efficient solutions for pseudometrics quantifying deviation from topological conjugacy between dynamical systems are presented. Deviation from conjugacy is quantified in a Pareto optimal sense that accounts for spectral properties of Koopman operators as well as trajectory geometry. Theoretical justification is provided for computing such pseudometrics in Koopman eigenfunction space rather than observable space. Furthermore, it is shown that theoretical consistency with topological conjugacy can be maintained when restricting the search for optimal transformations between systems to the unitary group. Therefore the pseudometrics are based on analytical solutions for unitary transformations in Koopman eigenfunction space. Geometric considerations for the deviation from conjugacy Pareto optimality problem are used to develop scalar pseudometrics that account for all possible optimal solutions given just two Pareto points. The approach is demonstrated on two example problems; the first being a simple benchmarking problem and the second an engineering example comparing the dynamics of morphological computation of biological nonlinear muscle actuators to simplified man-made (including bioinspired) approaches. The benefits of considering operator and trajectory geometry based dissimilarity measures in a unified and consistent formalism is demonstrated. Overall, the deviation from conjugacy pseudometrics provide practical advantages in terms of efficiency and scalability, while maintaining theoretical consistency.</description>

      <title>Rigidity in a Fixed Number Field and a Directional $p$-Adic Littlewood Conjecture for Algebraic Vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X_n$ be the space of unimodular lattices in $\RR^n$ and let $A$ be the full diagonal group in $\on{SL}_n(\RR)$. It is known that compact $A$-orbits originate from moduls in totally real degree $n$ number fields. Our first result shows that for a natural family of compact orbits $(Ax_k)_k$ all originating from a fixed number field $K$, every weak limit of the Haar measures on those orbits $m_{Ax_k}$ must contain the Haar measure $m_{X_n}$ as an ergodic component. This result generalizes certain aspects of the work by Aka and Shapira in \cite{Shapira-Aka} to arbitrary dimensions, as well as elements from Shapira-Zheng in \cite{shapira2021translates}.
  For every vector $\overline \alpha\in \RR^n$ and for every rational approximation $(\overline p,q)\in \RR^n\times\RR$ we can associate the displacement vector $q\alpha-\overline p$. We focus on algebraic vectors, namely $\overline \alpha=(\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_n)$ such that $1, \alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_n$ span a rank $n$ number field. For these vectors, we investigate the size of their displacements as well as the distribution of their directions. We establish that algebraic vector $\overline \alpha$ satisfy the $p$-adic Littlewood Conjecture. Namely, we prove that \begin{equation}
  \liminf_{k \to \infty} \left( k \|k\|_p \right)^{1/n} \| k (\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_n) \|_\infty = 0. \end{equation} Additionally, we classify all limiting distributions, with a special weighting, of the sequence of directions of the defects in the $\varepsilon$-approximations of $(\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_n)$. Each such limiting measure is expressed as the pushforward of an algebraic measure on $X_n$ to the sphere.
  Our proof relies on estimates of the asymptotic orders of units in fixed number fields modulo families of natural numbers and on rigidity results from \cite{ELMV1}.</description>

      <title>New algebras of functions on topological groups arising from G-spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0608575</link>
      <description>arXiv:math/0608575v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a topological group G we introduce the algebra SUC(G) of strongly uniformly continuous functions. It contains the algebra WAP(G) of weakly almost periodic functions as well as the algebras LE(G) and Asp(G) of locally equicontinuous and Asplund functions respectively. For the Polish groups of order preserving homeomorphisms of the unit interval and of isometries of the Urysohn space of diameter 1, SUC(G) is trivial. We study the Roelcke algebra (= UC(G) = right and left uniformly continuous functions) and SUC compactifications of the groups S(N), of permutations of a countable set, and H(C), the group of homeomorphisms of the Cantor set. For the first group we show that WAP(G)=SUC(G)=UC(G) and also provide a concrete description of the corresponding metrizable (in fact Cantor) semitopological semigroup compactification. For the second group, in contrast, we show that SUC(G) is properly contained in UC(G) and for this group UC(G) does not yield a right topological semigroup compactification. We introduce the notion of fixed point on a class P of flows (P-fpp) and study in particular groups which are SUC-amenable and groups with the SUC-fpp (SUC-extreme amenability). We show that every Polish group G with metrizable M(G) is SUC-amenable and if, in addition, M(G) is proximal, then G is SUC-extremely amenable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.10510v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the key formula which intertwines multiplicative Markoff-Lagrange spectrum and symbolic dynamics. The proof uses complex analysis and elucidates the strategy of the problem. Moreover, the new method applies to a wide variety of polynomials possibly having multiple roots. We derive several consequences of this formula, which are expected on the Markoff-Lagrange spectrum.</description>

      <title>Transcendence and normality of complex numbers via Hurwitz continued fractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20029v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the topological, dynamical, and descriptive set theoretic properties of Hurwitz continued fractions. Hurwitz continued fractions associate an infinite sequence of Gaussian integers to every complex number which is not a Gaussian rational. The resulting space of sequences of Gaussian integers $\Omega$ is not closed. By means of an algorithm, we show that $\Omega$ contains a natural subset whose closure $\overline{\mathsf{R}}$ encodes continued fraction expansions of complex numbers which are not Gaussian rationals. We prove that $(\overline{\mathsf{R}}, \sigma)$ is a subshift with a feeble specification property. As an application, we determine the rank in the Borel hierarchy of the set of Hurwitz normal numbers with respect to the complex Gauss measure. We also construct a family of complex transcendental numbers with bounded partial quotients.</description>

      <title>Weyl groups of groupoid C*-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04906v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the theory of C*-algebras, the Weyl groups were defined for the Cuntz algebras and graph algebras by Cuntz and Conti et al. respectively. In this paper, we introduce and investigate the Weyl groups of groupoid C*-algebras as a natural generalization of the existing Weyl groups. Then we analyse several groups of automorphisms on groupoid C*-algebras. Finally, we apply our results to Cuntz algebras, graph algebras and C*-algebras associated with Deaconu-Renault systems.</description>
