      <title>Real-time dynamics with bead-Fourier path integrals I: Bead-Fourier CMD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing new methods for the accurate and efficient calculations of real-time quantum correlation functions is deemed one of the most challenging problems of modern condensed matter theory. Many popular methods, such as centroid molecular dynamics (CMD), make use of Feynman path integrals (PIs) to efficiently introduce nuclear quantum effects into classical dynamical simulations. Conventional CMD methods use the discretized form of the PI formalism to represent a quantum particle using a series of replicas, or "beads", connected with harmonic springs to create an imaginary time ring polymer. The alternative Fourier PI methodology, instead, represents the imaginary time path using a Fourier sine series. Presented as an intermediary between the two formalisms, bead-Fourier PIs (BF-PIs) have been shown to reduce the number of beads needed to converge equilibrium properties by including a few terms of the Fourier series. Here, a new CMD method is presented where the effective potential is calculated using BF-PIs as opposed to the typical discretized PIs. We demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of this new BF-CMD method for a series of 1D model systems and show that at low temperatures, one can achieve a 4-fold reduction in the number of beads with the addition of a single Fourier component. The developed methodology is general and can be extended to other closely related methods, such as ring polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD), as well as non-adiabatic PI methods.</description>

      <title>A new scale anomaly in Dirac matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of Dirac semimetals is modeled at low energies by the massless Dirac Hamiltonian with the Fermi velocity replacing the velocity of light. The classical action is scale invariant. In 3D materials, Coulomb interactions induce a conformal anomaly associated to the charge renormalization already known in quantum field theory. In this work, we describe a new conformal anomaly induced by the running of the Fermi velocity that applies to Dirac semimetals in two and three dimensions. The case of graphene is particularly interesting. We analyze the anomaly and explore its thermodynamic and hydrodynamic consequences. The anomaly modifies the propagation speed of hydrodynamic sound waves, alters the thermodynamic equation of state, and induces a non-vanishing bulk viscosity proportional to the beta function of the Fermi velocity.</description>

      <title>Reference lattice, sound, stiffness, and magnetic transitions of Ising monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A reference lattice, away from which elastic distortions induced by the spin texturing of 2D magnets take hold, is motivated from a picture of pairwise Biot-Savart interactions among identical solenoids that either elongate or compress a (``zero-current'') spring lattice. Applied to a paradigmatic CrSiTe$_3$ monolayer (ML), the reference is given by the average between the atomic positions of FM and N\'eel AFM lattices; such an atomic disposition permits understanding structural distortions and elastic energies due to magnetism readily. Furthermore, the anisotropic speed of sound in the magnetic ground state explains an observed anisotropy of vibrational frequencies on similar magnets. Elastic stiffness constants are reported, too. Magnetic energies in four Ising structural configurations were calculated, and the strain needed for those 2D magnets to undergo an AFM to FM quantum phase transition was determined as well.</description>

      <title>Human-machine collaboration: ordering mechanism of rank-2 spin liquid on breathing pyrochlore lattice</title>

Abstract: Machine learning algorithms thrive on large data sets of good quality. Here we show that they can also excel in a typical research setting with little data of limited quality, through an interplay of insights coming from machine, and human researchers. The question we address is the unsolved problem of ordering out of a spin-liquid phase described by an emergent rank-2 U(1) gauge theory, as described by [H. Yan et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 124, 127203 (2020)]. Published Monte Carlo simulations for this problem are consistent with a strong first-order phase transition, but were too noisy for the form of low-temperature order to be identified. Using a highly-interpretable machine learning approach based on a support vector machine with a tensorial kernel (TKSVM), we re-analyze this Monte Carlo data, gaining new information about the form of order that could in turn be interpreted by traditionally-trained physicists. We find that the low-temperature ordered phase is a form of magnetic order analogous to a smectic liquid crystal. This arises due to a subtle thermal order-by-disorder mechanism, that can be understood from the fluctuations of the tensor electric field of the parent rank-2 gauge theory. These results were obtained by a back-and-forth process which closely resembles a collaboration between human researchers and machines. We argue that this "collaborative" approach may provide a blueprint for solving other problems that have not yielded to human insights alone.</description>

      <title>Quantum Phase diagrams and transitions for Chern topological insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09770v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological invariants such as Chern classes are by now a standard way to classify topological phases. Introducing and varying parameters in such systems leads to phase diagrams, where the Chern classes may jump when crossing a critical locus. These systems appear naturally when considering slicing of higher dimensional systems or when considering systems with parameters. As the Chern classes are topological invariants, they can only change if the "topology breaks down". We give a precise mathematical formulation of this phenomenon and show that synthetically any phase diagram of Chern topological phases can be designed and realized by a physical system, using covering, aka. winding maps. Here we provide explicit families realizing arbitrary Chern jumps. The critical locus of these maps is described by the classical rose curves. These realize the lower bound on the number of Dirac points necessary obtained from viewing them as local charges. We treat several concrete models and show that they have the predicted generic behavior. In particular, we focus on different types of lattices and tight-binding models, and show that effective winding maps, and thus higher Chern numbers, can be achieved using k-th nearest neighbors. We give explicit formulas for a family of 2D lattices using imaginary quadratic field extensions and their norms. Our study includes the square, triangular, honeycomb and Kagome lattices.</description>
