      <title>Doubling down on down-type diquarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective field theory-based searches for new physics at colliders are relatively insensitive to interactions involving only right-handed down-type quarks. These interactions can hide amongst jet backgrounds at the LHC, and their indirect effects in electroweak and Higgs processes are small. Identifying scenarios in which these interactions dominate, we can naturally pick out just two tree-level mediators, both scalar diquarks. Over the full parameter space of these states, we analyse exotics searches at current and future hadron colliders, Higgs signal strength constraints, and indirect constraints from flavour physics, finding genuine complementarity between the data sets. In particular, while flavour constraints can exclude diquarks in the hundreds of TeV mass range, these can be evaded once a flavour structure is imposed on the couplings, as we illustrate by embedding the diquarks within a composite Higgs model. In combination, however, we show that flavour and collider constraints exclude down-type diquarks to multi-TeV scales, thus narrowing the remaining hiding places for new interactions amongst LHC data.</description>

      <title>Displaced vertex signals of low temperature baryogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the connection of baryogenesis at temperatures below the electroweak scale and signals for long-lived particles at the LHC. The model features new SM singlets, with a long-lived fermion decaying to quarks to generate the baryon asymmetry. The model avoids strong flavor physics bounds while predicting a rich diquark phenomenology, monojet signals, and displaced vertices. We show how the displaced vertex signals can be probed at the HL-LHC. The large transverse production makes a strong physics case for constructing far detector experiments such as MATHUSLA, ANUBIS, and CODEX-b, complementary to the central and forward long-lived particle program.</description>

      <title>Conformal Leptogenesis in Composite Higgs Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the generation of the baryon asymmetry in Composite Higgs models with partial compositeness of the Standard Model (SM) fermions and heavy right-handed neutrinos, developing for the first time a complete picture of leptogenesis in that setup. The asymmetry is induced by the out of equilibrium decays of the heavy right-handed neutrinos into a plasma of the nearly conformal field theory (CFT), i.e. the deconfined phase of the Composite Higgs dynamics. This exotic mechanism, which we call Conformal Leptogenesis, admits a reliable description in terms of a set of ``Boltzmann equations'' whose coefficients can be expressed in terms of correlation functions of the CFT. The asymmetry thus generated is subsequently affected by the supercooling resulting from the confining phase transition of the strong Higgs sector as well as by the washout induced by the resonances formed after the transition. Nevertheless, a qualitative description of the latter effects suggests that conformal leptogenesis can successfully reproduce the observed baryon asymmetry in a wide region of parameter space. A distinctive signature of our scenarios is a sizable compositeness for all the generations of SM neutrinos, which is currently consistent with all constraints but may be within reach of future colliders.</description>

      <title>Unravelling New Physics Signals at the HL-LHC with Low-Energy Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies suggest that global fits of Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs) might inadvertently 'fit away' signs of new physics in the high-energy tails of the distributions measured at the high luminosity programme of the LHC (HL-LHC). This could lead to spurious effects that might conceal key BSM signatures and hinder the success of indirect searches for new physics. In this letter, we demonstrate that future deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) measurements at the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC), and at CERN via FASER$\nu$ and SND@LHC at LHC Run III, and the future neutrino experiments to be hosted at the proposed Forward Physics Facility (FPF) at the HL-LHC, provide complementary constraints on large-$x$ sea quarks. These constraints are crucial to mitigate the risk of missing key BSM signals, by enabling precise constraints on large-$x$ PDFs through a 'BSM-safe' integration of both high- and low-energy data, which is essential for a robust interpretation of the high-energy measurements.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous breaking of baryon number, baryogenesis and the bajoron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the spontaneous breaking of global baryon number for baryogenesis. We introduce a model with three majorana fermions and a complex scalar carrying baryon number charge. After symmetry breaking, the baryon asymmetry is generated below the electroweak scale via the decays of one of the majorana fermions. The main focus of the paper is the phenomenology of the Nambu--Goldstone boson of $U(1)_B$, which we call the bajoron. With small sources of explicit baryon number violation, the bajoron acquires a small mass and is generally very long-lived. The model avoids proton decay, satisfies cosmological constraints, and offers interesting collider phenomenology for the Large Hadron Collider. These long-lived particles tied to baryogenesis strongly support the development of far-detector experiments such as MATHUSLA, FASER, SHiP, and others.</description>

      <title>Non-conservation of Lepton Numbers in the Neutrino Sector Could Change the Prospects for Core Collapse Supernova Explosions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that strong interactions violating the conservation of lepton numbers in the neutrino sector could significantly alter the standard low entropy picture for the pre-supernova collapsing core of a massive star. A rapid neutrino-antineutrino equilibration leads to entropy generation and enhanced electron capture and, hence, a lower electron fraction than in the standard model. This would affect the downstream core evolution, the prospects for a supernova explosion, and the emergent neutrino signal. If realized by lepton-number-violating neutrino self-interactions (LNV $\nu$SI), the relevant mediator mass and coupling ranges can be probed by future accelerator-based experiments.</description>

      <title>Measuring Solar neutrino Fluxes in Direct Detection Experiments in the Presence of Light Mediators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The potential of the dark matter direct detection experiments to provide independent measurements on solar neutrino fluxes in the Standard Model and in the presence of the light mediators is studied in this work. We also present the sensitivity of direct detection experiments on light mediators with solar neutrinos. We find that the sensitivities on $^8$B and pp neutrino fluxes can reach $\pm10\%$ with improved backgrounds and systematic uncertainties and they can be further pushed to $\pm3\%$ with a increased exposure. The constraints on light mediators can reach $\mathcal{O}(10^{-6})$ for the masses of scalar and vector mediators below 10 MeV. However, the presence of scalar or vector mediators could lead to shifts in the best fit value of $^8$B fluxes, which will increase the challenges in the precise measurements of solar neutrino fluxes with direct detection experiments.</description>

      <title>p--$\phi$ femtoscopic correlation analysis using a dynamical model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse the p--$\phi$ correlation functions in high-multiplicity proton+proton collisions at the LHC using a dynamical model, DCCI2, and discuss the effects of collision dynamics on the p--$\phi$ femtoscopic study. Collision dynamics, such as collective expansion and hadronic rescatterings, leads to the relative momentum-dependent non-Gaussian source functions. This results in deviations in the correlation functions compared to those using the Gaussian source function adopted in existing studies. Our analysis shows the importance of using the source functions that reflect more realistic collision dynamics for future precision analysis of hadron interactions via femtoscopy.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the $U(1)_{B-L}$ model from global QCD analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform the first global QCD analysis of electron-nucleon deep-inelastic scattering and related high-energy data including the beyond the Standard Model $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge boson, $Z'$. Contrary to the dark photon case, we find no improvement in the $\chi^2$ relative to the baseline result. The finding allows us to place exclusion limits on the coupling constant of the $Z'$ with mass in the range $M_{Z'} = 2$ GeV to 160 GeV.</description>

      <title>Higher-order soft-gluon corrections for $t{\bar t}Z$ cross sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate higher-order soft-gluon corrections for the associated production of a top-antitop quark pair and a $Z$ boson ($t{\bar t}Z$ production) in proton-proton collisions. We find that these corrections are numerically dominant and large. We present approximate NNLO (aNNLO) and approximate N$^3$LO (aN$^3$LO) cross sections that add, respectively, second-order and third-order soft-gluon corrections to the exact NLO QCD result. We also add electroweak (EW) corrections through NLO. We estimate uncertainties that arise from scale dependence, which are smaller at higher orders, and from parton distribution functions. We compare our aN$^3$LO QCD + NLO EW theoretical results to measurements of $t{\bar t}Z$ cross sections from the LHC and find good agreement. We also calculate single-particle-inclusive differential distributions in top-quark transverse momentum and rapidity.</description>

      <title>Prediction of the CP Phase $\delta_{CP}$ in the Neutrino Oscillation and an Axion-less Solution to the Strong CP Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A model of the axion-less solution to the strong CP problem has been recently constructed based on the $\bf T^2/\mathbb{Z}_3$ orbifold in the six dimensional space-time. We extend, in this paper, the model to include the lepton sector with three right-handed neutrinos. A crucial point in the extended model is that we have only one CP-violating phase and thus the CP phase in the neutrino oscillation can be predicted by the CP phase in the CKM matrix. The CP phase $\delta_{CP}$ in the PMNS matrix is predicted as $\delta_{CP}\simeq 195^\circ - 200^\circ$
  which can be tested in the near future experiments. We also discuss the effective mass $m_{\beta\beta}$ responsible for the neutrino-less double beta decay of nucleus, which is predicted as $m_{\beta\beta} \simeq 8-11$\,meV.</description>

Abstract: We update our analyses to constrain neutrino decoherence induced by wave-packet separation with RENO and Daya Bay data, now including the final data sets of the two experiments. We find that while the individual bounds from Daya Bay and RENO data improve relative to our original estimates, the combined fits are still dominated by KamLAND data and are only minimally improved.</description>

      <title>QCD field-strength correlators on a Polyakov loop with gradient flow at next-to-leading order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Momentum exchange between a heavy quark and a hot quark-gluon medium can be characterized nonperturbatively in terms of field-strength field-strength (E-E and B-B) correlators along a Polyakov loop. These can be studied on the lattice and analytically continued. However the lattice typically determines the correlators after the application of gradient flow. We investigate how gradient flow renormalizes these correlation functions by carrying out a next-to-leading order perturbative analysis of the correlators including gradient flow. This establishes a next-to-leading order renormalization matching between the correlators as measured on the lattice and the correlators relevant for momentum diffusion.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the weak semileptonic decay of the $ \Omega^{+}_{ccb} \rightarrow \Xi^{++}_{cc} ~{\ell}\bar\nu_{\ell}$, where a triply heavy baryon with spin 1/2 decays into the observed doubly heavy baryon with spin 1/2, using QCD sum rule method in all lepton channels. We compute the six relevant vector and axial vector form factors entering the low energy matrix elements in full theory. The invariant form factors are building blocks, using the fit faction of which in terms of $ q^2 $ in whole physical region, we calculate the exclusive widths in three lepton channels. Our predictions may help the present and future experiments in the course of their search for doubly and triply heavy baryons.</description>

      <title>Path integral treatment of coherence effects in charmonium production in nuclear ultra-peripheral collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present for the first time a revised study of charmonium production in nuclear ultra-peripheral collisions (UPC) based on a rigorous Green function formalism. This formalism allows for the proper incorporation of the effects of color transparency, as well as the quantum coherence inherent in the higher twist quark shadowing related to the $Q\bar Q$ Fock component of the photon. The significance of this effect gradually decreases towards forward and/or backward rapidities. In the LHC kinematic region we additionally incorporate within the same formalism the leading twist gluon shadowing corrections related to higher multi-gluon photon fluctuations. They represent a dominant source of nuclear phenomena in the mid-rapidity region. Model predictions for the rapidity distributions $d\sigma/dy$ are in good agreement with available UPC data on coherent charmonium production at RHIC and the LHC. They can also be verified by future measurements at the LHC, as well as at EIC.</description>

      <title>Possible signal of an exotic $I=1$, $J=2$ state in the $B \to D^{*-}D^+K^+$ reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01701</link>

Abstract: We study the \proc reaction, showing that a peak in the \dk mass distribution around 2834 MeV reported by LHCb could be associated with a theoretical exotic state with that mass, a width of 19 MeV and $J^P=2^+$, stemming from the interaction of the $D^{*+}K^{*+}$ and $D^{*+}_s \rho^+$ channels, which is a partner of the $0^+$ $T_{c\bar{s}}(2900)$. We show that the data is compatible with this assumption, but also see that the mass distribution itself cannot discriminate between the spins $J=0$, $1$, $2$ of the state. Then we evaluate the momenta of the angular mass distribution and show that they are very different for each of the spin assumptions, and that the momenta coming from interference terms have larger strength at the resonant energy than the peaks seen in the angular integrated mass distribution. We make a call for the experimental determination of these magnitudes, which has already been used by the LHCb in related decay reactions.</description>

      <title>Momentum dependent potentials from a parity doubling CMF model in UrQMD: Results on flow and particle production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum molecular dynamics (QMD) part of the UrQMD model is extended to allow implementation of momentum dependent potentials from a parity doubling chiral mean field (CMF) model. Important aspects like energy conservation and effects on particle production and flow are discussed. It is shown, that this new implementation reproduces qualitatively and quantitatively available data over a wide range of beam energies and improves the description of observables without exception. In particular the description of hyperon and pion production at SIS18 energies is improved. From a comparison with HADES data one could conclude that the present parametrization of the CMF model leads to a slightly too weak momentum dependence. However, a more firm conclusion will require a systematic comparison with flow and multiplicity data over a range of beam energies and system sizes. Our work serves as an important step towards such future studies where the properties of dense QCD matter, through parameters of the CMF model, can be constraint using a comparison of the UrQMD model with high precision heavy ion data, finally also allowing direct comparisons with neutron star and neutron star merger observables.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of charged spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particles in superposed states minimally coupled to electromagnetism in curved spacetime within the WKB approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the curved-spacetime dynamics of charged spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particles minimally coupled to the electromagnetic field and propagating in superposed states of different masses. For that purpose, we make use of a Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin approximation of the Dirac equation with a minimal coupling to the Maxwell field in curved spacetime. We obtain the spin dynamics as well as the deviation from geodesic motion of such particles. The problem of having the mass eigenstates experience different proper times, as opposed to the case of neutral particles, is here dealt with by first extracting the second-order differential equation obeyed by each superposition. This strategy proves to be not only powerful, but also very economical.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phonons in Bose-Einstein condensates propagate as massless scalar particles on top of an emergent acoustic metric. This hydrodynamics/gravity analogy can be exploited to realize acoustic black holes, featuring an event horizon that traps phonons. We show that by appropriately perturbing the background fluid, gravitational wave-like fluctuations of the acoustic metric can be produced. Such fluctuations can be used to excite an acoustic black hole, which should then relax by phonon emission.</description>

      <title>Tidal Love numbers of gravitational atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultralight bosonic fields can form condensates, or clouds, around spinning black holes. When this system is under the influence of a secondary massive body, its tidal response can be quantified in the tidal Love numbers (TLNs). Although TLNs vanish for black holes in vacuum, it has been shown that the same is not true for black holes immersed in matter environments. In this work, we compute the gravitational TLNs of black holes surrounded by scalar clouds, in the Newtonian limit. We show that they are non-vanishing, have a strong power-law dependence on the boson's mass, and are proportional to the scalar cloud's total mass. In particular, we find that, independently of the cloud's configuration, the TLNs from axisymmetric tides scale as $\propto r_c^{2l+1}$, for $r_c$ the cloud's "radius" and $l$ the multipole order of the external tidal field. This differs by a factor $r_c$ from previous estimates based on scalar and vector tidal perturbations but is in perfect agreement with the behavior of TLNs in other matter systems. Furthermore, we show that the adiabatic tides approximation we employ is, in general, not appropriate for non-axisymmetric tidal interactions.</description>

      <title>(In)stability of the Higgs vacuum from the $\textrm{O}(N)$ model at large $N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theory of an independent Higgs field is given by an $\textrm{O}(N)$ model with an $N$-component scalar $\vec{\phi}$ and a quartic $\lambda(\vec{\phi}\cdot\vec{\phi})^2$ potential when $N=4$. The phase structure of the theory can be studied analytically for all values of the coupling $\lambda$ using the large-$N$ limit, both at zero and finite temperature. However, authors in the 70s and 80s argued the theory at large $N$ was "sick" and "futile", and dismissed the theory. This was based on two points: (1) a failure to identify the stable phases and vacuum of the theory and (2) the issue of a negative bare coupling $\lambda&lt;0$ in the UV. We provide evidence that the theory is not, in fact, "sick". Issue (2) is dealt with through the modern understanding of $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$-symmetric non-Hermitian theories with "wrong-sign" couplings. Issue (1) is resolved by realizing that the true vacuum has no spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) and that the SSB phase only becomes preferred at high temperatures.</description>

      <title>Natural Anomaly Matching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a large class of chiral gauge theories in four dimensions it was found that certain natural assumption about the bifermion condensates leads to the infrared effective theory where the 't Hooft anomaly matching conditions are satisfied in an entirely evident fashion, without need of verifying arithmetic equations. This is due to the fact that in these systems, characterized by dynamical color (and flavor) symmetry breaking, the quantum numbers and multiplicities of the low-energy massless fermions match exactly those of the fermions in the UV theory which do not condense and remain massless, with respect to the unbroken symmetries. This means also that the stronger constraints following from the matching request of mixed anomalies involving certain generalized 1-form center symmetries, as well as some global anomalies such as Witten's $SU(2)$ anomaly, are all fully satisfied. It is the aim of this note to clarify better the working of this phenomenon (which we call Natural Anomaly Matching), correct some earlier statements made about it, and illustrate it further with a few new examples.</description>

Abstract: A hermitian matrix can be parametrized by a set consisting of its determinant and the eigenvalues of its submatrices. We established a group of equations which connect these variables with the mixing parameters of diagonalization. These equations are simple in structure and manifestly invariant in form under the symmetry operations of dilatation, translation, rephasing and permutation. When applied to the problem of neutrino oscillation in matter they produced two new ``matter invariants" which are confirmed by available data.</description>

Abstract: The angular correlation of pulsar residuals observed by NANOGrav and other pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations show evidence in support of the Hellings-Downs correlation expected from stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB). In this paper, we offer a non-gravitational wave explanation of the observed pulsar timing correlations as caused by an ultra-light $L_{\mu} - L_{\tau}$ gauge boson dark matter (ULDM). ULDM can affect the pulsar correlations in two ways. The gravitational potential of vector ULDM gives rise to a Shapiro time delay of the pulsar signals and a non-trivial angular correlation (as compared to the scalar ULDM case). In addition, if the pulsars have a non-zero charge of the dark matter gauge group, then the electric field of the local dark matter causes an oscillation of the pulsar and a corresponding Doppler shift of the pulsar signal. We point out that pulsars carry a significant charge of muons, and thus the $L_{\mu} - L_{\tau}$ vector dark matter contributes to both the Doppler oscillations and the time delay of the pulsar signals. The synergy between these two effects provides a better fit to the shape of the angular correlation function, as observed by the NANOGrav collaboration, compared to the standard SGWB explanation or the SGWB combined with time delay explanations. Our analysis shows that in addition to the SGWB signal, there may potentially be excess timing residuals attributable to the $L_{\mu} - L_{\tau}$ ULDM.</description>

Abstract: String theory models generically predict the existence of multiple axion-like particle (ALP) fields, yet the majority of both theoretical and experimental works have assumed only one ALP. In this paper, we discuss the phenomenology of systems with multiple ALPs that can undergo oscillations akin to neutrino oscillations. Motivated by this effect, we extend the 'anarchy' framework, which has been used to predict neutrino oscillation parameters, to generate the parameters of many ALP systems. We explore the phenomenology of these ALP anarchy models in some of the leading ALP search strategies, including the CERN Axion Solar Telescope, magnetic white dwarfs and the gamma-ray spectra of distant blazars. We include both the ALP-photon and the ALP-electron coupling. We find that ALP anarchy models predict drastically different results than single ALP models.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the transport coefficients and observables of a rotating QGP medium in kinetic theory framework with a novel approach to the collision integral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01240v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present work, we have studied how the rotation of the QGP medium affects the transport coefficients and observables in heavy ion collisions. For the noncentral collisions, although most of the angular momentum gets carried away by the spectators, there still remains a finite angular momentum with a finite range of angular velocity, which thus incites rotation in the produced matter. As a result, various properties of the QGP medium are likely to be modulated by the rotation. We have calculated the transport coefficients and observables, such as the electrical conductivity, the thermal conductivity, the Knudsen number, the elliptic flow, the specific heat at constant pressure, the specific heat at constant volume, the trace anomaly, the thermal diffusion constant and the isothermal compressibility using the kinetic theory to see the effect of rotation on them. In particular, we have used the novel relaxation time approximation for the collision integral in the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation to derive the transport coefficients and compared them with their values in the relaxation time approximation within the kinetic theory approach in conjunction with the finite angular velocity. We have found that the angular velocity plays an important role and enhances the flow of charge and heat in the medium. Further, as compared to the relaxation time approximation, the electrical and thermal conductivities have smaller values in the novel relaxation time approximation and these differences between the conductivities in the said approximations are more pronounced at high temperature than at low temperature. Furthermore, all the aforesaid observables are found to be sensitive to the rotation of the QGP medium.</description>

Abstract: The lepton flavor violating (LFV) decays $h, Z\to e_b e_a $, and $e_b\to e_a \gamma$ are discussed in a class of general 3-3-1 models adding heavy neutral leptons and singly charged Higgs bosons to accommodate experimental data of neutrino oscillation and $(g-2)_{e_a}$ anomalies of charged leptons through the inverse seesaw mechanism. We show that the models with the minimal number of inverse seesaw neutrinos cannot reach the $1\sigma$ range of $(g-2)_{\mu}$ data due to the experimental upper bounds on decay rates of $(\tau \to \mu \gamma)$ and $(\mu \to e \gamma)$. Features of LFV decays are presented in detail, focusing on the regions of parameter space satisfying the $1\sigma$ ranges of $(g-2)_{e,\mu}$ data.</description>

Abstract: Very high-energy astrophysical gamma rays suffer a suppression of their flux along their propagation due to their interaction, through the $\gamma\gamma\to e^+e^-$ pair-production process, with the soft photon backgrounds present in the Universe. We examine the Universe's transparency to gamma rays within a Lorentz Invariance Violation (LIV) framework, focusing on photon subluminal quadratic corrections driven by a high-energy scale. Based on an explicit calculation, we provide a new expression for the cross section that overcomes the limitations of previous approaches and refines existing constraints for the LIV scale, while we introduce a new approximation that may be useful in LIV scenarios beyond effective field theory. These improvements appear essential for setting constraints on LIV effects with future observations at ultra-high energies, where previous approximations may fall short.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the long-standing discrepancy in lepton flavor universality ratios $R_D$ and $R_{D^{\ast}}$ we assess the status of scalar leptoquark states $R_2$, $\widetilde R_2$ and $S_1$ which can in principle provide a desired enhancement of $\mathcal{B}(B\to D^{(\ast )}\tau \nu)$ in a minimal setup with two Yukawa couplings only. We consider unavoidable low-energy constraints, $Z$-pole measurements as well as high-$p_T$ constraints. After setting mass of each leptoquark to $1.5$ TeV we find that of all considered states only $S_1$ leptoquark, coupled to both chiralities of leptons and quarks, is still a completely viable solution while the scenario with $R_2$ is in growing tension with $\Gamma(Z \to \tau \tau)$ and with the LHC constraints on the di-tau tails at high-$p_T$. We comment on the future experimental tests of $S_1$ scenario.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Leptogenesis typically requires the introduction of heavy particles whose out-of-equilibrium decays are essential for generating a matter-antimatter asymmetry, according to one of Sakharov's conditions. We demonstrate that in Dirac leptogenesis, scatterings between the light degrees of freedom -- Standard Model particles plus Dirac neutrinos - are sufficient to generate the asymmetry. The generation requires at least two effective charges conserved by the fast Standard Model interactions. Due to its vanishing source term in the Boltzmann equations, the asymmetry of right-handed neutrinos solely arises through wash-in processes. Sakharov's conditions are satisfied because the right-handed neutrino partners are out of equilibrium. Consequently, heavy degrees of freedom never needed to be produced in the early universe, allowing for a reheating temperature well below their mass scale. Considering a minimal leptoquark model, we discuss the viable parameter space along with the potential observational signature of an increased number of effective neutrinos in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Flavor dependence of unpolarized quark Transverse Momentum Distributions from a global fit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13833v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an extraction of the unpolarized transverse-momentum-dependent parton distribution and fragmentation functions that takes into account possible differences between quark flavors and final-state hadrons. The extraction is based on experimental measurements from Drell-Yan processes and semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering, whose combination is essential to distinguish flavor differences. The analysis is carried out at N$^3$LL accuracy. The extracted flavor-dependent distributions give a very good description of the data ($\chi^2/N_{\rm dat} = 1.08$). The resulting uncertainties take fully into account also the uncertainties in the determination of the corresponding collinear distributions.</description>

      <title>Heavy-quark dominance and fine structure of excited heavy baryons $\Sigma_{Q}$, $\Xi '_{Q}$ and $\Omega_{Q}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16162v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the framework of the relativized quark model, the calculation of spin-orbit interactions is improved by considering the contribution from the light quark cluster in a singly heavy baryon. It modifies the energy level splitting of the orbital excitation significantly and causes the emergence of fine structures for $\Sigma_{Q}$, $\Xi '_{Q}$ and $\Omega_{Q}$ baryons. Based on this improvement, we systematically analyze the fine structures and retest the heavy quark dominance mechanism. This mechanism is found to be violated in the $1P$-wave states of the $\Sigma_{c}$, $\Xi '_{c}$ and $\Omega_{c}$ baryons although it remains effective overall, which may help to understand the nature of the heavy quarks and strong interactions. With the predicted fine structures, we make the precise assignments of those observed heavy baryons which once could not be accurately explained due to their close mass values. The method used in this work is instructive and applicable for the study of more complex exotic hadrons, such as the heavy tetraquarks and pentaquarks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the determination of the partonic structure of colorless exchanges in deep inelastic diffractive $ep$ scattering at the Electron Ion Collider, using the standard decomposition into Pomeron and Reggeon contributions. We perform fits to simulated diffractive cross section pseudodata in four variables, including the momentum transfer $t$, to estimate the achievable precision on the Pomeron and Reggeon quark and gluon distributions. We analyze the influence of different cuts in the kinematic variables, beam energy configurations and luminosities, including a `first year' scenario. We conclude that the EIC will be able to constrain the partonic structure of the sub-leading Reggeon exchange with a precision comparable to that of the leading Pomeron exchange.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study bounce solutions and associated negative modes in the class of piecewise linear triangular-shaped potentials that may be viewed as approximations of smooth potentials. In these simple potentials, the bounce solution and action can be obtained analytically for a general spacetime dimension $D$. The eigenequations for the fluctuations around the bounce are universal and have the form of a Schr\"odinger-like equation with delta-function potentials. This Schr\"odinger equation is solved exactly for the negative modes whose number is confirmed to be one. The latter result may justify the usefulness of such piecewise linear potentials in the study of false vacuum decay.</description>

      <title>Factorization for $J/\psi$ leptoproduction at small transverse momentum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04793v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonrelativistic Quantum Chromodynamics (NRQCD) breaks down in the region of low transverse momentum, where the transverse momentum of the produced quarkonium state is sensitive to multiple scattering with the incoming hadron and to soft gluon radiation. In this kinematic regime, the transverse-momentum-dependent (TMD) factorization framework is required, promoting the long-distance matrix elements (LDMEs) of NRQCD to the so-called TMD shape functions (TMDShFs), which encode both the soft gluon radiation and the formation of the heavy-quark bound state. In this work, we apply an effective-field theory approach (combining NRQCD and SCET) to the photon-gluon fusion process in inclusive $J/\psi$ leptoproduction. We derive a factorization theorem for the cross section in terms of TMDShFs, compute these quantities at next-to-leading order, establish their evolution, and study their matching onto the corresponding LDMEs in the high-transverse-momentum region. Our results are particularly relevant to the Electron-Ion Collider, where $J/\psi$ leptoproduction can be used to probe gluon transverse-momentum-dependent parton distribution functions (gluon TMDPDFs).</description>

      <title>Large pseudoscalar Yukawa couplings in the complex 3HDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19856v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As LHC's Run3 unfolds, we peer deeper into the couplings of the 125GeV Higgs ($h_{125}$) and also test for extra scalars. Even before such extra scalars are found, one can probe them by using the fact that theories with multiple Higgs doublets allow for substantial deviations of the couplings of $h_{125}$ from their SM values. Indeed, the observed couplings already place stringent limits on such theories. We investigate the curious possibility that $h_{125}$ couples to the top quark mostly as a scalar, while it couples to the bottom quark mostly as a pseudoscalar. This possibility was allowed by 2017 data for the so-called C2HDM; a two Higgs doublet model with a single source of explicit CP violation. It was shown recently that this possibility disappears when using the full experimental data of 2024. Here we discuss a three Higgs doublet with explicit CP violation (C3HDM), and show that the curious CP-even/CP-odd $t$/$b$ possibility is partly resuscitated, prompting further experimental exploration of this prospect.</description>

      <title>Interference effects in resonant di-Higgs production at the LHC in the Higgs singlet extension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06651v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interference effects are well founded from the quantum mechanical viewpoint and in principle cannot be ignored in realistic studies of New Physics scenarios. In this work, we investigate the size of interference effects between resonant and non-resonant contributions to di-Higgs production in the singlet extension of the Standard Model, where the additional heavy scalar provides a resonant channel. We find these interference contributions to have a non-negligible effect on the cross-sections and differential distributions. In order to allow for a computationally efficient treatment of these effects via reweighting, we introduce a new tool utilising a matrix-element reweighting method: HHReweighter. In addition to the broadly used di-Higgs invariant mass $m_{hh}$, we analyse the sensitivity to the interference terms for other kinematic variables, such as the Higgs boson transverse momentum, and find that these also can be sensitive to interference effects. Furthermore, we provide updates on the latest experimental and theoretical limits on the parameter space of the real singlet extension of the Standard Model Higgs sector.</description>

      <title>Minimizing Selection Bias in Inclusive Jets in Heavy-Ion Collisions with Energy Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The first-ever measurement of energy correlators within inclusive jets produced in heavy-ion collisions, revealed by the CMS Collaboration, shows a clear enhancement at large angles relative to the proton-proton (p-p) baseline. However, interpreting this enhancement is complicated due to selection bias from energy loss, which also distorts the energy correlator heavy-ion to p-p ratio in the hadronization region, hindering our understanding of parton/hadron dynamics in a colored medium. In this Letter, we introduce a new ratio of energy correlator observables that removes the leading effects of selection bias from the two-point energy correlator spectrum (E2C). Pythia and Herwig simulations show that the impact of selection bias in the E2C is reduced by an order of magnitude, while sensitivity to any other medium modifications is retained. This quantity can be obtained directly from the experimental measurements presented by CMS, as illustrated in the accompanying note.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14164v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The double-gluon hybrid meson configuration was recently proposed and investigated within QCD sum rules. In this talk, we discuss the color structures of the double-gluon hybrid meson and construct current operators with exotic quantum numbers $J^{PC}=1^{-+}$ and $2^{+-}$ for two of the structures. In the framework of QCD sum rules, we consider the condensates up to dimension-8 at the leading order of $\alpha_{s}$ for both charmonium and the bottomonium systems. The results indicate that the masses of the $1^{-+}$ and $2^{+-}$ charmonium double-gluon hybrid mesons are approximately $6.1-7.2$ GeV and $6.3-6.4$ GeV, respectively. As for the bottomonium systems, their masses fall within the range of $13.7-14.3$ GeV and $12.6-13.3$ GeV for the $1^{-+}$ and $2^{+-}$ channels, respectively. Additionally, the charmonium hybrids could be produced in the radiative decays of bottomonium mesons in BelleII experiment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose that the non-observation of WIMPs may be explained by dark matter primarily annihilating to the darker concealed sector while coupling to the standard model with only minimal strength. To demonstrate this scenario, we focus on the WIMP dark matter candidate from a $U(1)_x$ hidden sector, which couples more strongly to another concealed $U(1)_c$ sector than to the standard model. We explore two possible cases for the evolution of dark particles among hidden sectors: (1) The WIMP annihilates efficiently and achieves the observed relic density with the assistance of the concealed sector. (2) The WIMP transforms into another type of dark matter within the concealed sector and attains the observed relic density. Annihilating to the darker explains why WIMPs have remained undetected, and all WIMP models will continue to hold interest.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the hard scattering amplitude of gravitational form factors (GFFs) of hadrons within QCD factorization at large momentum transfers, focusing on their conformal field theory (CFT) description. These form factors are key to studying quark and gluon angular momentum in hadrons, connected to Mellin moments of Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering (DVCS). The analysis uses diffeomorphism invariance and conformal symmetry in momentum space. A non-Abelian $TJJ$ 3-point function at $O(\alpha_s^2)$ reveals a dilaton interaction in the $t$-channel. We present a parameterization relevant for future DVCS/GFF experiments at the Electron-Ion Collider.</description>

      <title>Phase-Space methods for neutrino oscillations: extension to multi-beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Phase-Space approach (PSA), which was originally introduced in [Lacroix et al., Phys. Rev. D 106, 123006 (2022)] to describe neutrino flavor oscillations for interacting neutrinos emitted from stellar objects is extended to describe arbitrary numbers of neutrino beams. The PSA is based on mapping the quantum fluctuations into a statistical treatment by sampling initial conditions followed by independent mean-field evolution. A new method is proposed to perform this sampling that allows treating an arbitrary number of neutrinos in each neutrino beam. We validate the technique successfully and confirm its predictive power on several examples where a reference exact calculation is possible. We show that it can describe many-body effects, such as entanglement and dissipation induced by the interaction between neutrinos. Due to the complexity of the problem, exact solutions can only be calculated for rather limited cases, with a limited number of beams and/or neutrinos in each beam. The PSA approach considerably reduces the numerical cost and provides an efficient technique to accurately simulate arbitrary numbers of beams. Examples of PSA results are given here, including up to 200 beams with time-independent or time-dependent Hamiltonian. We anticipate that this approach will be useful to bridge exact microscopic techniques with more traditional transport theories used in neutrino oscillations. It will also provide important reference calculations for future quantum computer applications where other techniques are not applicable to classical computers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.01134v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the time-dependent behaviour of quantum correlations of a system of an inverted oscillator governed by out-of-equilibrium dynamics using the well-known Schwinger-Keldysh formalism in presence of quantum mechanical quench. Considering a generalized structure of a time-dependent Hamiltonian for an inverted oscillator system, we use the invariant operator method to obtain its eigenstates and continuous energy eigenvalues. Using the expression for the eigenstates, we further derive the most general expression for the generating function as well as the out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOC) for the given system using this formalism. Further, considering the time-dependent coupling and frequency of the quantum inverted oscillator characterized by quench parameters, we comment on the dynamical behaviour, specifically the early, intermediate and late time-dependent features of the OTOC for the quenched quantum inverted oscillator. Next, we study a specific case, where the system of inverted oscillator exhibits chaotic behaviour by computing the quantum Lyapunov exponent from the time-dependent behaviour of OTOC in presence of the given quench profile.</description>

      <title>Moments of parton distribution functions of any order from lattice QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe a procedure to determine moments of parton distribution functions of any order in lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The procedure is based on the gradient flow for fermion and gauge fields. The flowed matrix elements of twist-2 operators renormalize multiplicatively, and the matching with the physical matrix elements can be obtained using continuum symmetries and the irreducible representations of Euclidean 4-dimensional rotations. We calculate the matching coefficients at one-loop in perturbation theory for moments of any order in the flavor nonsinglet case. We also give specific examples of operators that could be used in lattice QCD computations. It turns out that it is possible to choose operators with identical Lorentz indices and still have a multiplicative matching. One can thus use twist-2 operators exclusively with temporal indices, thus substantially improving the signal-to-noise ratio in the computation of the hadronic matrix elements.</description>

      <title>Superhorizon Curvature Perturbations Are Protected against One-Loop Corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04682v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine one-loop corrections from small-scale curvature perturbations to the superhorizon-limit ones in single-field inflation models, which have recently caused controversy. We consider the case where the Universe experiences transitions of slow-roll (SR) $\to$ intermediate period $\to$ SR. The intermediate period can be an ultra-slow-roll period or a resonant amplification period, either of which enhances small-scale curvature perturbations. We assume that the superhorizon curvature perturbations are conserved at least during each of the SR periods. Within this framework, we show that the superhorizon curvature perturbations during the first and the second SR periods coincide at one-loop level in the slow-roll limit.</description>

      <title>Strangeness-Correlations on the pseudo-critical line in (2+1)-flavor QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09335v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present some lattice QCD results on first ($\chi_1^i$) and second ($\chi_2^i$) cumulants of and correlations ($\chi_{11}^{ij}$) among net baryon-number ($B$), strangeness ($S$) and electric charge ($Q$) along the pseudo-critical line ($T_{pc}(\mu_B)$) in the temperature ($T$)--baryon chemical potential ($\mu_B$) phase diagram of (2+1)-flavor QCD. We point out that violations of the isospin symmetric limit of vanishing electric charge chemical potential are small along the $T_{pc}(\mu_B)$ for the entire range of $\mu_B$ covered in the RHIC beam energy scan. For the strangeness neutral matter produced in heavy-ion collisions this leads to a close relation between $\chi_{11}^{BS}$ and $\chi_{11}^{QS}$. We compare lattice QCD results for $\chi_{11}^{BS}/\chi_2^S$ along the $T_{pc}(\mu_B)$ line with preliminary experimental measurements of $\chi_{11}^{BS}/\chi_2^S$ for collision energies $7.7~{\rm GeV}\le \sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}\le 62.4~{\rm GeV}$. While we find good agreements for $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}\ge 39$~GeV, differences are sizeable at smaller values of $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}$. Moreover, we compare lattice QCD results for the ratio of the strangeness ($\mu_S$) to baryon ($\mu_B$) chemical potentials, which define a strangeness neutral system with fixed electric charge to baryon number density, with experimental results obtained by the STAR collaboration for $\mu_S/\mu_B$ using strange baryon yields on the freeze-out line. Finally, we determine the baryon chemical potential at the freeze-out ($\mu_B^f$) by comparing $\chi_1^B/\chi_2^B$ along the $T_{pc}(\mu_B)$ with the experimentally measured net-proton cumulants $\chi_1^p/\chi_2^p$. We find that $\{\mu_B^f, T_{pc}(\mu_B^f) \}$ are consistent with the freeze-out parameters of the statistical-model fits to experimentally measured hadron yields for $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}} \geq 11.5$ GeV.</description>

      <title>Fay identities for polylogarithms on higher-genus Riemann surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A recent construction of polylogarithms on Riemann surfaces of arbitrary genus in arXiv:2306.08644 is based on a flat connection assembled from single-valued non-holomorphic integration kernels that depend on two points on the Riemann surface. In this work, we construct and prove infinite families of bilinear relations among these integration kernels that are necessary for the closure of the space of higher-genus polylogarithms under integration over the points on the surface. Our bilinear relations generalize the Fay identities among the genus-one Kronecker-Eisenstein kernels to arbitrary genus. The multiple-valued meromorphic kernels in the flat connection of Enriquez are conjectured to obey higher-genus Fay identities of exactly the same form as their single-valued non-holomorphic counterparts. We initiate the applications of Fay identities to derive functional relations among higher-genus polylogarithms involving either single-valued or meromorphic integration kernels.</description>

      <title>Strange stars admixed with mirror dark matter: confronting observations of XTE J1814-338</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15969v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore a novel framework for explaining the mass and radius relationships of observed neutron stars by considering strange stars (SSs) admixed with mirror dark matter (MDM). We develop a theoretical model that incorporates non-commutative algebra to describe the interactions between ordinary strange quark matter (SQM) and MDM, which are predicted to form compact objects that could explain recent astrophysical data, including observations of PSR J0740+6620, PSR J0030+0451, PSR J0437-4715, and the central compact object in HESS J1731-347. Notably, we demonstrate that the exotic mass-radius measurement of XTE J1814-338 can be explained by the presence of a mirror SS with an ordinary SQM core. In contrast to other explanations based on boson stars, our SS+MDM model offers a natural explanation for this system. We provide detailed mass-radius comparisons with observational data and discuss future observations that could test the predictions of our model, offering new insights into neutron star structure and the role of dark matter in compact objects.</description>
