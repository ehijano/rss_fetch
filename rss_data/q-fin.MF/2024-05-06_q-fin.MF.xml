      <title>On variable annuities with surrender charges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we provide a theoretical analysis of Variable Annuities with a focus on the holder's right to an early termination of the contract. We obtain a rigorous pricing formula and the optimal exercise boundary for the surrender option. We also illustrate our theoretical results with extensive numerical experiments. The pricing problem is formulated as an optimal stopping problem with a time-dependent payoff which is discontinuous at the maturity of the contract and non-smooth. This structure leads to non-monotonic optimal stopping boundaries which we prove nevertheless to be continuous and regular in the sense of diffusions for the stopping set. The lack of monotonicity of the boundary makes it impossible to use classical methods from optimal stopping. Also more recent results about Lipschitz continuous boundaries are not applicable in our setup. Thus, we contribute a new methodology for non-monotone stopping boundaries.</description>

      <title>Fourier-Laplace transforms in polynomial Ornstein-Uhlenbeck volatility models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Fourier-Laplace transforms of a broad class of polynomial Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) volatility models, including the well-known Stein-Stein, Sch\"obel-Zhu, one-factor Bergomi, and the recently introduced Quintic OU models motivated by the SPX-VIX joint calibration problem. We show the connection between the joint Fourier-Laplace functional of the log-price and the integrated variance, and the solution of an infinite dimensional Riccati equation. Next, under some non-vanishing conditions of the Fourier-Laplace transforms, we establish an existence result for such Riccati equation and we provide a discretized approximation of the joint characteristic functional that is exponentially entire. On the practical side, we develop a numerical scheme to solve the stiff infinite dimensional Riccati equations and demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the scheme for pricing SPX options and volatility swaps using Fourier and Laplace inversions, with specific examples of the Quintic OU and the one-factor Bergomi models and their calibration to real market data.</description>
