      <title>Large deviations in mean-field quantum spin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous fields (or bundles) of $C^*$-algebras form an important ingredient for describing emergent phenomena, such as phase transitions and spontaneous symmetry breaking. In this work, we consider the continuous $C^*$-bundle generated by increasing symmetric tensor powers of the complex $\ell\times\ell$ matrices $M_\ell(\mathbb{C})$, which can be interpreted as abstract description of mean-field theories defining the macroscopic limit of infinite quantum systems. Within this framework we discuss the principle of large deviations for the local Gibbs state in the high temperature regime and characterize the limit of the ensuing logarithmic generating function.</description>

      <title>Existence of orthogonal domain walls in B\'enard-Rayleigh convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In B{\'e}nard-Rayleigh convection we consider the pattern defect in orthogonal domain walls connecting a set of convective rolls with another set of rolls orthogonal to the first set. This is understood as an heteroclinic orbit of a reversible system where the x-coordinate plays the role of time. This appears as a perturbation of the heteroclinic orbit proved to exist in a reduced 6-dimensional system studied by a variational method in [3], and studied analytically in [10]. We then prove for a given amplitude, and an imposed symmetry in coordinate y, the existence of a one parameter family of heteroclinic connections between orthogonal sets of rolls, with wave numbers (different in general) which are linked to an adapted ''shift'' of rolls parallel to the wall.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present two involutivity theorems in the context of Poisson quasi-Nijenhuis manifolds. The second one stems from recursion relations that generalize the so called Lenard-Magri relations on a bi-Hamiltonian manifold. We apply these results to the case of the closed (or periodic) Toda lattice. Then we show how this geometrical setting is related to the bi-Hamiltonian pair of the lattice and to its recursion relations.</description>

      <title>Recycling solutions of boundary value problems: the Wiener--Hopf perspective on embedding formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Embedding formula allows to recycle solution of a family boundary value problems by expressing all the solutions in terms of a small number of solutions. Such formulas have been previously derived in the context of diffraction by applying a cleverly chosen operator to the solution and the construction of edge Green's functions which are introduced in an elaborate manner specific for each problem. We demonstrate that embedding formula naturally appears from a matrix Wiener--Hopf equation, and the embedding formula is derived from the canonical solution to this matrix Wiener--Hopf problem. This allows to drive the embedding formula in any context where the problem can be formulated as a Wiener--Hopf equation. We illustrate the effectiveness of this approach by revisiting known problems, such as the problem of diffraction by half-line, a strip and the problem of diffraction by a wedge. Additionally, a new matrix Wiener--Hopf formulation is derived for wedge problems.</description>

      <title>Quantum cellular automata and categorical duality of spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dualities play a central role in the study of quantum spin chains, providing insight into the structure of quantum phase diagrams and phase transitions. In this work we study categorical dualities, which are defined as bounded-spread isomorphisms between algebras of symmetry-respecting local operators on a spin chain. We consider generalized global symmetries that correspond to unitary fusion categories, which are represented by matrix-product operator algebras. A fundamental question about dualities is whether they can be extended to quantum cellular automata on the larger algebra generated by all local operators that respect the unit matrix-product operator. For conventional global symmetries, which are on-site representations of finite groups, this larger algebra is simply the tensor product of algebras associated to individual spins in the chain. We present a solution to the extension problem using the machinery of Doplicher-Haag-Roberts bimodules. Our solution provides a crisp categorical criterion for when an extension of a duality exists. We show that the set of possible extensions form a torsor over the invertible objects in the relevant symmetry category. Our approach recovers existing results from the literature when applied to quantum cellular automata that respect a conventional global symmetry.</description>

      <title>An optimal lower bound for the low density Fermi gas in three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the dilute Fermi gas in three dimensions interacting through a positive, radially symmetric, compactly supported and integrable potential in the thermodynamic limit. We establish a second order lower bound for the ground state energy density with an error term which is optimal in the sense that it matches the order of the next correction term conjectured by Huang-Yang in 1957.</description>

      <title>Extendibility of fermionic states and rigorous ground state approximations of interacting fermionic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solving interacting fermionic quantum many-body problems as they are ubiquitous in quantum chemistry and materials science is a central task of theoretical and numerical physics, a task that can commonly only be addressed in the sense of providing approximations of ground states. For this reason, it is important to have tools at hand to assess how well simple ansatzes would fare. In this work, we provide rigorous guarantees on how well fermionic Gaussian product states can approximate the true ground state, given a weighted interaction graph capturing the interaction pattern of the systems. Our result can be on the one hand seen as a extendibility result of fermionic quantum states: It says in what ways fermionic correlations can be distributed. On the other hand, this is a non-symmetric de-Finetti theorem for fermions, as the direct fermionic analog of a theorem due to Brandao and Harrow. We compare the findings with the distinctly different situation of distinguishable finite-dimensional quantum systems, comment on the approximation of ground states with Gaussian states and elaborate on the connection to the no low-energy trivial state conjecture.</description>

      <title>A phase transition in sampling from Restricted Boltzmann Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Restricted Boltzmann Machines are a class of undirected graphical models that play a key role in deep learning and unsupervised learning. In this study, we prove a phase transition phenomenon in the mixing time of the Gibbs sampler for a one-parameter Restricted Boltzmann Machine. Specifically, the mixing time varies logarithmically, polynomially, and exponentially with the number of vertices depending on whether the parameter $c$ is above, equal to, or below a critical value $c_\star\approx-5.87$. A key insight from our analysis is the link between the Gibbs sampler and a dynamical system, which we utilize to quantify the former based on the behavior of the latter. To study the critical case $c= c_\star$, we develop a new isoperimetric inequality for the sampler's stationary distribution by showing that the distribution is nearly log-concave.</description>

      <title>Higher-order gap ratios of singular values in open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding open quantum systems using information encoded in its complex eigenvalues has been a subject of growing interest. In this paper, we study higher-order gap ratios of the singular values of generic open quantum systems. We show that $k$-th order gap ratio of the singular values of an open quantum system can be connected to the nearest-neighbor spacing ratio of positions of classical particles of a harmonically confined log-gas with inverse temperature $\beta'(k)$ where $\beta'(k)$ is an analytical function that depends on $k$ and the Dyson's index $\beta=1,2,$ and $4$ that characterizes the properties of the associated Hermitized matrix. Our findings are crucial not only for understanding long-range correlations between the eigenvalues but also provide an excellent way of distinguishing different symmetry classes in an open quantum system. To highlight the universality of our findings, we demonstrate the higher-order gap ratios using different platforms such as non-Hermitian random matrices, random dissipative Liouvillians, Hamiltonians coupled to a Markovian bath, and Hamiltonians with in-built non-Hermiticity.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Steklov problem on surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The magnetic Dirichlet-to-Neumann map encodes the voltage-to-current measurements under the influence of a magnetic field. In the case of surfaces, we provide precise spectral asymptotics expansion (up to arbitrary polynomial power) for the eigenvalues of this map. Moreover, we consider the inverse spectral problem and from the expansion we show that the spectrum of the magnetic Dirichlet-to-Neumann map, in favourable situations, uniquely determines the number and the length of boundary components, the parallel transport and the magnetic flux along boundary components. In general, we show that the situation complicates compared to the case when there is no magnetic field. For instance, there are plenty of examples where the expansion does $\textit{not}$ detect the number of boundary components, and this phenomenon is thoroughly studied in the paper.</description>

      <title>Transmission through Cantor structured Dirac comb potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce the Cantor-structured Dirac comb potential, referred to as the Cantor Dirac comb (CDC-$\rho_{N}$) potential system, and investigate non-relativistic quantum tunneling through this novel potential configuration. This system is engineered by positioning delta potentials at the boundaries of each rectangular potential segment of Cantor potential. This study is the first to investigate quantum tunneling through a fractal geometric Dirac comb potential. This potential system exemplifies a particular instance of the super periodic potential (SPP), a broader class of potentials that generalize locally periodic potentials. Utilizing the theoretical framework of SPP, we derived a closed-form expression for the transmission probability for this potential architecture. We report various transmission characteristics, including the appearance of band-like features and the scaling behavior of the reflection coefficient with wave vector $k$, which is governed by a scaling function expressed as a finite product of the Laue function. A particularly striking feature of the system is the occurrence of sharp transmission resonances, which may prove useful in applications such as highly sharp transmission filters.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic interactions between a sedimenting squirmer and a planar wall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hydrodynamic interactions between a sedimenting microswimmer and a solid wall have ubiquitous biological and technological applications. A plethora of gravity-induced swimming dynamics near a planar no-slip wall provides a platform for designing artificial microswimmers that can generate directed propulsion through their translation-rotation coupling near a wall. In this work we provide exact solutions for a squirmer (a model swimmer of spherical shape with a prescribed slip velocity) facing either towards or away from a planar wall perpendicular to gravity. These exact solutions are used to validate a numerical code based on the boundary integral method with an adaptive mesh for distances from the wall down to 0.1% of the squirmer radius. This boundary integral code is then used to investigate the rich gravity-induced dynamics near a wall, mapping out the detailed bifurcation structures of the swimming dynamics in terms of orientation and distance to the wall. Simulation results show that a squirmer may transverse along the wall, move to a fixed point at a given height with a fixed orientation in a monotonic way or in an oscillatory fashion, or oscillate in a limit cycle in the presence of wall repulsion.</description>

Abstract: We present a metriplectic formulation of the radiative transfer equation with polarization and varying refractive index and show that this formulation automatically satisfies the first two laws of thermodynamics. In particular, the derived antisymmetric bracket enjoys the Jacobi identity. To obtain this formulation we suitably transform the equation and show that important physical quantities derived from the solution remain invariant under such a transformation.</description>

The confluence process of this differential equation and the relation with the one-photon quantum Rabi model are also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08176v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a supermanifold equipped with an odd distribution of maximal dimension and constant symbol, we construct the formal moduli problem of deformations of the distribution. This moduli problem is described by a local super dg Lie algebra that provides both a resolution of the structure-preserving vector fields on superspace and a derived enhancement of superconformal symmetry. Applying our construction in standard physical examples returns the conformal supergravity multiplet in every known example, in any dimension and with any amount of supersymmetry$\unicode{x2014}$whether or not a superconformal algebra exists. We discuss new examples related to twisted supergravity, higher Virasoro algebras, and exceptional super Lie algebras. The compatibility of our techniques with twisting also leads to a computation of every twist of the stress tensor multiplet of a superconformal theory, including universal operator product expansions. Our approach uses a derived model for the space of functions constant along the distribution, which is applicable even when the distribution is non-involutive; we construct other natural multiplets, such as K\"ahler differentials, that appear naturally through this lens on superspace geometry.</description>

      <title>Nonsmooth Analysis of Doubly Nonlinear Second-Order Evolution Equations with Non-Convex Energy Functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10128</link>
      <description>arXiv:1910.10128v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the existence of strong solutions to a general class of doubly multivalued and nonlinear evolution equations of second order. The multivalued operators are generated by the subdifferential of nonsmooth potentials that live in different spaces, $U$ and $V$, where in general $U \nsubseteq V$ and $V \nsubseteq U$. The proof is based on the regularization of the dissipation potential using the generalized Moreau--Yosida regularization and a semi-implicit time-discretization scheme, which demonstrates the existence of strong solutions to the regularized problem. The existence of solutions to the original problem is then shown by letting the regularization parameter converge to zero. Furthermore, we establish an energy-dissipation inequality for the solution. We conclude with applications of this abstract theory.</description>

      <title>Zesting produces modular isotopes and explains their topological invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.11374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.11374v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the ribbon zesting construction can produce modular isotopes -- different modular fusion categories with the same modular data. The result relies on the observation that the Reshetikhin-Turaev invariants of framed links associated to a ribbon fusion category satisfy a factorization property under zesting. This gives a new perspective on using topological invariants to classify topological order in light of modular data not being a complete invariant.</description>

      <title>Deep Neural Networks as the Semi-classical Limit of Topological Quantum Neural Networks: The problem of generalisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.13741v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep Neural Networks miss a principled model of their operation. A novel framework for supervised learning based on Topological Quantum Field Theory that looks particularly well suited for implementation on quantum processors has been recently explored. We propose using this framework to understand the problem of generalisation in Deep Neural Networks. More specifically, in this approach, Deep Neural Networks are viewed as the semi-classical limit of Topological Quantum Neural Networks. A framework of this kind explains the overfitting behavior of Deep Neural Networks during the training step and the corresponding generalisation capabilities. We explore the paradigmatic case of the perceptron, which we implement as the semiclassical limit of Topological Quantum Neural Networks. We apply a novel algorithm we developed, showing that it obtains similar results to standard neural networks, but without the need for training (optimisation).</description>

      <title>Bounds on buoyancy driven flows with Navier-slip conditions on rough boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.00226v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider two-dimensional Rayleigh-B\'enard convection with Navier-slip and fixed temperature boundary conditions at the two horizontal rough walls described by the height function $h$. We prove rigorous upper bounds on the Nusselt number $\text{Nu}$ which capture the dependence on the curvature of the boundary $\kappa$ and the (non-constant) friction coefficient $\alpha$ explicitly. If $h\in W^{2,\infty}$ and $\kappa$ satisfies a smallness condition with respect to $\alpha$, we find $$ \text{Nu}\lesssim \text{Ra}^{\frac{1}{2}}+\|\kappa\|_{\infty}\,,$$ where $\text{Ra}$ is the Rayleigh number, which agrees with the predicted Spiegel-Kraichnan scaling when $\kappa=0$. This bound is obtained via local regularity estimates in a small strip at the boundary. When $h\in W^{3,\infty}$, the functions $\kappa$ and $\alpha$ are sufficiently small in $L^{\infty}$ and the Prandtl number $\Pr$ is sufficiently large, we prove upper bounds using the background field method, which interpolate between $\text{Ra}^{\frac{1}{2}}$ and $\text{Ra}^{\frac{5}{12}}$ with non-trivial dependence on $\alpha$ and $\kappa$. These bounds agree with the result in Drivas et al (2022 Phil. Trans. R. Soc. A 380 20210025) for flat boundaries and constant friction coefficient. Furthermore, in the regime $\Pr\geq \text{Ra}^{\frac 57}$, we improve the $\text{Ra}^{\frac 12}$-upper bound, showing $$\text{Nu}\lesssim_{\alpha,\kappa}\text{Ra}^{\frac{3}{7}}\,,$$ where $\lesssim_{\alpha,\kappa}$ hides an additional dependency of the implicit constant on $\alpha$ and $\kappa$.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations in the logarithmic energy for zeros of random polynomials on the sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.02898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Smale's Seventh Problem asks for an efficient algorithm to generate a configuration of $n$ points on the sphere that nearly minimizes the logarithmic energy. As a candidate starting configuration for this problem, Armentano, Beltr\'an and Shub considered the set of points given by the stereographic projection of the roots of the random elliptic polynomial of degree $n$ and computed the expected logarithmic energy. We study the fluctuations of the logarithmic energy associated to this random configuration and prove a central limit theorem. Our approach shows that all cumulants of the logarithmic energy are asymptotically linear in $n$, and hence the energy is well-concentrated on the scale of $\sqrt{n}$.</description>

      <title>Large time behaviour of the 2D thermally non-diffusive Boussinesq equations with Navier-slip boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05400v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the large-time behavior of a buoyancy-driven fluid without thermal diffusion under Navier-slip boundary conditions in a bounded domain with Lipschitz-continuous second derivatives. After establishing improved regularity for classical solutions, we analyze their large-time asymptotics. Specifically, we show that the solutions converge to a state where, as $t \rightarrow \infty$, $\|u\|_{W^{1,p}} \rightarrow 0$, and hydrostatic balance is achieved in the weak topology of $L^2$. Additionally, we determine the necessary conditions for the hydrostatic balance to be attained in the strong topology in the large-time limit. We then analyze a particular steady state, the hydrostatic equilibrium, characterized by $ u = 0 $, $ \theta = \beta x_2 + \gamma $, and $ p = \frac{\beta}{2}x_2^2 + \gamma x_2 + \delta $. In a periodic strip, we establish the linear stability of this state for $\beta &gt; 0$, indicating that the temperature is vertically stably stratified. This work builds upon the results in [Doering et al.], which focus on free-slip boundary conditions, as well as recent studies [Ayd{\i}n, Kukavica, Ziane; Ayd{\i}n, Jayanti] that address no-slip boundary conditions. Notably, the novelty of this study lies in the ability to directly bound the pressure term, made possible by the Navier-slip boundary conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14039v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study multiport networks, common in electrical engineering. They have boundary conditions different from electrical networks: the boundary vertices are split into pairs and the sum of the incoming currents is set to be zero in each pair. If one sets the voltage difference for each pair, then the incoming currents are uniquely determined. We generalize Kirchhoff's matrix-tree theorem to this setup. Different forests now contribute with different signs, making the proof subtle. In particular, we use the formula for the response matrix minors by R. Kenyon-D. Wilson, determinantal identities, and combinatorial bijections. We introduce superport networks, generalizing both ordinary networks and multiport ones.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations of the Nodal Number in the Two-Energy Planar Berry Random Wave Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18219v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the fluctuations of the nodal number (count of the phase singularities) in a natural extension of the well-known complex planar Berry Random Wave Model - Berry (2002) - obtained by considering two independent real Berry Random Waves, with distinct energies $E_1, E_2 \to \infty$ (at possibly $\neq$ speeds). Our framework relaxes the conditions used in Nourdin, Peccati and Rossi (2019) where the energies were assumed to be identical ($E_1 \equiv E_2$). We establish the asymptotic equivalence of the nodal number with its 4-th chaotic projection and prove quantitative Central Limit Theorems (CLTs) in the 1-Wasserstein distance for the univariate and multivariate scenarios. We provide a corresponding qualitative theorem on the convergence to the White Noise in a sense of random distributions. We compute the exact formula for the asymptotic variance of the nodal number with exact constants depending on the choice of the subsequence. We provide a simple and complete characterisation of this dependency through introduction of the three asymptotic parameters: $r^{log}$, $r$, $r^{exp}$. The corresponding claims in the one-energy model were established in Nourdin, Peccati and Rossi (2019), Peccati and Vidotto (2020), Notarnicola, Peccati and Vidotto (2023), and we recover them as a special case of our results. Moreover, we establish full-correlations with polyspectra, which are analogues of the full-correlation with tri-spectrum that was previously observed for the nodal length in Vidotto (2021).</description>

      <title>Minimal Elements of the Causal Boundary with Applications to Spacetime Splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07782v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1972, Geroch, Kronheimer, and Penrose introduced what is now called the causal boundary of a spacetime. This boundary is constructed out of Terminal Indecomposable Past sets (TIPs) and their future analogues (TIFs), which are the pasts and futures of inextendible causal curves. The causal boundary is a key tool to understand the global structure of a spacetime. In this paper, we show that in a spacetime with compact Cauchy surfaces, there is always at least one minimal TIP and one minimal TIF, minimal meaning that it does not contain another TIP (resp.\ TIF) as a proper subset. We then study the implications of the minimal TIP and TIF meeting each other. This condition generalizes some of the "no observer horizon" conditions that have been used in the literature to obtain partial solutions of the Bartnik splitting conjecture. We also show that such a no observer horizons condition is satisfied when the spacetime has a (possibly discrete) timelike conformal symmetry, generalizing a result of Costa e Silva, Flores, and Herrera about conformal Killing vector fields.</description>

Abstract: In the context of kernel optimization, we prove a result that yields new factorizations and realizations. Our initial context is that of general positive operator-valued kernels. We further present implications for Hilbert space-valued Gaussian processes, as they arise in applications to dynamics and to machine learning. Further applications are given in non-commutative probability theory, including a new non-commutative Radon--Nikodym theorem.</description>

      <title>Analytical Expression for Continuum-continuum Transition Amplitude of Hydrogen-like Atoms with Angular-momentum Dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09662v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Attosecond chronoscopy typically utilises interfering two-photon transitions to access the phase information. Simulating these two-photon transitions is challenging due to the continuum-continuum transition term. The hydrogenic approximation within second-order perturbation theory has been widely used due to the existence of analytical expressions of the wave functions. So far, only (partially) asymptotic results have been derived, which fail to correctly describe the low-kinetic-energy behaviour, especially for high angular-momentum states. Here, we report an analytical expression that overcome these limitations. They are based on the Appell's F1 function and use the confluent hypergeometric function of the second kind as the intermediate states. We show that the derived formula quantitatively agrees with the numerical simulations using the time-dependent Schr{\"o}dinger equation for various angular-momentum states, which improves the accuracy compared to the other analytical approaches that were previously reported. Furthermore, we give an angular-momentum-dependent asymptotic form of the outgoing wavefunction and their continuum-continuum dipole transition amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Spherical and hyperbolic orthogonal ring patterns: integrability and variational principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06573v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce orthogonal ring patterns in the 2-sphere and in the hyperbolic plane, consisting of pairs of concentric circles, which generalize circle patterns. We show that their radii are described by a discrete integrable system. This is a special case of the master integrable equation Q4. The variational description is given in terms of elliptic generalizations of the dilogarithm function. They have the same convexity principles as their circle-pattern counterparts. This allows us to prove existence and uniqueness results for the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary value problems. Some examples are computed numerically. In the limit of small smoothly varying rings, one obtains harmonic maps to the sphere and to the hyperbolic plane. A close relation to discrete surfaces with constant mean curvature is explained.</description>

      <title>Spatial Form Factor for Point Patterns: Homogeneous Poisson Point Process and Coulomb Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a spatial form factor (SFF) for the characterization of spatial patterns associated with point processes. Specifically, the SFF is defined in terms of the averaged even Fourier transform of the distance between any pair of points. We focus on homogeneous Poisson point processes and derive the explicit expression for the SFF in $d$-spatial dimensions. The SFF can then be found in terms of the even Fourier transform of the probability distribution for the distance between two independent and uniformly distributed random points on a $d$-dimensional ball, arising in the ball line picking problem. The relation between the SFF and the set of $n$-order spacing distributions is further established. The SFF is analyzed in detail for $d=1,2,3$ and in the infinite-dimensional case, as well as for the $d$-dimensional Coulomb gas, as an interacting point process. We also introduce a generalization of the SFF applicable to arbitrary sets in a metric space.</description>

      <title>On the existence of traveling wave solutions for cold plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07823v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The present paper is concerned with the existence of traveling wave solutions of the asymptotic model, derived by the authors in a previous work, to approximate the unidirectional evolution of a collision-free plasma in a magnetic field. First, using bifurcation theory, we can rigorously prove the existence of periodic traveling waves of small amplitude. Furthermore, our analysis also evidences the existence of different type of traveling waves. To this end, we present a second approach based on the analysis of the differential system satisfied by the traveling-wave profiles, the existence of equilibria, and the identification of associated homo-clinic and periodic orbits around them. The study makes use of linearization techniques and numerical computations to show the existence of different types of traveling-wave solutions, with monotone and non-monotone behaviour and different regularity, as well as periodic traveling waves.</description>
