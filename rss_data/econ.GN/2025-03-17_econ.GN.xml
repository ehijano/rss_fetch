      <title>Economic Impact of China's Retaliatory Soybean Tariff on U.S. Soybean Farmers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper analyzes the economic impact of China's retaliatory soybean tariff on U.S. soybean farmers using advanced econometric methods and comprehensive datasets including USDA reports, trade data, and historical price movements. The analysis employs a Structural Vector Autoregression (SVAR), a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) estimation, and a Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) model, revealing the impacts of China's retaliatory tariff on soybean prices, exports, farm incomes, and acreage decisions. U.S. policy responses, including direct subsidies and market diversification strategies, are also evaluated.</description>

      <title>Public Support for Environmental Regulation: When Ideology Trumps Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When environmental regulations are unpopular, policymakers often attribute resistance to information frictions and poor communication. We test this idea in the context of a major climate policy: Germany's Heating Law of 2023, which mandates the phase-out of fossil fuel heating. Through a survey experiment with property owners, we examine whether providing comprehensive information about the regulation's costs, requirements, and timeline affects adoption decisions and policy support. Despite successfully increasing factual knowledge, information provision has no significant effect on intended technology adoption, policy support, or incentivized measures of climate preferences. Instead, pre-existing environmental preferences and demographic characteristics emerge as the key predictors of responses to the regulation. A feeling that existing systems still work well and cost considerations dominate fossil fuel users' stated reasons for non-adoption, while independence from fossil fuels and perceived contributions to the common good drive adoption among switchers. Our findings suggest that opposition to climate policy stems from fundamental preference heterogeneity rather than information frictions. This has important implications for optimal policy design, highlighting potential limits of information provision in overcoming resistance to environmental regulation. The results also speak to broader questions in political economy about the relationship between knowledge, preferences, and support for policy reform.</description>

      <title>Exploring Competitive and Collusive Behaviors in Algorithmic Pricing with Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nowadays, a significant share of the business-to-consumer sector is based on online platforms like Amazon and Alibaba and uses AI for pricing strategies. This has sparked debate on whether pricing algorithms may tacitly collude to set supra-competitive prices without being explicitly designed to do so. Our study addresses these concerns by examining the risk of collusion when Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms are used to decide on pricing strategies in competitive markets. Prior research in this field focused on Tabular Q-learning (TQL) and led to opposing views on whether learning-based algorithms can result in supra-competitive prices. Building on this, our work contributes to this ongoing discussion by providing a more nuanced numerical study that goes beyond TQL, additionally capturing off- and on- policy Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms, two distinct families of DRL algorithms that recently gained attention for algorithmic pricing. We study multiple Bertrand oligopoly variants and show that algorithmic collusion depends on the algorithm used. In our experiments, we observed that TQL tends to exhibit higher collusion and price dispersion. Moreover, it suffers from instability and disparity, as agents with higher learning rates consistently achieve higher profits, and it lacks robustness in state representation, with pricing dynamics varying significantly based on information access. In contrast, DRL algorithms, such as PPO and DQN, generally converge to lower prices closer to the Nash equilibrium. Additionally, we show that when pre-trained TQL agents interact with DRL agents, the latter quickly outperforms the former, highlighting the advantages of DRL in pricing competition. Lastly, we find that competition between heterogeneous DRL algorithms, such as PPO and DQN, tends to reduce the likelihood of supra-competitive pricing.</description>

      <title>Cost-effectiveness of climate regulations depends on non-climate benefits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The United States has long pursued regulations that aim to reduce fossil fuel use. However, while potential emission reduction motivates the introduction and enforcement of these regulations, realization of this potential does not obfuscate the need for prudent economic policy. Scrutinizing nearly two decades of climate regulations in the transportation, industrial, and electric power sector, we enumerate their associated cost effectiveness. Our findings are twofold. Firstly, we find that whereas there are instances where climate regulations carry net economic benefits, there are also cases where compliance costs substantially exceed the social cost of carbon (SCC). Aggregated across sectors and subject to the precise SCC leveraged, up to 65 percent of climate regulations have abatement costs that exceed the SCC. This exceedance is particularly profound in the transportation sector where up to 82 percent of regulations reviewed have abatement costs that exceed the SCC. Secondly, we find that whereas the economic benefits of climate regulations generally exceed the economic costs, this exceedance is largely contingent on the presence of non-climate benefits. Aggregated across sectors, climate benefits account for 33 percent of overall benefits associated with a regulation, compared to 18, 46, and 2 percent for public health, private, and other benefits respectively. Furthermore, we document instances where climate benefits account for as little as 1.6 percent of overall regulatory benefits. This finding hints at a regulatory inefficiency and raises the prospect that alternative, non-climate specific regulation may be a more appropriate mechanism for realizing the non-climate benefits associated with these regulations. Collectively, our findings challenge the economic pragmatism of some (but not all) climate regulations adopted by the United States over a period of nearly two decades.</description>

      <title>Scalable Global Solution Techniques for High-Dimensional Models in Dynare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For over three decades, Dynare has been a cornerstone of dynamic stochastic modeling in economics, relying primarily on perturbation-based local solution methods. However, these techniques often falter in high-dimensional, non-linear models that demand more comprehensive approaches. This paper demonstrates that global solutions of economic models with substantial heterogeneity and frictions can be computed accurately and swiftly by augmenting Dynare with adaptive sparse grids (SGs) and high-dimensional model representation (HDMR). SGs mitigate the curse of dimensionality, as the number of grid points grows significantly slower than in traditional tensor-product Cartesian grids. Additionally, adaptivity focuses grid refinement on regions with steep gradients or non-differentiabilities, enhancing computational efficiency. Complementing SGs, HDMR tackles large state spaces by approximating policy functions with a hierarchical expansion of low-dimensional terms. Using a time iteration algorithm, we benchmark our approach on an international real business cycle model. Our results show that both SGs and HDMR alleviate the curse of dimensionality, enabling accurate solutions for at least 100-dimensional models on standard hardware in relatively short times. This advancement extends Dynare's capabilities beyond perturbation approaches, establishing a versatile platform for sophisticated non-linear models and paving the way for integrating the most recent global solution methods, such as those from machine learning.</description>

      <title>Algorithms vs. Peers: Shaping Engagement with Novel Content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pervasive rise of digital platforms has reshaped how individuals engage with information, with algorithms and peer influence playing pivotal roles in these processes. This study investigates the effects of algorithmic curation and peer influence through social cues (e.g., peer endorsements) on engagement with novel content. Through a randomized field experiment on WeChat involving over 2.1 million users, we find that while peer-sharing exposes users to more novel content, algorithmic curation elicits significantly higher engagement with novel content than peer-sharing, even when social cues are present. Despite users' preference for redundant and less diverse content, both mechanisms mitigate this bias, with algorithms demonstrating a stronger positive effect than peer influence. These findings, though heterogeneous, are robust across demographic variations such as sex, age, and network size. Our results challenge concerns about "filter bubbles" and underscore the constructive role of algorithms in promoting engagement with non-redundant, diverse content.</description>

      <title>From homemakers to breadwinners? How mandatory kindergarten affects maternal labour market outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.14524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.14524v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The majority of Swiss children attend mandatory and cost-free kindergarten at four. We examine the effect of this policy on maternal labour market outcomes. Using administrative data, we exploit the birthday cut-off for kindergarten entry in the same or in the following year and apply a non-parametric regression discontinuity design (RDD). We find that mandatory kindergarten has a statistically significant positive effect on the labour market attachment of previously non-employed mothers, increasing their employment probability by 4 percentage points. In contrast, there are no significant effects on other groups or in the total sample of mothers.</description>

      <title>From Policy to Practice: Upper Bound Cost Estimates of Europes Green Hydrogen Ambitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07149v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the European countries strive to meet their ambitious climate goals, renewable hydrogen has emerged to aid in decarbonizing energy-intensive sectors and support the overall energy transition. To ensure that hydrogen production aligns with these goals, the European Commission has introduced criteria for additionality, temporal correlation, and geographical correlation. These criteria are designed to ensure that hydrogen production from renewable sources supports the growth of renewable energy. This study assesses the impact of these criteria on green hydrogen production, focusing on production costs and technology impacts. The European energy market is simulated up to 2048 using stochastic programming, applying these requirements exclusively to green hydrogen production without the phased-in compliance period outlined in the EU regulations. The findings show that meeting the criteria will increase expected system costs by 82 billion euro from 2024 to 2048, largely due to the rapid shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy. The additionality requirement, which mandates the use of new renewable energy installations for electrolysis, proves to be the most expensive, but also the most effective in accelerating renewable energy adoption.</description>

      <title>Towards Fair Roads -- Manifesto For Fairness Paradigm in Traffic Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traffic engineering aims to control infrastructure and population behaviour to achieve optimal usage of road networks. Fairness is fundamental to stimulate cooperation in large populations, and plays an important role in traffic engineering, as it increases the well-being of users, improves driving safety by rule-adherence, and overcomes public resistance at legislative implementation. Despite the importance of fairness, only a few works have translated fairness into the transportation domain, with a focus on transportation planning rather than traffic engineering. Moreover, existing works in traffic engineering discuss fairness superficially and insufficiently, focussing on only a few definitions. The mission of this work is (i) to challenge the efficiency-driven engineering paradigm of traffic engineering, (ii) to establish a link to modern fairness theories, and (iii) to highlight the importance of fairness when allocating scarce, public good, mobility resources between road users. To achieve this, a mode-agnostic, distributive fairness framework for mobility resource allocation is proposed. It serves when designing traffic engineering solutions, and convinces in public debates with a useful, argumentative tool-set to confront equity considerations. Ultimately, this enables systematic research and design of fairness-informed control systems, demonstrated by three case studies on signalized intersection management and static road pricing.</description>

      <title>Interdisciplinary Papers Supported by Disciplinary Grants Garner Deep and Broad Scientific Impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.14732v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interdisciplinary research has emerged as a hotbed for innovation and a key approach to addressing complex societal challenges. The increasing dominance of grant-supported research in shaping scientific advances, coupled with growing interest in funding interdisciplinary work, raises fundamental questions about the effectiveness of interdisciplinary grants in fostering high-impact interdisciplinary research outcomes. Here, we quantify the interdisciplinarity of both research grants and publications, capturing 350,000 grants from 164 funding agencies across 26 countries and 1.3 million papers that acknowledged their support from 1985 to 2009. Our analysis uncovers two seemingly contradictory patterns: Interdisciplinary grants tend to produce interdisciplinary papers, which are generally associated with high impact. However, compared to disciplinary grants, interdisciplinary grants on average yield fewer papers and interdisciplinary papers they support tend to have substantially reduced impact. We demonstrate that the key to explaining this paradox lies in the power of disciplinary grants in propelling high-impact interdisciplinary research. Specifically, our results show that highly interdisciplinary papers supported by deeply disciplinary grants garner disproportionately more citations, both within their core disciplines and from broader fields. Moreover, disciplinary grants, particularly when combined with other similar grants, are more effective in producing high-impact interdisciplinary research. Amidst the rapid rise of support for interdisciplinary work across the sciences, these results highlight the hitherto unknown role of disciplinary grants in driving crucial interdisciplinary advances, suggesting that interdisciplinary research requires deep disciplinary expertise and investments.</description>

      <title>Behavioral Machine Learning? Computer Predictions of Corporate Earnings also Overreact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.16158v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning algorithms are known to outperform human analysts in predicting corporate earnings, leading to their rapid adoption. However, we show that leading methods (XGBoost, neural nets, ChatGPT) systematically overreact to news. The overreaction is primarily due to biases in the training data and we show that it cannot be eliminated without compromising accuracy. Analysts with machine learning training overreact much less than do traditional analysts. We provide a model showing that there is a tradeoff between predictive power and rational behavior. Our findings suggest that AI tools reduce but do not eliminate behavioral biases in financial markets.</description>
