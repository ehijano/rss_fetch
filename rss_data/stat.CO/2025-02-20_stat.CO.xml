      <title>OGBoost: A Python Package for Ordinal Gradient Boosting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces OGBoost, a scikit-learn-compatible Python package for ordinal regression using gradient boosting. Ordinal variables (e.g., rating scales, quality assessments) lie between nominal and continuous data, necessitating specialized methods that reflect their inherent ordering. Built on a coordinate-descent approach for optimization and the latent-variable framework for ordinal regression, OGBoost performs joint optimization of a latent continuous regression function (functional gradient descent) and a threshold vector that converts the latent continuous value into discrete class probabilities (classical gradient descent). In addition to the stanadard methods for scikit-learn classifiers, the GradientBoostingOrdinal class implements a "decision_function" that returns the (scalar) value of the latent function for each observation, which can be used as a high-resolution alternative to class labels for comparing and ranking observations. The class has the option to use cross-validation for early stopping rather than a single holdout validation set, a more robust approach for small and/or imbalanced datasets. Furthermore, users can select base learners with different underlying algorithms and/or hyperparameters for use throughout the boosting iterations, resulting in a `heterogeneous' ensemble approach that can be used as a more efficient alternative to hyperparameter tuning (e.g. via grid search). We illustrate the capabilities of OGBoost through examples, using the wine quality dataset from the UCI respository. The package is available on PyPI and can be installed via "pip install ogboost".</description>

      <title>A Zero-Inflated Poisson Latent Position Cluster Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The latent position network model (LPM) is a popular approach for the statistical analysis of network data. A central aspect of this model is that it assigns nodes to random positions in a latent space, such that the probability of an interaction between each pair of individuals or nodes is determined by their distance in this latent space. A key feature of this model is that it allows one to visualize nuanced structures via the latent space representation. The LPM can be further extended to the Latent Position Cluster Model (LPCM), to accommodate the clustering of nodes by assuming that the latent positions are distributed following a finite mixture distribution. In this paper, we extend the LPCM to accommodate missing network data and apply this to non-negative discrete weighted social networks. By treating missing data as ``unusual'' zero interactions, we propose a combination of the LPCM with the zero-inflated Poisson distribution. Statistical inference is based on a novel partially collapsed Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, where a Mixture-of-Finite-Mixtures (MFM) model is adopted to automatically determine the number of clusters and optimal group partitioning. Our algorithm features a truncated absorb-eject move, which is a novel adaptation of an idea commonly used in collapsed samplers, within the context of MFMs. Another aspect of our work is that we illustrate our results on 3-dimensional latent spaces, maintaining clear visualizations while achieving more flexibility than 2-dimensional models. The performance of this approach is illustrated via two carefully designed simulation studies, as well as four different publicly available real networks, where some interesting new perspectives are uncovered.</description>

      <title>A Novel Constrained Sampling Method for Efficient Exploration in Materials and Chemical Mixture Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16567v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient exploration of multicomponent material composition spaces is often limited by time and financial constraints, particularly when mixture and synthesis constraints exist. Traditional methods like Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) struggle with constrained problems especially in high dimensions, while emerging approaches like Bayesian optimization (BO) face challenges in early-stage exploration. This article introduces ConstrAined Sequential laTin hypeRcube sampling methOd (CASTRO), an open-source tool designed to address these challenges. CASTRO is optimized for uniform sampling in constrained small- to moderate-dimensional spaces, with scalability to higher dimensions through future adaptations. CASTRO uses a divide-and-conquer strategy to decompose problems into parallel subproblems, improving efficiency and scalability. It effectively handles equality-mixture constraints, ensuring comprehensive design space coverage and leveraging LHS and LHS with multidimensional uniformity (LHSMDU). It also integrates prior experimental knowledge, making it well-suited for efficient exploration within limited budgets. Validation through two material design case studies, a four-dimensional problem with near-uniform distributions and a nine-dimensional problem with additional synthesis constraints, demonstrates CASTRO's effectiveness in exploring constrained design spaces for materials science, pharmaceuticals and chemicals. The software and case studies are available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>BNEM: A Boltzmann Sampler Based on Bootstrapped Noised Energy Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09787v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Developing an efficient sampler capable of generating independent and identically distributed (IID) samples from a Boltzmann distribution is a crucial challenge in scientific research, e.g. molecular dynamics. In this work, we intend to learn neural samplers given energy functions instead of data sampled from the Boltzmann distribution. By learning the energies of the noised data, we propose a diffusion-based sampler, Noised Energy Matching, which theoretically has lower variance and more complexity compared to related works. Furthermore, a novel bootstrapping technique is applied to NEM to balance between bias and variance. We evaluate NEM and BNEM on a 2-dimensional 40 Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and a 4-particle double-well potential (DW-4). The experimental results demonstrate that BNEM can achieve state-of-the-art performance while being more robust.</description>

      <title>CriteoPrivateAd: A Real-World Bidding Dataset to Design Private Advertising Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12103v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the past years, many proposals have emerged in order to address online advertising use-cases without access to third-party cookies. All these proposals leverage some privacy-enhancing technologies such as aggregation or differential privacy. Yet, no public and rich-enough ground truth is currently available to assess the relevancy of aforementioned private advertising frameworks. We are releasing the largest, in terms of number of features, bidding dataset specifically built in alignment with the design of major browser vendors proposals such as Chrome Privacy Sandbox. This dataset, coined CriteoPrivateAd, stands for an anonymised version of Criteo production logs and provides sufficient data to learn bidding models commonly used in online advertising under many privacy constraints (delayed reports, display and user-level differential privacy, user signal quantisation or aggregated reports). We ensured that this dataset, while being anonymised, is able to provide offline results close to production performance of adtech companies including Criteo - making it a relevant ground truth to design private advertising systems. The dataset is available in Hugging Face: https://huggingface.co/datasets/criteo/CriteoPrivateAd.</description>
