      <title>High-contrast double Bragg interferometry via detuning control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose high-contrast Mach-Zehnder atom interferometers based on double Bragg diffraction (DBD) operating under external acceleration. To mitigate differential Doppler shifts and experimental imperfections, we introduce a tri-frequency laser scheme with dynamic detuning control. We evaluate four detuning-control strategies&amp;mdash;conventional DBD, constant detuning, linear detuning sweep (DS-DBD), and a hybrid protocol combining detuning sweep with optimal control theory (OCT)&amp;mdash;using exact numerical simulations and a five-level S-matrix model. The OCT strategy provides the highest robustness, maintaining contrast above 95\% under realistic conditions, while the DS-DBD strategy sustains contrast above 90\% for well-collimated Bose-Einstein condensates. These results offer practical pathways to enhancing DBD-based interferometers for precision quantum sensing and fundamental physics tests.</description>

      <title>Generation of frequency-bin-encoded dual-rail cluster states via time-frequency multiplexing of microwave photonic qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cluster states are a class of multi-qubit entangled states with broad applications such as quantum metrology and one-way quantum computing. Here, we present a protocol to generate frequency-bin-encoded dual-rail cluster states using a superconducting circuit consisting of a fixed-frequency transmon qubit, a resonator and a Purcell filter. We implement time-frequency multiplexing by sequentially emitting co-propagating microwave photons of distinct frequencies. The frequency-bin dual-rail encoding enables erasure detection based on photon occupancy. We characterize the state fidelity using quantum tomography and quantify the multipartite entanglement using the metric of localizable entanglement. Our implementation achieves a state fidelity exceeding 50$\%$ for a cluster state consisting of up to four logical qubits. The localizable entanglement remains across chains of up to seven logical qubits. After discarding the erasure errors, the fidelity exceeds 50% for states with up to eight logical qubits, and the entanglement persists across chains of up to eleven qubits. These results highlight the improved robustness of frequency-bin dual-rail encoding against photon loss compared to conventional single-rail schemes. This work provides a scalable pathway toward high-dimensional entangled state generation and photonic quantum information processing in the microwave domain.</description>

      <title>Reliable high-accuracy error mitigation for utility-scale quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Error mitigation is essential for unlocking the full potential of quantum algorithms and accelerating the timeline toward quantum advantage. As quantum hardware progresses to push the boundaries of classical simulation, efficient and robust error mitigation methods are becoming increasingly important for producing accurate and reliable outputs. We introduce QESEM, a reliable, high-accuracy, characterization-based software implementing efficient, unbiased quasi-probabilistic error mitigation. We explain the innovative components underlying the operation of QESEM and demonstrate its capabilities in the largest utility-scale error mitigation experiment based on an unbiased method. This experiment simulates the kicked transverse field Ising model with far-from-Clifford parameters on an IBM Heron device. We further validate QESEM's versatility across arbitrary quantum circuits and devices through high-accuracy error-mitigated molecular VQE circuits executed on IBM Heron and IonQ trapped-ion devices. Compared with multiple variants of the widely used zero-noise extrapolation method, QESEM consistently achieves higher accuracy. These results mark a significant step forward in accuracy and reliability for running quantum circuits on devices available today across diverse algorithmic applications. Finally, we provide projections of QESEM's performance on near-term devices toward quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Fiber-Free-Space Entanglement Distribution Using Off-the-Shelf Quantum Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement serves as a fundamental resource for quantum technologies, enabling communication and computation tasks that surpass classical limits. Its distribution across networks is essential for interconnecting quantum processors, enabling distributed quantum computing to address complex challenges in areas such as drug discovery, material science, and optimization. In this work, we report the successful distribution of polarization-entangled photon pairs across a campus-scale, three-node quantum network comprising both fiber and free-space optical links. The entire system was built using commercially available components provided by partners within the Netherlands Quantum Ecosystem. This result represents advancements in the technological maturity of quantum communication systems and demonstrates a pathway towards the practical deployment of early-stage quantum networks both on Earth and in space.</description>

      <title>Wireless Josephson parametric amplifier above 20 GHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Operating superconducting qubits at elevated temperatures offers increased cooling power and thus system scalability, but requires suppression of thermal photons to preserve coherence and readout fidelity. This motivates migration to higher operation frequencies, which demands high-frequency amplification with near-quantum-limited noise characteristics for qubit readout. Here, we report the design and experimental realization of a wireless Josephson parametric amplifier (WJPA) operating above 20~GHz. The wireless design eliminates losses and impedance mismatches that become problematic at high frequencies. The WJPA achieves more than 20~dB of gain across a tunable frequency range of 21--23.5~GHz, with a typical dynamic bandwidth of 3~MHz. Through Y-factor measurements and a qubit-based photon number calibration, we show that the amplifier exhibits an added noise of approximately two photons.</description>

      <title>The Role of Entanglement in Quantum Reservoir Computing with Coupled Kerr Nonlinear Oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Reservoir Computing (QRC) uses quantum dynamics to efficiently process temporal data. In this work, we investigate a QRC framework based on two coupled Kerr nonlinear oscillators, a system well-suited for time-series prediction tasks due to its complex nonlinear interactions and potentially high-dimensional state space. We explore how its performance in time-series prediction depends on key physical parameters: input drive strength, Kerr nonlinearity, and oscillator coupling, and analyze the role of entanglement in improving the reservoir's computational performance, focusing on its effect on predicting non-trivial time series. Using logarithmic negativity to quantify entanglement and normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) to evaluate predictive accuracy, our results suggest that entanglement provides a computational advantage on average-up to a threshold in the input frequency-that persists under some levels of dissipation and dephasing. In particular, we find that higher dissipation rates can enhance performance. While the entanglement advantage manifests as improvements in both average and worst-case performance, it does not lead to improvements in the best-case error. These findings contribute to the broader understanding of quantum reservoirs for high performance, efficient quantum machine learning and time-series forecasting.</description>

      <title>Quantum Control of Thermal Emission from Photonic Crystals with Two-Level Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal light engineering is a field of considerable interest and potential. We study quantum light-matter interactions in a one-dimensional photonic crystal with two-level atoms as the active medium, replacing classical oscillators in traditional blackbody models. In a thermal bath with pumping, these atoms modulate thermal emission via interactions with photonic modes. The model with quantum two-level systems enables the processes of spontaneous emission, stimulated absorption, and stimulated emission. Equilibrium and nonequilibrium regimes depend on competition between pumping and thermal relaxation rates. Strong light-matter interaction and photon decay govern dynamics and steady states. In equilibrium, with a high thermal relaxation rate, photon numbers are initially determined by spontaneous emission and later stabilize due to stimulated absorption, influenced by light-matter interaction strength. In-band-gap photons reach steady states at a time scale of one or two orders of magnitude longer than outside-band-gap photons. Interestingly, for a strong light-matter interaction, all photons in the equilibrium regimes show Planckian radiation, regardless of their frequencies in or out of the band gaps. Band-gap suppression of thermal emission is more pronounced with weaker light-matter interaction or larger photon decay. In the nonequilibrium regime, the dynamics of photon numbers exhibit a multi-time-scale process transitioning to steady states due to strong pumping and stimulated processes. Steady-state electron populations of two-level atoms deviate from the Fermi-Dirac distribution, and the steady-state photon numbers exhibit super-Planckian emission. These findings enable quantum control of thermal emission spectra, which is relevant for reducing thermal noise in quantum computing or enhancing radiative cooling.</description>

      <title>Learning to Restore Heisenberg Limit in Noisy Quantum Sensing via Quantum Digital Twin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum sensors leverage nonclassical resources to achieve sensing precision at the Heisenberg limit, surpassing the standard quantum limit attainable through classical strategies. However, a critical issue is that the environmental noise induces rapid decoherence, fundamentally limiting the realizability of the Heisenberg limit. In this Letter, we propose a quantum digital twin protocol to overcome this issue. The protocol first establishes observable-constrained state reconstruction to infer random errors in the decoherence process, and then utilizes reinforcement learning to derive adaptive compensatory control strategies. Demonstrated across discrete, continuous variable and multi-qubit circuit systems, our approach bypasses quantum state tomography's exponential overhead and discovers optimal control schemes to restore the Heisenberg limit. Unlike quantum error correction or mitigation schemes requiring precise noise characterization and ancillary qubits, our autonomous protocol achieves noise-resilient sensing through environment-adaptive control sequencing. This work establishes quantum digital twin as a generic methodology for quantum control, proposing a noise-immune paradigm for next-generation quantum sensors compatible with NISQ-era experimental constraints.</description>

      <title>Sunlight-Excited Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion for Quantum Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum imaging, which harnesses quantum correlations to achieve imaging with multiple advantages over classical optics, has been in development for several years. Here, we explore sunlight, serving as the pump beam, to excite spontaneous parametric down-conversion to get the quantum correlation of two photons. Remarkably, our investigations disclose that the photon pairs produced from sunlight are well correlated in position such that they can be used for quantum imaging. Consequently, this demonstrates a latent application scenario in which the incoherent beam is harnessed as the pump source for quantum imaging. Our research is of substantial significance as it broadens the scope of available illumination options, such as using scattering light or non-traditional artificial incoherent light sources, for quantum information, a prime potential application being a space-based quantum information mechanism where this approach allows the system to operate independently of a laser.</description>

      <title>Fault-tolerant mixed boundary punctures on the toric code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Defects on the toric code, a well-known exactly solvable Abelian anyon model, can exhibit non-Abelian statistical properties, which can be classified into punctures and twists. Benhemou et al.[Phys. Rev. A. 105, 042417 (2022)] introduced a mixed boundary puncture model that integrates the advantages of both punctures and twists. They proposed that non-Abelian properties could be realized in the symmetric subspace {$|++\rangle$, $|--\rangle$}. This work demonstrates that the nontrivial antisymmetric subspace{$|+-\rangle$, $|-+\rangle$} also supports non-Abelian statistics. The mixed boundary puncture model is shown to be fault-tolerant in both subspaces, offering resistance to collective dephasing noise and collective rotation noise. In addition, we propose and validate a quantum information masking scheme within the three-partite mixed boundary puncture model.</description>

      <title>Multi-QIDA method for VQE state preparation in molecular systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of quantum algorithms and their application to quantum chemistry has introduced new opportunities for solving complex molecular problems that are computationally infeasible for classical methods. In quantum chemistry, the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm designed to estimate ground-state energies of molecular systems. Despite its promise, VQE faces challenges such as scalability issues, high circuit depths, and barren plateaus that make the optimization of the variational wavefunction. To mitigate these challenges, the Quantum Information Driven Ansatz (QIDA) leverages Quantum Mutual Information (QMI) to construct compact, correlation-driven circuits. In this work, we go back to the original field of application of QIDA, by applying the already defined Multi-Threshold Quantum Information Driven Ansatz (Multi-QIDA) methodology on Molecular Systems. to systematically construct shallow, layered quantum circuits starting from approximate QMI matrices obtained by Quantum Chemistry calculations. The Multi-QIDA approach combines efficient creation of the QMI map, reduction of the number of correlators required by exploiting Minimum/Maximum spanning tress, and an iterative layer-wise VQE optimization routine. These enhancements allow the method to recover missing correlations in molecular systems while maintaining computational efficiency. Additionally, the approach incorporates alternative gate constructions, such as SO(4) correlators, to enhance the circuit expressibility without significantly increasing the circuit complexity. We benchmark Multi-QIDA on systems ranging from small molecules like H2O, BeH2, and NH3 in Iterative Natural Orbitals (INOs) basis set, to active-space models such as H2O-6-31G-CAS(4,4) and N2-cc-pVTZ-CAS(6,6), comparing it to traditional hardware-efficient ansatze.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic quantum technologies have become pivotal in the implementation of communication, imaging and computing modalities. Among these applications, quantum ghost imaging (GI) exploits photon correlations to surpass classical limits, with recent advances in spatial-mode encoding and phase imaging. In parallel, all-optical computing offers powerful, passive-light processing capabilities. Here, we explore the intersection of these domains, revealing a conceptual and operational link between GI and Grover's quantum search algorithm (GSA) which is designed to search for elements in an unstructured database. Here, the elements are encoded as phases in the position basis states of photons. To show this, we use entangled photon pairs, with one photon encoding the oracle features while the other photon is used to find the marked element.</description>

      <title>Spectral characterizations of entanglement witnesses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic investigation of the spectral properties of entanglement witnesses (EWs). Specifically, we analyze the infimum and supremum of the largest eigenvalue, the smallest eigenvalue, the negativity (defined as the absolute value of the sum of negative eigenvalues), and the squared Frobenius norm of a unit-trace (normalized) entanglement witness, along with the conditions under which these values are attained. Our study provides distinct characterizations for decomposable (DEWs) and nondecomposable entanglement witnesses (NDEWs). While these two classes share many spectral similarities, we reveal a fundamental divergence by proving that the infimum of the smallest eigenvalue can be attained by DEWs, yet remains strictly unattainable for all NDEWs. We apply the results to provide necessary conditions for an EW to possess a mirrored EW. Furthermore, we demonstrate the superior detection capability of NDEWs by proving that any non-positive-transpose (NPT) state beyond the two-qubit and qubit-qutrit systems can be detected by an NDEW.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Enhanced Sensing of Excited-State Dynamics with Correlated Photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The squeezed photons, as a quantum-correlated light with reduced noise, have emerged as a great resource for sensing the structures of matter. Here we study the transient absorption (TA) scheme using the squeezed photons whose spectral correlation of amplitudes can be tailored. A microscopic theory is developed, revealing a highly time-energy-resolved nature of the signal that is not attainable by conventional TA scheme. Such a capability is elaborated by applying to monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide materials (TMDs), achieving a real-time monitoring of valley excitons and their dynamics. Moreover, we show the intermediate squeezing regime-not the strong squeezing-which the time-resolved spectroscopy is in favor of. Our work offers a new paradigm for studying nonequilibrium dynamics of matter, in light of the photocatalysis and optoelectronics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum batteries utilize quantum effects to enhance energy storage and work extraction, offering promising avenues for nanoscale energy applications. However, environmental noise poses a significant challenge by degrading stored energy. For a single qubit, we show that amplitude damping and bit-flip noises lead to ergotropy loss, while phase-flip noise permits partial preservation of work. Extending to a two-qubit Heisenberg XYZ model with Dzyaloshinsky-Moria interaction (DMI), we identify a critical interaction strength that enhances energy retention. We show that strong DMI and initial coherence protects ergotropy even under repeated noise applications, highlighting chiral spin interactions as a resource for noise-resilient quantum batteries.</description>

      <title>A solution of the quantum time of arrival problem via mathematical probability theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time of arrival refers to the time a particle takes after emission to impinge upon a suitably idealized detector surface. Within quantum theory, no generally accepted solution exists so far for the corresponding probability distribution of arrival times. In this work we derive a general solution for a single body without spin impacting on a so called ideal detector in the absence of any other forces or obstacles. A solution of the so called screen problem for this case is also given. We construct the ideal detector model via mathematical probability theory, which in turn suggests an adaption of the Madelung equations in this instance. This detector model assures that the probability flux through the detector surface is always positive, so that the corresponding distributions can be derived via an approach originally suggested by Daumer, D\"urr, Goldstein, and Zangh\`i. The resulting dynamical model is, strictly speaking, not compatible with quantum mechanics, yet it is well-described within geometric quantum theory. Geometric quantum theory is a novel adaption of quantum mechanics, which makes the latter consistent with mathematical probability theory. Implications to the general theory of measurement and avenues for future research are also provided. Future mathematical work should focus on finding an appropriate distributional formulation of the evolution equations and studying the well-posedness of the corresponding Cauchy problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biphoton systems exhibiting entanglement in position-momentum variables, known as spatial entanglement, are among the most intriguing and well-studied phenomena in quantum optics. A notable subset of these are phase entangled states, where entanglement manifests purely through correlations in the spatial phase of the wavefunction. While the generation of such states from biphotons via spontaneous parametric down-conversion has been explored, their physical implications and applications remain under-investigated. In this work, we theoretically and experimentally examine a unique form of phase entanglement known as `pure' phase entanglement. This state exhibits the unusual feature that the position of one photon is correlated with the momentum of the other. Unlike typical spatially entangled states, it shows no direct correlation in position or momentum between the two photons, underscoring that all correlations arise purely from the spatial phase of the wavefunction. We delve deeper into the theory of this state and experimentally construct it from known phase-entangled states. To certify its properties, we propose a setup that performs a "one-particle momentum measurement" and explore the various tunable parameters. We also highlight potential applications of this state in quantum optics and imaging experiments.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Permanent Dipoles on Dark States in Molecular Dimers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many organic molecules possess large permanent dipole moments that differ depending on the electronic state. These permanent dipoles influence both intermolecular coupling and interactions with the optical fields, yet they are often neglected in typical theoretical quantum optics treatments. Here, we investigate the optical properties and their effect on dark states of dimers possessing such permanent dipoles. We show that when monomers have excitation-dependent permanent dipoles, optical transitions between the bright and dark states of the dimer are enabled. We investigate how permanent dipoles allow for the existence of static driving terms between the ground and excited states of each monomer. In turn, these can cause the excited states of the monomers to couple indirectly to the zero excitation state of the dimer. This leads to interference between permanent and transition dipoles and can result in the formation of dark states that are entirely localised. Furthermore, dark states formed through indirect coupling exhibit enhanced robustness against energy level fluctuations, which may improve the efficiency of the design of photovoltaic devices.</description>

Abstract: We experimentally observe and theoretically explain anisotropic multiple quantum coherence signals in the fluorescence from dilute thermal potassium vapors, at room temperature and particle densities $\sim 10^8\ \rm{cm}^{-3}$. We identify the retarded part of the geometrically fully resolved inter-atomic, resonant dipole-dipole interaction as the crucial ingredient to theoretically reproduce all qualitative features of the experimental spectra.</description>

      <title>Random Unitaries in Constant (Quantum) Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random unitaries are a central object of study in quantum information, with applications to quantum computation, quantum many-body physics, and quantum cryptography. Recent work has constructed unitary designs and pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs) using $\Theta(\log \log n)$-depth unitary circuits with two-qubit gates.
  In this work, we show that unitary designs and PRUs can be efficiently constructed in several well-studied models of $\textit{constant-time}$ quantum computation (i.e., the time complexity on the quantum computer is independent of the system size). These models are constant-depth circuits augmented with certain nonlocal operations, such as (a) many-qubit TOFFOLI gates, (b) many-qubit FANOUT gates, or (c) mid-circuit measurements with classical feedforward control. Recent advances in quantum computing hardware suggest experimental feasibility of these models in the near future.
  Our results demonstrate that unitary designs and PRUs can be constructed in much weaker circuit models than previously thought. Furthermore, our construction of PRUs in constant-depth with many-qubit TOFFOLI gates shows that, under cryptographic assumptions, there is no polynomial-time learning algorithm for the circuit class $\mathsf{QAC}^0$. Finally, our results suggest a new approach towards proving that PARITY is not computable in $\mathsf{QAC}^0$, a long-standing question in quantum complexity theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relativistic thermal devices offer a unique platform for understanding the interplay between motion, quantum fields, and thermodynamics, revealing phenomena inaccessible to stationary systems. We consider a two-qubit SWAP heat engine whose working medium consists of inertially moving Unruh-DeWitt qubit detectors, each coupled to a scalar quantum field in thermal equilibrium at a distinct temperature. Relativistic motion causes the qubits to perceive frequency-dependent effective temperatures that are either hotter or colder than their respective reservoir temperature. We show that the relativistic temperature shift, perhaps the qubit velocity, can be harnessed as a thermodynamic resource to enhance the work output and the efficiency at maximum power of the heat engine. We derive a generalized second law for a heat engine with a moving working medium and demonstrate that it can exceed the standard Carnot bound defined by rest-frame temperatures.</description>

      <title>Dependence of the recoherence times and recoherence increments on the state of phonon bath in a single qubit dephasing model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recoherence times $t^*$ and the maximum values of the recoherence increments $\gamma_{\rm extr}$ are studied as functions of the bath parameters for a single qubit dephasing model, prepared initially by a special kind of the non-selective measurements. The recoherence/decoherence events (RDE), occurring at the initial stage of the system evolution, are found to be both similar and different from the system dynamics at large times. For instance, in contrast to the RDE observed on large time scales, the sub-Ohmic and Ohmic coupling regimes are more favourable for the short-time recoherence than the super-Ohmic one. On the other hand, the short-time behaviour of the recoherence and the long-time dynamics of the decoherence are closely related: the domain of the ohmicity indexes, where the decoherence changes its type (from the complete to incomplete one), is, simultaneously, that of the weakest recoherence. The obtained results give us some hints about the basic characteristics of the environment, which might provide the most optimal values of $t^*$ and $\gamma_{\rm extr}$ in some sense.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulation of Collective Neutrino Oscillations in Dense Neutrino Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inside dense neutrino gases, such as neutron star mergers or core-collapse supernovae, collective neutrino effects cause the transformation of one neutrino flavour into another. Due to strong neutrino self-interactions in these environments, there is prevalence of flavour swapping. Considering these environments to be isotropic and homogeneous, we present a study of collective neutrino oscillations by simulating such a system on a noisy quantum simulator (Qiskit AerSimulator) and a quantum processor (ibm\_brisbane). We model the effective Hamiltonian governing neutrino interactions and by applying the Trotter-Suzuki approximation, decompose it into a tractable form suitable for quantum circuit implementation of the time-evolution propagator. Encoding the neutrino state for a system of two- and three-neutrinos onto qubits, we compute the time evolution of the inversion probability relative to the initial product state. Furthermore, we present quantum circuits to evaluate the concurrence as a measure of entanglement between the neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Gapped spinful phases obtained via Gutzwiller projections of Euler states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gutzwiller projections of non-interacting chiral topological phases are known to give rise to fractional, topologically ordered chiral phases. Here, we carry out a similar construction using two copies of non-interacting Euler insulators to produce a class of spinful interacting Euler models. To that end, we take advantage of the recently discovered exact representation of certain Euler insulators by a projected entangled pair state (PEPS) of bond dimension $D = 2$. The Gutzwiller projection can be implemented within the tensor network formalism, giving rise to a new PEPS of bond dimension $D = 4$. We, moreover, apply very recent state-of-the-art tensor network tools to evaluate these phases. In particular, we analyze its entanglement entropy scaling and find no topological correction to the area law, indicating that the state is not intrinsically topologically ordered. Its entanglement spectrum shows a clear cusp at momentum zero, similar to non-interacting Euler insulators, and the spectrum of the transfer operator indicates that the state is gapped, which could imply non-intrinsic topological features. Finally, the static structure factor displays Bragg peaks, indicating the simultaneous presence of local order.</description>

      <title>Suppression of coherent light scattering in a three-dimensional atomic array</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how atoms collectively interact with light is not only important for fundamental science, but also crucial for designing light-matter interfaces in quantum technologies. Over the past decades, numerous studies have focused on arranging atoms in ordered arrays and using constructive (destructive) interference to enhance (suppress) the coupling to electromagnetic fields, thereby tailoring collective light-matter interactions. These studies have mainly focused on one- and two-dimensional arrays. However, only three-dimensional (3D) arrays can demonstrate destructive interference of coherent light scattering in all directions. This omnidirectional suppression of coherent light scattering in 3D atomic arrays has thus far not been experimentally demonstrated. Here, we observe a strong reduction of light scattering in a 3D atomic array prepared in the form of a Mott insulator in optical lattices. The residual light scattering is shown to be caused by the delocalization of atoms, Raman scattering, and inelastic scattering associated with saturation. We also demonstrate how light scattering can be a sensitive probe for density fluctuations in many-body states in optical lattices, enabling us to characterize the superfluid-to-Mott insulator phase transition as well as defects generated by dynamical parameter ramps. The results of our work can be used to prepare subradiant states for photon storage and probe correlations for many-body systems in optical lattices.</description>

      <title>Addressing Local Realism through Bell Tests at Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the most notable aspects of quantum systems is that their components can exhibit correlations much stronger than those allowed by classical physics. Two examples of quantum correlations are quantum entanglement and Bell nonlocality, but generally there is a hierarchy of many types of quantum correlations. Among these correlations, Bell nonlocality holds a special place because it plays a dual role in distinguishing theories where local realism is a valid description. A Bell test, which is a test of local realism, typically needs to be augmented with assumptions to address possible loopholes in the experimental setup. In this work, we study Bell tests in experiments in which the detector reports the correct outcome with a specified probability. This mirrors the situation at high-energy colliders, where particle spins are not measured directly but inferred from the angular distributions of their decay products. We show that, in this setup, a test of local realism is not possible. Quantum correlations, however, are still present, measurable, and informative in high-energy colliders.</description>

      <title>Spontaneously Broken Non-Invertible Symmetries in Transverse-Field Ising Qudit Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: \usepackage{iopams} Recent developments have revealed that symmetries need not form a group, but instead can be non-invertible. Here we use analytical arguments and numerical evidence to illuminate how spontaneous symmetry breaking of a non-invertible symmetry is similar yet distinct from ordinary, invertible, symmetry breaking. We consider one-dimensional chains of group-valued qudits, whose local Hilbert space is spanned by elements of a finite group $G$ (reducing to ordinary qubits when $G=\mathbb{Z}_2$). We construct Ising-type transverse-field Hamiltonians with Rep($G$) symmetry whose generators multiply according to the tensor product of irreducible representations (irreps) of the group $G$. For non-Abelian $G$, the symmetry is non-invertible. In the symmetry broken phase there is one ground state per irrep on a closed chain. The symmetry breaking can be detected by local order parameters but, unlike the invertible case, different ground states have distinct entanglement patterns. We show that for each irrep of dimension greater than one the corresponding ground state exhibits string order, entanglement spectrum degeneracies, and has gapless edge modes on an open chain -- features usually associated with symmetry-protected topological order. Consequently, domain wall excitations behave as one-dimensional non-Abelian anyons with non-trivial internal Hilbert spaces and fusion rules. Our work identifies properties of non-invertible symmetry breaking that existing quantum hardware can probe.</description>

      <title>Chiral Phonons in Graphyne</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral phonons, quantized lattice vibrations with circular polarization and non-zero angular momentum, offer new perspectives for phononic and quantum device engineering. Graphyne could be a promising candidate due to its unique lattice geometry, valley-structured electronic bands, and thermal transport capabilities. However, chiral phonons in graphyne remain unexplored owing to the existence of inversion ($\mathscr{P}$) and time-reversal ($\mathscr{T}$) symmetries. Herein, we have demonstrated the existence of chiral phonons in graphynes, achieved by breaking combined $\mathscr{PT}$ symmetry through atomic-selective substitutional doping. We find that the B, N, dopants and ortho BN co-dopant in 6-6-12 and $\gamma$-graphynes induce localized structural deformations. These deformations lift phonon degeneracies away from $\Gamma$ point and give rise to circularly polarized vibrational modes. We further established a strong correlation between chiral phonon angular momentum and electron affinity of dopants. Electron-rich dopants increase local electron density which could enable chiral phonon modes to couple more effectively with electronic environment. This in turn increases phonon angular momentum, indicating potential role of electron-phonon interactions in angular momentum modulation of chiral phonons. Our prosposed approach provides a tunable route for controlling chiral phonon behavior, paving way for development of advanced phononic devices.</description>

      <title>Circulation Statistics and Migdal Area Rule Beyond the Kibble-Zurek Mechanism in a Newborn Bose-Einstein Condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM) predicts that a newly formed superfluid prepared by a finite-time thermal quench is populated with vortices. The universality of vortex number statistics, beyond KZM, enables the characterization of circulation statistics within any region of area $A$ enclosed by a loop $C$. Migdal's minimal area rule of classical turbulence predicts that the probability density function of circulation around a closed contour is independent of the contour's shape. We verify the Migdal area rule for small loops with respect to the distance between the vortex and antivortex pairs and further characterize its universal breakdown for bigger loops. We further uncovered the nonequilibrium universality dictated by the KZM dynamics, which results in power-law scalings of the moments of the circulation statistics as a function of the quench time.</description>

Abstract: The quantum expectation value and the stationary noise spectral density for a Fabri-P\'erot gravitational-wave detector with a DC readout scheme are discussed in detail only through the quantum electrodynamics of lasers and the Heisenberg equations of mirrors' motion. We demonstrate that the initial conditions of the mirrors' motion concentrate around the fundamental frequency of the pendulum and are not related to the frequency range of our interest. Although in the ideal case, there is a consensus that the shot noise for the laser in the high-frequency range in the signal-referred noise spectral density decreases if the injected laser power is increased, our obtained noise spectral density shows that the shot noise does not decrease even if the injected laser power is increased. This is due to the leakage of the classical radiation pressure forces from the classical carrier field to the output port, and the classical carrier field is used as the reference in the DC readout scheme. Since the classical radiation pressure forces affect the mirror motion as a classical constant force, this classical constant force changes the equilibrium point of the pendulum of mirrors' motion. To recover the ideal case, we must consider adjusting the interferometer's tuning point to place the mirrors in equilibrium points. We investigate the case where the equilibrium tuning is incomplete and show that the behavior of the above shot noise is due to this incompleteness. We also discuss the maximal deviation of the mirror displacements from the equilibrium point in the incomplete tuning to recover the near ideal case.</description>

      <title>Tilted Material in an Optical Cavity: Light-Matter Moir\'e Effect and Coherent Frequency Conversion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exciton-polaritons formed inside optical cavities offer a highly tunable platform for exploring novel quantum phenomena. Here, we introduce and theoretically characterize a light-matter moir\'e effect (LMME) that arises when a 2D material is tilted inside a planar optical cavity, in contrast to stacking multiple layers at a twist angle as is done in forming 2D moir\'e hetero-structures. We show that this geometric tilt produces emergent periodicity in the light-matter coupling, yielding displaced replicas of the polariton dispersion and flat bands near the Brillouin-zone center. Through time-dependent quantum dynamical simulations, we demonstrate that LMME enables coherent frequency conversion and remains robust against phonon-induced decoherence. Our findings establish LMME as a new platform for engineering polariton band structures, the generation of flat bands and performing coherent frequency conversion relevant for developing polariton-based quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Dissipation-Induced Steady States in Topological Superconductors: Mechanisms and Design Principles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The search for conditions supporting degenerate steady states in nonequilibrium topological superconductors is important for advancing dissipative quantum engineering, a field that has attracted significant research attention over the past decade. In this study, we address this problem by investigating topological superconductors hosting unpaired Majorana modes under the influence of environmental dissipative fields. Within the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad framework and the third quantization formalism, we establish a correspondence between equilibrium Majorana zero modes and non-equilibrium kinetic zero modes. We further derive a simple algebraic relation between the numbers of these excitations expressed in terms of hybridization between the single-particle wavefunctions and linear dissipative fields. Based on these findings, we propose a practical recipes how to stabilize degenerate steady states in topological superconductors through controlled dissipation engineering. To demonstrate their applicability, we implement our general framework in the BDI-class Kitaev chain with long-range hopping and pairing terms -- a system known to host a robust edge-localized Majorana modes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We build the case that our published chiral soliton model [Phys. Rev. Lett. 124, 250402 (2019)] can lead to a genuine quantum time crystal for smaller atom numbers. To do this we compare results from the chiral soliton model with exact numerical solutions for the ground state of the three-particle Schr\"odinger equation in the limit that the spatial profile of the soliton is largely independent of its center-of-mass motion. The connection between the two approaches is found via the Page-Wootters mechanism, and this is what allows for dynamical evolution even in the quantum ground state, as required for a genuine quantum time crystal.</description>

      <title>Unified Field-integral Thermodynamics of Bose Mixtures: Stability and Critical Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a unified thermodynamic framework for Bose mixtures at finite temperatures based on the functional field integral, within which the decision on whether to discard the anomalous densities, when determining the density configuration and stability matrix, yields distinct theories. Beyond the existing Hartree-Fock approximation and Ota-Giorgini-Stringari theory, retaining the anomalous densities throughout will provide a completely self-consistent thermodynamic description, requiring the combination of the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov approximation and the representative statistical ensemble. Comparing three approaches for predicting magnetic susceptibility, we highlight the role of anomalous densities in stabilizing superfluid mixtures. We further unveil that Feshbach coupling can either expand the regime of atomic and molecular superfluids, or induce a phase transition to a pure molecular superfluid, depending on their density ratio. Importantly, we show that thermal fluctuations will trigger a phase transition from stable to unstable mixtures, where anomalous densities can serve as distinct signatures for experimental observation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accurate prediction of temperature-dependent magnetization dynamics is a fundamental challenge in computational magnetism. While Atomistic Spin Dynamics (ASD) simulations have emerged as a powerful tool for studying magnetic phenomena, their classical nature leads to significant deviations from experimental observations, particularly at low temperatures. Here we present a comprehensive implementation of quantum-corrected ASD into the Vampire software package, based on the open-system Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation with a quantum thermostat. Our implementation incorporates memory effects along with colored noise derived from quantum-mechanical considerations that improve the description of the equilibrium magnetization. We demonstrate excellent quantitative agreement with experimental magnetization curves for nickel and gadolinium across the full temperature range. Our results establish that incorporating quantum environmental effects and colored noise substantially enhances the predictive capabilities of ASD simulations, providing a robust framework for modeling temperature-dependent magnetic phenomena in localized moment magnetic systems.</description>

      <title>Exceptionally deficient topological square-root insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the most surprising features of effectively non-Hermitian physical systems is their potential to exhibit a striking nonlinear response and fragility to small perturbations. This feature arises from spectral singularities known as exceptional points, whose realization in the spectrum typically requires fine-tuning of parameters. The design of such systems receives significant impetus from the recent conception of \emph{exceptional deficiency}, in which the entire energy spectrum is composed of exceptional points. Here, we present a concrete and transparent mechanism that enforces exceptional deficiency through lattice sum rules in non-Hermitian topological square-root insulators. We identify the resulting dynamical signatures in static broadband amplification and non-Abelian adiabatic state amplification, differentiate between bulk and boundary effects, and outline routes to implementation in physical platforms</description>

      <title>A non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with the energy levels of free parafermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using a parent Hermitian tight-binding model on a bipartite lattice with chiral symmetry, we theoretically generate non-Hermitian models for free fermions with $p$ orbitals per unit cell satisfying a complex generalization of chiral symmetry. The $p$ complex energy bands in $k$ space are given by a common $k$-dependent real factor, determined by the bands of the parent model, multiplied by the $p$th roots of unity. When the parent model is the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, the single-particle energy levels are the same as those of free parafermion solutions to Baxter's non-Hermitian clock model. This construction relies on fully unidirectional hopping to create Bloch Hamiltonians with the form of generalized permutation matrices, but we also describe the effect of partial unidirectional hopping. For fully bidirectional hopping, the Bloch Hamiltonians are Hermitian and may be separated into even and odd parity blocks with respect to inversion of the orbitals within the unit cell. Partially unidirectional hopping breaks the inversion symmetry and mixes the even and odd blocks, and the real energy spectrum evolves into a complex one as the degree of unidirectionality increases, with details determined by the topology of the parent model and the number of orbitals per unit cell, $p$. We describe this process in detail for $p=3$ and $p=4$ with the SSH model. We also apply our approach to graphene, and show that $AA$-stacked bilayer graphene evolves into a square root Hamiltonian of monolayer graphene with the introduction of unidirectional hopping. We show that higher-order exceptional points occur at edge states and solitons in the non-Hermitian SSH model, and at the Dirac point of non-Hermitian graphene.</description>

      <title>Bound State Internal Interactions as a Mechanism for Exponential Decay</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.14875v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We hypothesize that the binding interactions among the components of bound systems and the background fields, sometimes known as virtual particle exchange, affect the state of the systems as do typical scattering interactions. Then with the assumption that the interior environment of unstable particles is disordered, we derive in the limit of continuous binding both an exactly exponential non-decay probability and Fermi's Golden Rule for the decay rates. The result suggests resolutions to several long-standing theoretical challenges associated with exponential decay in quantum mechanics, without appealing directly to non-Hermitian, approximate Hamiltonians or complex energies. It also contributes to a conceptual understanding of the continuum between controlled interactions that induce deviations from exponential decay, such as those in the Quantum Zeno Effect, and the uncontrolled internal dynamics of excited atoms and nuclei, which exhibit no such deviations. Finally, we examine how the binding interactions responsible for the general exponential character of decay for bound systems differ from the couplings with decay products that control decay rates, providing insight into challenges in quantum computing and information processing.</description>

      <title>Hierarchies among Genuine Multipartite Entangling Capabilities of Quantum Gates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.06574v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We classify quantum gates according to their capability to generate genuine multipartite entanglement (GME), using a hierarchy based on multipartite separable states. In particular, when a fixed unitary operator acts on the set of k-separable states, the maximal genuine multipartite entanglement content produced via that particular unitary operator is determined after maximizing over the set of k-separable input states. We identify unitary operators that are beneficial for generating high GME when the input states are entangled in some bipartition, although the picture can also be reversed, where such initial entanglement offers no advantage. We investigate the maximum entangling power of a broad range of unitary operators, encompassing special classes of quantum gates, as well as diagonal, permutation, and Haar-uniformly generated unitaries by computing generalized geometric measure (GGM) as a GME quantifier. Additionally, we observe a notable distinction in entangling power based on the nature of the input states: when maximization is restricted to separable states with real coefficients, the entangling power is lower than when the optimization is carried out over arbitrary separable states with complex coefficients, thereby highlighting the role of complex amplitudes in entanglement creation. Furthermore, we determine which unitary operators, along with their corresponding optimal inputs, yield output states with the highest achievable GGM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02858v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum teleportation is not merely a fascinating corollary of quantum entanglement, it also finds utility in quantum processing and circuit compilation. In this paper, we measure and track the entanglement and fidelity of two-qubit states prepared on a 127-qubit IBM Quantum device, as one of the qubits is teleported across 19 qubits. We design, evaluate and compare two distinct approaches to teleportation: post-selected measurement categorisation and dynamic circuit corrections based on mid-circuit measurements, and compare with direct state transportation using SWAP gates. By optimally choosing the teleportation path which exhibits the highest total negativity entanglement measure across nearest-neighbour pairs, we show the entanglement of a two-qubit graph state is sustained after at least 19 hops in teleportation using the post-selection approach and 17 hops using the dynamic circuit approach. We observe a higher level of teleported entanglement in paths determined from two-qubit negativities compared to those obtained from gate errors, demonstrating an advantage in using the negativity map over the gate error map for compiling quantum circuits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23845v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian (NH) skin effect is a truly NH feature, which manifests itself as an accumulation of states, known as skin states, on the boundaries of a system. In this perspective, we discuss several aspects of the NH skin effect focusing on the most interesting facets of this phenomenon. Beyond reviewing necessary requirements to see the NH skin effect, we discuss the NH skin effect as a topological effect that can be seen as a manifestation of a truly NH bulk-boundary correspondence, stemming from the spectral topology, and show how skin states can be distinguished from topological boundary states. As most theoretical work has focused on studying the NH skin effect in one-dimensional non-interacting systems, recent developments of studying this effect in higher dimensions as well as in many-body systems are highlighted. Lastly, experimental signatures and applications are discussed, and an outlook is provided.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07092v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the bitstring probabilities of ground states of bipartitioned ladders of Rydberg atoms, we calculate the mutual information, which is a lower bound on the corresponding bipartite von Neumann quantum entanglement entropy $S^{vN}_A$. We show that in many cases these lower bounds can be improved by removing the bitstrings with a probability lower than some value $p_{min}$ and renormalizing the remaining probabilities (filtering). We propose a heuristic based on the change of the conditional entropy under filtering that very effectively improves the estimate of $S^{vN}_A$. We consider various sizes, lattice spacings and bipartitions. Our numerical investigation suggest that the filtered mutual information obtained with samples having just a few thousand bitstrings can provide reasonably close estimates of $S^{vN}_A$. We briefly discuss practical implementations with QuEra's Aquila device.</description>

      <title>Topological quantum compilation of metaplectic anyons based on the genetic optimized algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01745v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological quantum computing holding global anti-interference ability is realized by braiding some anyons, such as well-known Fibonacci anyons. Here, based on $SO(3)_2 $ theory we obtain a total of 6 anyon models utilizing \textit{F}-matrices, \textit{R}-symbols, and fusion rules of metaplectic anyon.We obtain the elementary braiding matrices (EBMs) by means of unconventional encoding. After braiding \textit{X} and $X^\prime$, we insert a pair of \textit{Z} anyons into them to ensure that the initial order of anyons remains unchanged. In this process only fusion is required, and measurement is not necessary. Three of them $\{V^{113}_3,V^{131}_3,V^{133}_1\}$ are studied in detail. We study systematically the compilation of these three models through EBMs obtained analytically. For one-qubit case, the classical \textit{H}- and \textit{T}-gate can be well constructed using the genetic algorithm enhanced Solovay-Kitaev algorithm (GA-enhanced SKA) by $\{V^{113}_3,V^{131}_3,V^{133}_1\}$. The obtained accuracy of the \textit{H}/\textit{T}-gate by $\{V^{113}_3,V^{133}_1\}$ is slightly inferior to the corresponding gates of the Fibonacci anyon model, but it also can meet the requirements of fault-tolerant quantum computing, $V^{131}_3$ giving the best performance of these four models. For the two-qubit case, we use the exhaustive method for short lengths and the GA for long lengths to obtain braidword for $\{V^{113}_3,V^{131}_3,V^{133}_1\}$ models. The resulting matrices can well approximate the local equivalence class of the CNOT-gate, while demonstrating a much smaller error than the Fibonacci model, especially for the $V^{113}_3$.The braiding processes of conventional encoding (using identical anyons) and unconventional encoding (using distinct anyons) are compared. Finally, we attempt to generalize the model to the \textit{N}-qubit case.</description>

In the context of shared quantum computing, it is challenging to mitigate the crosstalk effect between quantum computations being simultaneously run by multiple users since the exact spatio-temporal gate distributions are not apparent due to privacy concerns. It is therefore important to develop techniques for accurate detection and mitigation of crosstalk to enable high-fidelity quantum computing. Assuming prior knowledge of crosstalk parameters, we propose a time-adaptive detection method leveraging spectator qubits and multiple quantum coherence to amplify crosstalk-induced perturbations. We demonstrate its utility in detecting random sparsely distributed crosstalk within a time window. Our work evaluates its performance in two scenarios: simulation using an artificial noise model with gate-induced crosstalk and always-on idlings channels; and the simulation using noise sampled from an IBM quantum computer parametrised by the reduced HSA error model. The presented results show our method's efficacy hinges on the dominance of single-qubit coherent noise across channels, and the impact of angle mismatching is suppressed as spectator qubits increase. From simulation using real-device noise parameters, our strategy outperforms the previous constant-frequency detection method of Harper et. al. [arXiv: 2402.02753 (2024)] in the detection success rate, achieving an average detection success probability of $0.852\pm 0.022$ (equally scaled noise channels) and $0.933\pm0.024$ (asymmetrically scaled noise channels) from 1 to 7 crosstalk counts.</description>

      <title>Passive leakage removal unit based on a disordered transmon array</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14391v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Leakage out from the qubit subspace compromises standard quantum error correction protocols and is a challenge for practical quantum computing. We propose a passive leakage removal unit based on an array of coupled disordered transmons and last-site reset by feedback-measurement or dissipation. The transmons have parametric disorder both in frequency and anharmonicity such that the qubit subspace is protected by localization through energy level mismatch while the energy levels for leakage excitations are in resonance for maximized leakage mobility. Leakage excitations propagate through the idle transmons until reaching the last site with feedback-measurement or dissipation removing them. For removing leakage excitations, we find two optimal measurement rates, which are comprehensively understood through two distinct timescales between the propagation and disintegration of leakage excitations. Based only on an array of standard transmon devices, our approach is readily compatible with existing superconducting quantum processor designs under realistic conditions.</description>

Abstract: We present universal building blocks for the quantum integration of generic cross sections in high-energy physics. We make use of Fourier quantum Monte Carlo integration (MCI) as implemented in Quantinuum's quantum MCI engine to provide an extendable methodology for generating efficient circuits that can implement generic cross-section calculations, providing a quadratic speed-up in root mean-squared error convergence with respect to classical MCI. We focus on a concrete example of a $1 \to 3$ decay process to illustrate our work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13364v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Achieving and controlling non-reciprocity in engineered photonic structures is of fundamental interest in science and engineering. Here, we introduce a tunable, non-Hermitian, nonlinear microwave dimer designed to precisely implement phase-non-reciprocal hopping dynamics between two spatially separated cavities at room temperature. Our system incorporates simple components such as three-dimensional microwave cavities, unidirectional amplifiers, digital attenuators, and a digital phase shifter. By dividing the energy transfer into forward and backward paths, our platform enables precise control over the amplitude and phase of the propagating signals in each direction. Through a combination of theoretical and numerical analysis, we model the dynamics of the system under different operating conditions, including a parameter regime where the gain not only compensates for but significantly exceeds the inherent loss. Our model quantitatively reproduces the observed weak-drive transmission spectra, the amplitude and frequency of self-sustained limit cycles, and the phase locking synchronization effect between the limit cycle and an external microwave tone. Our results may have implications in areas ranging from sensing and synthetic photonic materials to neuromorphic computing and quantum networks, while providing new insight into the interplay between non-Hermitian and nonlinear dynamics.</description>

Abstract: We study how entanglement in photoionization is transferred from an electron-ion pair to an electron-photon pair by fluorescence. Time-resolved von Neumann entropies are used to establish how information is shared between the particles. Multipartite entanglement, between electron, ion and photon, is found on intermediate timescales. Finally, it is shown how a phase-locked two-pulse sequence allows for the application of time symmetry, mediated by strong coupling, to reveal the entanglement transfer process by measuring the photon number and electron kinetic energy in coincidence.</description>

      <title>Relativistic limits on the discretization and temporal resolution of a quantum clock</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05848v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a brief discussion regarding relativistic limits on the discretization and temporal resolution of time values in a quantum clock. Our clock is characterized by a time observable chosen to be the complement of a bounded and discrete Hamiltonian which can have an equally-spaced or a generic spectrum. In the first case the time observable can be described by an Hermitian operator and we find a limit in the discretization for the time eigenvalues. Nevertheless, in both cases, the time observable can be described by a POVM and, by increasing the number of time states, we can arbitrarily reduce the bound on the minimum time quantum, demonstrating that we can safely take the time values as continuous when the number of time states tends to infinity. Finally, we find a limit for temporal resolution of our time observable when the clock is used (together with light signals) in a relativistic framework for measuring spacetime distances.</description>

      <title>Quantum refrigerator embedded in spin-star environments: Scalings of temperature and refrigeration time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04374v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine a quantum absorption refrigerator that comprises three qubits, each of which is connected with a separate spin-star environment. The refrigerator exhibits the feature of transient cooling, i.e., lowering of the temperature of the first qubit in sufficiently small timescales. Since the spin-star environment is inherently non-Markovian in nature, steady-state cooling is not achieved. A key advantage of our model is that the symmetries of the Hamiltonian enable a solution of the reduced density matrices of the refrigerator qubits, even in the presence of a large number of environmental spins. We derive the condition for autonomous refrigeration and analyze how the optimal cold qubit temperature scales with the number of bath qubits. We find a power law scaling towards a constant asymptotic value. We also find the scaling of the minimum time required for cooling as a function of the number of bath spins. Further, we scrutinize the heat currents associated with each of the three qubits.</description>

Abstract: Multipartite quantum entanglement, as a core quantum resource, is fundamental to the advancement of quantum science and technology. In multipartite quantum systems, there are two kinds of quantum entanglement: $k$-nonseparability and $k$-partite entanglement. In this paper, we propose sufficient criteria for detecting $k$-nonseparability and $k$-partite entanglement by using the generalized Wigner-Yanase skew information and mutually unbiased measurements. Examples are given to demonstrate the detection capability and advantages of these criteria. As an application, an example of recognizing the networks by detecting the depth of quantum networks is given.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14519v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a general protocol for distributed quantum computing that accommodates arbitrary unknown subroutines. It can be applied to scale up quantum computing through multi-chip interconnection, as well as to tasks such as estimating unknown parameters or processes for circuit depth reduction and constructing secure quantum cryptographic protocols. Our protocol builds upon a few techniques we develop, such as the oblivious quantum teleportation and control, which can circumvent quantum no-go theorems on the manipulation of unknown objects. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this protocol can be physically implemented using currently available quantum computing platforms. These results suggest that our framework could provide a foundation for developing more advanced quantum algorithms and protocols in the future.</description>

      <title>Tracking phase entanglement during propagation of downconverted photons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17906v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-dimensional entanglement in the form of transverse spatial correlation between a pair of photons generated via spontaneous parametric downconversion is not only a valuable resource in many academic and real-life applications but also provides access to several intriguing quantum phenomena. One such non-intuitive phenomenon is phase entanglement, in which the biphoton state is correlated in the complex phase of its wavefunction. This state, which emerges during the propagation of the biphoton wavefunction, exhibits neither position nor momentum correlation, yet retains full entanglement. In this work, we experimentally explore this state in two distinct ways. The first is by tracking the vanishing spatial photon number correlation over propagation distances lying in $\left[0,\infty\right)$, folded into a finite range using single-lens imaging. These observations show excellent agreement with our theoretical predictions based on the Double Gaussian (DG) approximation of the biphoton state. The second approach involves performing a two-photon interference experiment using a double slit and this state, which reveals the correlated phase front. We show, both theoretically and experimentally, that the observed two-photon interference structure is markedly different from that produced by position-correlated photons, as confirmed by computing the joint probability distribution of photons (JPD) and related metrics. Such interference using phase-entangled light has not been attempted before and opens avenues for advanced experiments and applications in the field of spatial entanglement.</description>

      <title>Resources for bosonic metrology: quantum-enhanced precision from a superselection rule perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum optics and atomic systems are prominent platforms for exploiting quantum-enhanced precision in parameter estimation. However, not only are quantum optical and atomic systems often treated separately, but even within quantum optics, identifying optimal probes (quantum states) and evolutions (parameter-dependent dynamics) typically relies on case-by-case analyses. Mode, and sometimes only particle entanglement, can yield quantum enhancement of precision in continuous- and discrete-variable regimes, yet a clear connection between these regimes remains elusive. In this work, we present a unified framework for quantum metrology that encompasses all known precision-enhancing regimes using bosonic resources. We introduce a superselection rule compliant representation of the electromagnetic field that explicitly incorporates the phase reference, enforcing total particle number conservation. This approach provides a description of the electromagnetic field which is formally equivalent to the one employed in atomic systems, and we show how it encompasses both the discrete and the continuous limits of quantum optics. Within this framework, we consistently recover established results while offering a coherent physical interpretation of the quantum resources responsible for precision enhancement. Moreover, we develop general strategies to optimize precision using arbitrary multimode entangled probe states. Finally, our formalism readily accommodates noise, measurement strategies and non-unitary evolutions, extending its applicability to realistic experimental scenarios.</description>

      <title>Exploring near critical lattice gauge simulators with Rydberg atoms facilities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We motivate the use of a ladder of Rydberg atoms as an analog simulator for a lattice gauge theory version of scalar electrodynamics also called the compact Abelian Higgs model. We demonstrate that by using a few thousand shots from a single copy of the ladder simulator it is possible to estimate the bipartite quantum von Neumann entanglement entropy $S^{vN}_A$. The estimation relies on an optimized filtration of the mutual information associated with the bitstrings obtained from public facilities of configurable Rydberg arrays named Aquila. We discuss the limitations associated with finite sampling, sorting fidelity, adiabatic preparation, ramp-down of the Rabi frequency before measurement, and readout errors. We use cumulative probability distribution to compare Aquila results with high accuracy density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) or exact results. The state preparation appears to be the main source of error. We discuss the large volume behavior of the cumulative probability distribution and show examples where for a finite number of shots, there appears to be some large enough size for which, with high probability, any given state is seen at most once. We show that the results presented can be extended to multipartite entanglement. We briefly discuss the cost of the calculations for large square arrays in the context of obtaining quantum advantage in the near future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17076v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of high-performance quantum technologies relies on the ability to prepare the quantum states of solid-state emitters with high fidelity while cleanly separating the emitted photons from the driving field. Here, we present a comprehensive theoretical comparison of three single-pulse coherent control protocols: resonant Rabi oscillations, adiabatic rapid passage (ARP), and notch-filtered ARP (NARP). To establish an ideal performance baseline, we first map the parameter spaces for each protocol in a closed system, identifying the regions of robust population inversion. We then use a Lindblad master equation to compute the time-resolved emission spectra in the presence of decoherence. Our results show that while all three schemes can generate identical, transform-limited Lorentzian photons, NARP uniquely combines the high-fidelity robustness of adiabatic passage with intrinsic spectral separability. Our findings, which align with the work on NARP by Wilbur et al., establish a clear design framework for engineering the next generation of quantum light sources.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a model of a scalable qudit-based quantum processor that uses rotational degrees of freedom of polar molecules. Entangling gates between qudits are implemented via moving molecule in optical traps by exploiting dipole-dipole interactions to mediate coherent coupling. We develop encoding schemes that map single qubits (d=2) into qudits of dimensions 2 &lt;= d &lt;= 5, and pairs of qubits into higher-dimensional qudits with d=4, 5. This approach enables the realization of a universal set of quantum gates. In particular, we exploit additional levels that are present in the d=3 and d=5 qudits, which allows one to simplify the decomposition of multiqubit gates. We then analyze the relevant experimental parameters to realize our schemes with SrF and 87Rb133Cs molecules. The proposed approach offers a promising route towards scalable and versatile quantum information processing with multilevel systems, which can be potentially realized using currently available experimental facilities.</description>

      <title>Optically-biased Rydberg microwave receiver enabled by hybrid nonlinear interferometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05310v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The coupling of Rydberg vapour medium to both microwave and optical fields allows harnessing the merits of all-optical detection, e.g. weak disruption of the measured field and invulnerability to extremely strong fields, owing to the lack of a conventional antenna in the detector. However, the highest sensitivity in this approach is typically achieved by introducing an additional microwave field acting as a local oscillator, thereby compromising the all-optical nature of the measurement. Here we propose an alternative method, optical-bias detection, that allows truly all-optical operation, while retaining exceptional sensitivity. We tackle the issue of laser phase noise, emerging in this type of detection, via a simultaneous measurement of the laser phase noise in a nonlinear process and real-time data processing, which overall yields an improvement of $35\ \mathrm{dB}$ in terms of signal-to-noise ratio compared with the basic approach. We report the sensitivity of $176\ \mathrm{nV/cm/\sqrt{Hz}}$ and reliable operation up to $3.5\ \mathrm{mV/cm}$ of $13.9\ \mathrm{GHz}$ electric field. We also demonstrate a quadrature-amplitude modulated data transmission, underlining the capability of the system to detect quadratures of the microwave field. This approach is thus directly comparable to the state-of-the-art superheterodyne, while retaining the merits of all-optical detection.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Krylov Methods for Molecular Hamiltonians: Reduced Memory Cost and Complexity Scaling via Tensor Hypercontraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12708v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce an algorithm that is simultaneously memory-efficient and low-scaling for applying ab initio molecular Hamiltonians to matrix-product states (MPS) via the tensor-hypercontraction (THC) format. These gains carry over to Krylov subspace methods, which can find low-lying eigenstates and simulate quantum time evolution while avoiding local minima and maintaining high accuracy. In our approach, the molecular Hamiltonian is represented as a sum of products of four MPOs, each with a bond dimension of only 2. Iteratively applying the MPOs to the current quantum state in MPS form, summing and re-compressing the MPS leads to a scheme with the same asymptotic memory cost as the bare MPS and reduces the computational cost scaling compared to the Krylov method using a conventional MPO construction. We provide a detailed theoretical derivation of these statements and conduct supporting numerical experiments to demonstrate the advantage. Our algorithm is highly parallelizable and thus lends itself to large-scale HPC simulations.</description>

      <title>Mechanical form factors and densities of non-relativistic fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The hadron physics community has been actively debating the interpretation of so-called mechanical properties of hadrons. Non-relativistic quantum-mechanical systems like the hydrogen atom have been appealed to in these debates as analogies. Since such appeals are likely to continue, it is important to have Galilei-covariant expressions for matrix elements of the energy-momentum tensor. In this work, I obtain Galilei-covariant breakdowns of such matrix elements into mechanical form factors, with a special focus on spin-half states. I additionally study the spatial densities associated with these form factors, using the pilot wave interpretation to guide their breakdown into contributions from internal structure and from quantum-mechanical effects such as wave packet dispersion. For completeness, I also obtain non-relativistic Breit frame densities.</description>

      <title>First direct search for light dark matter interactions in a transition-edge sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18982v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose the use of transition-edge sensor (TES) single-photon detectors as a simultaneous target and sensor for direct dark matter searches, and report results from the first search of this kind. We perform a 489 h science run with a TES device optimized for the detection of 1064 nm photons, with a mass of ~0.2 ng and an energy threshold of ~0.3 eV, and set new limits on dark matter interactions with both electrons and nucleons for dark matter with mass below the MeV scale. With their excellent energy resolution, TESs enable search strategies that are complementary to recent results from superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors and kinetic inductance detectors. We show that next-generation TES arrays hold promise to probe new regions of light dark matter parameter space.</description>

      <title>Comparison of D-Wave Quantum Annealing and Markov Chain Monte Carlo for Sampling from a Probability Distribution of a Restricted Boltzmann Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A local-valley (LV) centered approach to assessing the quality of sampling from Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) was applied to the latest generation of the D-Wave quantum annealer. D-Wave and Gibbs samples from a classically trained RBM were obtained at conditions relevant to the contrastive-divergence-based RBM learning. The samples were compared for the number of the LVs to which they belonged and the energy of the corresponding local minima. No significant (desirable) increase in the number of the LVs has been achieved by decreasing the D-Wave annealing time. At any training epoch, the states sampled by the D-Wave belonged to a somewhat higher number of LVs than in the Gibbs sampling. However, many of those LVs found by the two techniques differed. For high-probability sampled states, the two techniques were (unfavorably) less complementary and more overlapping. Nevertheless, many potentially "important" local minima, i.e., those having intermediate, even if not high, probability values, were found by only one of the two sampling techniques while missed by the other. The two techniques overlapped less at later than earlier training epochs, which is precisely the stage of the training when modest improvements to the sampling quality could make meaningful differences for the RBM trainability. The results of this work may explain the failure of previous investigations to achieve substantial (or any) improvement when using D-Wave-based sampling. However, the results reveal some potential for improvement, e.g., using a combined classical-quantum approach.</description>
