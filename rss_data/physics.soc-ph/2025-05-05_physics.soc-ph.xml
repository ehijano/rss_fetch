      <title>Modeling and Analyzing Urban Networks and Amenities with OSMnx</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: OSMnx is a Python package for downloading, modeling, analyzing, and visualizing urban networks and any other geospatial features from OpenStreetMap data. A large and growing body of literature uses it to conduct scientific studies across the disciplines of geography, urban planning, transport engineering, computer science, and others. The OSMnx project has recently developed and implemented many new features, modeling capabilities, and analytical methods. The package now encompasses substantially more functionality than was previously documented in the literature. This article introduces OSMnx's modern capabilities, usage, and design -- in addition to the scientific theory and logic underlying them. It shares lessons learned in geospatial software development and reflects on open science's implications for urban modeling and analysis.</description>

      <title>Location matters: Exploring the effects of regional geographical and political characteristics on hydrogen pipeline costs globally</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transporting hydrogen using pipelines is becoming increasingly relevant in the energy system, yet current cost estimates typically rely on simplistic approaches that overlook region-specific characteristics, leading to potential underestimations of costs. This paper examines hydrogen pipeline costs by incorporating regional geographical factors, such as land use, topography and existing infrastructure, together with political-economic factors represented through country-specific weighted average costs of capital. Using a GIS-based model, we demonstrate that the regional levelized cost of transportation can vary by up to a factor of three. Comparing our approach with conventional ones based on uniform detour factors in an existing European energy system analysis framework shows substantial deviations in trade flows and highlights the relevance of this work. We provide cost and route data for 4,900 potential global pipeline routes. Our findings yield valuable insights for further research and stakeholders when assessing the economic viability of hydrogen as a competitive energy carrier.</description>

      <title>Product-level value chains from firm data: mapping trophic levels into economic growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reconstruct a product-level input-output network based on firm-level import-export data of Italian firms. We show that the network has a statistically significant, yet nuanced trophic structure, which is evident at the product level but is lost when the classification is coarse-grained. This detailed value chain allows us to characterize the trophic distance between inputs and outputs of single firms, and to derive a coherent picture at the sector level, finding that sectors such as weapons and vehicles are the ones with the largest increase in downstreamness between their inputs and their outputs. Our measure of downstreamness at the product level can be used to derive country-level indicators that characterize industrial strategies and capabilities and act as predictors of economic growth. With respect to the standard input/output analysis, we show that the fine-grained structure is qualitatively different from what can be observed using sector-level data. We finally prove that, even if we leverage exclusively data from Italian firms, the metrics that we derive are predictive at the country level and capture a significant description of the input-output relations of global value chains.</description>

      <title>Power Laws Associated with Self-Organized Criticality: A Comparison of Empirical Data with Model Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the relevance of {\sl self-organized criticality (SOC)} models in previously published empirical datasets, which includes statistical observations in astrophysics, geophysics, biophysics, sociophysics, and informatics. We study 25 interdisciplinary phenomena with five different event detection and power law fitting methods. The total number of analyzed size distributions amounts to 64 cases, of which 80\% are found to be nearly consistent ($\alpha_s=1.99\pm0.30$) with the SOC model predictions. The fractal-diffusive SOC model predicts power law slopes of $\alpha_F=(9/5)=1.80$ for the flux $F$, $\alpha_E=(5/3)\sim1.67$ for the fluence or energy $E$, and $\alpha_T=2.00$ for the avalanche duration $T$. We find that the phenomena of solar flares, earthquakes, and forest fires are consistent with the theoretical predictions, while the size distributions of other phenomena are not conclusive due to neglected background treatment, inadequacy of power law fitting range, small-number statistics, and finite-system size effects.</description>

      <title>Towards a format for describing networks / 1. Networks and knowledge graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The relationship between the concepts of network and knowledge graph is explored. A knowledge graph can be considered a special type of network. When using a knowledge graph, various networks can be obtained from it, and network analysis procedures can be applied to them. RDF is a formalization of the knowledge graph concept for the Semantic Web, but some of its solutions are also extensible to a format for describing general networks.</description>

      <title>Extended Persistent Homology Distinguishes Simple and Complex Contagions with High Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The social contagion literature makes a distinction between simple (independent cascade or bond percolation processes that pass infections through edges) and complex contagions (bootstrap percolation or threshold processes that require local reinforcement to spread). However, distinguishing simple and complex contagions using observational data poses a significant challenge in practice. Estimating population-level activation functions from observed contagion dynamics is hindered by confounding factors that influence adoptions (other than neighborhood interactions), as well as heterogeneity in individual behaviors and modeling variations that make it difficult to design appropriate null models for inferring contagion types. Here, we show that a new tool from topological data analysis (TDA), called extended persistent homology (EPH), when applied to contagion processes over networks, can effectively detect simple and complex contagion processes, as well as predict their parameters. We train classification and regression models using EPH-based topological summaries computed on simulated simple and complex contagion dynamics on three real-world network datasets and obtain high predictive performance over a wide range of contagion parameters and under a variety of informational constraints, including uncertainty in model parameters, noise, and partial observability of contagion dynamics. EPH captures the role of cycles of varying lengths in the observed contagion dynamics and offers a useful metric to classify contagion models and predict their parameters. Analyzing geometrical features of network contagion using TDA tools such as EPH can find applications in other network problems such as seeding, vaccination, and quarantine optimization, as well as network inference and reconstruction problems.</description>

      <title>DebtStreamness: An Ecological Approach to Credit Flows in Inter-Firm Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how credit flows through inter-firm networks is critical for assessing financial stability and systemic risk. In this study, we introduce DebtStreamness, a novel metric inspired by trophic levels in ecological food webs, to quantify the position of firms within credit chains. By viewing credit as the ``primary energy source'' of the economy, we measure how far credit travels through inter-firm relationships before reaching its final borrowers. Applying this framework to Uruguay's inter-firm credit network, using survey data from the Central Bank, we find that credit chains are generally short, with a tiered structure in which some firms act as intermediaries, lending to others further along the chain. We also find that local network motifs such as loops can substantially increase a firm's DebtStreamness, even when its direct borrowing from banks remains the same. Comparing our results with standard economic classifications based on input-output linkages, we find that DebtStreamness captures distinct financial structures not visible through production data. We further validate our approach using two maximum-entropy network reconstruction methods, demonstrating the robustness of DebtStreamness in capturing systemic credit structures. These results suggest that DebtStreamness offers a complementary ecological perspective on systemic credit risk and highlights the role of hidden financial intermediation in firm networks.</description>

      <title>Inferring resource competition in microbial communities from time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04520v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The competition for resources is a defining feature of microbial communities. In many contexts, from soils to host-associated communities, highly diverse microbes are organized into metabolic groups or guilds with similar resource preferences. The resource preferences of individual taxa that give rise to these guilds are critical for understanding fluxes of resources through the community and the structure of diversity in the system. However, inferring the metabolic capabilities of individual taxa, and their competition with other taxa, within a community is challenging and unresolved. Here we address this gap in knowledge by leveraging dynamic measurements of abundances in communities. We show that simple correlations are often misleading in predicting resource competition. We show that spectral methods such as the cross-power spectral density (CPSD) and coherence that account for time-delayed effects are superior metrics for inferring the structure of resource competition in communities. We first demonstrate this fact on synthetic data generated from consumer-resource models with time-dependent resource availability, where taxa are organized into groups or guilds with similar resource preferences. By applying spectral methods to oceanic plankton time-series data, we demonstrate that these methods detect interaction structures among species with similar genomic sequences. Our results indicate that analyzing temporal data across multiple timescales can reveal the underlying structure of resource competition within communities.</description>
