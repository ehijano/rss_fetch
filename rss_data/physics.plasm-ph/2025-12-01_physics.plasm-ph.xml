      <title>GANDALF: A hardware-agnostic spectral solver for kinetic reduced MHD turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present GANDALF, a JAX-based spectral solver for Kinetic Reduced MHD (KRMHD) turbulence designed to lower infrastructure barriers to plasma turbulence research. Existing production codes require specialized HPC infrastructure and compilation expertise, limiting participation to well-resourced institutions. GANDALF addresses this barrier by leveraging JAX's hardware abstraction to run transparently on laptops, desktop GPUs, and Apple Silicon without modification, enabling single-command installation via pip. We employ Fourier spectral methods for spatial discretization and Hermite spectral basis for velocity space, combined with an exponential integrating factor method that exactly propagates linear Alfv\'en waves, eliminating associated numerical stiffness. Verification demonstrates research-grade accuracy: linear Alfv\'en waves achieve machine precision (~10^{-15} relative error), the Orszag-Tang vortex conserves energy to 10^{-6} over two Alfv\'en times, and driven turbulence reproduces the expected k_perp^{-5/3} cascade spectrum. GANDALF enables rapid prototyping, parameter surveys, and educational applications on commodity hardware. The code complements rather than replaces established solvers like AstroGK and Viriato, prioritizing accessibility for researchers without HPC resources. By removing infrastructure barriers while maintaining spectral accuracy, GANDALF broadens participation in fundamental plasma turbulence research, particularly benefiting students, small research groups, and institutions in developing regions.</description>

      <title>FPGA-Accelerated Real-Time Beam Emission Spectroscopy Diagnostics at DIII-D Using the SLAC Neural Network Library for ML Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving reliable real-time control of tokamak plasmas is essential for sustaining high-performance operation in next-generation fusion reactors. A major challenge is the accurate and timely prediction of edge-localized modes (ELMs), especially in high-confinement regimes such as wide-pedestal quiescent H-mode. We present a hardware-accelerated machine learning (ML) inference system integrated into the RTSTAB processing node of the DIII-D real-time diagnostic and control infrastructure. The system uses an AMD/Xilinx KCU1500 FPGA to enable ultra low latency plasma state classification and ELM forecasting. Input features come from real-time Beam Emission Spectroscopy (BES), and the ML model is implemented as a dense neural network using the SLAC Neural Network Library (SNL).
  A key capability is SNL dynamic parameter loading, which allows on-the-fly updates of neural network weights and biases without hardware resynthesis. This enables multiple classification tasks on a single FPGA design and supports adaptive control strategies that respond to evolving plasma conditions. By decoupling inference from fixed-weight configurations, the system supports continuous model refinement and seamless task switching during live operation.
  The SNL-based inference engine is fully integrated with the FPGA in the DIII-D RTSTAB Plasma Control System (PCS), improving ELM avoidance, confinement, and operational stability. These results show the feasibility of embedding dynamically reconfigurable FPGA-based ML inference into real-time fusion diagnostic pipelines, providing a scalable and resilient path toward intelligent and autonomous plasma control in future magnetic confinement fusion devices.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamically Consistent Vibrational-Electron Heating: Generalized Derivation for Excited State Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of electron temperature ($T_{\rm e}$) in non-equilibrium plasma flows is critical for applications ranging from hypersonic flight to plasma-assisted combustion. We recently proposed a thermodynamically consistent model for vibrational-electron (V-e) heating [Phys. Fluids 37, 096141 (2025)] which enforces convergence of $T_{\rm e}$ to the vibrational temperature ($T_{\rm v}$) at equilibrium. While the original derivation assumed electron energy loss was dominated by collisions with ground-state molecules, this Letter presents a rigorous generalization of the model. We demonstrate that the heating-to-cooling ratio $\exp(\theta_{\rm v}/T_{\rm e}-\theta_{\rm v}/T_{\rm v})$ with $\theta_{\rm v}$ the characteristic vibrational temperature remains valid even when electron cooling interactions with vibrationally excited states are included. This derivation removes the previous constraint assuming ground-state dominance, thereby extending the model's validity to plasma flows where vibrationally excited populations contribute significantly to electron cooling.</description>

      <title>Shear Alfv\'en Waves in Chaotic Magnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The shear Alfv\'en spectrum is computed in the presence of symmetry breaking perturbations that introduce chaotic magnetic field trajectories. Quadratic flux minimised surfaces allow the creation of pseudo straight field line coordinates in the chaotic region. With these coordinates, the reduced ideal MHD equations are cast into an eigenvalue problem and solved numerically. The spectrum is computed with varying perturbation strength, showing how shear Alfv\'en waves change as increasing number of flux surfaces are destroyed. Solutions on specific flux surfaces are shown to remain relatively unchanged while the flux surface remains intact, and retain some original features at large perturbations where the flux surface is destroyed.</description>

      <title>Solving the six-dimensional Vlasov-Maxwell System with Active Flux and Splitting Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active Flux (AF) is a modified Finite Volume method that evolves additional Degrees of Freedom (DoF) located on the cell interfaces to compute high-order approximations to the numerical fluxes through the respective interface. We present an AF-based scheme for the simulation of collisionless plasmas described by the Vlasov equation coupled with Maxwell's equations. In order to limit the DoF in high dimensional settings we employ operator splitting. The resulting one-dimensional advection equations can be solved efficiently and with low implementation complexity, making it a very fast alternative to standard Finite Volume methods. We compare our scheme's performance with a related Finite Volume method based on the semi-Lagrangian approach. We find that, as a consequence of its compact stencil, the AF scheme has significantly lower dissipation and reduced anisotropy, and thus produces results on par with or even superior to the benchmark for standard test cases reproducing important kinetic phenomena, while also offering lower computational cost.</description>

      <title>The Machine Learning Approach to Moment Closure Relations for Plasma: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The requirement for large-scale global simulations of plasma is an ongoing challenge in both space and laboratory plasma physics. Any simulation based on a fluid model inherently requires a closure relation for the high order plasma moments. This review compiles and analyses the recent surge of machine learning approaches developing improved plasma closure models capable of capturing kinetic phenomena within plasma fluid models. The purpose of this review is both to collect and analyse the various methods employed on the plasma closure problem, including both equation discovery methods and neural network surrogate approaches, as well as to provide a general overview of the state of the problem. In particular, we highlight the challenges of developing a data-driven closure as well as the direction future work should take toward addressing these challenges, in the pursuit of a computationally viable large-scale global simulation.</description>

      <title>Experimental study of argon gas breakdown with symmetric and asymmetric electrode configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Paschen law relates the breakdown voltage of a gas to the product of gas pressure and inter-electrode distance, predicting a characteristic minimum voltage at a specific pd value. In this study, the role of electrode configurations (symmetric and asymmetric) and inter-electrode spacing on the gas breakdown processes (or Paschen Law) is examined. Numerous sets of experiments are performed with both symmetric and asymmetric electrode configurations of different sizes to obtain Paschen curves at different inter-electrode distances. The experimentally obtained Paschen's curves for different electrode configurations are fitted using a proposed modified empirical relation for breakdown voltage, incorporating variable power-law dependencies and fitting parameters to better capture the observed deviations. Upon closer inspection, we observed that the breakdown voltage and the corresponding pd value are influenced by both electrode configurations and the inter-electrode discharge gap. The variation in breakdown voltage and pd minima for different electrode configurations is explained by analyzing the electric field distributions between the electrodes (cathode and anode) for an applied voltage.</description>

      <title>High fidelity simulations of the multi-species Vlasov-Maxwell system with the Numerical Flow Iteration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Validity of fluid models breaks down for non-thermal or weakly collisional plasmas which often occur e.g. in the solar wind. In these regimes one has to resort to modelling through the first-principle Vlasov-Maxwell system, but its six-dimensional phase-space dynamics, strong filamentation, and multi-scale structure make direct numerical simulation extremely demanding. Particle-In-Cell (PIC) methods remain the standard for ion-scale studies, yet their memory cost and intrinsic noise hinder accurate electron-scale simulations. In this paper, we introduce an alternative method based on an iterative-in-time approximation of characteristics. The approach reconstructs the phase-space dynamics from the time history of the electromagnetic fields and the initial distribution functions, enabling extremely high effective resolution far below the phase-space grid scale without storing or advecting high-dimensional data. Earlier work demonstrated this capability for the multi-species electrostatic Vlasov system. Here we discuss an extension of the method to the full Vlasov-Maxwell equations using a Hamiltonian splitting to advance the solution in a structure-preserving way while retaining the reduced memory footprint.</description>

      <title>A multi-language auto-differentiation module and its application to a parallel particle-in-cell code on distributed computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The auto differentiable simulation is a type of simulation that outputs of the simulation include not only the simulation result itself, but also their derivatives with respect to various input parameters. It provides an efficient method to study sensitivity of the simulation results with respect to the input parameters. Furthermore, it can be used in gradient based optimization methods for rapidly optimizing design parameters. In this paper, we present the development of a fast and transparent auto-differentiation module/class designed for easy integration into numerous simulation codes. As an application, this auto-differentiation module is integrated into a parallel particle-in-cell code with message passing interface (MPI) on distributed memory computers.</description>

      <title>Hierachical Multiscale Modeling of Positive Corona Discharges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the field of corona discharges, the complex chemical mechanisms inside the ionization region have prompted the development of simplified models to replicate the macroscopic effects of ion generation, thereby reducing the computational effort, especially in two and three dimensional simulations. We propose a methodology that allows to replace the ionization process with appropriate boundary conditions used by a corona model solving the drift region. We refer to this model as macro-scale, since it does not solve the ionization region. Our approach begins with one dimensional computations in cylindrical coordinates of the whole discharge, where we include a fairly detailed model of the plasma region near the emitter. We refer to this model as full-scale, since all the spatial scales, including the ionization region, are properly taken into account. From these results it is possible to establish boundary conditions for macroscopic simulations. The idea is that, given an emitter radius, the boundary conditions can be used for a variety of geometries that leverage on that emitter as active electrode. Our results agree with available experimental data for positive corona discharges in different configurations and with simplified analytical models from literature.</description>

      <title>Synchronized Catastrophic Collapse and Extreme Intensity Amplification of Ultra-Intense Pulses in Near-Resonance Magnetized Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27239v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultra-high field intensities are essential for developing high-energy-density physics and compact plasma accelerators, but they are essentially constrained by the limitations of focusing distance and nonlinear efficiency. We present a theoretical model for extreme laser energy concentration in under-dense plasma that shows a highly effective, magnetically supported pathway. We demonstrate a fundamental, nonlinear enhancement of the relativistic self-focusing (RSF) mechanism by adjusting an external magnetic field close to the cyclotron resonance (Ce=0.7). Over a remarkably short distance of 1.25 Rayleigh lengths, the pulse is driven into a catastrophic, coupled collapse by this magnetic enhancement. Significant temporal self-compression (0.60) and simultaneous spatial confinement (0.05) are the outcomes of the dynamics. Importantly, this combined confinement results in a localized peak intensity amplification factor greater than 103 compared to the initial state. This work offers a clear, practical blueprint for upcoming laser-plasma experiments and validates a reliable and compact technique for producing petawatt-scale power densities.</description>

      <title>Relativistic resistive magnetohydrodynamics for a two-component plasma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14787v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive relativistic resistive magnetohydrodynamics for a two-component ultrarelativistic plasma directly from kinetic theory. Starting with the Boltzmann--Vlasov equation and using the 14-moment approximation in the Landau frame, we obtain coupled evolution equations for the charge diffusion four-current and the shear-stress tensor. Benchmarking against the usual Israel-Stewart type relaxation form shows that this simplified description is accurate for small viscosity to entropy ($\eta/s$) ratio, vanishing magnetic field, and not so strong electric field. Outside this regime the dynamics depart in a controlled way, i.e., strong electric fields introduce nonlinear back-reaction that delays and reduces current peaks, and a sizable shear-stress is produced even without a flow profile.</description>

      <title>Collisionless relaxation to equilibrium distributions in cold dark matter halos: origin of the Navarro-Frenk-White profile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02104v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collisionless self-gravitating systems such as cold dark matter halos are known to harbor universal density profiles despite the intricate non-linear physics of hierarchical structure formation in the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. The origin of such states has been a persistent mystery, particularly because the physics of collisionless relaxation has remained poorly understood. To solve this long-standing problem, we develop a self-consistent quasilinear theory in action-angle space for the collisionless relaxation of inhomogeneous, self-gravitating systems by perturbing the governing Vlasov-Poisson equations. We obtain a quasilinear diffusion equation that describes the secular evolution of the mean coarse-grained distribution function $f_0$ of accreted matter in the fluctuating force field of a spherical isotropic halo. The diffusion coefficient not only depends on the fluctuation power spectrum but also on the evolving potential of the system, which reflects the self-consistency of the problem. Diffusive heating in the pre-assembled halo develops an $r^{-\gamma}$ inner density cusp, accretion and relaxation in which develops an $r^{-\beta}$ outer fall-off with $\beta \approx 5 - 2\gamma$ in the quasi-steady state. Spherical collapse theory dictates that a quasi-steady outer halo must settle to $\beta \approx 3$, for which the mass enclosed within a shell barely changes with time. This implies that $\gamma\approx 1$, which is possible in the quasilinear framework only if (i) the pre-assembled halo harbors an $r^{-\gamma_{\mathrm{P}}}$ profile with $\gamma_{\mathrm{P}} \gtrsim 0.5$, (ii) its fluctuations are correlated in time (red noise), and (iii) the initial value of $\gamma$ is smaller than $1$, implying that the $r^{-1}$ cusp is a neutral equilibrium. We demonstrate for the first time how the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile emerges as a quasi-steady state of collisionless relaxation.</description>

      <title>Mode Composition Shapes Magnetic Anisotropy in Solar Wind Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Turbulence is a ubiquitous process that transfers energy across many spatial and temporal scales, thereby influencing particle transport and heating. Recent progress has improved our understanding of the anisotropy of turbulence with respect to the mean magnetic field; however, its exact form and implications for magnetic topology and energy transfer remain unclear. In this study, we investigate the nature of magnetic anisotropy in compressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence within low-$\beta$ solar wind using measurements from the Cluster spacecraft. By decomposing small-amplitude fluctuations into Alfv\'en and compressible modes, we reveal that magnetic anisotropy is largely mode dependent: Alfvenic fluctuations are broadly distributed in propagation angle, whereas compressible fluctuations are concentrated near the quasi-parallel (slab) direction, a feature closely linked to collisionless damping of compressible modes. For $\beta\rightarrow0$, compressible modes become dominant within the slab component at smaller scales. These findings advance our understanding of magnetic anisotropy in solar wind turbulence and offer a new perspective on the three-dimensional turbulence cascade, with broad implications for particle transport, acceleration, and magnetic reconnection.</description>

Abstract: We present a path-integral Monte Carlo estimator for calculating the dipole polarizability of interacting Coulomb plasma in the long-wavelength limit, i.e., the optical region. We present comprehensive details and method validation studies for our approach based on dipole imaginary-time autocorrelation functions. The simulation of thermal equilibrium in imaginary time has exact Coulomb interactions and Boltzmann quantum statistics. For reference, we use the Drude model as the long-wavelength limit of the Lindhard response, presenting its analytical continuation into the imaginary time and Matsubara series. We demonstrate great agreement within $1\%$ between PIMC and the reference model, indicating negligible numerical biases and physical many-body effects in metallic densities. The approach is amenable to nonlinear optical response, quantum confinements, dispersion forces, and to inform applications such as plasmonics and epsilon-near-zero materials.</description>
