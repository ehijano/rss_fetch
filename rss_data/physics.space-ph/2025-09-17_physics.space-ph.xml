      <title>The impact of Alfvenic shear flow on magnetic reconnection and turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection is a fundamental and omnipresent energy conversion process in plasma physics. Novel observations of fields and particles from Parker Solar Probe (PSP) have shown the absence of reconnection in a large number of current sheets in the near-Sun solar wind. Using near-Sun observations from PSP Encounters 4 to 11 (Jan 2020 to March 2022), we investigate whether reconnection onset might be suppressed by velocity shear. We compare estimates of the tearing mode growth rate in the presence of shear flow for time periods identified as containing reconnecting current sheets versus non-reconnecting times, finding systematically larger growth rates for reconnection periods. Upon examination of the parameters associated with reconnection onset, we find that 85% of the reconnection events are embedded in slow, non-Alfvenic wind streams. We compare with fast, slow non-Alfvenic, and slow Alfvenic streams, finding that the growth rate is suppressed in highly Alfvenic fast and slow wind and reconnection is not seen in these wind types, as would be expected from our theoretical expressions. These wind streams have strong Alfvenic} flow shear, consistent with the idea of reconnection suppression by such flows. This could help explain the frequent absence of reconnection events in the highly Alfvenic, near-Sun solar wind observed by PSP. Finally, we find a steepening of both the trace and magnitude magnetic field spectra within reconnection periods in comparison to ambient wind. We tie this to the dynamics of relatively balanced turbulence within these reconnection periods and the potential generation of compressible fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Active-Passive Galactic Cosmic Ray Simulator: experimental implementation and microdosimetric characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Space radiation is one of the major obstacles to space exploration. If not mitigated, radiation can interact both with biological and electronic systems, inducing damage and posing significant risk to space missions. Countermeasures can only be studied effectively with ground-based accelerators that act as a proxy for space radiation, typically with a harsher radiation field that worsen the effects of space radiation. Following an in-silico design and optimization process we have developed a galactic cosmic ray (GCR) simulator using a hybrid active-passive methodology. In this approach, the primary beam energy is actively switched and the beam interacts with specifically designed passive modulators. In this paper, we present the implementation of such a GCR simulator and its experimental microdosimetric characterization. Measuring the GCR field is of paramount importance, both before providing it to the user as a validated radiation field and for achieving the best possible radiation description. The issue is addressed in this paper by using a tissue-equivalent proportional counter to measure radiation quality and by comparing experimental measurements with Monte Carlo simulations. In conclusion, we will demonstrate the GCR simulator's capability to reproduce a GCR field.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Active-Passive Galactic Cosmic Ray Simulator: in-silico design and optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-energy heavy-ion particle accelerators have long served as a proxy for the harsh space radiation environment, enabling both fundamental life-science research and applied testing of flight components. Typically, monoenergetic high-energy heavy-ion beams are used to mimic the complex mixed radiation field encountered in low Earth orbit and beyond. However, synergistic effects arising from the spatial or temporal proximity of interactions of different radiation qualities in a mixed field cannot be fully assessed with such beams. Therefore, spearheaded by developments at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory, the GSI Helmholtzzentrum fuer Schwerionenforschung, supported by ESA, has developed advanced space radiation simulation capabilities to support space radiation studies in Europe. Here, we report the design, optimization, and in-silico benchmarking of GSI's hybrid active-passive GCR simulator. Additionally, a computationally optimized phase-space particle source for Geant4 is presented, which will be made available to external users to support their own in-silico studies and experimental planning.</description>

      <title>A New Mechanism for ULF Wave Modulation of Energetic Electron Precipitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The May 2024 geomagnetic superstorm provided the opportunity to explore how strong wave-particle interactions affect energetic electron precipitation under intense driving. Using coordinated measurements from a balloon-borne Timepix-based X-ray detector, ground-based riometers and magnetometers, and Arase satellite observations, we identified quasi-periodic bursts of energetic electron precipitation coincident with Pc5 ultra low frequency (ULF) wave oscillations. Arase satellite data revealed energy-dispersed trapped energetic electron flux modulations in the 'seed' energy range, indicating that trapped electron flux was likely modulated by ULF waves. This letter reveals that these flux enhancements surpassed the Kennel-Petschek (K-P) limit, creating intense chorus waves and driving periodic electron precipitation. Drift-dispersion analysis traced these modulations back to a source in the post-noon magnetospheric sector, matching balloon and ground-based measurements. Here, we propose a novel indirect ULF wave-driven mechanism for modulated energetic electron precipitation, whereby periodic modulations of `seed' electron fluxes enhance electron losses.</description>

      <title>Space Mission Options for Reconnaissance and Mitigation of Asteroid 2024 YR4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Near-Earth asteroid 2024 YR4 was discovered on 2024-12-27 and its probability of Earth impact in December 2032 peaked at about 3% on 2025-02-18. Additional observations ruled out Earth impact by 2025-02-23. However, the probability of lunar impact in December 2032 then rose, reaching about 4% by the end of the apparition in May 2025. James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations on 2025-03-26 estimated the asteroid's diameter at 60 +/- 7 m. Studies of 2024 YR4's potential lunar impact effects suggest lunar ejecta could increase micrometeoroid debris flux in low Earth orbit up to 1000 times above background levels over just a few days, possibly threatening astronauts and spacecraft. In this work, we present options for space missions to 2024 YR4 that could be utilized if lunar impact is confirmed. We cover flyby &amp; rendezvous reconnaissance, deflection, and robust disruption of the asteroid. We examine both rapid-response and delayed launch options through 2032. We evaluate chemical and solar electric propulsion, various launch vehicles, optimized deep space maneuvers, and gravity assists. Re-tasking extant spacecraft and using built spacecraft not yet launched are also considered. The best reconnaissance mission options launch in late 2028, leaving only approximately three years for development at the time of this writing in August 2025. Deflection missions were assessed and appear impractical. However, kinetic robust disruption missions are available with launches between April 2030 and April 2032. Nuclear robust disruption missions are also available with launches between late 2029 and late 2031. Finally, even if lunar impact is ruled out there is significant potential utility in deploying a reconnaissance mission to characterize the asteroid.</description>

      <title>Solar Flare Hard X-ray Polarimetry with the CUbesat Solar Polarimeter (CUSP) mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The CUbesat Solar Polarimeter (CUSP) project is a CubeSat mission planned for a launch in low-Earth orbit and aimed to measure the linear polarization of solar flares in the hard X-ray band by means of a Compton scattering polarimeter. CUSP will allow us to study the magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration in the flaring magnetic structures of our star. CUSP is a project in the framework of the Alcor Program of the Italian Space Agency aimed at developing new CubeSat missions. It is undergoing a 12-month Phase B that started in December 2024.
  The Compton polarimeter on board CUSP is composed of two acquisition chains based on plastic scintillators read out by Multi-Anode PhotoMultiplier Tubes for the scatterer part and GAGG crystals coupled to Avalanche PhotoDiodes for the absorbers. An event coincident between the two readout schemes will lead to a measurement of the incoming X-ray's azimuthal scattering angle, linked to the polarization of the solar flare in a statistical manner. The current status of the CUSP mission design, mission analysis, and payload scientific performance will be reported. The latter will be discussed based on preliminary laboratory results obtained in parallel with Geant4 simulations.</description>

      <title>Probing Solar Polar Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20502v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The magnetic fields and dynamical processes in the solar polar regions play a crucial role in the solar magnetic cycle and in supplying mass and energy to the fast solar wind, ultimately being vital in controlling solar activities and driving space weather. Despite numerous efforts to explore these regions, to date no imaging observations of the Sun's poles have been achieved from vantage points out of the ecliptic plane, leaving their behavior and evolution poorly understood. This observation gap has left three top-level scientific questions unanswered, 1) How does the solar dynamo work and drive the solar magnetic cycle? 2) What drives the fast solar wind? 3) How do space weather processes globally originate from the Sun and propagate throughout the solar system? The Solar Polar-orbit Observatory (SPO) mission, a solar polar exploration spacecraft, is proposed to address these three unanswered scientific questions by imaging the Sun's poles from high heliolatitudes. In order to achieve its scientific goals, SPO will carry six remote-sensing and four in-situ instruments to measure the vector magnetic fields and Doppler velocity fields in the photosphere, to observed the Sun in the extreme ultraviolet, X-ray, and radio wavelengths, to image the corona and the heliosphere up to 45 $R_\odot$, and to perform in-situ detection of magnetic fields, and low- and high-energy particles in the solar wind.</description>
