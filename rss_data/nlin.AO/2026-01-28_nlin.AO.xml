      <title>Is gelation a singularity or a flow induced instability?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gelation in the Smoluchowski coagulation equation is commonly interpreted as a finite-time singularity marked by mass loss or moment divergence. We instead characterize gelation as a loss of dynamical stability of the Smoluchowski flow, quantified through the time-dependent spectrum of the Jacobian along the evolving aggregation dynamics. Studying homogeneous kernels $K(i,j)=(ij)^{\alpha}$ together with the classical Smoluchowski, we show that gelation is consistently preceded by the appearance of positive real eigenvalues, indicating a loss of local dynamical stability. While non-gelling kernels exhibit only transient finite-size effects, gelling kernels display persistent spectral destabilization associated with macroscopic gel formation. Our results identify gelation as a genuine dynamical instability of the Smoluchowski flow.</description>

      <title>Modeling Two-Scale Rank Distributions via Redistribution Dynamics or an Analytic Derivation of the Beta Rank Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Beta Rank Function (BRF) is a two-sided distribution characterized by a smooth peak and double powerlaw decay, widely used to model empirical data exhibiting deviations from pure power laws. In this paper, we introduce a novel two-step generative process that produces data exactly following the BRF distribution. The first step involves any mechanism generating a power-law distribution, while the second step applies a regressive redistribution process that reallocates resources from poorer to richer entities, thereby amplifying inequality. This approach represents the first analytic derivation of an exact BRF distribution from a generative mechanism. We validate the model through applications to income and urban population distributions. Beyond exact generation, this framework offers new insights into the systemic origins of deviations from power laws frequently observed in complex systems, linking rank distributions to underlying feedback and redistribution dynamics.</description>

      <title>De novo emergence of metabolically active protocells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11013v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A continuous route from a disordered soup of simple chemical feedstocks to a functional protocell -- a compartment that metabolizes, grows, and propagates -- remains elusive. Here, we show that a homogeneous aqueous chemical mixture containing phosphorus, iron, molybdenum salts and formaldehyde spontaneously self-organizes into compartments that couple robust non-equilibrium chemical dynamics to their own growth. These structures mature to a sustained, dissipative steady state and support an organic synthetic engine, producing diverse molecular species including many core biomolecular classes. Internal spherules that are themselves growth-competent are produced within the protocells, establishing a rudimentary mode of self-perpetuation. The chemical dynamics we observe in controlled laboratory conditions also occur in reaction mixtures exposed to natural day-night cycles. Strikingly, the morphology and chemical composition of the protocells in our experiments closely resemble molybdenum-rich microspheres recently discovered in current oceanic environments. Our work establishes a robust, testable route to de novo protocell formation. The emergence of life-like spatiotemporal organization and chemical dynamics from minimal initial conditions is more facile than previously thought and could be a recurring natural phenomenon.</description>
