      <title>Event-Aware Sentiment Factors from LLM-Augmented Financial Tweets: A Transparent Framework for Interpretable Quant Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we wish to showcase the unique utility of large language models (LLMs) in financial semantic annotation and alpha signal discovery. Leveraging a corpus of company-related tweets, we use an LLM to automatically assign multi-label event categories to high-sentiment-intensity tweets. We align these labeled sentiment signals with forward returns over 1-to-7-day horizons to evaluate their statistical efficacy and market tradability. Our experiments reveal that certain event labels consistently yield negative alpha, with Sharpe ratios as low as -0.38 and information coefficients exceeding 0.05, all statistically significant at the 95\% confidence level. This study establishes the feasibility of transforming unstructured social media text into structured, multi-label event variables. A key contribution of this work is its commitment to transparency and reproducibility; all code and methodologies are made publicly available. Our results provide compelling evidence that social media sentiment is a valuable, albeit noisy, signal in financial forecasting and underscore the potential of open-source frameworks to democratize algorithmic trading research.</description>

      <title>Deformation of semi-circle law for the correlated time series and Phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the eigenvalue of the Wigner random matrix, which is created from a time series with temporal correlation. We observe the deformation of the semi-circle law which is similar to the eigenvalue distribution of the Wigner-L\`{e}vy matrix. The distribution has a longer tail and a higher peak than the semi-circle law. In the absence of correlation, the eigenvalue distribution of the Wigner random matrix is known as the semi-circle law in the large $N$ limit. When there is a temporal correlation, the eigenvalue distribution converges to the deformed semi-circle law which has a longer tail and a higher peak than the semi-circle law. When we created the Wigner matrix using financial time series, we test the normal i.i.d. using the Wigner matrix. We observe the difference from the semi-circle law for FX time series. The difference from the semi-circle law is explained by the temporal correlation. Here, we discuss the moments of distribution and convergence to the deformed semi-circle law with a temporal correlation. We discuss the phase transition and compare to the Marchenko-Pastur distribution(MPD) case.</description>

      <title>Unwitting Markowitz' Simplification of Portfolio Random Returns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In his famous paper, Markowitz (1952) derived the dependence of portfolio random returns on the random returns of its securities. This result allowed Markowitz to obtain his famous expression for portfolio variance. We show that Markowitz's equation for portfolio random returns and the expression for portfolio variance, which results from it, describe a simplified approximation of the real markets when the volumes of all consecutive trades with the securities are assumed to be constant during the averaging interval. To show this, we consider the investor who doesn't trade shares of securities of his portfolio. The investor only observes the trades made in the market with his securities and derives the time series that model the trades with his portfolio as with a single security. These time series describe the portfolio return and variance in exactly the same way as the time series of trades with securities describe their returns and variances. The portfolio time series reveal the dependence of portfolio random returns on the random returns of securities and on the ratio of the random volumes of trades with the securities to the random volumes of trades with the portfolio. If we assume that all volumes of the consecutive trades with securities are constant, obtain Markowitz's equation for the portfolio's random returns. The market-based variance of the portfolio accounts for the effects of random fluctuations of the volumes of the consecutive trades. The use of Markowitz variance may give significantly higher or lower estimates than market-based portfolio variance.</description>
