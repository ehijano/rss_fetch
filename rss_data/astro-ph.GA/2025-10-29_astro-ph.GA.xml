      <title>The SARAO MeerKAT Galactic Plane Survey compact source catalogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a catalogue of compact sources detected in the SARAO MeerKAT 1.3 GHz Galactic Plane Survey (SMGPS). We extract 510599 compact sources, with areas less than five 8" beams, from the survey maps covering the regions $252\deg&lt; l &lt; 358^\deg$ and $2\deg &lt; l &lt; 61\deg$ at $|b| \leq 1.5^\deg$, which have an angular resolution of 8" and a sensitivity of $\sim$ 10-30 $\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$. In this paper, we describe the source identification and characterisation methods, present the quality assurance of the catalogue, explore the nature of the catalogue sources, and present initial science highlights. We limit our catalogue to sources with a signal-to-noise ratio $\geq 5$, as the catalogue is $\sim$90 per cent complete, and has a false positive rate of less than 1 per cent at this threshold. The bulk of the catalogue sources are previously unknown to the literature, with the majority of unknown sources at sub-mJy levels. Initial science highlights from the catalogue include the detection of 213 radio quiet WISE HII region candidates, previously undetected in radio continuum studies. We show images that compare the SMGPS compact sources to CORNISH ultracompact HII regions, thus highlighting the sensitivity and unprecedented uv-coverage of the SMGPS, and the potential synergy of the SMGPS with other surveys.</description>

      <title>Galaxy Spin Alignment with Tidal Fields in the SDSS-IV MaNGA Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tidal torque theory (TTT) predicts that galaxy spins are correlated with the surrounding tidal field, reflecting how angular momentum is acquired during structure formation. We present a new observational test of this prediction using the final data release of the SDSS-IV MaNGA integral field spectroscopy survey, which enables direct spin measurements from stellar and ionized gas kinematics for nearly 10,000 galaxies. Unlike previous studies that relied on filament orientations, we directly utilize the three-dimensional tidal field reconstructed from the galaxy distribution, providing a physically defined reference frame for the analysis. We find that massive galaxies tend to align their spins parallel to the intermediate axis of the tidal field, consistent with the prediction of the TTT. They also tend to orient perpendicular to the major axis, hinting at the possible influence of baryonic processes. In contrast, low-mass galaxies exhibit the opposite trend, with a transition mass of $M_*\sim10^{10}-10^{10.5}\,M_\odot$. No significant alignment is detected with respect to the minor axis across all stellar masses. We further examine the dependence on morphology and environment, finding that S0 and early-type spiral galaxies exhibit stronger alignment signals than late-type spirals. The alignment trend becomes particularly pronounced in regions of high tidal anisotropy and high overdensity. A mutual information analysis identifies these environmental factors as the dominant drivers of the observed trends. Our results provide the most direct empirical evidence to date for the connection between galaxy spins and the cosmic tidal field.</description>

      <title>Molecular Gas in Major Mergers Hosting Dual and Single AGN at &lt;10 kpc Nuclear Separations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present high-resolution ($\sim$50$-$100 pc) Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) observations of $^{12}$CO(2-1) or $^{12}$CO(1-0) emission in seven local ($z$ $\lesssim$ 0.05) major mergers -- five of which are dual active galactic nuclei (AGN) systems, and two of which are single AGN systems. We model the molecular gas kinematics through rotating disk profiles using a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo approach. The residuals were then used to isolate non-rotating components of the molecular gas -- the most likely contributor to future SMBH growth. We find that more massive SMBHs have higher surface densities of non-rotating molecular gas within their sphere of influence. This potential molecular gas supply, however, does not correlate with the current accretion efficiency of the SMBHs, suggesting that only a fraction of the observed non-rotating gas is currently reaching the SMBH. Finally, we tentatively find no significant differences in the nuclear molecular gas masses of single AGN and dual AGN hosts, both within the SMBH sphere of influence and within the central kiloparsec. Our results indicate that the probability of occurrence of the dual AGN phenomenon is likely dependent on AGN variability and/or obscuration rather than the availability of molecular gas in the nuclear regions.</description>

      <title>Galactic Alchemy: Deep Learning Map-to-Map Translation in Hydrodynamical Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first systematic study of multi-domain map-to-map translation in galaxy formation simulations, leveraging deep generative models to predict diverse galactic properties. Using high-resolution magneto-hydrodynamical simulation data, we compare conditional generative adversarial networks and diffusion models under unified preprocessing and evaluation, optimizing architectures and attention mechanisms for physical fidelity on galactic scales. Our approach jointly addresses seven astrophysical domains - including dark matter, gas, neutral hydrogen, stellar mass, temperature, and magnetic field strength - while introducing physics-aware evaluation metrics that quantify structural realism beyond standard computer vision measures. We demonstrate that translation difficulty correlates with physical coupling, achieving near-perfect fidelity for mappings from gas to dark matter and mappings involving astro-chemical components such as total gas to HI content, while identifying fundamental challenges in weakly constrained tasks such as gas to stellar mass mappings. Our results establish GAN-based models as competitive counterparts to state-of-the-art diffusion approaches at a fraction of the computational cost (in training and inference), paving the way for scalable, physics-aware generative frameworks for forward modelling and observational reconstruction in the SKA era.</description>

      <title>Does Machine Learning Work? A Comparative Analysis of Strong Gravitational Lens Searches in the Dark Energy Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic comparison of three independent machine learning (ML)-based searches for strong gravitational lenses applied to the Dark Energy Survey (Jacobs et al. 2019a,b; Rojas et al. 2022; Gonzalez et al. 2025). Each search employs a distinct ML architecture and training strategy, allowing us to evaluate their relative performance, completeness, and complementarity. Using a visually inspected sample of 1651 systems previously reported as lens candidates, we assess how each model scores these systems and quantify their agreement with expert classifications. The three models show progressive improvement in performance, with F1-scores of 0.31, 0.35, and 0.54 for Jacobs, Rojas, and Gonzalez, respectively. Their completeness for moderate- to high-confidence lens candidates follows a similar trend (31%, 52%, and 70%). When combined, the models recover 82% of all such systems, highlighting their strong complementarity. Additionally, we explore ensemble strategies: average, median, linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and an Independent Bayesian method. We find that all but averaging achieve higher maximum F1 scores than the best individual model, with some ensemble methods improving precision by up to a factor of six. These results demonstrate that combining multiple, diverse ML classifiers can substantially improve the completeness of lens samples while drastically reducing false positives, offering practical guidance for optimizing future ML-based strong lens searches in wide-field surveys.</description>

      <title>Spatial-Kinematic Absorption Models of the Circumgalactic Medium. II. Ionized Gas Phases and Absorption Lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this two-paper series, we present a straightforward mathematical model for synthesizing quasar absorption line profiles from sight lines through idealized, spatial-kinematic models of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) and their host galaxies. In Paper I, we developed the spatial components of the galaxy/CGM structures (disk, halo, wind, accretion) and their 3D velocity fields. We derived the formalism for arbitrary observed orientation of the galaxy/CGM model and quasar line of sight positioning. In this paper, following a brief review of Paper I, we present the formalism for populating the galaxy/CGM structures with multiphase photoionized and collisionally ionized gas and for generating HI and metal-line absorption profiles. Example absorption line systems through a fiducial galaxy/CGM model are presented. These flexible spatial-kinematic absorption models (SKAMs) can be directly applied to and/or easily modified/expanded for studying individual or ensembles of observed absorption line systems, for exploring various competing theoretical scenarios of the baryon cycle as studied through quasar absorption line systems, and/or serving as pedagogical tools for developing physical intuition. We briefly describe a SKAM GUI that is in early stages of development.</description>

      <title>MAGNUS I: A MUSE-DEEP sample of early-type galaxies at intermediate redshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a sample of 212 early-type galaxies (ETGs) at redshifts $0.25 &lt; z &lt; 0.75$. We combine deep integral-field spectroscopy from the MUSE-DEEP survey with high-resolution HST imaging to study the structure, kinematics, and stellar populations of these galaxies. We measure spatially resolved stellar kinematics and use the specific angular momentum proxy, $\lambda_R$, to classify galaxies into fast and slow rotators. We find a slow rotator fraction consistent with local Universe samples, suggesting little evolution in the massive ETG population since $z \sim 1$. The kinematic and photometric axes of fast rotators are generally well-aligned, similar to their local counterparts. We find that global stellar population properties, such as age, metallicity, and mass-to-light ratio ($M_*/L$), correlate strongly with the central velocity dispersion ($\sigma_\mathrm{e}$), following trends established for local ETGs. Slow rotators are typically more massive, have higher $\sigma_\mathrm{e}$, and are more metal-rich than fast rotators. Our findings indicate that the fundamental structural, kinematic, and stellar population scaling relations of massive ETGs were already in place by $z \sim 0.75$, suggesting their evolutionary pathways have remained stable over the last $\sim 7$ Gyr.</description>

      <title>MAGNUS II: Rotational support of massive early-type galaxies decreased over the past 7 billion years</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how the internal kinematics of massive galaxies evolve is key to constraining the physical processes that drive their assembly. We investigate the evolution of rotational support in massive ($\log M_{\ast}/M_{\odot} \geq 10.6$) early-type galaxies (ETGs) over the past $\sim$7 Gyr. We use MUSE integral-field spectroscopic (IFS) data for 212 ETGs at intermediate redshift ($0.25 &lt; z &lt; 0.75$) from the MAGNUS sample. We compare their kinematics to a carefully matched local sample of 787 ETGs ($z \leq 0.05$) from the MaNGA survey. Using the specific stellar angular momentum proxy, $\lambda_R$, we quantify the balance between ordered rotation and random motions. We derive intrinsic $\lambda_R$ values by applying a uniform correction for seeing and point-spread function (PSF) effects to both samples. We find a significant evolutionary trend: the intermediate-redshift ETGs are systematically more rotationally supported than their local counterparts. The median PSF-corrected $\lambda_R$ for the MAGNUS sample is $0.48 \pm 0.05$, substantially higher than the median of $0.34 \pm 0.03$ for the matched MaNGA sample. This corresponds to a positive slope in the $\lambda_R-z$ relation of $\mathrm{d} \lambda_R / \mathrm{d} z = 0.3 \pm 0.04$ for the combined sample. The decline in rotational support is most pronounced for the most massive galaxies ($\log M_{\ast}/M_{\odot} &gt; 11.3$). Our results provide robust evidence that massive ETGs have undergone significant kinematic evolution, losing angular momentum as they evolve towards the present day, consistent with theoretical models where processes such as dry mergers play a crucial role in shaping the dynamical state of galaxies.</description>

      <title>Tracing Cloud Formation and Evolution Through 3D Magnetic Field Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose to use the unprecedented polarization sensitivity of PRIMA's PRIMAger Polarization Imager and its high resolution in Band 1 (92 $\mu$m) to map magnetic fields across two contrasting molecular cloud environments: the well-studied Perseus cloud and the isolated Musca filament. This comparative study will leverage the existing VLA radio observations that provide line-of-sight magnetic field component of the Perseus cloud, along with upcoming POSSUM survey results for Musca, to construct the first detailed 3D magnetic field vector maps at sub-parsec resolution. Perseus, with its known formation history through interstellar structure (e.g., bubble) interactions, will reveal how magnetic fields evolve during active star formation phases, while Musca, an isolated filament with lower star-formation activity, will show magnetic field morphology in early evolutionary stages. With PRIMA's resolution of 0.01 pc for Perseus and $&lt;0.01$ pc for Musca, we will resolve magnetic field structures at scales necessary for understanding cloud fragmentation and star formation efficiency, and the roles that magnetic fields play in these processes. Our survey will require approximately 1438 hours to cover 42 deg$^2$ of Perseus and 12 deg$^2$ of Musca. With this, we aim to provide the first comprehensive view of how environment and evolutionary state may influence magnetic field evolution in molecular clouds and how magnetic fields influence cloud formation, fragmentation, and star formation.</description>

      <title>How External Medium outside Prestellar Cores Affects Protostellar Growth: Variations in Accretion Rate and Evolution of Disks and Outflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how the external medium surrounding prestellar cores affects the star formation process by conducting three-dimensional resistive magnetohydrodynamic simulations. The initial cores follow critical Bonnor-Ebert profiles and are embedded in environments with different ambient densities. The simulations follow the evolution at least until the envelope mass within a radius equal to twice the critical Bonnor-Ebert radius drops to 35% of the initial cloud mass. We reveal that in environments with higher external density, enhanced mass inflow from the envelope leads to Bondi-like accretion as the protostellar mass increases. The continued inflow substantially increases the final stellar mass, resulting in star formation efficiencies that appear to exceed unity in dense environments. The external medium also influences the evolution of circumstellar disks and protostellar outflows: with the high-density external medium, disks grow rapidly but their mass becomes smaller relative to the protostellar mass, and the outflow is sustained over a long duration. However, the ratio of angular momentum removed by outflows and magnetic braking to that introduced by inflowing gas decreases with increasing external density. These results suggest that the density of the external medium regulates not only protostellar mass growth but also the inflow-outflow balance and angular momentum transport in magnetized, rotating star-forming cores.</description>

      <title>Self-supervised Synthetic Pretraining for Inference of Stellar Mass Embedded in Dense Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar mass is a fundamental quantity that determines the properties and evolution of stars. However, estimating stellar masses in star-forming regions is challenging because young stars are obscured by dense gas and the regions are highly inhomogeneous, making spherical dynamical estimates unreliable. Supervised machine learning could link such complex structures to stellar mass, but it requires large, high-quality labeled datasets from high-resolution magneto-hydrodynamical (MHD) simulations, which are computationally expensive. We address this by pretraining a vision transformer on one million synthetic fractal images using the self-supervised framework DINOv2, and then applying the frozen model to limited high-resolution MHD simulations. Our results demonstrate that synthetic pretraining improves frozen-feature regression stellar mass predictions, with the pretrained model performing slightly better than a supervised model trained on the same limited simulations. Principal component analysis of the extracted features further reveals semantically meaningful structures, suggesting that the model enables unsupervised segmentation of star-forming regions without the need for labeled data or fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>The luminosity function and clustering of bright quasars in the FLAMINGO cosmological simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmological hydrodynamical simulations are essential tools for studying the formation and evolution of galaxies and their central supermassive black holes. While they reproduce many key observed properties of galaxies, their limited volumes have hindered comprehensive studies of the AGN and quasar populations. In this work, we leverage the FLAMINGO simulation suite, focusing on its large $(2.8$ $\mathrm{Gpc})^3$ volume, to investigate two key observables of quasar activity: the quasar luminosity function (QLF) and quasar clustering. FLAMINGO reproduces the observed QLF at low redshift ($z \lesssim 1$) and for faint quasars ($L_\mathrm{bol} \lesssim 10^{45}$ $\mathrm{erg s^{-1}}$), but significantly underpredicts the abundance of bright quasars at $z \approx 1$-$3$. Introducing a 0.75 dex log-normal luminosity scatter to represent unresolved small-scale variability boosts the number of bright quasars by upscattering lower-luminosity systems, thereby improving agreement with observations at the bright end. A decomposition of the QLF by black hole mass reveals that this boost is primarily driven by low-mass black holes radiating above the Eddington limit. Nevertheless, limitations remain in fully reproducing the rise and decline of the bright quasar population over cosmic time and in matching the black hole masses inferred from quasar spectra. Thanks to FLAMINGO's large volume, we can robustly sample rare, luminous quasars and measure their spatial clustering for $\log_{10} L_\mathrm{bol}/\mathrm{erg s^{-1}} \gtrsim 45.5$. The simulation reproduces the observed clustering across $0 \lesssim z \lesssim 3$, and the reduced luminosity dependence introduced by scatter aligns with observational trends. However, it underpredicts the clustering strength at $z \approx 4$, consistent with other models and possibly reflecting high-redshift observational uncertainties.</description>

Abstract: Quasar absorption systems not only affect the way quasars are selected, but also serve as key probes of galaxies, providing insight into their chemical evolution and interstellar medium (ISM). Recently, a method based on Gaia astrometric measurements has aided the selection of quasars reddened by dust hitherto overlooked. We conducted a spectroscopic study using VLT/X-Shooter on one such dust-reddened quasar, Q2310-3358. This quasar, at $z = 2.3908\pm0.0003$, is associated with a Damped Lyman-alpha absorber (DLA) at nearly the same redshift $2.4007\pm0.0003$, with a neutral hydrogen column density of $\log N(\mathrm{H\,I}) = 21.214 \pm 0.003$. The DLA is very metal-rich (close to the Solar metallicity after correction for depletion on dust grains). Its properties align with the metal-to-dust ratio and the mass-metallicity relation established in previous large samples of DLAs. Surprisingly, given its proximity to the quasar in redshift, the absorber has strong cold gas characteristics, including CI and H$_2$. Based on the derived kinetic temperature of $71^{+28}_{-15}$~K, we infer the presence of a strong UV radiation field, which in turn suggests that the quasar and the DLA are in close proximity, i.e. part of the same galaxy and not just different objects in the same overdensity of galaxies. We use the line ratios of the CI fine-structure lines to constrain the density of the cold gas, yielding $n_{\rm H} \sim 10^{3}~\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$. Our analysis extends the understanding of $z_{abs} \approx z_{em}$ absorption line systems and provides valuable constraints on the interplay between dust, metals, and neutral gas in the ISM of early galaxies.</description>

      <title>Detailed Abundance Determination of Metal-Poor Stars with X-Shooter I. Unusual Chemistry in Halo Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed chemical analysis study of 16 candidate metal-poor stars, previously identified with 2dF+AAOmega, using X-Shooter spectra and the Korg 1D LTE spectral synthesis code. We generally confirm the earlier metallicity estimates and reveal four EMP ([Fe/H] $&lt; -3$) stars in the current sample. Two of these stars, including the most metal-poor at [Fe/H] = $-3.83 \pm 0.07$, are kinematically associated with the GSE accretion event, increasing the number of known GSE stars with [Fe/H] $&lt; -3.5$ to eight. From the X-Shooter spectra we also determine abundances for 16 elements, with the element-to-iron abundance ratios generally consistent with high-resolution studies of Galactic halo stars. Within the sample, we identify three peculiar stars: the first is a GSE nitrogen enhanced metal poor (NEMP; [N/Fe] $= 1.62 \pm 0.10$ and [C/Fe] $= 0.27 \pm 0.08$) star with unusually high Na ([Na/Fe] $= 2.28 \pm 0.07$) and Li (A(Li)$_{\rm 3DNLTE} = 1.90 \pm 0.08$) abundances, but which lacks any enhancement in [Al/Fe] or [Mg/Fe]. The second is a halo r-II star significantly enhanced in Sr ([Sr/Ba] $= 0.37 \pm 0.08$), suggesting mixture of r-process and s-process enrichment, uncommon for r-II stars. Whilst the third is a halo star very depleted in N ([N/Fe] $&lt; -1.13$), with low C ([C/Fe] $= -0.36 \pm 0.08$) and otherwise 'normal' [X/Fe] abundances, suggesting enrichment with Type II supernova that proceeds enrichment from massive AGB stars. This study reveals the substantial degree of chemical diversity in the stellar populations which assembled the early Milky Way.</description>

      <title>A possible trigger of the multiple population phenomenon in star clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple populations (MPs) is a intra-star cluster phenomenon consisting in star-to-star variation of the abundance of some light chemical elements. They have been observed in many star clusters, most of them old globular clusters, populating the Milky Way and other satellite galaxies. Since the study of MPs became more systematic, different astrophysical parameters have been claimed to be the main responsible for its occurrence. However, at the present time, no attempt would seem to have solved this conundrum. This work deals with a potential trigger of the MPs phenomenon, based on the gathered observational evidence of the existence of MPs in some star clusters and the absence of its in others. We found that star clusters with MPs mostly formed during time intervals of intense star formation activity in a galaxy, for instance during the galaxy formation epoch, a close galaxy encounter, etc. At those time intervals where relative peaks in the galaxy star formation rate occur, star clusters with masses above a lower mass limit harbour MPs. This lower star cluster mass limit would marginally depend on the star cluster age.</description>

      <title>Spatial-Kinematic Absorption Models of the Circumgalactic Medium. I. Structures, Orientations, and Kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this two-paper series, we present a straightforward mathematical model for synthesizing quasar absorption line profiles from sight lines through idealized, spatial-kinematic models of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) and their host galaxies. Here, in Paper I, we develop the spatial geometries of multiple galaxy/CGM structures and populate these structures with 3D velocity fields. For arbitrary viewing angles and galaxy-quasar impact parameters, we derive observer coordinate-based expressions for the perceived azimuthal angle and galaxy inclination and a generalized scalar expression for the line-of-sight velocity as a function of position along the line of sight. We motivate and develop four idealized galaxy/CGM spatial-kinematic structures based on empirical data and theoretical predictions: (1) a rotating galactic disk/extra-planar gas, (2) a static or dynamic spherical halo, (3) an outflowing bi-polar galactic wind, and (4) an inward spiraling flared planar accretion. Using a small set of free parameters, the spatial geometries and velocity fields can be adjusted and explored, including velocity gradients, wind stalling, and accretion trajectories. These spatial-kinematic models are designed to be flexible and easily modified and can be tailored for studying individual galaxy-absorber pairs or galaxy group environments; they can be applied to real-world observations or hydrodynamic simulations of the baryon cycle as studied through quasar absorption line systems. These models also serve as tools for developing physical intuition. In Paper II, we will present the formalism for populating the galaxy/CGM structures with multiphase photoionized and collisionally ionized gas and for generating absorption profiles for ions of interest.</description>

      <title>Half-Light Radius Measurements of Andromeda Dwarf Satellites from the Isaac Newton Telescope Survey Using Exponential, Plummer, and S\'ersic Fits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present half-light radius measurements for the dwarf satellites of Andromeda, based on multi-epoch imaging from the Isaac Newton Telescope (INT) Monitoring Survey of Local Group dwarf galaxies. This analysis is conducted within a larger study to identify long-period variable (LPV) stars in these galaxies. The survey was performed with the Wide Field Camera on the 2.5-m INT and covers multiple epochs obtained between 2015 and 2018 in the i (Sloan) and V (Harris) bands. To determine the half-light radii, we derived surface brightness and number density profiles for each system and fitted them with Exponential, Plummer, and S\'ersic models. The resulting half-light radii are in good agreement with literature values but reveal subtle variations linked to differences in stellar distribution and morphology. Distances were independently estimated using the Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) method, yielding values consistent with previous determinations. The complete photometric and variability catalogs will be made publicly available through CDS/VizieR, providing a valuable resource and foundation for future studies of the structure, stellar populations, and evolution of Andromeda's dwarf companions.</description>

      <title>Kinematic, Elemental and Structural Dependences on Metallicity in the Galactic Bulge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We selected Bulge stars from APOGEE DR17 cross-matched with astrometric data from \textit{Gaia} DR3. Bulge stars were divided into sub-samples with line-of-sight velocity dispersion analyzed and the peaks of MDF were detected by both Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) and \texttt{scipy.signal.find\_peaks}. GMM is also conducted to kinematically distinguish the metal-poor and metal-rich populations. Analyses were put on the Bulge stars (including retrograde stars), their elemental abundances, and the [Mg/Mn]-[Al/Fe] plane to investigate potential accreted components. Finally, the shapes (X-shaped/boxy) of Bulge stars with different metallicities were analyzed through least-squares fitting based on the analytical Bulge models. By studying the kinematic, elemental and structural dependences on metallicity for Bulge stars, our findings are concluded as follows: 1. Six peaks are detected in the Bulge MDF, encompassing values reported in previous studies, suggesting a complex composition of Bulge populations. 2. An inversion relationship is well-observed in metal-rich sub-samples, while absent in metal-poor sub-samples. 3. Metal-poor populations exhibit larger dispersions than metal-rich stars (which is also revealed by GMM decomposition), suggesting that metal-rich stars are kinematically coherent. 4. Retrograde stars are confined to $\sim1$ kpc of the Galactic center, with their relative fraction decreasing at higher [Fe/H] -- a trend potentially linked to the ``spin-up'' process of Galactic disks. 5. Metal-rich Bulge stars with [Al/Fe] $&lt;-0.15$ are likely associated with from disk accreted substructure, while all elemental planes exhibit bimodality but Na abundances rise monotonically with metallicity. 6. In general, stars with all metallicities support a boxy profile.</description>

      <title>Planetary nebulae as tracers of accreted stellar populations in massive galaxies in groups and clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planetary nebulae (PNe) are valuable spatial and kinematic tracers of nearby galaxies. In this mini-review, I focus on their role in tracing the halo and intra-cluster/intra-group light assembly in groups and clusters of galaxies within 100~Mpc and, in particular, the link between characteristic PN metrics such as the $\alpha$-parameter and the PN luminosity function and changes from the underlying in-situ to ex-situ stellar populations. These results from nearby groups and clusters are placed into context with integral-field spectroscopic surveys of galaxies, which allow the co-spatial measurement of PN and stellar population properties. I provide an outlook on upcoming instrumentation that will provide new opportunities for the study of extragalactic PN populations. I address the challenges of reconciling observations of extragalactic PN populations with predictions from stellar evolution models and how revised late-stellar-evolution models have alleviated some of the tensions between observations and theory.</description>

      <title>JWST observations of photodissociation regions III. Dust modelling at the illuminated edge of the Horsehead PDR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carbonaceous nano-grains are a significant component of interstellar dust and dominate the mid-infrared emission of photodissociation regions (PDRs). We study the evolution of nano-grains across the illuminated edge of the Horsehead PDR, especially their abundance and size properties. This work is part of the Physics and Chemistry of PDR Fronts program studying dust and gas in PDRs with JWST. We use NIRCam+MIRI photometric bands and NIRSpec+MRS spectroscopy to map the illuminated edge. We model dust emission using the THEMIS dust model with the SOC radiative transfer code. Detailed modeling of high angular resolution JWST data allows us to obtain constraints on nano-grain properties. We find that diffuse ISM dust cannot account for the observed data, requiring evolved grains. A sharp density increase is observed at the illuminated edge, consistent with ALMA observations revealing a sharp transition between molecular and ionized gas. Although the PDR length could not be directly determined, we estimate an upper limit of approximately 0.015 pc. This implies a lower limit on small grain abundance (greater than 0.003), showing small grains are not depleted at the Horsehead edge, unlike in the Orion Bar. Our findings indicate a high-density environment and less steep size distribution for nano-grains at the illuminated edge versus the diffuse ISM. This implies nano-grain destruction mechanisms might be less efficient in the Horsehead's moderate-UV field than in more intense PDRs. These results support a model where nano-grain population recovery is slower in moderate-UV environments, leading to a unique dust size distribution at the edge of the Horsehead Nebula.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Cosmic Ray Transport on the $\gamma$-Ray Luminosity of Diffuse Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of $\gamma$-rays from diffuse gas provide the opportunity to study the distribution of high energy particles in different astrophysical environments. In the circumgalactic medium (CGM) and the intracluster medium (ICM), it is expected that relativistic cosmic rays collide with thermal particles and produce $\gamma$-rays through pion decay. The $\gamma$-ray luminosity of a plasma depends on where cosmic rays are: if they are in denser gas, they produce more $\gamma$-rays. In this work, we study how different cosmic-ray transport mechanisms impact the $\gamma$-ray luminosity of a turbulent, multiphase medium formed from an initially diffuse medium. Two quantities set the luminosity: the average cosmic-ray energy density and the correlation of cosmic-ray energy and gas density. Overall, cosmic rays must escape cold dense regions in order to produce less $\gamma$-ray emission and be consistent with observations. Our simulations with fast transport mechanisms (either diffusion or streaming) are degenerate: they each produce a lower $\gamma$-ray luminosity than slow transport simulations by two orders of magnitude. This result means that fast transport (particularly in dense clumps) is necessary for simulations to agree with the dearth of observations of $\gamma$-ray emission from diffuse gas like the CGM and ICM. We also show the significant difference in luminosity is the result of cosmic-ray reacceleration. This reacceleration is different from the turbulent reacceleration described by Ptuskin (1988). Instead, condensing, cold clouds drive a significant increase in the average cosmic-ray energy and, as a result, the $\gamma$-ray luminosity.</description>

      <title>Implications for the formation of Oort cloud-like structures and interstellar comets in dense environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most stars form in dense stellar environments, where frequent close encounters can strongly perturb and reshape the early architecture of planetary systems. The solar system, with its rich population of distant comets, provides a natural laboratory to study these processes. We perform detailed numerical simulations using the LonelyPlanets framework that combines NBODY6++GPU and REBOUND, to explore the evolution of debris disks around solar system analogues embedded in stellar clusters. Two initial configurations are considered, an $Extended$ and a $Compact$ model, each containing four giant planets and either an extended or compact debris disk. We find that compact disks primarily form Kuiper belt and scattered disk-like populations through planet-disk interactions, while extended disks are more strongly shaped by stellar encounters, producing Oort cloud-like structures and interstellar comets with ejection velocities of 1-3 km/s. Stellar perturbations are most effective for encounter inclinations between $0^{\circ}$ and $30^{\circ}$, giving rise to distinct dynamical populations, like Sednoids, and inner Oort cloud analogues, and a characteristic tail in semi-major axis-eccentricity space. In coplanar encounters, the disk remains largely flattened, whereas polar flybys redistribute angular momentum vertically, producing nearly isotropic outer populations that resemble an emerging Oort cloud. Our results suggest that cometary reservoirs and interstellar objects are natural byproducts of planet-disk interactions and stellar flybys in dense clusters, linking the architecture of outer planetary systems to their birth environments.</description>

      <title>Gravothermal collapse of self-interacting dark-matter halos with anisotropic velocity distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-gravitating galactic halos composed of self-interacting dark matter exhibit the formation of a highly dense core at the galactic center--a gravothermal collapse. Analytic models to describe this evolution have been developed and calibrated to numerical simulations initialized with isotropic particle velocity distributions, an assumption not necessarily warranted by the theory of halo formation. Here we study the dependence of the timescale for gravothermal collapse on the velocity distribution. To do so, we consider self-consistent initial conditions for halos with the same density distribution but with different velocity distributions. We consider models with constant anisotropy and with an anisotropy that increases with radius. The velocity distributions that we explore have collapse times that differ from that assuming isotropic distributions by more than a factor of two. We argue that these variations may depend on the global changes in velocity-dispersion profiles in these anisotropic models and not just on the degree of anisotropy.</description>

      <title>Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, Roman Sees Where You Are: Predicting Exoplanet Transit Yields in the Rosette Nebula with the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Young stars host only a small fraction of the known exoplanet population because their photometric variability, magnetic activity, and frequent placement in dense, poorly-resolved regions hamper exoplanet detections. Yet, measuring planets at these ages is crucial since these phases are when dynamical processes that drive planetary migration are most active. We assess the expected yield of a hypothetical Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope transit survey of the Rosette Nebula, a $\sim10\,\mathrm{Myr}$ star-forming region with a dense and diverse stellar population. Using the Roman Exposure Time Calculator to quantify sensitivity to Rosette members, we establish detection thresholds for companions and evaluate yields via Monte Carlo injection-recovery simulations. We predict the detection of $33 \pm 9$ young transiting exoplanets orbiting stellar hosts in a month-long survey, and $29 \pm 8$ in a two-week survey. The extended baseline primarily improves sensitivity to longer-period planets orbiting FGK stars, while most M dwarf detections are well-sampled within two weeks. Irrespective of the temporal baseline, transit detections are dominated by of 1-2\,$R_\oplus$ super-Earths and sub-Neptunes with $P\lesssim8$\,days. Such a sample would substantially expand the census of only three detected planets younger than $20\,\mathrm{Myr}$, probing an age regime in which planetary radii remain inflated, the stability of close-in orbits is uncertain, and planetary migration may still be ongoing. This survey offers a path to constrain early planetary evolution and establish prime follow-up targets for the James Webb Space Telescope, Vera Rubin Observatory, and the Habitable Worlds Observatory.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the soft X-ray source population towards the inner Galactic disk with XMM-Newton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Across the Galactic disk lies a diverse population of X-ray sources, with the fainter end remaining poorly understood due to past survey sensitivity limits. We aim to classify and characterize faint X-ray sources detected in the eROSITA All-Sky Survey (eRASS1) towards the inner Galactic disk ($350^\circ &lt; l &lt; 360^\circ$, $-1^\circ &lt; b &lt; 1^\circ$) using deeper XMM-Newton observations (typical exposure of $\sim 20\,\text{ks}$). We analyzed 189 eRASS1 sources, combining X-ray spectral fitting ($0.2$--$10\,\text{keV}$) with Gaia astrometric and photometric data for robust classification. Our results show that the eRASS1 catalog towards the Galactic disk is overwhelmingly dominated by coronal sources ($\sim 74\%$), primarily active stars and binaries, with $\sim 8\%$ being wind-powered massive stars and $\sim 18\%$ being accreting compact objects. We propose an empirical hardness-ratio cut ($\text{HR} &gt; -0.2$) to efficiently isolate these non-coronal sources. By stacking the classified population and comparing with the Galactic Ridge X-ray Emission (GRXE), we estimate that $\sim 6\%$ of the GRXE flux in the $0.5$--$2.0\,\text{keV}$ band is resolved into point sources above the eRASS1 flux limit ($\sim 5\times 10^{-14}\,\text{erg}\,\text{cm}^{-2}\,\text{s}^{-1}$). This resolved soft-band emission is dominated by active stars, while hard-band flux originates primarily from X-ray binaries. We conclude that the eRASS1 catalog retains a non-negligible population of compact objects that can be effectively distinguished using X-ray color selection.</description>

      <title>Rest-frame Optical Spectroscopy of $z \sim 2$ Quasars with Steep Hard X-ray Spectral Shapes: X-ray Selection of Super-Eddington Accretion and Verification</title>

Abstract: Super-Eddington accretion is a crucial phase in the growth of supermassive black holes. However, identifying super-Eddington accreting quasars observationally is challenging due to uncertain black-hole mass estimates and other complications. The Eddington ratio parameter does not represent accurately the accretion rate in the super-Eddington regime. On the other hand, super-Eddington accreting quasars appear to show large hard X-ray (rest-frame &gt; 2 keV) power-law photon indices, and they also exhibit distinct optical spectral features including weak [O III] $\lambda 5007$ emission and strong Fe II emission. We test steep X-ray photon-index selection of super-Eddington accreting quasars by obtaining Palomar 200-inch Hale Telescope near-infrared spectra for a pilot sample of nine $\Gamma=2.0-2.6$ quasars at $z\approx1.4-2.5$. We derive H$\beta$-based single-epoch virial black-hole masses (median value $\rm 4.3 \times 10^{8}~M_{\odot}$) and Eddington ratios (median value 0.6). The Eddington ratio distribution is consistent with that of the comparison sample, which is a flux-limited sample of quasars at $z\approx1.5-3.5$ with near-infrared spectroscopy. But our super-Eddington candidates do show statistically weaker [O III] emission ($P_{\rm null}=0.0075$) and marginally stronger Fe II emission ($P_{\rm null}=0.06$). We also find one candidate with broad (width of 1960 km/s) and blueshifted (690 km/s) [O III] $\lambda 4959$ and [O III] $\lambda 5007$ lines, which probably originate from a strong [O III] outflow driven by super-Eddington accretion. Overall, the steep X-ray photon-index selection of super-Eddington accreting quasars appears promising. But a larger sample is needed to assess further the reliability of the selection.</description>

      <title>Diverse Emission Patterns from Precessing Super-Eddington Disks Formed in Tidal Disruption Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A tidal disruption event (TDE) occurs when a star passes within the tidal radius of a supermassive black hole (SMBH). In TDEs it is expected that the orbital angular momentum of the disrupted star is generally misaligned with the SMBH spin axis, which should result in a misaligned super-Eddington disk precessing around the SMBH spin axis due to the Lense-Thirring effect. In this paper, we investigate the distinct observational signatures produced from such TDE disks, by performing radiative transfer calculations upon previous super-Eddington disk simulations. We demonstrate that the precession of the disk and wind drive time-dependent obscuration and reprocessing of X-ray radiation. Depending on the orientation of the viewing angle of the observer and the tilt angle of the disk, four main types of variability are induced: 1) The smooth-TDEs: The emissions from these TDEs show no fluctuations; 2) The dimmer: The main emission type (X-ray or optical) stays the same, with small to moderate modulations of brightness; 3) The blinker: X-ray and optical emissions take turns to dominate in one cycle of precession, with dramatic changes in the X-ray fluxes. 4) The siren: X-ray and optical emissions take over each other twice per cycle, possibly with two different peak X-ray fluxes within one cycle. In all three scenarios, we observe an inverse correlation between X-ray and optical emissions. Our model provides a unified physical framework for interpreting TDE multi-wavelength variability through disk precession dynamics and gives an alternative interpretation to the interesting case of J045650.3-203750 which was suggested to be a repeated partial TDE previously.</description>

      <title>CSST Slitless Spectra: Target Detection and Classification with YOLO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Addressing the spatial uncertainty and spectral blending challenges in CSST slitless spectroscopy, we present a deep learning-driven, end-to-end framework based on the You Only Look Once (YOLO) models. This approach directly detects, classifies, and analyzes spectral traces from raw 2D images, bypassing traditional, error-accumulating pipelines. YOLOv5 effectively detects both compact zero-order and extended first-order traces even in highly crowded fields. Building on this, YOLO11 integrates source classification (star/galaxy) and discrete astrophysical parameter estimation (e.g., redshift bins), showcasing complete spectral trace analysis without other manual preprocessing. Our framework processes large images rapidly, learning spectral-spatial features holistically to minimize errors. We achieve high trace detection precision (YOLOv5) and demonstrate successful quasar identification and binned redshift estimation (YOLO11). This study establishes machine learning as a paradigm shift in slitless spectroscopy, unifying detection, classification, and preliminary parameter estimation in a scalable system. Future research will concentrate on direct, continuous prediction of astrophysical parameters from raw spectral traces.</description>

      <title>What is the nature of late infall streamers?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Growing observational evidence suggests that Class II protoplanetary disks may undergo substantial interactions with their environment in the form of late infall. This mass inflow predominantly manifests itself in the form of so-called streamers: filaments and arcs of gas connecting large-scale, extended gas structures to disk scales. Prevalent late infall has far-reaching consequences for planet formation theory, challenging the long-standing treatment of evolved disks in isolation. In this work, we investigate the emergence of late-infall streamers in different formation scenarios, their morphology and multiplicity, as well as their dependence on environmental conditions. We conduct this investigation by performing 3D hydrodynamical simulation using the grid-based code FARGO3D, which we post-process to obtain synthetic observations using the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code RADMC3D. We find that, while a late infall event in the form of a single encounter with a "cloudlet" of gas can produce a streamer via an interplay between the fall-back of bound material and shocks, such features dissipate quickly, on a timescale of ~10 kyr. Furthermore, we find that streamers can also form naturally in a turbulent, dense environment without the need for such encounters, which could act to reconcile short-lived streamers with ubiquitous detection of these structures. Here, we find multiple co-existing streamers for a disk velocity relative to the interstellar medium of $v_\mathrm{sys}=0.5~\mathrm{km}~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and a turbulent velocity dispersion of $\sigma_\mathrm{turb}=0.5~\mathrm{km}~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. We find considerable dependence of the streamer morphology on the environment, which may act as a utility to constrain the physical conditions of the gas surrounding planet-forming disk, and therefore the conditions under which planets form.</description>

Abstract: The initial gravitational collapse of Dark Matter and gas forms a universal filamentary network where the first galaxies form, with shapes and sizes that depend on the choice of Dark Matter. Claims from deep space imaging surveys that elongated galaxies predominate at $z &gt; 3$ are examined here by comparison with detailed hydrodynamical simulations of Cold Dark Matter (CDM), Warm Dark Matter (WDM), and Wave/Fuzzy Dark Matter, $\psi$DM. For CDM and WDM we have sufficient volume, $10^{3}\,\mathrm{Mpc/h}^{3}$, to generate galaxies with stellar masses $&gt; 10^{9}\,M_{\odot}$ at $z &gt; 2$, allowing comparison with the CEERS and CANDELS surveys. We find the observed tendency towards elongated, prolate-shaped young galaxies is well matched by WDM, from material accreted along smooth filaments during the first $\simeq 500\,\mathrm{Myr}$, with little dependence on stellar mass. This contrasts with CDM, where the stellar morphology is mainly spheroidal, formed from merging of fragmented filaments. For CDM, several subhalos are predicted to be visible, whereas for WDM and $\psi$DM, early merging is rare. Our findings show how the shapes and sizes of early galaxies are sensitive to the smoothness of the underlying filament network, providing a new constraint on the nature of dark matter.</description>

      <title>BlackTHUNDER -- A non-stellar Balmer break in a black hole-dominated little red dot at $z=7.04$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent observations from JWST have revealed an abundant population of active galactic nuclei (AGN) and so-called ``Little Red Dots'' (LRDs) at $2\lesssim z \lesssim 11$, many of which are characterized by V-shaped UV-to-optical continua with turnovers around the Balmer limit. The physical nature of these LRDs is unclear, and it remains debated whether the peculiar spectral shape originates from AGN, compact galaxies, or both. We present the analysis of new NIRSpec-IFU data from the BlackTHUNDER JWST Large Programme and archival NIRSpec-MSA data of a lensed LRD at $z=7.04$. The spectra confirm the presence of a smooth Balmer break and a broad H$\beta$ tracing the Broad Line Region (BLR) of an AGN. The small velocity dispersion of the H$\beta$ narrow component indicates a small dynamical mass of the host galaxy of $M_{\rm dyn}&lt;4 \times 10^8~M_{\odot}$, which implies that the stellar population cannot contribute more than 10% to the optical continuum. We show that the Balmer break can be well described by an AGN continuum absorbed by very dense ($n_{\rm H}\sim 10^{10}~{\rm cm^{-3}}$) and nearly dust-free gas along our line-of-sight (possibly gas in the BLR or its surrounding). The same gas is expected to produce H$\beta$ absorption, at a level consistent with a tentative detection ($3\sigma$) in the high-resolution spectrum. Such a non-stellar origin of the Balmer break may apply to other LRDs, and would alleviate the issue of extremely high stellar mass surface densities inferred in the case of a stellar interpretation of the Balmer break. We note that this is a rare case of a black hole that is overmassive relative to both the host galaxy stellar and dynamical masses. We finally report indications of variability and the first attempt of AGN reverberation mapping at such an early epoch.</description>

      <title>Environmental dependence of galaxy properties in the southern GAMA regions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using data from the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey, we investigate how galaxy properties correlate with the local environment, focusing on the two southern regions of the survey (G02 and G23) that have not previously been examined in this context. We employ two-point and marked correlation functions to quantify the environmental dependence of galaxy color, stellar mass, luminosity across the $u$, $g$, $r$, $J$, and $K$ bands, as well as star formation rate (SFR) and specific star formation rate (sSFR). We also assess the impact of redshift incompleteness and cosmic variance on these clustering measurements. Our results show that $u-r$ and $g-r$ colors are most strongly correlated with local overdensity, followed by stellar mass. The sSFR exhibits a clear inverse relationship with density of the environment, consistent with the trend observed for $u$-band luminosity, which traces young stellar populations. In contrast, galaxies brighter in the $g$, $J$, and $K$ bands preferentially inhabit denser regions. By comparing our measurements from the southern regions with those from the equatorial regions of GAMA, we find that cosmic variance does not significantly influence our conclusions. However, redshift incompleteness affects the clustering measurements, as revealed through comparisons of subsets within the G02 region. The measured correlations provide key constraints for models of galaxy assembly across mass and environment, while the environmental trends in color and near-infrared luminosity offer a means to trace stellar mass growth and quenching with redshift.</description>

      <title>Collisionless relaxation to equilibrium distributions in cold dark matter halos: origin of the NFW profile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02104v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collisionless self-gravitating systems such as cold dark matter halos are known to harbor universal density profiles despite the intricate non-linear physics of hierarchical structure formation in the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. The origin of such states has been a persistent mystery, particularly because the physics of collisionless relaxation has remained poorly understood. To solve this long-standing problem, we develop a self-consistent quasilinear theory in action-angle space for the collisionless relaxation of inhomogeneous, self-gravitating systems by perturbing the governing Vlasov-Poisson equations. We obtain a quasilinear diffusion equation that describes the secular evolution of the mean coarse-grained distribution function $f_0$ of accreted matter in the fluctuating force field of a spherical isotropic halo. The diffusion coefficient not only depends on the fluctuation power spectrum but also on the evolving potential of the system, which reflects the self-consistency of the problem. Diffusive heating in the pre-assembled halo develops an $r^{-\gamma}$ inner density cusp, accretion and relaxation in which develops an $r^{-\beta}$ outer fall-off with $\beta \approx 5 - 2\gamma$ in the quasi-steady state. Spherical collapse theory dictates that a quasi-steady outer halo must settle to $\beta \approx 3$, for which the mass enclosed within a shell barely changes with time. This implies that $\gamma\approx 1$, which is possible in the quasilinear framework only if (i) the pre-assembled halo harbors an $r^{-\gamma_{\mathrm{P}}}$ profile with $\gamma_{\mathrm{P}} \gtrsim 0.5$, (ii) its fluctuations are correlated in time (red noise), and (iii) the initial value of $\gamma$ is smaller than $1$, implying that the $r^{-1}$ cusp is a neutral equilibrium. We demonstrate for the first time how the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile emerges as a quasi-steady state of collisionless relaxation.</description>

      <title>Microlensing of dark matter models in the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00770v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate constraints on the abundance of primordial black holes (PBHs) as dark matter (DM) candidates using five years of microlensing data from the OGLE survey. While the majority of OGLE's $\sim\!2000$ microlensing events are well-explained by stellar populations such as brown dwarfs, main-sequence stars, and compact remnants, a subset of six ultrashort-timescale events ($t_E \sim 0.1\text{--}0.3~\mathrm{days}$) may signal the presence of PBHs. Building upon prior work that adopted the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) DM profile, we examine how alternative DM halo models -- specifically the Einasto and Burkert profiles, affect microlensing predictions and the constraints on PBH abundance. In light of kinematic data of Milky Way, we could obtain the range of ($r_s, \rho_s$) for both profiles. We computed differential microlensing event rates for both profiles, using the main-sequence star rate as an observational benchmark. Our results show that neither the Einasto nor Burkert profiles reproduce the distribution of main-sequence star events, yet both allow for viable explanations of the ultrashort-timescale events with PBH masses $M_{\mathrm{PBH}} \sim 10^{-5} M_\odot$. Using a Poisson likelihood analysis under the null hypothesis that no PBH is observed in OGLE dataset, we derive $95\%~\text{C.L.}$ upper and lower bounds on $f_{\mathrm{PBH}}$ for both profiles, finding that the constraints are significantly relaxed under Burkert profiles compared to the NFW case. These results show the sensitivity of PBH constraints to the assumed DM halo structure and highlight the importance of accurately modeling the inner Galactic density profile to robustly assess PBH dark matter scenarios.</description>

      <title>The Balmer Break and Optical Continuum of Little Red Dots from Super-Eddington Accretion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The physical origin of Little Red Dots (LRDs)--compact extragalactic sources with red rest-optical continua and broad Balmer lines--remains elusive. The redness of LRDs is likely intrinsic, suggesting optically thick gas emitting at a characteristic effective temperature of $\sim5000{\rm~K}$. Meanwhile, many LRD spectra exhibit a Balmer break, often attributed to absorption by a dense gas shell surrounding an AGN. Using semi-analytical atmosphere models and radiation transport calculations, we show that a super-Eddington accretion system can give rise to a Balmer break and a red optical color simultaneously, without invoking external gas absorption for the break or dust reddening. The break originates from a discontinuity in opacity across the Balmer limit, similar to that of early-type stars, but the lower photosphere density of super-Eddington systems, $\rho&lt;10^{-9}{\rm~g~cm^{-3}}$, implies a significant opacity contrast even at a cool photosphere temperature of $\sim5000{\rm~K}$. Furthermore, while accretion in the form of a standard thin disk requires fine tuning to match the optical color of LRDs, an alternative scenario of a geometrically thick, roughly spherical accretion flow implies an effective temperature $4000{\rm~K}\lesssim T_{\rm eff}\lesssim6000{\rm~K}$ that is very insensitive to the accretion rate (analogous to the Hayashi line in stellar models). The continuum spectra from the latter scenario align with the Balmer break and optical color of currently known LRDs. We discuss predictions of our model and the prospects for more realistic spectra based on super-Eddington accretion simulations.</description>

      <title>Shocked, Heated, and Now Resolved: H$_2$ excitation in the low-luminosity AGN at M58 core with JWST</title>

Abstract: We present JWST NIRSpec and MIRI MRS observations of the central kiloparsec of M58 (NGC 4579), a nearby LINER galaxy hosting a low-luminosity AGN (LLAGN; $L_\mathrm{bol} \sim 10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$) with a low-power jet. These data provide an unprecedented view of the warm molecular gas phase and reveal clear signatures of feedback. We detect 44 H$_2$ lines, including bright pure rotational lines (S(1)-S(18)) and rovibrational lines up to $\nu=2$, probing a wide range of excitation conditions. Excitation diagrams show that rotational lines follow a power-law temperature distribution with an exponential cutoff, consistent with heating by low-velocity shocks. H$_2$ rovibrational lines deviate from thermal models primarily because of sub-thermal excitation at low density. Additionally, there may be a 10% contribution powered by AGN X-ray photons in the nucleus. The dust lanes associated with the spiral inflow appear dynamically undisturbed but show signs of shock heating, while the inner $\sim$200 pc exhibits turbulent kinematics produced by outflowing molecular gas. These results reveal the subtle yet measurable impact of LLAGN feedback on the interstellar medium, demonstrating that even weak, vertically oriented jets and low radiative accretion rates can perturb molecular gas and regulate nuclear reservoirs. This study highlights JWST's transformative ability to uncover hidden modes of AGN feedback.</description>

      <title>The Stellar Morphology &amp; Size of X-ray-selected Active Galactic Nuclei Host Galaxies Revealed by JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13719</link>

Abstract: We investigate the stellar shape and size-mass relationship of X-ray selected Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) host galaxies using the high-angular resolution and deep sensitivity in the near-infrared of the COSMOS-Web JWST survey field. We present the rest-frame 1-$\mu m$ size, stellar mass, Sersic index, axis-ratio, Gini-$M_{20}$ parameters of 690 moderate luminosity AGNs between redshift 0-3 and with stellar mass $\log M_s\sim 10.75$. We find that AGN host galaxies have an effective radius of 1-5 kpc, which is between star-forming (SFG) and quiescent galaxies (QGs) of the same stellar mass. AGN hosts have similar size-mass trends as SFG and QGs, being smaller at higher redshift for the same stellar mass. The slope of the size-mass relationship of AGN host galaxies is steeper than that of star-forming galaxies. Their rest-frame 1$\mu m$ stellar morphology indicates a significant spheroidal component. We observed a low merger fraction (6%) in our sample as well as substructures similar to disks, bars, and spiral arms in the residual images, which are in tension with evolutionary pathways that require major mergers. However, it may also be due to the different timescales between mergers and AGN activity.</description>

      <title>XRISM mock observations of simulated AGN jets in the core of a galaxy cluster</title>

Abstract: Jets from active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are expected to heat the surrounding intracluster medium (ICM). We investigate how the interaction between jets and the ICM appears in high-resolution X-ray observations using mock X-ray observations based on two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations. We constructed a model of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) similar to Cygnus A (Cyg A), a powerful FR II radio galaxy. Our simulations model bipolar jets propagating into a stratified ICM, forming forward shocks and low-density cocoons. Based on these results, we generate synthetic spectra that incorporate both shocked and unshocked ICM components. Then, we perform mock observations using the XRISM/Resolve X-ray spectrometer. We focus particularly on viewing angle effects. Our mock observations revealed that the smallest line broadening, observed as velocity dispersion, associated with the cocoon's bulk expansion occurs when observing along the jet direction, where the expansion velocity is highest. Although this may appear counterintuitive, it occurs because the rapidly expanding jet head contributes little to X-ray emission due to its high temperature and low density. Our results highlight the importance of considering the temperature and density structure of AGN-driven shocks and cocoons when interpreting XRISM data. These findings lay the groundwork for XRISM's observations of AGN jets and will improve our understanding of AGN feedback processes in galaxy clusters.</description>

      <title>Observationally derived change in the star formation rate as mergers progress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galaxy mergers can change the rate at which stars are formed. We can trace when these changes occur in simulations of galaxy mergers. However, for observed galaxies we do not know how the star formation rate (SFR) evolves along the merger sequence as it is difficult to probe the time before or after coalescence. We aim to derive how SFR changes in observed mergers throughout the merger sequence, from a statistical perspective. Merger times were estimated for observed galaxy mergers in the Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS) using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The CNN was trained on mock KiDS images created using IllustrisTNG data. The SFRs were derived from spectral energy density fitting to KiDS and VIKINGs data. To determine the change in SFR for the merging galaxies, each merging galaxy was matched and compared to ten comparable non-merging galaxies; matching each galaxy in redshift, stellar mass, and local density. Mergers see an increase in the SFR for galaxies from 300~Myr before the merger until coalescence, continuing until at least 200~Myr after the merger event. After this, there is a possibility that SFR activity in the mergers begins to decrease, but we need more data to better constrain our merger times and SFRs to confirm this. We find that more galaxies with higher stellar mass (M$_{\star}$) have greater SFR enhancement as they merge compared to lower-M$_{\star}$ galaxies. There is no clear trend of changing SFR enhancement as local density changes, but the least dense environments have the least SFR enhancement. The increasing SFR enhancement is likely due to the closer proximity of galaxies and the presence of more close passes as the time before the merger approaches 0~Myr, with the SFR slowing 200~Myr after the merger event.</description>

      <title>Lost in the FoG: Pitfalls of Models for Large-Scale Hydrogen Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01956v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large-scale HI surveys and their cross-correlations with galaxy distributions have immense potential as cosmological probes. Interpreting these measurements requires theoretical models that must incorporate redshift-space distortions (RSDs), such as the Kaiser and fingers-of-God (FoG) effect, and differences in the tracer and matter distributions via the tracer bias. These effects are commonly approximated with assumptions that should be tested on simulated distributions. In this work, we use the hydrodynamical simulation suite IllustrisTNG to assess the performance of models of $z \leq 1$ HI auto and HI-galaxy cross-power spectra, finding that the models employed by recent observations introduce errors comparable to or exceeding their measurement uncertainties. In particular, neglecting FoG causes $\gtrsim 10\%$ deviations between the modeled and simulated power spectra at $k \gtrsim 0.1$ $h$ / Mpc, larger than assuming a constant bias which reaches the same error threshold at slightly smaller scales. However, even without these assumptions, models can still err by $\sim 10\%$ on relevant scales. These remaining errors arise from multiple RSD damping sources on HI clustering, which are not sufficiently described with a single FoG term. Overall, our results highlight the need for an improved understanding of RSDs to harness the capabilities of future measurements of HI distributions.</description>

      <title>oLIMpus: An Effective Model for Line Intensity Mapping Auto- and Cross- Power Spectra in Cosmic Dawn and Reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15922v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Line-intensity mapping (LIM) is emerging as a powerful probe of the high-redshift Universe, with a growing number of LIM experiments targeting various spectral lines deep into the epochs of reionization and cosmic dawn. A key remaining challenge is the consistent and efficient modeling of the diverse emission lines and of the observables of different surveys. Here, we present oLIMpus, a fully analytical effective model to study LIM auto- and cross- power spectra. Our work builds on the 21-cm effective model presented in Zeus21, applying it to star-forming lines and improving it in different aspects. Our code accounts for shot noise and linear redshift-space distortions and it includes by default prescriptions for OII, OIII, H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, CII, CO line luminosities, together with the 21-cm model inherited from Zeus21. Beyond auto- and cross-power spectra, oLIMpus can produce mock coeval boxes and lightcones, and with a computational time of $\sim s$ it is ideal for parameter-space exploration and inference. Its modular implementation makes it easy to customize and extend, enabling various applications, such as MCMC analyses and consistent multi-line cross-correlations.</description>

      <title>The variability of active galaxies: I. Broad-band noise X-ray power spectra from XMM-Newton and Swift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14529</link>

Abstract: Accreting supermassive black holes at the centres of galaxies are the engine of active galactic nuclei (AGN). X-ray light curves of unabsorbed AGN show dramatic random variability on timescales ranging from seconds to years. The power spectrum of the fluctuations is usually well-modelled with a power law that decays as $1/f$ at low frequencies, and which bends to $1/f^{2-3}$ at high frequencies. The timescale associated with the bend correlates well with the mass of the black hole and may also correlate with bolometric luminosity in the `X-ray variability plane'. Because AGN light curves are usually irregularly sampled, the estimation of AGN power spectra is challenging. In a previous paper, we introduced a new method to estimate the parameters of bending power law power spectra from AGN light curves. We apply this method to a sample of 56 variable and unabsorbed AGN, observed with XMM-Newton and Swift in the $0.3-1.5$ keV band over the past two decades. We obtain estimates of the bends in 50 sources, which is the largest sample of X-ray bends in the soft band. We also find that the high-frequency power spectrum is often steeper than 2. We update the X-ray variability plane with new bend timescale measurements spanning from 7 min to 62 days. We report the detections of low-frequency bends in the power spectra of five AGN, three of which are previously unpublished: 1H 1934-063, Mkn 766 and Mkn 279.</description>

      <title>On the observation of cosmic strings via gravitational-wave lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20442v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a framework for detecting gravitational-wave signals lensed by cosmic strings (CSs), addressing a key gap in current searches. CSs, whose detection would provide a unique probe of high-energy physics and the early Universe, possess distinct topological and geometric features that require a dedicated search strategy. Our approach employs a full-wave transmission factor, expressed analytically via Fresnel integrals, which captures the characteristic diffraction and interference effects of the conical spacetime around a straight CS. We contrast CS lensing with the well-studied point mass lens (PML) model, highlighting their fundamental differences: CS lensing depends on cosmological distances, string tension $\Delta$, and wavelength $\lambda$, and produces two non-amplified images set by the global conical geometry. In contrast, PML lensing is governed by the distance-independent ratio $\sim M_{Lz}/\lambda$, where $M_{Lz}$ represents the redshifted mass of the lens, with image properties derived from the lens equation. For BBH mergers lensed by CSs, we show that the waveforms exhibit a characteristic beating pattern or time-separated, exact replicas. We derive a detectability bound on the string tension and, using Bayesian model selection, demonstrate that CS lensing is distinguishable from both unlensed and PML-lensed signals across a wide region of parameter space.</description>
