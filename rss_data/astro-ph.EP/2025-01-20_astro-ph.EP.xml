      <title>Dust dynamics in radially convective regions of protoplanetary disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrodynamic instabilities likely operate in protoplanetary disks. One candidate, Convective Overstability (COS), can be triggered in regions with a negative radial entropy gradient. The ensuing turbulence and flow structures are expected to affect dust dynamics directly. We revisit the interaction between dust and the COS with high-resolution spectral simulations in the unstratified, axisymmetric Boussinesq shearing box framework. We find zonal flows, or pressure bumps, formed by the COS trap dust, as expected, but dust densities increase at most by a factor of $O(10)$ over its background value due to the zonal flows' unsteady nature. Furthermore, dust feedback can impede the formation of zonal flows, even at small dust-to-gas ratios $\epsilon \sim O(0.1)$. We interpret this phenomenon as a competition between the negative gas angular momentum flux associated with zonal flow formation and the positive dust angular momentum flux associated with its drift towards pressure maxima. Dust concentration significantly weakens when a large-scale radial pressure gradient induces a background dust drift. Ultimately, we find that dust concentration by COS-induced zonal flows is limited to $\epsilon \lesssim 1$. Whether this can be improved under more realistic geometries must be addressed with stratified and full 3D simulations at equivalent resolutions.</description>

      <title>11 New Transiting Brown Dwarfs and Very Low Mass Stars from TESS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the discovery of 11 new transiting brown dwarfs and low-mass M-dwarfs from NASA's TESS mission: TOI-2844, TOI-3122, TOI-3577, TOI-3755, TOI-4462, TOI-4635, TOI-4737, TOI-4759, TOI-5240, TOI-5467, and TOI-5882. They consist of 5 brown dwarf companions and 6 very low mass stellar companions ranging in mass from $25 M_{\rm J}$ to $128 M_{\rm J}$. We used a combination of photometric time-series, spectroscopic, and high resolution imaging follow-up as a part of the TESS Follow-up Observing Program (TFOP) in order to characterize each system. With over 50 transiting brown dwarfs confirmed, we now have a large enough sample to directly test different formation and evolutionary scenarios. We provide a renewed perspective on the transiting brown dwarf desert and its role in differentiating between planetary and stellar formation mechanisms. Our analysis of the eccentricity distribution for the transiting brown dwarf sample does not support previous claims of a transition between planetary and stellar formation at $\sim42$ $M_{\rm J}$. We also contribute a first look into the metallicity distribution of transiting companions in the range $7 - 150$ $M_{\rm J}$, showing that this too does not support a $\sim42$ $M_{\rm J}$ transition. Finally, we also detect a significant lithium absorption feature in one of the brown dwarf hosts (TOI-5882) but determine that the host star is likely old based on rotation, kinematic, and photometric measurements. We therefore claim that TOI-5882 may be a candidate for planetary engulfment.</description>

      <title>Similar-mass versus diverse-mass planetary systems in wind-driven accretion discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many close-in multiple-planet systems show a peas-in-a-pod trend, where neighbouring planets have similar sizes, masses, and orbital spacing. Others, including the Solar System, have a more diverse size and mass distribution. Classical planet formation models tend to produce the former rather than the latter, and the origin of this difference remains unclear. Recent studies suggest disc evolution is largely driven by magnetic winds rather than viscosity alone. In such wind-driven accretion discs, the mass accretion rate varies radially instead of being constant, as in classical viscous discs. We investigate how the wind's efficiency in removing disc mass affects planet formation and migration. We performed single-core planet formation simulations via pebble accretion in wind-driven accretion discs. We varied wind efficiency via the magnetic lever arm parameter $ \lambda $ and studied outcomes by considering a range of initial disc masses and accretion timescales. Our simulations show that higher $ \lambda $ discs, with less wind mass loss, lead to faster formation and migration, generating similar-mass planetary systems. Lower $ \lambda $ discs lead to slower formation and migration and more diverse-mass planetary systems. A mass jump occurs for all $ \lambda $ cases when planet formation and disc accretion timescales are comparable, but is larger for lower $ \lambda $ discs. Super-Earth systems with cold Jupiters form more frequently in metal-rich discs, consistent with observations. Our simulations suggest similar-mass and diverse-mass systems are approximately separated at $ \lambda \sim 2\text{--}3 $.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Interior Structure and Thermal Evolution of Super-Earth GJ 486b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent ground- and space-based surveys have shown that planets between Earth and Neptune in size, known as "super-Earths," are among the most frequently found planets in the Galaxy. Although the JWST era has provided high-quality atmospheric data on several such super-Earths, modeling tools are crucial for understanding their unobservable interiors. Consequently, interior studies represent the next essential step in gaining a comprehensive understanding of this class of exoplanets. This study investigates the interior structure, thermal evolution, and atmospheric dynamics of the super-Earth GJ 486b using SERPINT, a 1-D self-consistent coupled interior structure and evolution model, aiming to understand the planet's thermal evolution based on an Earth-like structure. Our results indicate that GJ 486b's core is approximately 1.34 times larger than Earth's, with a core pressure of about 1171 GPa. The thermal evolution model predicts that the planet's mantle cools and solidifies over approximately 0.93 million years. As the magma ocean cools, water is released from the melt, forming a water-rich atmosphere during early solidification. Photolysis of water vapor and subsequent hydrogen escape lead to oxygen accumulation, forming a water- and oxygen-rich secondary atmosphere. Future high-sensitivity JWST observations, with improved wavelength coverage and the detection of additional trace gases, will enable a detailed analysis of the planet's atmospheric composition, providing crucial insights into the interior, surface, and subsurface properties of GJ 486b.</description>

      <title>Microwave scattering by rough polyhedral particles on a surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electromagnetic (EM) scattering by non-symmetric wavelength-scale particles on a planar surface has numerous applications in the remote sensing of planetary bodies, both in planetary and geo-sciences. We conduct numerical simulations of EM scattering by rough polyhedral particles (with 12 or 20 faces) using the discrete-dipole approximation and contrast the results to that of spheres. The particles have permittivities corresponding to common minerals in the microwave regime ($\epsilon_r=4.7 + 0.016$i and $7.8 + 0.09$i), and a size-frequency distribution (SFD) consistent with the observed scattering properties (power law distribution of size parameters between 0.5 and 8 with an index from $-2.5$ to $-3.5$). The assumed substrate permittivity $2.4 + 0.012$i corresponds to a powdered regolith. We present what roles the particle roundness, permittivity, and SFD for a realistic range of parameters play in the EM scattering properties as a function of incidence angle with a focus on backscattering in microwave-remote-sensing applications. The particle roundness and SFD have a clearly observable effect on the polarimetric properties, while the role of permittivity is relatively minor (in the studied range). Among various backscattering observables, the circular polarization ratio is the least sensitive to the decrease of the upper boundary (down to a size parameter of 3) and the index of the SFD.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Jet-Bubble-Disk Interaction: Jet Feedback on a Protoplanetary Disk via an Expanding Bubble in WSB 52</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While stellar jets and outflows are fueled by accretion from disks, their direct influence on disks remain unexplored. Here we revisit ALMA observations of $^{12}$CO line emission for the young stellar object WSB 52. We identify an expanding bubble that interacts with its protoplanetary disk. Given that the disk axis points toward the bubble center and the kinetic energy of the bubble is roughly $10^{41}$~erg, we postulate that stellar jets, aligned with the disk axis, have triggered the bubble. The bubble morphology is consistent with uniform expansion with partial concavity, implying the bubble-disk interaction. Correspondingly, the shape and the velocity field of protoplanetary disk appear to be deformed and exhibit high-velocity components, suggesting strong interactions and mass loss from the disk. The discovery of jet feedback onto the disk via the bubble -- which we term the jet-bubble-disk interaction -- sheds new light on the dynamical processes governing star and planet formation.</description>

      <title>Excess of $^{236}$U in the northwest Mediterranean Sea</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present first $^{236}$U results in the northwestern Mediterranean. $^{236}$U is studied in a seawater column sampled at DYFAMED (Dynamics of Atmospheric Fluxes in the Mediterranean Sea) station (Ligurian Sea). The obtained $^{236}$U/$^{238}$U atom ratios in the dissolved phase, ranging from about $2\times10^{-9}$ at $100$ m depth to about $1.5\times10^{-9}$ at $2350$ m depth, indicate that anthropogenic $^{236}$U dominates the whole water column. The corresponding deep-water column inventory ($12.6$ ng/m$^2$ or $32.1\times10^{12}$ atoms/m$^2$) exceeds by a factor of $2.5$ the expected one for global fallout at similar latitudes ($5$ ng/m$^2$ or $13\times10^{12}$ atoms/m$^2$), evidencing the influence of local or regional $^{236}$U sources in the western Mediterranean basin. On the other hand, the input of $^{236}$U associated to Saharan dust outbreaks is evaluated. It is estimated an additional $^{236}$U annual deposition of about $0.2$ pg/m$^2$ based on the study of atmospheric particles collected in Monaco during different Saharan dust intrusions. The obtained results in the corresponding suspended solids collected at DYFAMED station indicate that about $64$% of that $^{236}$U stays in solution in seawater. Overall, this source accounts for about $0.1$% of the $^{236}$U inventory excess observed at DYFAMED station. The influence of the so-called Chernobyl fallout and the radioactive effluents produced by the different nuclear installations allocated to the Mediterranean basin, might explain the inventory gap, however, further studies are necessary to come to a conclusion about its origin.</description>

      <title>Asteroid 2023 NT1: A Cautionary Tale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13112v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate various short-warning mitigation scenarios via fragmentation for a hypothetical impact of asteroid 2023 NT1, a Near-Earth Object (NEO) that was discovered on July 15, 2023, two days after its closest approach to Earth on July 13. The asteroid passed by Earth within ~0.25 lunar distances, with a closest approach of ~1$\times10^5$ km and velocity of 11.27 km/s. Its size remains largely uncertain, with an estimated diameter range of 26-58 m and a most probable estimate of 34 m [JPL Sentry, September 15, 2023] (weighted by the NEO size frequency distribution). If 2023 NT1 had collided with Earth, it could have caused significant local damage. Assuming a spherical asteroid with a diameter of 34 m, uniform density of 2.6 g/cm$^3$, and impact velocity of 15.59 km/s, a collision would have yielded an estimated impact energy of ~1.5 Mt, approximately three times the energy of the Chelyabinsk airburst in 2013. We analyze the effectiveness of mitigation via intentional robust disruption (IRD) for objects similar to 2023 NT1. We utilize Pulverize It (PI), a NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts (NIAC) study of planetary defense via fragmentation, to model potential mitigation scenarios through simulations of hypervelocity asteroid disruption and atmospheric ground effects in the case of a terminal defense mode. Simulations suggest that PI is an effective multi-modal approach for planetary defense that can operate in extremely short interdiction modes, in addition to long interdiction time scales with extended warning. Our simulations support the proposition that threats like 2023 NT1 can be effectively mitigated with intercepts of one day (or less) prior to impact, yielding minimal to no ground damage.</description>

      <title>Second-generation planet formation after tidal disruption from common envelope evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14190v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose that certain white dwarf (WD) planets, such as WD 1856+534 b, may form out of material from a stellar companion that tidally disrupts from common envelope evolution with the WD progenitor star. The disrupted companion shreds into an accretion disc, out of which a gas giant protoplanet forms due to gravitational instability. To explore this scenario, we make use of detailed stellar evolution models consistent with WD 1856+534. The minimum mass companion that produces a gravitationally-unstable disc after tidal disruption is $\sim0.15\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$. In this scenario, WD 1856+534 b might have formed at or close to its present separation, in contrast to other proposed scenarios where it would have migrated in from a much larger separation. Planet formation from tidal disruption is a new channel for producing second-generation planets around WDs.</description>
