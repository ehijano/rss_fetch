      <title>Agroseismology: unraveling the impact of farming practices on soil hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Farmed landscapes provide a natural laboratory to test how management reshapes near-surface hydrodynamics. Combining distributed acoustic sensing with physics-based hydromechanical modeling, we tracked minute-resolution, meter-scale changes across experimental fields with controlled tillage and compaction histories. We find that dynamic capillary effects, rate-dependent suction stresses during wetting and drying, govern transient stiffness and moisture redistribution in disturbed soils, producing sharp post-rain velocity drops from near-surface saturation and large hysteretic velocity rebounds driven by evapotranspiration. By pairing a seismic rainfall proxy with a drainage closure, we invert velocity changes to estimate evapotranspiration, revealing how disturbance alters flux partitioning and storage. These results establish agroseismology as a non-invasive, extendable tool to uncover soil hydromechanics, explain why conventional farming intensifies variability, and provide new constraints for Earth system models, land management, and hazard resilience.</description>

      <title>GlobalTomo: A global dataset for physics-ML seismic wavefield modeling and FWI</title>

Abstract: Global seismic tomography, taking advantage of seismic waves from natural earthquakes, provides essential insights into the earth's internal dynamics. Advanced Full-waveform Inversion (FWI) techniques, whose aim is to meticulously interpret every detail in seismograms, confront formidable computational demands in forward modeling and adjoint simulations on a global scale. Recent advancements in Machine Learning (ML) offer a transformative potential for accelerating the computational efficiency of FWI and extending its applicability to larger scales. This work presents the first 3D global synthetic dataset tailored for seismic wavefield modeling and full-waveform tomography, referred to as the GlobalTomo dataset. This dataset is uniquely comprehensive, incorporating explicit wave physics and robust geophysical parameterization at realistic global scales, generated through state-of-the-art forward simulations optimized for 3D global wavefield calculations. Through extensive analysis and the establishment of ML baselines, we illustrate that ML approaches are particularly suitable for global FWI, overcoming its limitations with rapid forward modeling and flexible inversion strategies. This work represents a cross-disciplinary effort to enhance our understanding of the earth's interior through physics-ML modeling.</description>

      <title>Haicheng and Tangshan Earthquakes as potential Dragon-Kings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21310v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dragon-king earthquake hypothesis proposes that some very large to great earthquakes are not merely the extreme end of the frequency-magnitude Gutenberg-Richter distribution (FMD), but are generated by distinct physical mechanisms, making them statistical outliers. We develop a data-driven framework to systematically test the dragon-king earthquake hypothesis. Our method combines objective spatial clustering, based on data-adaptive kernel density estimation (KDE), with a high-power sequential outlier detection technique. For each identified cluster, we exam sine the tail of the FMD to identify anomalous events. Candidate dragon-kings are evaluated via robust statistical tests, primarily the max-robust-sum (MRS) test with inward sequential testing. For each observed statistic of the MRS test, we calculate its p-value defined as the probability that this statistic could be generated by the null distribution. We apply this framework to seismicity surrounding the 1975 Haicheng mL 7.4 and 1976 Tangshan mL 7.9 earthquakes. For Haicheng, the mainshock shows a strong dragon-king signature in its pre-mainshock sequence, with p-values between 0.03 and 0.07 across a stable range of KDE density thresholds used to define natural seismicity clusters. Post-mainshock and combined sequences yield slightly higher p-values (up to 0.09). In contrast, the Tangshan mainshock exhibits a weaker outlier signal before the event (p-values in the range 0.05-0.15) but a stronger dragon-king signature afterward, with p-values from 0.015 to 0.05. The evidence that the Haicheng and Tangshan mainshocks exhibit dragon-king characteristics supports the idea that some large and great earthquakes arise from a maturation process that may enhance predictability. Haicheng provides a clear case study, while retrospective analyses suggest that Tangshan might also have been forecasted under more systematic procedures.</description>

      <title>Geological Everything Model 3D: A Promptable Foundation Model for Unified and Zero-Shot Subsurface Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00419v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding Earth's subsurface is critical for energy transition, natural hazard mitigation, and planetary science. Yet subsurface analysis remains fragmented, with separate models required for structural interpretation, stratigraphic analysis, geobody segmentation, and property modeling-each tightly coupled to specific data distributions and task formulations. We introduce the Geological Everything Model 3D (GEM), a unified generative architecture that reformulates all these tasks as prompt-conditioned inference along latent structural frameworks derived from subsurface imaging. This formulation moves beyond task-specific models by enabling a shared inference mechanism, where GEM propagates human-provided prompts-such as well logs, masks, or structural sketches-along inferred structural frameworks to produce geologically coherent outputs. Through this mechanism, GEM achieves zero-shot generalization across tasks with heterogeneous prompt types, without retraining for new tasks or data sources. This capability emerges from a two-stage training process that combines self-supervised representation learning on large-scale field seismic data with adversarial fine-tuning using mixed prompts and labels across diverse subsurface tasks. GEM demonstrates broad applicability across surveys and tasks, including Martian radar stratigraphy analysis, structural interpretation in subduction zones, full seismic stratigraphic interpretation, geobody segmentation, and property modeling. By bridging expert knowledge with generative reasoning in a structurally aware manner, GEM lays the foundation for scalable, human-in-the-loop geophysical AI-transitioning from fragmented pipelines to a vertically integrated, promptable reasoning system.
