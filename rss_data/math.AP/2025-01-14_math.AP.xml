      <title>Analysis of a Shear beam model with suspenders in thermoelasticity of type III</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct an analysis of a one-dimensional linear problem that describes the vibrations of a connected suspension bridge. In this model, the single-span roadbed is represented as a thermoelastic Shear beam without rotary inertia. We incorporate thermal dissipation into the transverse displacement equation, following Green and Naghdi's theory. Our work demonstrates the existence of a global solution by employing classical Faedo-Galerkin approximations and three a priori estimates. Furthermore, we establish exponential stability through the application of the energy method. For numerical study, we propose a spatial discretization using finite elements and a temporal discretization through an implicit Euler scheme. In doing so, we prove discrete stability properties and a priori error estimates for the discrete problem. To provide a practical dimension to our theoretical findings, we present a set of numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>The Modified Energy Method for Quasilinear Wave Equations of Kirchhoff Type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we use the modified energy method of Hunter, Ifrim, Tataru, and Wongto prove an improved quintic energy estimate for initial data small in $\dot H^1_x \times L^2_x$ for a wide class of quasilinear wave equations of Kirchhoff type. This allows us to make the first steps towards small data $H^{5/4}_x \times H^{1/4}_x$ local well-posedness. In particular, we prove an enhanced lifespan for corresponding solutions depending only on the $\dot H^{5/4}_x \times \dot H^{1/4}_x$ norm of the initial data as well as the existence of weak solutions for $H^{5/4}_x \times H^{1/4}_x$ initial data, again small in $\dot H^1_x \times L^2_x$. In contrast to previous modified energy results, the nonlinearity in these models depends on an $\dot H^1_x$ norm of the solution. This means a modified energy cannot be deduced algebraically by analyzing resonant interactions between wave packets since all spatial dependence is integrated out in the nonlinearity. Instead, the modified energy is determined as a Taylor series of incremental leading order terms.</description>

      <title>Phase Transition for Potentials of High-Dimensional Wells with a Mass-Type Constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by Lin-Pan-Wang (Comm. Pure Appl. Math., 65(6): 833-888, 2012), we continue to study the corresponding time-independent case of the Keller-Rubinstein-Sternberg problem. To be precise, we explore the asymptotic behavior of minimizers as $\varepsilon\to0$, for the functional $$\mathbf{E}_\varepsilon(u)= \int_{\Omega}\left(|\nabla u|^{2}+\frac{1}{\varepsilon^{2}} F(u)\right) d x$$under a mass-type constraint $\int_{\Omega}\rho(u)\, dx=m$, where $\rho:\mathbb{R}^k \to \mathbb{R}\in Lip(\mathbb{R}^k)$ is specialized as a density function with $m$ representing a fixed total mass. The potential function $F$ vanishes on two disjoint, compact, connected, smooth Riemannian submanifolds $N^{\pm}\subset\mathbb{R}^k$. We analyze the expansion of $\mathbf{E}_\varepsilon(u_\varepsilon)$ for various density functions $\rho$, identifying the leading-order term in the asymptotic expansion, which depends on the geometry of the domain and the energy of minimal connecting orbits between $N^+$ and $N^-$. Furthermore, we estimate the higher-order term under different geometric assumptions and characterize the convergence $u_{\varepsilon_i}\to v $ in the ${L}^1$ sense.</description>

      <title>Global Fujita-Kato solutions of the incompressible inhomogeneous magnetohydrodynamic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the incompressible inhomogeneous magnetohydrodynamic equations in $\mathbb{R}^3$, under the assumptions that the initial density $\rho_0$ is only bounded, and the initial velocity $u_0$ and magnetic field $B_0$ exhibit critical regularities. In particular, the density is allowed to be piecewise constant with jumps. First, we establish the global-in-time well-posedness and large-time behavior of solutions to the Cauchy problem in the case that $\rho_0$ has small variations, and $u_0$ and $B_0$ are sufficiently small in the critical Besov space $\dot{B}^{3/p-1}_{p,1}$ with $1&lt;p&lt;3$. Moreover, the small variation assumption on $\rho_0$ is no longer required in the case $p=2$. Then, we construct a unique global Fujita-Kato solution under the weaker condition that $u_0$ and $B_0$ are small in $\dot{B}^{1/2}_{2,\infty}$ but may be large in $\dot{H}^{1/2}$. Additionally, we show a general uniqueness result with only bounded and nonnegative density, without assuming the $L^1(0,T;L^{\infty})$ regularity of the velocity. Our study systematically addresses the global solvability of the inhomogeneous magnetohydrodynamic equations with rough density in the critical regularity setting.</description>

      <title>Around the Quantum Lenard-Balescu equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the mean-field regime, a gas of quantum particles with Boltzmann statistics can be described by the Hartree-Fock equation. This dynamics becomes trivial if the initial distribution of particle is invariant by translation. However, the first correction is given on time of order $O(N)$ by the quantum Lenard--Balescu equation. In the first part of the present article, we justify this equation until time of order $O((\log N)^{1-\delta})$ (for any $\delta\in(0,1)$).
  A similar phenomenon exists in the classical setting (with a similar validity time obtained by Duerinckx \cite{Duerinckx}). In a second time, we prove the convergence in large dimension ($d\geq 4$) of the solutions of the quantum Lenard--Balescu equation to the solutions of its classical counterpart in the semi-classical limit. The dimension $3$ appears to be critical. This problem can be interpreted as a grazing collision limit: the quantum Lenard--Balescu equation looks like a cut-off Boltzmann equation, when the classical one looks like the Landau equation.</description>

      <title>Harnack inequalities for quasilinear anisotropic elliptic equations with a first order term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider weak solutions of the equation $$-\Delta_p^H u+a(x,u)H^q(\nabla u)=f(x,u) \quad \text{in } \Omega,$$ where $H$ is in some cases called Finsler norm, $\Omega$ is a domain of $\mathbb R^N$, $p&gt;1$, $q\ge \max\{p-1,1\}$, and $a(\cdot,u)$, $f(\cdot,u)$ are functions satisfying suitable assumptions. We exploit the Moser iteration technique to prove a Harnack type comparison inequality for solutions of the equation and a Harnack type inequality for solutions of the linearized operator. As a consequence, we deduce a Strong Comparison Principle for solutions of the equation and a strong Maximum Principle for solutions of the linearized operator.</description>

      <title>Remarks on Hierarchic Control for a Linearized Micropolar Fluids System in Moving Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a Stackelberg strategy subject to the evolutionary linearized micropolar fluids equations in domains with moving boundaries, considering a Nash multi-objective equilibrium (non necessarily cooperative) for the "follower players" (as is called in the economy field) and an optimal problem for the leader player with approximate controllability objective. We will obtain the following main results : the existence and uniqueness of Nash equilibrium and its characterization, the approximate controllability of the linearized micropolar system with respect to the leader control and the existence and uniqueness of the Stackelberg-Nash problem, where the optimality system for the leader is given.</description>

      <title>Saint-Venant Estimates and Liouville-Type Theorems for the Stationary MHD Equation in $\mathbb{R}^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a Liouville-type theorem for the MHD equations using Saint-Venant type estimates. We show that \( (u, B) \) is a trivial solution if the growth of the \( L^s \) mean oscillation of the potential functions for both the velocity and magnetic fields are controlled. Our growth assumption is weaker than those previously known for similar results. The main idea is to refine the Saint-Venant type estimates using the Froullani integral.</description>

      <title>Multilayered fluid-structure interactions: existence of weak solutions for time-periodic and initial-value problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the interaction between incompressible viscous fluids and multilayered elastic structures in a 3D/2D/3D framework, where a 3D fluid interacts with a 2D thin elastic layer, coupled to a 3D thick elastic solid. The system is driven by time-periodic boundary conditions involving Bernoulli pressure. We prove the existence of at least one time-periodic weak solution when the boundary pressure has a sufficiently small $L^2-$ norm.
  A key feature of our analysis is the assumption of viscoelasticity in the thick solid, which is crucial for obtaining diffusion estimates and ensuring energy stability. Without this assumption, weak solutions are established for the initial-value problem. Our results extend prior work on 2D/1D/2D configurations to the more complex 3D/2D/3D setting, providing new insights into multilayered fluid-structure interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a stable characterization of on-diagonal upper bounds for heat kernels associated with regular Dirichlet forms on metric measure spaces satisfying the volume doubling property. Our conditions include integral bounds on the jump kernel outside metric balls, a variant of the Faber-Krahn inequality, a cutoff Sobolev inequality, and an integral control of inverse square volumes of balls with respect to the jump kernel. Crucially, we do not assume that the jump kernel has a density, and we show that these assumptions are essentially optimal.</description>

      <title>Dispersive estimates for Schr\"{o}dinger's and wave equations on Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proves $L^p$ decay estimates for Schr\"{o}dinger's and wave equations with scalar potentials on three-dimensional Riemannian manifolds.
  The main result regards small perturbations of a metric with constant negative sectional curvature. We also prove estimates on $\mathbb S^3$, the three-dimensional sphere, and $\mathbb H^3$, the three-dimensional hyperbolic space.
  Most of the estimates hold for the perturbed Hamiltonian $H=H_0+V$, where $H_0$ is the shifted Laplacian $H_0=-\Delta+\kappa_0$, $\kappa_0$ is the constant (or asymptotic) sectional curvature, and $V$ is a small scalar potential.
  The results are based on direct estimates of the wave propagator.
  All results hold in three space dimensions. The metric is required to have four derivatives.</description>

      <title>Nishida-Smoller type large solutions and exponential growth for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations with slip boundary conditions in 3D bounded domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper concerns the isentropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations in a three-dimensional (3D) bounded domain with slip boundary conditions and vacuum. It is shown that the classical solutions to the initial-boundary-value problem of this system with large initial energy and vacuum exist globally in time and have an exponential decay rate which is decreasing with respect to the adiabatic exponent $\gamma&gt;1$ provided that the fluid is nearly isothermal (namely, the adiabatic exponent is close enough to 1). This constitutes an extension of the celebrated result for the one-dimensional Cauchy problem of the isentropic Euler equations that has been established in 1973 by Nishida and Smoller (Comm. Pure Appl. Math. 26 (1973), 183-200). In addition, it is also shown that the gradient of the density will grow unboundedly with an exponential rate when the initial vacuum appears (even at a point). In contrast to previous related works, where either small initial energy are required or boundary effects are ignored, this establishes the first result on the global existence and exponential growth of large-energy solutions with vacuum to the 3D isentropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations with slip boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Nonradial stability of self-similar blowup to Keller-Segel equation in three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In three dimensions, the parabolic-elliptic Keller-Segel system exhibits a rich variety of singularity formations. Notably, it admits an explicit self-similar blow-up solution whose radial stability, conjectured more than two decades ago in [Brenner-Constantin-Kadanoff-Schenkel-Venkataramani, 1999], was recently confirmed by [Glogi\'c-Sch\"orkhuber, 2024]. This paper aims to extend the radial stability to the nonradial setting, building on the finite-codimensional stability analysis in our previous work [Li-Zhou, 2024]. The main input is the mode stability of the linearized operator, whose nonlocal nature presents challenges for the spectral analysis. Besides a quantitative perturbative analysis for the high spherical classes, we adapted in the first spherical class the wave operator method of [Li-Wei-Zhang, 2020] for the fluid stability to localize the operator and remove the known unstable mode simultaneously. Our method provides localization beyond the partial mass variable and is independent of the explicit formula of the profile, so it potentially sheds light on other linear nonlocal problems.</description>

      <title>On the compactness of the support of solitary waves of the complex saturated nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger equation and related problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the vectorial stationary Schr\"odinger equation $-\Delta u+a\,U+b\,u=F,$ with a saturated nonlinearity $U=u/|u|$ and with some complex coefficients $(a,b)\in\mathbb{C}^2$. Besides the existence and uniqueness of solutions for the Dirichlet and Neumann problems, we prove the compactness of the support of the solution, under suitable conditions on $(a,b)$ and even when the source in the right hand side $F(x)$ is not vanishing for large values of $|x|.$ The proof of the compactness of the support uses a local energy method, given the impossibility of applying the maximum principle. We also consider the associate Schr\"{o}dinger-Poisson system when coupling with a simple magnetic field. Among other consequences, our results give a rigorous proof of the existence of  ``solitons with compact support" claimed, without any proof, by several previous authors.</description>

      <title>The role of mutants in the spatio-temporal progression of inflammatory bowel disease: three classes of permanent form travelling waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite its high prevalence and impact on the lives of those affected, a complete understanding of the cause of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is lacking. In this paper, we investigate a novel mechanism which proposes that mutant epithelial cells are significant to the progression of IBD since they promote inflammation and are resistant to death. We develop a simple model encapsulating the propagation of mutant epithelial cells and immune cells which results from interactions with the intestinal barrier and bacteria. Motivated by the slow growth of mutant epithelial cells, and relatively slow response rate of the adaptive immune system, we combine geometric singular perturbation theory with matched asymptotic expansions to determine the one-dimensional slow invariant manifold that characterises the leading order dynamics at all times beyond a passive initial adjustment phase. The dynamics on this manifold are controlled by a bifurcation parameter %, $\sigma$, which depends on the ratio of {growth to decay rates} of all components except mutants and determines three distinct classes of permanent-form travelling waves that describe the propagation of mutant epithelial and immune cells. These are obtained from scalar reaction-diffusion equations with the reaction being (i) a bistable nonlinearity with a cut-off, (ii) a cubic Fisher nonlinearity and (iii) a KPP or Fisher nonlinearity. Our results suggest that mutant epithelial cells are critical to the progression of IBD. However, their effect on the speed of progression is subdominant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Negative refractive index materials have garnered widespread attention due to their anomalous electromagnetic properties. In this paper, we utilize complementing boundary conditions to conduct a priori estimates for Cauchy problems and derive the limiting absorption principle. Consequently, we establish the well-posedness of the transmission problem involving conventional materials and negative refractive index materials within a simulated two-dimensional periodic structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain semiclassical resolvent estimates for the Schr{\"o}dinger operator (ih$\nabla$ + b)^2 + V in R^d , d $\ge$ 3, where  h  is a semiclassical parameter, V and b are real-valued electric and magnetic potentials independent of h.Under quite general assumptions, we prove that the norm of the weighted resolvent is bounded by exp(Ch^{-2} log(h^{ -1} )) . We get better resolvent bounds for electric potentials which are H{\"o}lder with respect to the radial variable and magnetic potentials which are H{\"o}lder with respect to the space variable. For long-range electric potentials which are Lipschitz with respect to the radial variable and long-range magnetic potentials which are Lipschitz with respect to the space variable we obtain a resolvent bound of the form exp(Ch^{-1}) .</description>

      <title>Analysis of subwavelength resonances in high contrast elastic media by a variational method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a mathematical study of wave scattering by a hard elastic obstacle embedded in a soft elastic body in three dimensions. Our contributions are threefold. First, we characterize subwavelength resonances using the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map and an auxiliary variational form, showing that these resonances occur when the determinant of a specific matrix vanishes. Second, employing Gohberg-Sigal theory and Puiseux series expansions for multi-valued functions, we derive the asymptotic expansions of subwavelength resonant frequencies in the low-frequency regime through this explicit characterization. Finally, we provide a representation of the scattered field in the interior domain, where the enhancement coefficients are governed by the imaginary parts of the resonant frequencies. Additionally, we establish the transversal and longitudinal far-field patterns for the scattered field in the exterior domain.</description>

      <title>On singular problems associated with mixed operators under mixed boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the following singular problem associated with mixed operators (the combination of the classical Laplace operator and the fractional Laplace operator) under mixed boundary conditions \begin{equation*} \label{1}
  \left\{
  \begin{aligned}
  \mathcal{L}u &amp;= g(u), \quad u &gt; 0 \quad \text{in} \quad \Omega,
  u &amp;= 0 \quad \text{in} \quad U^c,
  \mathcal{N}_s(u) &amp;= 0 \quad \text{in} \quad \mathcal{N},
  \frac{\partial u}{\partial \nu} &amp;= 0 \quad \text{in} \quad \partial \Omega \cap \overline{\mathcal{N}},
  \end{aligned}
  \right.
  \tag{$P_\lambda$} \end{equation*}
  where $U= (\Omega \cup {\mathcal{N}} \cup (\partial\Omega\cap\overline{\mathcal{N}}))$, $\Omega \subseteq \mathbb{R}^N$ is a non empty open set, $\mathcal{D}$, $\mathcal{N}$ are open subsets of $\mathbb{R}^N\setminus{\bar{\Omega }}$ such that ${\mathcal{D}} \cup {\mathcal{N}}= \mathbb{R}^N\setminus{\bar{\Omega}}$, $\mathcal{D} \cap {\mathcal{N}}= \emptyset $ and $\Omega\cup \mathcal{N}$ is a bounded set with smooth boundary, $\lambda &gt;0$ is a real parameter and
  $\mathcal{L}= -\Delta+(-\Delta)^{s},~ \text{for}~s \in (0, 1).$
  Here $g(u)=u^{-q}$ or $g(u)= \lambda u^{-q}+ u^p$ with $0&lt;q&lt;1&lt;p\leq 2^*-1$. We study $(P_\lambda)$ to derive the existence of weak solutions along with its $L^\infty$-regularity. Moreover, some Sobolev-type variational inequalities associated with these weak solutions are established.</description>

Abstract: In this contribution, we are interested in the analysis of a semi-implicit time discretization scheme for the approximation of a parabolic equation driven by multiplicative colored noise involving a $p$-Laplace operator (with $p\geq 2$), nonlinear source terms and subject to Neumann boundary conditions. Using the Minty-Browder theorem, we are able to prove the well-posedness of such a scheme.</description>

      <title>Eco-evolutionary dynamics of a trait-structured predator-prey model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coupling between evolutionary and ecological changes (eco-evolutionary dynamics) has been shown to be relevant among diverse species, and is also of interest outside of ecology, i.e. in cancer evolution. These dynamics play an important role in determining survival in response to climate change, motivating the need for mathematical models to capture this often complex interplay. Population genetics models incorporating eco-evolutionary dynamics often sacrifice analytical tractability to model the complexity of real systems, and do not explicitly consider the effect of population heterogeneity. In order to allow for population heterogeneity, transient, and long-term dynamics, while retaining tractability, we generalise a moment-based method applicable in the regime of small segregational variance to the case of time-dependent mortality and birth. These results are applied to a predator-prey model, where ecological parameters such as the contact rate between species are trait-structured. The trait-distribution of the prey species is shown to be approximately Gaussian with constant variance centered on the mean trait, which is asymptotically governed by an autonomous ODE. In this way, we make explicit the impact of eco-evolutionary dynamics on the transient behaviour and long-term fate of the prey species.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the spatially homogeneous Landau equation, which is a variation of the Boltzmann equation in the grazing collision limit. For the Landau equation for hard potentials in the style of Desvillettes-Villani (Comm. Partial Differential Equations, 2000), we provide the proof of the existence of axisymmetric measure-valued solution for any axisymmetric $\mathcal{P}_p(\mathbb{R}^3)$ initial profile for any $p\ge 2$. Moreover, we prove that if the initial data is not a single Dirac mass, then the solution instantaneously becomes analytic for any time $t&gt;0$ in the hard potential case. In the soft potential and the Maxwellian molecule cases, we show that there are no solutions whose support is contained in a fixed line even for any given line-concentrated data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We adapt boundary deformation techniques to solve a Neumann problem for the Helmholtz equation with rough electric potentials in bounded domains. In particular, we study the dependance of Neumann eigenvalues of the perturbed Laplacian with respect to boundary deformation, and we illustrate how to find a domain in which the Neumann problem can be solved for any energy, if there is some freedom in the choice of the domain. This work is motivated by a Runge approximation result in the context of an inverse problem in point-source scattering with partial data.</description>

      <title>On the Time-decay of solutions arising from periodically forced Dirac Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is increased interest in time-dependent (non-autonomous) Hamiltonians, stemming in part from the active field of Floquet quantum materials. Despite this, dispersive time-decay bounds, which reflect energy transport in such systems, have received little attention.
  We study the dynamics of non-autonomous, time-periodically forced, Dirac Hamiltonians: $i\partial_t\alpha =D(t)\alpha$, where $D(t)=i\sigma_3\partial_x+ \nu(t)$ is time-periodic but not spatially localized. For the special case $\nu(t)=m\sigma_1$, which models a relativistic particle of constant mass $m$, one has a dispersive decay bound: $\|\alpha(t,x)\|_{L^\infty_x}\lesssim t^{-\frac12}$. Previous analyses of Schr\"odinger Hamiltonians suggest that this decay bound persists for small, spatially-localized and time-periodic $\nu(t)$. However, we show that this is not necessarily the case if $\nu(t)$ is not spatially localized. Specifically, we study two non-autonomous Dirac models whose time-evolution (and monodromy operator) is constructed via Fourier analysis. In a rotating mass model, the dispersive decay bound is of the same type as for the constant mass model. However, in a model with a periodically alternating sign of the mass, the results are quite different. By stationary-phase analysis of the associated Fourier representation, we display initial data for which the $L^\infty_x$ time-decay rate are considerably slower: $\mathcal{O}(t^{-1/3})$ or even $\mathcal{O}(t^{-1/5})$ as $t\to\infty$.</description>

      <title>Uniform large-scale $\varepsilon$-regularity for entropic optimal transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the regularity properties of the minimisers of entropic optimal transport providing a natural analogue of the $\varepsilon$-regularity theory of quadratic optimal transport in the entropic setting. More precisely, we show that if the minimiser of the entropic problem satisfies a gradient BMO-type estimate at some scale, the same estimate holds all the way down to the natural length-scale associated to the entropic regularisation.
  Our result follows from a more general $\varepsilon$-regularity theory for optimal transport costs which can be viewed as perturbations of quadratic optimal transport. We consider such a perturbed cost and require that, under a certain class of admissible affine rescalings, the minimiser remains a local quasi-minimiser of the quadratic problem (in an appropriate sense) and that the cost of "long trajectories" of minimisers (and their rescalings) is small. Under these assumptions, we show that the minimiser satisfies an appropriate $C^{2,\alpha}$ Morrey$\unicode{x2013}$Campanato-type estimate which is valid up to the scale of quasi-minimality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $C$ be a configuration of $n$ ovals in $\mathbb{S}^2$. We show that there is a Riemannian metric $g$ over $\mathbb{S}^2$ with a Laplacian eigenfunction whose zero set is $C$, and the corresponding eigenvalue is the $k$-th eigenvalue for $n\leq k \leq \alpha_1 n$. We also have that $\lambda\operatorname{Vol}_g\left(\mathbb{S}^2\right) = \Theta(n)$.
  Additionally, assuming $C$ can be drawn as a topological minor of the $m\times m$ grid graph, we show that there is an infinitesimal perturbation of the round metric on $\mathbb{S}^2$ and a corresponding Laplacian eigenfunction $f$ with eigenvalue $\Theta(m^2)$ such that the zero set of $f$ is equivalent to $C$.</description>

      <title>Savanna dynamics with grazing, browsing, and migration effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article explores the dynamics of savanna ecosystems with grazing, browsing, and migration effects. Covering over one-eighth of the Earth's land area and supporting about one-fifth of the global population, the savanna is an ecological system whose importance has only recently garnered significant attention from biologists. The interactions between organisms in this ecosystem are highly complex, and fundamental mathematical issues remain unresolved. We rigorously analyze traveling waves in savanna systems and focus on whether trees, grass, grazers, and browsers coexist. We demonstrate the existence of various traveling waves, including waves transitioning from extinction to co-existence and waves from a grass-vegetation state (where only grass and grazers exist) to co-existence. Due to the biodiversity of species in grassland ecosystems, it is not appropriate to consider overly simplified models of competition between grasses and trees. From both a biological and mathematical perspective, factors such as animal grazing, browsing, and migration (which facilitates seed dispersal) play a crucial role in promoting ecological stability and coexistence. Additionally, we estimate the nonzero minimum value of the total plant biomass within the savanna dynamic system to better understand the persistence and stability of sustainable development within the ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Control for the Oldroyd Equation in Memoriam to Professor Luiz Adauto Medeiros</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This manuscript deals with a hierarchical control problem for Oldroyd equation under the Stackelberg-Nash strategy. The Oldroyd equation model is defined by non-regular coefficients, that is, they are bounded measurable functions. We assume that we can act in the dynamic of the system by a hierarchy of controls, where one main control (the leader) and several additional secondary control (the followers) act in order to accomplish their given tasks: controllability for the leader and optimization for followers. We obtain the existence and uniqueness of Nash equilibrium and its characterization, the approximate controllability with respect to the leader control, and the optimality system for leader control.</description>

      <title>Approximate controllability for a one-dimensional wave equation with the fixed endpoint control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of the approximate controllability for a one-dimensional wave equation in domains with moving boundary. This equation models the motion of a string where an endpoint is fixed and the other one is moving. When the speed of the moving endpoint is less than the characteristic speed, the controllability of this equation is established. We present the following results: the existence and uniqueness of Nash equilibrium, the approximate controllability with respect to the leader control, and the optimality system for the leader control.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study Dirichlet problem for non-local operator on bounded domains in ${\mathbb R}^d$
  $$
  {\cal L}u = {\rm div}(A(x) \nabla (x)) + b(x) \cdot \nabla u(x)
  + \int_{{\mathbb R}^d} (u(y)-u(x) ) J(x, dy) , $$ where $A(x)=(a_{ij}(x))_{1\leq i,j\leq d}$ is a measurable $d\times d$ matrix-valued function on ${\mathbb R}^d$ that is uniformly elliptic and bounded, $b$ is an ${\mathbb R}^d$-valued function so that $|b|^2$ is in some Kato class ${\mathbb K}_d$, for each $x\in {\mathbb R}^d$, $J(x, dy)$ is a finite measure on ${\mathbb R}^d$ so that $x\mapsto J(x, {\mathbb R}^d)$ is in the Kato class ${\mathbb K}_d$. We show there is a unique Feller process $X$ having strong Feller property associated with ${\cal L}$, which can be obtained from the diffusion process having generator $ {\rm div}(A(x) \nabla (x)) + b(x) \cdot \nabla u(x) $ through redistribution. We further show that for any bounded connected open subset $D\subset{\mathbb R}^d$ that is regular with respect to the Laplace operator $\Delta$ and for any bounded continuous function $\varphi $ on $D^c$, the Dirichlet problem ${\cal L} u=0$ in $D$ with $u=\varphi$ on $D^c$ has a unique bounded continuous weak solution on ${\mathbb R}^d$. This unique weak solution can be represented in terms of the Feller process associated with ${\cal L}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article studies the fluctuation behaviour of the stochastic point vortex model with common noise. Using the martingale method combined with a localization argument, we prove that the sequence of fluctuation processes converges in distribution to the unique probabilistically strong solution of a linear stochastic evolution equation. In particular, we establish the strong convergence from the stochastic point vortex model with common noise to the conditional McKean Vlasov equation.</description>

Abstract: For a compact connected Riemannian manifold with smooth boundary, we establish an effective procedure, by which we can calculate all the coefficients of the spectral asymptotic formula of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map associated to the Witten-Laplacian with potential. In particular, by computing the full symbol of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map we explicitly give the first four coefficients. They are spectral invariants, which provide precise information concerning the volume, curvatures, drifting function and potential.</description>

Abstract: We establish partial H\"older continuity of the gradient for equilibrium configurations of vectorial multidimensional variational problems, involving bulk and surface energies. The bulk energy densities are uniformly strictly quasiconvex functions with $p$-growth, $1&lt;p&lt; 2$, without any further structure conditions. The anisotropic surface energy is defined by means of an elliptic integrand $\Phi$ not necessarily regular.</description>

Abstract: We study a particular system of partial differential equations in which the harmonic, the divergence and the gradient operators of the unknown functions appear (harmonic-divgrad system). Using the Killing Hopf theorem and leveraging the properties of Riemannian manifolds with constant sectional curvature we establish the conditions under which these equations admit only the trivial solutions proving their trivialization on positive curvature space forms. The analysis of this particular system is motivated by its occurrence in the study of asymptotic symmetries in $p$-form gauge theories and in mixed symmetry tensor gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Spectral distribution of the free Jacobi process with equal rank projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The free Jacobi process is the radial part of the compression of the free unitary Brownian motion by two free orthogonal projections. In this paper, we determine the characteristic curves of the partial differential equation satisfied by its spectral distribution when both projections have the same rank $\alpha \in (0,1)$. Doing so leads for any fixed time $t &gt;0$ to an expression of the moment generating function in a neighborhood of the origin, extending our previous results valid for $\alpha = 1/2$. Moreover, the obtained characteristic curves are encoded by an $\alpha$-deformation of the $\xi$-transform of the spectral distribution of the free unitary Brownian motion, of which we study mapping properties. We also prove a dynamical version of a recent identity pointed out by T. Kunisky and relating the stationary distributions of the free Jacobi processes corresponding to the set of parameters $(\alpha, \alpha)$ and $(1/2,\alpha)$. Actually, our dynamical version relates the Cauchy-Stieltjes transforms of the densities of the finite time spectral distributions.</description>

Abstract: We study the forward-backward system of stochastic partial differential equations describing a mean field game for a large population of small players subject to both idiosyncratic and common noise. The unique feature of the problem is that the idiosyncratic noise coefficient may be degenerate, so that the system does not admit smooth solutions in general. We develop a new notion of weak solutions for backward stochastic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations, and use this to build probabilistically weak solutions of the mean field game system.</description>

Abstract: We report a proof that under natural assumptions shock profiles viewed as heteroclinic travelling wave solutions to a hyperbolically regularized system of conservation laws are spectrally stable, if the shock amplitude is sufficiently small. This means that an associated Evans function $\mathcal{E}:\Lambda\rightarrow\mathbb{C}$ with $\Lambda\subset\mathbb{C}$ an open superset of the closed right half plane $\mathbb{H}^+\equiv\{\kappa\in\mathbb{C}:\text{Re}\,\kappa \geq 0\}$, has only one zero, namely a simple zero at $0$. The result is analogous to the one obtained in [FS02] and [PZ04] for parabolically regularized systems of conservation laws, and also distinctly extends findings on hyperbolic relaxation systems in [PZ04], [MZ09], [Ued09] .</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.18857v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with asymptotic persistence, extinction and spreading properties for non-cooperative Fisher-KPP systems with space-time periodic coefficients. Results are formulated in terms of a family of generalized principal eigenvalues associated with the linearized problem. When the maximal generalized principal eigenvalue is negative, all solutions to the Cauchy problem become locally uniformly positive in long-time, at least one space-time periodic uniformly positive entire solution exists, and solutions with compactly supported initial condition asymptotically spread in space at a speed given by a Freidlin-G{\"a}rtner-type formula. When another, possibly smaller, generalized principal eigenvalue is nonnegative, then on the contrary all solutions to the Cauchy problem vanish uniformly and the zero solution is the unique space-time periodic nonnegative entire solution. When the twogeneralized principal eigenvalues differ and zero is in between, the long-time behavior depends on the decay at infinity of the initial condition. The proofs rely upon double-sided controls by solutions of cooperative systems. The control from below is new for such systems and makes it possible to shorten the proofs and extend the generality of the system simultaneously.</description>

In particular, our Harnack estimates are the first ones for such equations, and our H\"older regularity refines certain known result in several aspects.

Abstract: Motivated by conjectures in Mirror Symmetry, we continue the study of the real Monge--Amp\`ere operator on the boundary of a simplex. This can be formulated in terms of optimal transport, and we consider, more generally, the problem of optimal transport between symmetric probability measures on the boundary of a simplex and of the dual simplex. For suitably regular measures, we obtain regularity properties of the transport map, and of its convex potential. To do so, we exploit boundary regularity results for optimal transport maps by Caffarelli, together with the symmetries of the simplex.</description>

      <title>The 2D Gray-Scott system of equations: constructive proofs of existence of localized stationary patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08529v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we present a comprehensive framework for constructing smooth, localized solutions in systems of semi-linear partial differential equations, with a particular emphasis to the Gray-Scott model. Specifically, we construct a natural Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$ for the study of systems of autonomous semi-linear PDEs, on which products and differential operators are well-defined. Then, given an approximate solution $\mathbf{u}_0$, we derive a Newton-Kantorovich approach based on the construction of an approximate inverse of the linearization around $\mathbf{u}_0$. In particular, we derive a condition under which we prove the existence of a unique solution in a neighborhood of $\mathbf{u}_0$. Such a condition can be verified thanks to the explicit computation of different upper bounds, for which analytical details are presented. Furthermore, we provide an extra condition under which localized patterns are proven to be the limit of an unbounded branch of (spatially) periodic solutions as the period tends to infinity. We then demonstrate our approach by proving (constructively) the existence of four different localized patterns in the 2D Gray-Scott model. In addition, these solutions are proven to satisfy the $D_4$-symmetry. That is, the symmetry of the square. The algorithmic details to perform the computer-assisted proofs are available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>On the semi-additivity of the $1/2$-symmetric caloric capacity in the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study properties of a variant of the $1/2$-caloric capacity, called $1/2$-symmetric caloric capacity. The latter is associated simultaneously with the $1/2$-fractional heat equation and its conjugate. We establish its semi-additivity in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and, moreover, we compute explicitly the $1/2$-symmetric caloric capacity of rectangles, which illustrates its anisotropic behaviour.</description>

      <title>Sharp non-uniqueness for the 2D hyper-dissipative Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06880v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we study the non-uniqueness of weak solutions for the two-dimensional hyper-dissipative Navier-Stokes equations in the super-critical spaces $L_{t}^{\gamma}W_{x}^{s,p}$ when $\alpha\in[1,\frac{3}{2})$, and obtain the conclusion that the non-uniqueness of the weak solutions at the two endpoints is sharp in view of the generalized Lady\v{z}enskaya-Prodi-Serrin condition with the triplet $(s,\gamma,p)=(s,\infty, \frac{2}{2\alpha-1+s})$ and $(s, \frac{2\alpha}{2\alpha-1+s}, \infty)$. As a good observation, we use the intermittency of the temporal concentrated function in an almost optimal way. The research results extend the recent elegant works on 2D Navier-Stokes equations in [Cheskidov and Luo, Invent. Math., 229 (2022), pp. 987--1054; Cheskidov and Luo, Ann. PDE, 9:13 (2023)] to the hyper-dissipative case $\alpha \in(1,\frac{3}{2})$, and are also applicable in Lebesgue and Besov spaces. It is proved that even in the case of high viscosity, the behavior of the solution remains unpredictable and stochastic due to the lack of integrability and regularity.</description>

      <title>A note on the log-perturbed Br\'ezis-Nirenberg problem on the hyperbolic space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the log-perturbed Br\'ezis-Nirenberg problem on the hyperbolic space
  \begin{align*}
  \Delta_{\mathbb{B}^N}u+\lambda u +|u|^{p-1}u+\theta u \ln u^2 =0, \ \ \ \ u \in H^1(\mathbb{B}^N), \ u &gt; 0 \ \mbox{in} \ \mathbb{B}^N,
  \end{align*}
  and study the existence vs non-existence results. We show that whenever $\theta &gt;0,$ there exists an $H^1$-solution, while for $\theta &lt;0$, there does not exist a positive solution in a reasonably general class. Since the perturbation $ u \ln u^2$ changes sign, Pohozaev type identities do not yield any non-existence results. The main contribution of this article is obtaining an "almost" precise lower asymptotic decay estimate on the positive solutions for $\theta &lt;0,$ culminating in proving their non-existence assertion.</description>

      <title>Mathematical study of a new Navier-Stokes-alpha model with nonlinear filter equation -- Part I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03481v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article is devoted to the mathematical study of a new Navier-Stokes-alpha model with a nonlinear filter equation. For a given indicator function, this filter equation was first considered by W. Layton, G. Rebholz, and C. Trenchea to select eddies for damping based on the understanding of how nonlinearity acts in real flow problems. Numerically, this nonlinear filter equation was applied to the nonlinear term in the Navier-Stokes equations to provide a precise analysis of numerical diffusion and error estimates. Mathematically, the resulting alpha-model is described by a doubly nonlinear parabolic-elliptic coupled system. We therefore undertake the first theoretical study of this system by considering periodic boundary conditions in the spatial variable. Specifically, we address the existence and uniqueness of weak Leray-type solutions, their rigorous convergence to weak Leray solutions of the classical Navier-Stokes equations, and their long-time dynamics through the concept of the global attractor and some upper bounds for its fractal dimension. Handling the nonlinear filter equation together with the well-known nonlinear transport term makes certain estimates delicate, particularly when deriving upper bounds on the fractal dimension. For the latter, we adapt techniques developed for hyperbolic-type equations.</description>

Abstract: We propose a systematic approach to analysing the complex structure of time-periodic solutions to the cubic wave equation on an interval with Dirichlet boundary conditions first reported in arXiv:2407.16507. The analysis we present is based on a detailed study of sparse mode interactions suggested by the previous numerical work. Our results complement prior rigorous existence proofs and suggest that solutions exist for any frequency, however, they may be arbitrarily large.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalue Inequalities for Fully Nonlinear Elliptic Equations via the Alexandroff-Bekelman-Pucci Method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01858v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we establish eigenvalue inequalities for elliptic differential operators either for Dirichlet or for Robin eigenvalue problems, by using the technique introduced by Alexandroff, Bekelman and Pucci. These inequalities can be extended for fully nonlinear elliptic equations, such as for the Monge-Amp\`ere equation and for Pucci's equations. As an application we establish a lower bound for the $ L^p -$norm of the Laplacian and this bound is sharp, in the sense that, when equality is achieved then a symmetry property is obtained. In addition, we obtain an $ L^{\infty} $ bound for the gradient of solutions to fully nonlinear elliptic equations and as a result, a $ C^3 $ estimate.</description>

      <title>Periodic solutions to nonlocal pseudo-differential equations. A bifurcation theoretical perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we use abstract bifurcation theory for Fredholm operators of index zero to deal with periodic even solutions of the one-dimensional equation $\mathcal{L}u=\lambda u+|u|^{p}$, where $\mathcal{L}$ is a nonlocal pseudodifferential operator defined as a Fourier multiplier and $\lambda$ is the bifurcation parameter. Our general setting includes the fractional Laplacian $\mathcal{L}\equiv(-\Delta)^{s}$ and sharpens the results obtained for this operator to date. As a direct application, we establish the existence of traveling waves for general nonlocal dispersive equations for some velocity ranges.</description>

      <title>Multisoliton solutions for equivariant wave maps on a $2+1$ dimensional wormhole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02020v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study equivariant wave maps from the $2+1$ dimensional wormhole to the 2-sphere. This model has explicit harmonic map solutions which, in suitable coordinates, have the form of the sine-Gordon kinks/anti-kinks. We conjecture that there exist asymptotically static chains of $N\geq 2$ alternating kinks and anti-kinks whose subsequent rates of expansion increase in geometric progression as $t\rightarrow \infty$. Our argument employs the method of collective coordinates to derive effective finite-dimensional ODE models for the asymptotic dynamics of $N$-chains. For $N=2,3$ the predictions of these effective models are verified by direct PDE computations which demonstrate that the $N$-chains lie at the threshold of kink-anti-kink annihilation.</description>

      <title>The $L^p$ regularity problem for parabolic operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23801v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we fully resolve the question of whether the Regularity problem for the parabolic PDE $-\partial_tu + \mbox{div}(A\nabla u)=0$ on a Lipschitz cylinder $\mathcal O\times\mathbb R$ is solvable for some $p\in (1,\infty)$ under the assumption that the matrix $A$ is elliptic, has bounded and measurable coefficients and its coefficients satisfy a natural Carleson condition (a parabolic analog of the so-called DKP-condition).
  We prove that for some $p_0&gt;1$ the Regularity problem is solvable in the range $(1,p_0)$. We note that answer to this question was not known even in the small Carleson case, that is, when the Carleson norm of coefficients is sufficiently small.
  In the elliptic case the analogous question was only fully resolved recently independently by two groups, with two very different methods: one involving two of the authors and S. Hofmann, the second by M. Mourgoglou, B. Poggi and X. Tolsa. Our approach in the parabolic case is motivated by that of the first group, but in the parabolic setting there are significant new challenges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we apply our minimax theory ([4], [5], [6]) with the one developed by A. Moameni in [2] to formalize a general scheme giving the multiplicity of critical points. Here is a sample of application of the scheme to a critical elliptic problem: Let $\Omega\subset {\bf R}^n$ ($n\geq 3$) be a smooth bounded domain and let $1&lt;q&lt;2\leq p&lt;{{2n}\over {n-2}}$.Then, for every $r, \nu&gt;0$, there exists $\lambda^*&gt;0$ with the following property: for every $\lambda\in ]0,\lambda^*[$, $\mu\in ]-\lambda^*,\lambda^*[$, and for every convex dense set $S\subset H^{-1}(\Omega)$, there exists $\tilde\varphi\in S$, with $\|\tilde\varphi\|_{H^{-1}(\Omega)}&lt;r$, such that the problem $$\cases{-\Delta u=\lambda(|u|^{{{4}\over {n-2}}}u+\nu |u|^{q-2}u+\mu|u|^{p-2}u+\tilde\varphi) &amp; in $\Omega$\cr &amp; \cr u=0 &amp; on $\partial\Omega$\cr}$$ has at least two solutions whose norms in $H^1_0(\Omega)$ are less than or equal to $r$.</description>

      <title>On Second-Order $L^\infty$ Variational Problems with Lower-Order Terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11701v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study $2$nd order $L^\infty$ variational problems, through seeking to minimise a supremal functional involving the Hessian of admissible functions as well as lower-order terms. Specifically, given a bounded domain $\Omega\subseteq \mathbb R^n$ and $\mathrm H : \Omega\times\big(\mathbb R \times\mathbb R^n \times \mathbb R^{n^{\otimes2}}_s \big) \to \mathbb R$, we consider the functional \[ \mathrm{E}_\infty(u, \mathcal{O}) :=\underset{ \mathcal{O}}{\mathrm{ess}\sup}\hspace{1mm}\mathrm H (\cdot,u,\mathrm D u,\mathrm D^2u ) , \ \ u\in W^{2,\infty}(\Omega), \ \mathcal{O} \subseteq \Omega \text{ measurable}. \] We establish the existence of minimisers subject to (first-order) Dirichlet data on $\partial \Omega$ under natural assumptions, and, when $n=1$, we also show the existence of absolute minimisers. We further derive a necessary fully nonlinear PDE of third-order which arises as the analogue of the Euler-Lagrange equation for absolute minimisers, and is given by
  $$ \ \ \mathrm H_{\mathrm X}(\cdot,u,\mathrm D u,\mathrm D^2u): \mathrm D\big(\mathrm H(\cdot,u,\mathrm D u,\mathrm D^2u)\big)\otimes \mathrm D\big(\mathrm H(\cdot,u,\mathrm D u,\mathrm D^2u)\big)=0\ \ \text{ in }\Omega.
  $$ We then rigorously derive this PDE from smooth absolute minimisers, and prove the existence of generalised D-solutions to the (first-order) Dirichlet problem. Our work generalises the key results obtained in [26] which first studied problems of this type with pure Hessian dependence only, providing at the same time considerably simpler streamlined proofs.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we primarily study the Pogorelov-type $C^2$ estimates for $(k-1)$-convex solutions of the sum Hessian equation under the assumption of semi-convexity, and apply these estimates to obtain a rigidity theorem for global solutions satisfying the corresponding conditions. Furthermore, we investigate the Pogorelov estimates and rigidity theorems for solutions to the parabolic versions under similar conditions. These results extend the works of \cite{He-Sheng-Xiang-Zhang-2022-CCM} and \cite{Liu-Ren-2023-JFA}.</description>

      <title>Does Yakhot's growth law for turbulent burning velocity hold?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using formal renormalization theory, Yakhot derived in ([32], 1988) an $O\left(\frac{A}{\sqrt{\log A}}\right)$ growth law of the turbulent flame speed with respect to large flow intensity $A$ based on the inviscid G-equation. Although this growth law is widely cited in combustion literature, there has been no rigorous mathematical discussion to date about its validity. As a first step towards unveiling the mystery, we prove that there is no intermediate growth law between $O\left(\frac{A}{\log A}\right)$ and $O(A)$ for two dimensional incompressible Lipschitz continuous periodic flows with bounded swirl sizes. In particular, we do not assume the non-degeneracy of critical points. Additionally, other examples of flows with lower regularity, Lagrangian chaos, and related phenomena are also discussed.</description>

Abstract: We consider weighted p-Laplace type equations with homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions in convex domains, where the weight is a log-concave function which may degenerate at the boundary. In the case of bounded domains, we provide sharp global second-order estimates. For unbounded domains, we prove local estimates at the boundary.

Abstract: In this work, we present higher order div-curl type estimates in the sense of Coifman, Lions, Meyer &amp; Semmes in the local setup of elliptic linear differential operators with smooth coefficients on localizable Hardy spaces. Our version implies and extends results obtained for first order operators associated to elliptic systems and complexes of vector fields. As tools, with own interest, we develop a new smooth atomic decomposition on localizable Hardy-Sobolev spaces and a Poincar\'e type inequality.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate on a bounded open set of $\mathbb{R}^N$ with smooth boundary, an eigenvalue problem involving the sum of nonlocal operators $(-\Delta)_p^{s_1}+ (-\Delta)_q^{s_2}$ with $s_1,s_2\in (0,1)$, $p,q\in (1,\infty)$ and subject to the corresponding homogeneous nonlocal $(p,q)$-Neumann boundary condition. A careful analysis of the considered problem leads us to a complete description of the set of eigenvalues as being the precise interval $\{0\}\cup(\lambda_{1}(s_2,q),\infty)$, where $\lambda_{1}(s_2,q)$ is the first nonzero eigenvalue of the homogeneous fractional $q$-Laplacian under nonlocal $q$-Neumann boundary condition. Furthermore, we establish that every eigenfunctions is globally bounded.</description>

      <title>Resonant forms at zero for dissipative Anosov flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.06255v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study resonant differential forms at zero for transitive Anosov flows on $3$-manifolds. We pay particular attention to the dissipative case, that is, Anosov flows that do not preserve an absolutely continuous measure. Such flows have two distinguished Sinai-Ruelle-Bowen $3$-forms, $\Omega_{\text{SRB}}^{\pm}$, and the cohomology classes $[\iota_{X}\Omega_{\text{SRB}}^{\pm}]$ (where $X$ is the infinitesimal generator of the flow) play a key role in the determination of the space of resonant $1$-forms. When both classes vanish we associate to the flow a $\textit{helicity}$ that naturally extends the classical notion associated with null-homologous volume preserving flows. We provide a general theory that includes horocyclic invariance of resonant $1$-forms and SRB-measures as well as the local geometry of the maps $X\mapsto [\iota_{X}\Omega_{\text{SRB}}^{\pm}]$ near a null-homologous volume preserving flow. Next, we study several relevant classes of examples. Among these are thermostats associated with holomorphic quadratic differentials, giving rise to quasi-Fuchsian flows as introduced by Ghys. For these flows we compute explicitly all resonant $1$-forms at zero, we show that $[\iota_{X}\Omega_{\text{SRB}}^{\pm}]=0$ and give an explicit formula for the helicity. In addition we show that a generic time change of a quasi-Fuchsian flow is semisimple and thus the order of vanishing of the Ruelle zeta function at zero is $-\chi(M)$, the same as in the geodesic flow case. In contrast, we show that if $(M,g)$ is a closed surface of negative curvature, the Gaussian thermostat driven by a (small) harmonic $1$-form has a Ruelle zeta function whose order of vanishing at zero is $-\chi(M)-1$.</description>

      <title>Genus one singularities in mean curvature flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05923v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that for certain one-parameter families of initial conditions in $\mathbb R^3$, when we run mean curvature flow, a genus one singularity must appear in one of the flows. Moreover, such a singularity is robust under perturbation of the family of initial conditions. This contrasts sharply with the case of just a single flow. As an application, we construct an embedded, genus one self-shrinker with entropy lower than a shrinking doughnut.</description>

      <title>Parametric holomorphy of elliptic eigenvalue problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01227v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of parameter-dependent partial differential equations (parametric PDEs) with countably many parameters has been actively studied for the last few decades. In particular, it has been well known that a certain type of parametric holomorphy of the PDE solutions allows the application of deep neural networks without encountering the curse of dimensionality. This paper aims to propose a general framework for verifying the desired parametric holomorphy by utilizing the bounds on parametric derivatives. The framework is illustrated with examples of parametric elliptic eigenvalue problems (EVPs), encompassing both linear and semilinear cases. As the results, it will be shown that the ground eigenpairs have the desired holomorphy. Furthermore, under the same conditions, improved bounds for the mixed derivatives of the ground eigenpairs are derived. These bounds are well known to take a crucial role in the error analysis of quasi-Monte Carlo methods.</description>

      <title>The effective use of BLAS interface for implementation of finite-element ADER-DG and finite-volume ADER-WENO methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12483v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerical methods of the ADER family, in particular finite-element ADER-DG and finite-volume ADER-WENO methods, are among the most accurate numerical methods for solving quasilinear PDE systems. The internal structure of ADER-DG and ADER-WENO numerical methods contains a large number of basic linear algebra operations related to matrix multiplications. The main interface of software libraries for matrix multiplications for high-performance computing is BLAS. This paper presents an effective method for integration the standard functions of the BLAS interface into the implementation of these numerical methods. The calculated matrices are small matrices; at the same time, the proposed implementation makes it possible to effectively use existing JIT technologies. The proposed approach immediately operates on AoS, which makes it possible to efficiently calculate flux, source and non-conservative terms without need to carry out transposition. The obtained computational costs demonstrated that the effective implementation, based on the use of the JIT functions of the BLAS, outperformed both the implementation based on the general BLAS functions and the vanilla implementations by several orders of magnitude. At the same time, the complexity of developing an implementation based on the approach proposed in this work does not exceed the complexity of developing a vanilla implementation.</description>
