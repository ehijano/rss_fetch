      <title>Using Catalan words and $q$-shuffle algebras to describe the Damiani-Beck PBW bases for the positive parts of quantum affine superalgebra $U_q(C(2)^{(2)})$ and quantum admissible affine algebra $\mathcal{U}_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{s l}}_2)$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the positive part $U_q^{+}$ of the quantum affine superalgebra $U_q(C(2)^{(2)})$ and the quantum admissible affine algebra $\mathcal{U}_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{s l}}_2)$ newly defined in \cite{HZ}, which both have presentations with two generators $e_{\alpha}, e_{\delta-\alpha}$ that satisfy the cubic $q$-Serre relations. There are the Damiani and the Beck $PBW$ bases for those two algebras due to Khoroshkin-Lukierski-Tolstoy and Hu-Zhuang, respectively. In this paper, we use $q$-shuffle algebra and Catalan words to express those two bases in closed form. Finally, the equitable presentations of $U_q(C(2)^{(2)})$ and $\mathcal{U}_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{s l}}_2)$ are exhibited.</description>

      <title>Universal microscopic descriptions for statistics of particles and extended excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Statistics of excitations play an essential role in understanding phases of matter. In this paper, we introduce a universal method for studying the generalized statistics of Abelian particles and extended excitations in lattices of any dimension. We compute the statistics using the Berry phase of a sequence of unitary operators that transports the excitations while canceling local ambiguities at each step. The sequence is derived from locality, using the Smith normal form. We show that the statistics are quantized invariants. Our method unifies the statistics for the braiding and fusion of particles and loops, and leads to the discovery of novel statistics for membrane excitations. The statistics can be interpreted as the quantum anomaly of a generalized global symmetry, which manifests as an obstruction to gauging the symmetry on lattices. Furthermore, we show that non-trivial statistics forbid short-range entangled states, establishing the dynamical consequence of anomalies in microscopic lattice models.</description>

      <title>Twisted tensor product of dg categories and Kontsevich's Swiss Cheese conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $A$ be a $1$-algebra. The Kontsevich Swiss Cheese conjecture [K2] states that the homotopy category $\mathrm{Ho}(\mathrm{Act}(A))$ of actions of $2$-algebras on $A$ has a final object and that this object is weakly equivalent to the pair $(\mathrm{Hoch}(A), A)$, where $\mathrm{Hoch}(A)$ is the cochain Hochschild complex of $A$. Here the category of actions is the category whose objects are pairs $(B,A)$ which are algebras of the chain Swiss Cheese operad such that the induced action of the little interval operad on the component $A$ coincides with the $1$-structure on $A$.
  We prove that there is a colored dg operad ${O}$ with 2 colors, weakly equivalent to the chain Swiss Cheese operad for which the following ``stricter" version of the Kontsevich Swiss Cheese conjecture holds. Denote the two colors of ${O}$ by $a$ (for the 1-algebra argument) and $c$ (for the 2-algebra argument), denote by $E_1^{{O}}$ the restriction of ${O}$ to the color $a$, and by $E_2^{{O}}$ the restriction of ${O}$ to the color $c$. Let $\mathrm{Alg}({O})$ be the category of dg algebras over ${O}$. For a fixed $1$-algebra $A$ we also have the the category of action $\mathrm{Alg}({O})_A$ (equal to $\mathrm{Act}(A)$ in case of the Swiss Cheese operad). We prove that there is an equivalence of categories $$\mathrm{Alg}({O})_A \cong \mathrm{Alg}(E_2^{{O}})/\mathrm{Hoch}(A)$$ We stress that for this particular model of Swiss Cheese operad the statement holds on the chain level, without passage to the homotopy category.</description>

      <title>A family of orthogonal functions on the unit circle and a new multilateral matrix inverse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using Bailey's very-well-poised $_6\psi_6$ summation, we show that a specific sequence of well-poised bilateral basic hypergeometric $_3\psi_3$ series form a family of orthogonal functions on the unit circle. We further extract a bilateral matrix inverse from Dougall's ${}_2H_2$ summation which we use, in combination with the Pfaff--Saalsch\"utz summation, to derive a summation for a particular bilateral hypergeometric $_3H_3$ series. We finally provide multivariate extensions of the bilateral matrix inverse and the $_3H_3$ summation in the setting of hypergeometric series associated to the root system $A_r$.</description>

      <title>The Condensed Fiber Product and Zesting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the condensed fiber product of two $G$-crossed braided fusion categories, generalizing existing constructions in the literature. We show that this product is closely related to the cohomological construction known as zesting. Furthermore, the condensed fiber product defines a monoidal structure on the 2-category of $G$-crossed and braided extensions of braided categories with a fixed transparent symmetric pointed subcategory.</description>

      <title>Skew braces: a brief survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07112v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our primary focus is on the theory of skew braces, specifically exploring their connection with combinatorial solutions to the Yang-Baxter equation. Skew braces have recently emerged as intriguing algebraic structures, and their link to the Yang-Baxter equation adds further depth and significance to their study. Throughout this article, we place particular emphasis on various problems and conjectures that arise within this field. These open questions serve to stimulate further research and investigation, as we strive to enhance our understanding of skew braces and their role in the study of the Yang-Baxter equation.</description>

      <title>An algorithm for Tambara-Yamagami quantum invariants of 3-manifolds, parameterized by the first Betti number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08514v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum topology provides various frameworks for defining and computing invariants of manifolds inspired by quantum theory. One such framework of substantial interest in both mathematics and physics is the Turaev-Viro-Barrett-Westbury state sum construction, which uses the data of a spherical fusion category to define topological invariants of triangulated 3-manifolds via tensor network contractions. In this work we analyze the computational complexity of state sum invariants of 3-manifolds derived from Tambara-Yamagami categories. While these categories are the simplest source of state sum invariants beyond finite abelian groups (whose invariants can be computed in polynomial time) their computational complexities are yet to be fully understood. We first establish that the invariants arising from even the smallest Tambara-Yamagami categories are #P-hard to compute, so that one expects the same to be true of the whole family. Our main result is then the existence of a fixed parameter tractable algorithm to compute these 3-manifold invariants, where the parameter is the first Betti number of the 3-manifold with Z/2Z coefficients.
  Contrary to other domains of computational topology, such as graphs on surfaces, very few hard problems in 3-manifold topology are known to admit FPT algorithms with a topological parameter. However, such algorithms are of particular interest as their complexity depends only polynomially on the combinatorial representation of the input, regardless of size or combinatorial width. Additionally, in the case of Betti numbers, the parameter itself is computable in polynomial time. Thus while one generally expects quantum invariants to be hard to compute classically, our results suggest that the hardness of computing state sum invariants from Tambara-Yamagami categories arises from classical 3-manifold topology rather than the quantum nature of the algebraic input.</description>
