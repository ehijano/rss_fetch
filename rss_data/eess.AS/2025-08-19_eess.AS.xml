      <title>FNH-TTS: A Fast, Natural, and Human-Like Speech Synthesis System with advanced prosodic modeling based on Mixture of Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving natural and human-like speech synthesis with low inference costs remains a major challenge in speech synthesis research. This study focuses on human prosodic patterns and synthesized spectrum harmony, addressing the challenges of prosody modeling and artifact issues in non-autoregressive models. To enhance prosody modeling and synthesis quality, we introduce a new Duration Predictor based on the Mixture of Experts alongside a new Vocoder with two advanced multi-scale discriminators. We integrated the these new modules into the VITS system, forming our FNH-TTS system. Our experiments on LJSpeech, VCTK, and LibriTTS demonstrate the system's superiority in synthesis quality, phoneme duration prediction, Vocoder results, and synthesis speed. Our prosody visualization results show that FNH-TTS produces duration predictions that more closely align with natural human beings than other systems.</description>

      <title>MASSLOC: A Massive Sound Source Localization System based on Direction-of-Arrival Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acoustic indoor localization offers the potential for highly accurate position estimation while generally exhibiting low hardware requirements compared to Radio Frequency (RF)-based solutions. Furthermore, angular-based localization significantly reduces installation effort by minimizing the number of required fixed anchor nodes. In this contribution, we propose the so-called MASSLOC system, which leverages sparse two-dimensional array geometries to localize and identify a large number of concurrently active sources. Additionally, the use of complementary Zadoff-Chu sequences is introduced to enable efficient, beamforming-based source identification. These sequences provide a trade-off between favorable correlation properties and accurate, unsynchronized direction-of-arrival estimation by exhibiting a spectrally balanced waveform. The system is evaluated in both a controlled anechoic chamber and a highly reverberant lobby environment with a reverberation time of 1.6 s. In a laboratory setting, successful direction-of-arrival estimation and identification of up to 14 simultaneously emitting sources are demonstrated. Adopting a Perspective-n-Point (PnP) calibration approach, the system achieves a median three-dimensional localization error of 55.7 mm and a median angular error of 0.84 deg with dynamic source movement of up to 1.9 mps in the challenging reverberant environment. The multi-source capability is also demonstrated and evaluated in that environment with a total of three tags. These results indicate the scalability and robustness of the MASSLOC system, even under challenging acoustic conditions.</description>

      <title>Cryfish: On deep audio analysis with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent revolutionary progress in text-based large language models (LLMs) has contributed to the growth of interest in extending capabilities of such models to multimodal perception and understanding tasks. Hearing is an essential capability that is highly desired to be integrated into LLMs. However, effective integrating listening capabilities into LLMs is a significant challenge lying in generalizing complex auditory tasks across speech and sounds. To address these issues, we introduce Cryfish, our version of auditory-capable LLM. The model integrates WavLM audio-encoder features into Qwen2 model using a transformer-based connector. Cryfish is adapted to various auditory tasks through a specialized training strategy. We evaluate the model on the new Dynamic SUPERB Phase-2 comprehensive multitask benchmark specifically designed for auditory-capable models. The paper presents an in-depth analysis and detailed comparison of Cryfish with the publicly available models.</description>

      <title>Arabic ASR on the SADA Large-Scale Arabic Speech Corpus with Transformer-Based Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the performance of several state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR) models on a large-scale Arabic speech dataset, the SADA (Saudi Audio Dataset for Arabic), which contains 668 hours of high-quality audio from Saudi television shows. The dataset includes multiple dialects and environments, specifically a noisy subset that makes it particularly challenging for ASR. We evaluate the performance of the models on the SADA test set, and we explore the impact of fine-tuning, language models, as well as noise and denoising on their performance. We find that the best performing model is the MMS 1B model finetuned on SADA with a 4-gram language model that achieves a WER of 40.9\% and a CER of 17.6\% on the SADA test clean set.</description>

      <title>Prediction of Spotify Chart Success Using Audio and Streaming Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spotify's streaming charts offer a real-time lens into music popularity, driving discovery, playlists, and even revenue potential. Understanding what influences a song's rise in ranks on these charts-especially early on-can guide marketing efforts, investment decisions, and even artistic direction. In this project, we developed a classification pipeline to predict a song's chart success based on its musical characteristics and early engagement data. Using all 2024 U.S. Top 200 Spotify Daily Charts and the Spotify Web API, we built a dataset containing both metadata and audio features for 14,639 unique songs.
  The project was structured in two phases. First, we benchmarked four models: Logistic Regression, K Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, and XGBoost-using a standard train-test split. In the second phase, we incorporated cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, and detailed class-level evaluation to ensure robustness. Tree-based models consistently outperformed the rest, with Random Forest and XGBoost achieving macro F1-scores near 0.95 and accuracy around 97%.
  Even when stream count and rank history were excluded, models trained solely on audio attributes retained predictive power. These findings validate the potential of audio-based modeling in A&amp;R scouting, playlist optimization, and hit forecasting-long before a track reaches critical mass.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study how musicians use artificial intelligence (AI) across formats like singles, albums, performances, installations, voices, ballets, operas, or soundtracks. We collect 337 music artworks and categorize them based on AI usage: AI composition, co-composition, sound design, lyrics generation, and translation. We find that AI is employed as a co-creative tool, as an artistic medium, and in live performances and installations. Innovative uses of AI include exploring uncanny aesthetics, multilingual and multigenre song releases, and new formats such as online installations. This research provides a comprehensive overview of current AI music practices, offering insights into emerging artistic trends and the challenges faced by AI musicians.</description>

      <title>Exploring Self-Supervised Audio Models for Generalized Anomalous Sound Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine anomalous sound detection (ASD) is a valuable technique across various applications. However, its generalization performance is often limited due to challenges in data collection and the complexity of acoustic environments. Inspired by the success of large pre-trained models in numerous fields, this paper introduces a robust ASD model that leverages self-supervised pre-trained models trained on large-scale speech and audio datasets. Although there are inconsistencies between the pre-training datasets and the ASD task, our findings indicate that pre-training still provides substantial benefits for ASD. To mitigate overfitting and retain learned knowledge when fine-tuning with limited data, we explore Fully-Connected Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) as an alternative to full fine-tuning. Additionally, we propose a Machine-aware Group Adapter module, which enables the model to capture differences between various machines within a unified framework, thereby enhancing the generalization performance of ASD systems. To address the challenge of missing attribute labels, we design a novel objective function that dynamically clusters unattributed data using vector quantization and optimizes through a dual-level contrastive learning loss. The proposed methods are evaluated on all benchmark datasets, including the DCASE 2020-2024 five ASD challenges, and the experimental results show significant improvements of our new approach and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed strategies.</description>

      <title>What do Speech Foundation Models Learn? Analysis and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech foundation models (SFMs) are designed to serve as general-purpose representations for a wide range of speech-processing tasks. The last five years have seen an influx of increasingly successful self-supervised and supervised pre-trained models with impressive performance on various downstream tasks.
  Although the zoo of SFMs continues to grow, our understanding of the knowledge they acquire lags behind. This thesis presents a lightweight analysis framework using statistical tools and training-free tasks to investigate the acoustic and linguistic knowledge encoded in SFM layers. We conduct a comparative study across multiple SFMs and statistical tools. Our study also shows that the analytical insights have concrete implications for downstream task performance.
  The effectiveness of an SFM is ultimately determined by its performance on speech applications. Yet it remains unclear whether the benefits extend to spoken language understanding (SLU) tasks that require a deeper understanding than widely studied ones, such as speech recognition. The limited exploration of SLU is primarily due to a lack of relevant datasets. To alleviate that, this thesis contributes tasks, specifically spoken named entity recognition (NER) and named entity localization (NEL), to the Spoken Language Understanding Evaluation benchmark. We develop SFM-based approaches for NER and NEL, and find that end-to-end (E2E) models leveraging SFMs can surpass traditional cascaded (speech recognition followed by a text model) approaches. Further, we evaluate E2E SLU models across SFMs and adaptation strategies to assess the impact on task performance.
  Collectively, this thesis tackles previously unanswered questions about SFMs, providing tools and datasets to further our understanding and to enable the community to make informed design choices for future model development and adoption.</description>

      <title>HuBERT-VIC: Improving Noise-Robust Automatic Speech Recognition of Speech Foundation Model via Variance-Invariance-Covariance Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Noise robustness in speech foundation models (SFMs) has been a critical challenge, as most models are primarily trained on clean data and experience performance degradation when the models are exposed to noisy speech. To address this issue, we propose HuBERT-VIC, a noise-robust SFM with variance, in-variance, and covariance regularization (VICReg) objectives. These objectives adjust the statistics of noisy speech representations, enabling the model to capture diverse acoustic characteristics and improving the generalization ability across different types of noise. When applied to HuBERT, our model shows relative performance improvements of 23.3% on LibriSpeech test-clean and 13.2% on test-other, compared to the baseline model pre-trained on noisy speech.</description>

      <title>CarelessWhisper: Turning Whisper into a Causal Streaming Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has seen remarkable progress, with models like OpenAI Whisper and NVIDIA Canary achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in offline transcription. However, these models are not designed for streaming (online or real-time) transcription, due to limitations in their architecture and training methodology. We propose a method to turn the transformer encoder-decoder model into a low-latency streaming model that is careless about future context. We present an analysis explaining why it is not straightforward to convert an encoder-decoder transformer to a low-latency streaming model. Our proposed method modifies the existing (non-causal) encoder to a causal encoder by fine-tuning both the encoder and decoder using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and a weakly aligned dataset. We then propose an updated inference mechanism that utilizes the fine-tune causal encoder and decoder to yield greedy and beam-search decoding, and is shown to be locally optimal. Experiments on low-latency chunk sizes (less than 300 msec) show that our fine-tuned model outperforms existing non-fine-tuned streaming approaches in most cases, while using a lower complexity. Additionally, we observe that our training process yields better alignment, enabling a simple method for extracting word-level timestamps. We release our training and inference code, along with the fine-tuned models, to support further research and development in streaming ASR.</description>

      <title>On the Extension of Differential Beamforming Theory to Arbitrary Planar Arrays of First-Order Elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Small-size acoustic arrays exploit spatial diversity to achieve capabilities beyond those of single-element devices, with applications ranging from teleconferencing to immersive multimedia. A key requirement for broadband array processing is a frequency-invariant spatial response, which ensures consistent directivity across wide bandwidths and prevents spectral coloration. Differential beamforming offers an inherently frequency-invariant solution by leveraging pressure differences between closely spaced elements of small-size arrays. Traditional approaches, however, assume the array elements to be omnidirectional, whereas real transducers exhibit frequency-dependent directivity that can degrade performance if not properly modeled. To address this limitation, we propose a generalized modal matching framework for frequency-invariant differential beamforming, applicable to unconstrained planar arrays of first-order directional elements. By representing the desired beampattern as a truncated circular harmonic expansion and fitting it to the actual element responses, our method accommodates arbitrary planar geometries and element orientations. This approach enables the synthesis of beampatterns of any order and steering direction without imposing rigid layout requirements. Simulations confirm that accounting for sensor directivity at the design stage yields accurate and robust performance across varying frequencies, geometries, and noise conditions.</description>

      <title>Predicting speech intelligibility in older adults for speech enhancement using the Gammachirp Envelope Similarity Index, GESI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an objective intelligibility measure (OIM), called the Gammachirp Envelope Similarity Index (GESI), that can predict speech intelligibility (SI) in older adults. GESI is a bottom-up model based on psychoacoustic knowledge from the peripheral to the central auditory system. It computes the single SI metric using the gammachirp filterbank (GCFB), the modulation filterbank, and the extended cosine similarity measure. It takes into account not only the hearing level represented in the audiogram, but also the temporal processing characteristics captured by the temporal modulation transfer function (TMTF). To evaluate performance, SI experiments were conducted with older adults of various hearing levels using speech-in-noise with ideal speech enhancement on familiarity-controlled Japanese words. The prediction performance was compared with HASPIw2, which was developed for keyword SI prediction. The results showed that GESI predicted the subjective SI scores more accurately than HASPIw2. GESI was also found to be at least as effective as, if not more effective than, HASPIv2 in predicting English sentence-level SI. The effect of introducing TMTF into the GESI algorithm was insignificant, suggesting that TMTF measurements and models are not yet mature. Therefore, it may be necessary to perform TMTF measurements with bandpass noise and to improve the incorporation of temporal characteristics into the model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: End-to-End Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has advanced significantly yet still struggles with rare and domain-specific entities. This paper introduces a simple yet efficient prompt-based biasing technique for contextualized ASR, enhancing recognition accuracy by leverage a unified multitask learning framework. The approach comprises two key components: a prompt biasing model which is trained to determine when to focus on entities in prompt, and a entity filtering mechanism which efficiently filters out irrelevant entities. Our method significantly enhances ASR accuracy on entities, achieving a relative 30.7% and 18.0% reduction in Entity Word Error Rate compared to the baseline model with shallow fusion on in-house domain dataset with small and large entity lists, respectively. The primary advantage of this method lies in its efficiency and simplicity without any structure change, making it lightweight and highly efficient.</description>

      <title>Multi-agent Auditory Scene Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Auditory scene analysis (ASA) aims to retrieve information from the acoustic environment, by carrying out three main tasks: sound source location, separation, and classification. These tasks are traditionally executed with a linear data flow, where the sound sources are first located; then, using their location, each source is separated into its own audio stream; from each of which, information is extracted that is relevant to the application scenario (audio event detection, speaker identification, emotion classification, etc.). However, running these tasks linearly increases the overall response time, while making the last tasks (separation and classification) highly sensitive to errors of the first task (location). A considerable amount of effort and computational complexity has been employed in the state-of-the-art to develop techniques that are the least error-prone possible. However, doing so gives rise to an ASA system that is non-viable in many applications that require a small computational footprint and a low response time, such as bioacoustics, hearing-aid design, search and rescue, human-robot interaction, etc. To this effect, in this work, a multi-agent approach is proposed to carry out ASA where the tasks are run in parallel, with feedback loops between them to compensate for local errors, such as: using the quality of the separation output to correct the location error; and using the classification result to reduce the localization's sensitivity towards interferences. The result is a multi-agent auditory scene analysis (MASA) system that is robust against local errors, without a considerable increase in complexity, and with a low response time. The complete proposed MASA system is provided as a framework that uses open-source tools for sound acquisition and reproduction (JACK) and inter-agent communication (ROS2), allowing users to add their own agents.</description>

      <title>Controllable joint noise reduction and hearing loss compensation using a differentiable auditory model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09372v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning-based hearing loss compensation (HLC) seeks to enhance speech intelligibility and quality for hearing impaired listeners using neural networks. One major challenge of HLC is the lack of a ground-truth target. Recent works have used neural networks to emulate non-differentiable auditory peripheral models in closed-loop frameworks, but this approach lacks flexibility. Alternatively, differentiable auditory models allow direct optimization, yet previous studies focused on individual listener profiles, or joint noise reduction (NR) and HLC without balancing each task. This work formulates NR and HLC as a multi-task learning problem, training a system to simultaneously predict denoised and compensated signals from noisy speech and audiograms using a differentiable auditory model. Results show the system achieves similar objective metric performance to systems trained for each task separately, while being able to adjust the balance between NR and HLC during inference.</description>

      <title>Fast Algorithm for Moving Sound Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern neural network-based speech processing systems usually need to have reverberation resistance, so the training of such systems requires a large amount of reverberation data. In the process of system training, it is now more inclined to use sampling static systems to simulate dynamic systems, or to supplement data through actually recorded data. However, this cannot fundamentally solve the problem of simulating motion data that conforms to physical laws. Aiming at the core issue of insufficient training data for speech enhancement models in moving scenarios, this paper proposes Yang's motion spatio-temporal sampling reconstruction theory to realize efficient simulation of motion continuous time-varying reverberation. This theory breaks through the limitations of the traditional static Image-Source Method (ISM) in time-varying systems. By decomposing the impulse response of the moving image source into two parts: linear time-invariant modulation and discrete time-varying fractional delay, a moving sound field model conforming to physical laws is established. Based on the band-limited characteristics of motion displacement, a hierarchical sampling strategy is proposed: high sampling rate is used for low-order images to retain details, and low sampling rate is used for high-order images to reduce computational complexity. A fast synthesis architecture is designed to realize real-time simulation. Experiments show that compared with the open-source models, the proposed theory can more accurately restore the amplitude and phase changes in moving scenarios, solving the industry problem of motion sound source data simulation, and providing high-quality dynamic training data for speech enhancement models.</description>

      <title>Is Smaller Always Faster? Tradeoffs in Compressing Self-Supervised Speech Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.09949v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformer-based self-supervised models have achieved remarkable success in speech processing, but their large size and high inference cost present significant challenges for real-world deployment. While numerous compression techniques have been proposed, inconsistent evaluation metrics make it difficult to compare their practical effectiveness. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive study of four common compression methods, including weight pruning, head pruning, low-rank approximation, and knowledge distillation on self-supervised speech Transformers. We evaluate each method under three key metrics: parameter count, multiply-accumulate operations, and real-time factor. Results show that each method offers distinct advantages. In addition, we contextualize recent compression techniques, comparing DistilHuBERT, FitHuBERT, LightHuBERT, ARMHuBERT, and STaRHuBERT under the same framework, offering practical guidance on compression for deployment.</description>

      <title>S2Cap: A Benchmark and a Baseline for Singing Style Captioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09866v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Singing voices contain much richer information than common voices, including varied vocal and acoustic properties. However, current open-source audio-text datasets for singing voices capture only a narrow range of attributes and lack acoustic features, leading to limited utility towards downstream tasks, such as style captioning. To fill this gap, we formally define the singing style captioning task and present S2Cap, a dataset of singing voices with detailed descriptions covering diverse vocal, acoustic, and demographic characteristics. Using this dataset, we develop an efficient and straightforward baseline algorithm for singing style captioning. The dataset is available at https://zenodo.org/records/15673764.</description>

      <title>Full-Duplex-Bench: A Benchmark to Evaluate Full-duplex Spoken Dialogue Models on Turn-taking Capabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04721v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spoken dialogue modeling poses challenges beyond text-based language modeling, requiring real-time interaction, turn-taking, and backchanneling. While most Spoken Dialogue Models (SDMs) operate in half-duplex mode-processing one turn at a time - emerging full-duplex SDMs can listen and speak simultaneously, enabling more natural conversations. However, current evaluations remain limited, focusing mainly on turn-based metrics or coarse corpus-level analyses. To address this, we introduce Full-Duplex-Bench, a benchmark that systematically evaluates key interactive behaviors: pause handling, backchanneling, turn-taking, and interruption management. Our framework uses automatic metrics for consistent, reproducible assessment and provides a fair, fast evaluation setup. By releasing our benchmark and code, we aim to advance spoken dialogue modeling and foster the development of more natural and engaging SDMs.</description>

      <title>DiffVox: A Differentiable Model for Capturing and Analysing Vocal Effects Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14735v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel and interpretable model, DiffVox, for matching vocal effects in music production. DiffVox, short for ``Differentiable Vocal Fx", integrates parametric equalisation, dynamic range control, delay, and reverb with efficient differentiable implementations to enable gradient-based optimisation for parameter estimation. Vocal presets are retrieved from two datasets, comprising 70 tracks from MedleyDB and 365 tracks from a private collection. Analysis of parameter correlations reveals strong relationships between effects and parameters, such as the high-pass and low-shelf filters often working together to shape the low end, and the delay time correlating with the intensity of the delayed signals. Principal component analysis reveals connections to McAdams' timbre dimensions, where the most crucial component modulates the perceived spaciousness while the secondary components influence spectral brightness. Statistical testing confirms the non-Gaussian nature of the parameter distribution, highlighting the complexity of the vocal effects space. These initial findings on the parameter distributions set the foundation for future research in vocal effects modelling and automatic mixing. Our source code and datasets are accessible at https://github.com/SonyResearch/diffvox.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Noise Resilient Keyword Spotting Using One-Shot Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09304v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Keyword spotting (KWS) is a key component of smart devices, enabling efficient and intuitive audio interaction. However, standard KWS systems deployed on embedded devices often suffer performance degradation under real-world operating conditions. Resilient KWS systems address this issue by enabling dynamic adaptation, with applications such as adding or replacing keywords, adjusting to specific users, and improving noise robustness. However, deploying resilient, standalone KWS systems with low latency on resource-constrained devices remains challenging due to limited memory and computational resources. This study proposes a low computational approach for continuous noise adaptation of pretrained neural networks used for KWS classification, requiring only 1-shot learning and one epoch. The proposed method was assessed using two pretrained models and three real-world noise sources at signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) ranging from 24 to -3 dB. The adapted models consistently outperformed the pretrained models across all scenarios, especially at SNR $\leq$ 18 dB, achieving accuracy improvements of 4.9% to 46.0%. These results highlight the efficacy of the proposed methodology while being lightweight enough for deployment on resource-constrained devices.</description>

      <title>Comparative Evaluation of Acoustic Feature Extraction Tools for Clinical Speech Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01129v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study compares three acoustic feature extraction toolkits (OpenSMILE, Praat, and Librosa) applied to clinical speech data from individuals with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD) and healthy controls (HC). By standardizing extraction parameters across the toolkits, we analyzed speech samples from 77 SSD and 87 HC participants and found significant toolkit-dependent variations. While F0 percentiles showed high cross-toolkit correlation (r=0.962 to 0.999), measures like F0 standard deviation and formant values often had poor, even negative, agreement. Additionally, correlation patterns differed between SSD and HC groups. Classification analysis identified F0 mean, HNR, and MFCC1 (AUC greater than 0.70) as promising discriminators. These findings underscore reproducibility concerns and advocate for standardized protocols, multi-toolkit cross-validation, and transparent reporting.</description>

      <title>Towards Generalized Source Tracing for Codec-Based Deepfake Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07294v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent attempts at source tracing for codec-based deepfake speech (CodecFake), generated by neural audio codec-based speech generation (CoSG) models, have exhibited suboptimal performance. However, how to train source tracing models using simulated CoSG data while maintaining strong performance on real CoSG-generated audio remains an open challenge. In this paper, we show that models trained solely on codec-resynthesized data tend to overfit to non-speech regions and struggle to generalize to unseen content. To mitigate these challenges, we introduce the Semantic-Acoustic Source Tracing Network (SASTNet), which jointly leverages Whisper for semantic feature encoding and Wav2vec2 with AudioMAE for acoustic feature encoding. Our proposed SASTNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CoSG test set of the CodecFake+ dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness for reliable source tracing.</description>

      <title>USAD: Universal Speech and Audio Representation via Distillation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18843v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has revolutionized audio representations, yet models often remain domain-specific, focusing on either speech or non-speech tasks. In this work, we present Universal Speech and Audio Distillation (USAD), a unified approach to audio representation learning that integrates diverse audio types - speech, sound, and music - into a single model. USAD employs efficient layer-to-layer distillation from domain-specific SSL models to train a student on a comprehensive audio dataset. USAD offers competitive performance across various benchmarks and datasets, including frame and instance-level speech processing tasks, audio tagging, and sound classification, achieving near state-of-the-art results with a single encoder on SUPERB and HEAR benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Radif Corpus: A Symbolic Dataset for Non-Metric Iranian Classical Music</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10456v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-metric music forms the core of the repertoire in Iranian classical music. Dastgahi music serves as the underlying theoretical system for both Iranian art music and certain folk traditions. At the heart of Iranian classical music lies the radif, a foundational repertoire that organizes melodic material central to performance and pedagogy.
  In this study, we introduce a digital corpus representing the complete non-metrical radif repertoire, covering all 13 existing components of this repertoire. We provide MIDI files (about 281 minutes in total) and data spreadsheets describing notes, note durations, intervals, and hierarchical structures for 228 pieces of music. We faithfully represent the tonality including quarter-tones, and the non-metric aspect. Furthermore, we provide supporting basic statistics, and measures of complexity and similarity over the corpus.
  Our corpus provides a platform for computational studies of Iranian classical music. Researchers might employ it in studying melodic patterns, investigating improvisational styles, or for other tasks in music information retrieval, music theory, and computational (ethno)musicology.</description>

      <title>SEF-MK: Speaker-Embedding-Free Voice Anonymization through Multi-k-means Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07086v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Voice anonymization protects speaker privacy by concealing identity while preserving linguistic and paralinguistic content. Self-supervised learning (SSL) representations encode linguistic features but preserve speaker traits. We propose a novel speaker-embedding-free framework called SEF-MK. Instead of using a single k-means model trained on the entire dataset, SEF-MK anonymizes SSL representations for each utterance by randomly selecting one of multiple k-means models, each trained on a different subset of speakers. We explore this approach from both attacker and user perspectives. Extensive experiments show that, compared to a single k-means model, SEF-MK with multiple k-means models better preserves linguistic and emotional content from the user's viewpoint. However, from the attacker's perspective, utilizing multiple k-means models boosts the effectiveness of privacy attacks. These insights can aid users in designing voice anonymization systems to mitigate attacker threats.</description>
