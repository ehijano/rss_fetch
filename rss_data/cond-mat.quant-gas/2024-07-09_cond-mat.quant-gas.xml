      <title>Interaction-induced topological phase transition at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of topological phase transitions in interacting, symmetry-protected quantum matter at finite temperatures. Using a combined numerical and analytical approach, we study a one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with added Hubbard interactions, where no thermodynamic phase transition occurs at finite temperatures. The transition is signalled by a quantized, non-local bulk topological order parameter. It is driven by defects, which are enabled by the combination of interaction and thermal activation, with no counterpart in the non-interacting limit. The defects localize topological zero modes, which, when sufficiently abundant, cause the order parameter to vanish. This phenomenon, interpreted via bulk-boundary correspondence, reflects the loss of a topological edge mode at a well-defined critical temperature in the thermodynamic limit. Unlike zero-temperature topological transitions, these finite-temperature transitions lack thermodynamic signatures but remain observable in controlled quantum systems, such as ultracold fermionic atoms in optical lattices.</description>

      <title>Three-Body Recombination of Ultracold Microwave-Shielded Polar Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A combined experimental and theoretical study is carried out on the three-body recombination process in a gas of microwave-shielded polar molecules. For ground-state polar molecules dressed with a strong microwave field, field-linked bound states can appear in the intermolecular potential. We model three-body recombination into such bound states using classical trajectory calculations. Our results show that recombination can explain the enhanced loss rates observed at small microwave detunings in trapped samples of bosonic NaCs [Bigagli, $\textit{et al.}$, Nat. Phys. $\textbf{19}$ 1579-1584 (2023)]. Specifically, our calculations reproduce the experimentally measured three-body loss rates across a wide range of microwave Rabi couplings, detunings, and temperatures. This work suggests that for bosonic shielded molecular systems in which the two-body loss is sufficiently suppressed and a field-linked bound state is present, the dominant loss process will be three-body recombination.</description>

      <title>Ground-state phase diagram of the SU($4$) Heisenberg model on a plaquette lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the ground state of the SU($4$) Heisenberg model on a square lattice with spatial anisotropy on each plaquette bond using the tensor-network method based on infinite projected entangled pair states. We find that the SU($4$) singlet ground state appears in the strongly anisotropic limit, whereas N\'eel and valence bond crystal orders coexist in the nearly isotropic limit. By examining the intermediate parameter region, we identify a phase transition between these phases. The nature of the phase transition is likely to be of first order, and the transition point is estimated to be around $J'/J\approx 0.85(5)$, where $J$ and $J'$ are the interaction strengths of intra- and inter-plaquette bonds, respectively. We also calculate the anisotropy dependence of singlet correlations on a plaquette bond, which will be useful for future experiments of ultracold atoms in optical lattices.</description>

      <title>Quantum rotor in a two-dimensional mesoscopic Bose gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a molecular quantum rotor in a two-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate. The focus is on studying the angulon quasiparticle concept in the crossover from few- to many-body physics. To this end, we formulate the problem in real space and solve it with a mean-field approach in the frame co-rotating with the impurity. We show that the system starts to feature angulon characteristics when the size of the bosonic cloud is large enough to screen the rotor. More importantly, we demonstrate the departure from the angulon picture for large system sizes or large angular momenta where the properties of the system are determined by collective excitations of the Bose gas.</description>

      <title>Dual approach to soft-core anyonic Lieb-Liniger fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The identity of quantum matter can be effectively altered by means of gauge fields. In two spatial dimensions this is illustrated by the Chern-Simons flux-attachment mechanism, but such a mechanism is not possible in lower dimensions. Here, we study a one-dimensional interacting Bose gas in the presence of a gauge field. This model can be explicitly mapped into an interacting anyonic system by a large gauge transformation, indicating a statistical transmutation analogous to that of Chern-Simons. The Bogoliubov spectrum in the weakly-interacting limit reveals the presence of a roton minimum arising from the statistical interaction. At a mean-field level chiral solitons are recovered. Should these be understood as quantum bound states, it is natural to interpret them as corresponding to localised anyonic quasiparticles. Hydrodynamic arguments highlight the presence of dispersive chiral shock waves in the propagation of a wavepacket due to a Riemann-Hopf nonlinearity. Numerical calculations show the presence of both chiral soliton trains and shock waves.</description>

      <title>Robust double Bragg diffraction via detuning control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new theoretical model and numerical optimization of double Bragg diffraction (DBD), a widely used technique in atom interferometry. We derive an effective two-level-system Hamiltonian based on the Magnus expansion in the so-called "quasi-Bragg regime", where most Bragg-pulse atom interferometers operate. Furthermore, we extend the theory to a five-level description to account for Doppler detuning. Using these derived effective Hamiltonians, we investigate the impacts of AC-Stark shift and polarization errors on the double Bragg beam-splitter, along with their mitigations through detuning control. Notably, we design a linear detuning sweep that demonstrates robust efficiency exceeding 99.5% against polarization errors up to 8.5%. Moreover, we develop an artificial intelligence-aided optimal detuning control protocol, showcasing enhanced robustness against both polarization errors and Doppler effects. This protocol achieves an average efficiency of 99.92% for samples with a finite momentum width of 0.05$\hbar k_L$ within an extended polarization error range of up to 10%.</description>

      <title>Cavity QED in a High NA Resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From fundamental studies of light-matter interaction to applications in quantum networking and sensing, cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) provides a platform-crossing toolbox to control interactions between atoms and photons. The coherence of such interactions is determined by the product of the single-pass atomic absorption and the number of photon round-trips. Reducing the cavity loss has enabled resonators supporting nearly 1-million optical roundtrips at the expense of severely limited optical material choices and increased alignment sensitivity. The single-pass absorption probability can be increased through the use of near-concentric, fiber or nanophotonic cavities, which reduce the mode waists at the expense of constrained optical access and exposure to surface fields. Here we present a new high numerical-aperture, lens-based resonator that pushes the single-atom-single-photon absorption probability per round trip close to its fundamental limit by reducing the mode size at the atom below a micron while keeping the atom mm-to-cm away from all optics. This resonator provides strong light-matter coupling in a cavity where the light circulates only ~ 10 times. We load a single 87Rb atom into such a cavity, observe strong coupling, demonstrate cavity-enhanced atom detection with imaging fidelity of 99.55(6) percent and survival probability of 99.89(4) percent in 130 microseconds, and leverage this new platform for a time-resolved exploration of cavity cooling. The resonator's loss-resilience paves the way to coupling of atoms to nonlinear and adaptive optical elements and provides a minimally invasive route to readout of defect centers. Introduction of intra-cavity imaging systems will enable the creation of cavity arrays compatible with Rydberg atom array computing technologies, vastly expanding the applicability of the cavity QED toolbox.</description>

      <title>Vector Atom Accelerometry in an Optical Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate two multidimensional atom interferometers capable of measuring both the magnitude and direction of applied inertial forces. These interferometers do not rely on the ubiquitous light-pulses of traditional atom sensors, but are instead built from an innovative design that operates entirely within the Bloch bands of an optical lattice formed by interfering laser beams. Through time-dependent control of the position of the lattice in three-dimensional space, we realize simultaneous Bloch oscillations in two dimensions, and a vector atomic Michelson interferometer. Fits to the observed Bloch oscillations demonstrate the measurement of an applied acceleration of $2g$ along two axes, where $g$ is the average gravitational acceleration at the Earth's surface. For the Michelson interferometer, we perform Bayesian inferencing from a 49-channel output by repeating experiments for selected examples of two-axis accelerations. We demonstrate the resulting accuracy and sensitivity for vector parameter estimation. Our acceleration can be measured from a single experimental run and does not require repeated shots to construct a fringe. We find the performance of our device to be near the quantum limit for the interferometer size and quantum detection efficiency of the atoms. We discuss the reconfigurability of the vector accelerometer and the pathway toward further sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetism in Heavy Fermion Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Novel collinear magnet, the altermagnet (AM) with spin-splitting energy band and zero net magnetization have attracted great interest due to its potential spintronic applications. Here, we demonstrate AM-like phases in a microscopic Kondo lattice model, widely used for heavy fermion compounds. With the framework of fermionic parton mean-field theory, we find the $d$-wave AM state can coexist with the intrinsic Kondo screening effect in such itinerant-local electron system if an alternating next-nearest-neighbor-hopping (NNNH) is included. Such alternating NNNH take nonmagnetic atoms, neglected in usual antiferromagnetism study, into account when encountering real-life candidate AM materials. The AM-like states are characterized by their spin-splitting quasiparticle bands, Fermi surface, spin-resolved distribution function and conductivity. It is suggested that the magnetic quantum oscillation and charge transport measurement can detect those AM-like phases. We hope the present work may be useful for exploring AM-like phases in $f$-electron compounds.</description>

      <title>Precise correspondence between the p-wave chiral superfluid and the spinless bosonic superfluid on the lowest Landau level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a precise formal correspondence between a spinless p-wave chiral fermionic superfluid and a spinless bosonic superfluid in a strong magnetic field by accounting for the correct superfluid vorticity in the effective theory of the former. In literature, the vorticity manifests itself incompletely as the magnetic field. This paper demonstrates this substitution can be understood as a truncation in the relevant expansion scheme, together with field redefinitions. Those discarded components are critical to restoring the Berry phase term in the effective theory, and the restoration incapsulates these two systems in the same master Lagrangian. In addition to clarifying the structure of the Berry phase, this formalism permits solving the bosonic system on the lowest Landau level (LLL) based on the method of analogue. In particular, we show that in the linear regime, the Maxwell equations governing these systems are identical by reformulating the vortex crystal with an auxiliary electromagnetic field. This approach offers a unified view for these systems and yields solutions that are rotationally covariant, gauge invariants, and physically interpretable.</description>

      <title>Leggett-Garg Inequality for Bosons in a Double-Well Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Leggett-Garg inequality (LGI) serves as a criterion to determine the adherence of macroscopic system dynamics to macrorealism, as postulated by Leggett and Garg. A violation of this inequality implies either the absence of a realistic description of the system or the impracticality of noninvasive measurements. In this work, we investigate the violation of the LGI for the system of bosons in a double-well potential. Specifically, we explore the violation of the LGI in the dynamics of bosons in a double-well potential in the Bose-Einstein-Condensation (BEC) regime, where the system can be considered as two weakly coupled Bose condensates, and in the single-particle regime to establish the conditions under which the violation of the LGI occurs. Our analysis reveals that the LGI is violated due to Josephson oscillations, while it remains unviolated in the strong coupling regime, attributed to the self-trapping phenomena. Notably, we observe that the violation of the LGI becomes increasingly significant as the particle number increases. These findings provide valuable insights into the macrorealistic behavior of Bose condensates and highlight the effect of measurements on the dynamics of a macroscopic system.</description>

      <title>Quantum Supercriticality in the Ising Model and Rydberg Atom Array</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supercriticality, featured with universal scaling behaviors, emerges as an intriguing phenomenon proximate to the classical liquid-gas critical point. In this study, we extend this significant concept to quantum many-body systems near the quantum critical point (QCP), employing tensor network calculations and scaling analyses of the Ising model and Rydberg atom array. The supercritical, fluid-like, quantum states are found to be strongly fluctuating and highly entangled, as characterized by the universal scalings in susceptibility $\chi_z \sim (h_x-h_x^c)^{-\gamma}$, correlation length $\xi \sim (h_x-h_x^c)^{-\nu}$, fidelity susceptibility $\chi_F \sim (h_x - h_x^c)^{d\nu - 2}$, and entanglement entropy $S_{\rm E} \sim \ln{(h_x - h_x^c)}$. Here, $\gamma$ and $\nu$ represent critical exponents, $d$ is the dimension of the system, and $h_x^c$ is the critical transverse field of the Ising QCP. The universal scaling behaviors are revealed in the regime enclosed by two quantum supercritical crossover lines in the longitudinal-transverse field ($h_z$-$h_x$) plane, $|h_z| \propto (h_x - h_x^c)^{\beta + \gamma}$ relating to critical exponents $\beta$ and $\gamma$, where the response functions, measures of entanglement, and fidelity susceptibility reach their maxima. We propose that Rydberg atom arrays and quantum Ising magnets provide available platforms for exploring emergent supercritical phenomena and identifying the universal scalings. The present work establishes a foundation for exploring quantum supercriticality in magnetic systems and through quantum simulations.</description>

      <title>Clustering of conditional mutual information and quantum Markov structure at arbitrary temperatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent investigations have unveiled exotic quantum phases that elude characterization by simple bipartite correlation functions. In these phases, long-range entanglement arising from tripartite correlations plays a central role. Consequently, the study of multipartite correlations has become a focal point in modern physics. In these, Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) is one of the most well-established information-theoretic measures, adept at encapsulating the essence of various exotic phases, including topologically ordered ones. Within the realm of quantum many-body physics, it has been a long-sought goal to establish a quantum analog to the Hammersley-Clifford theorem that bridges the two concepts of the Gibbs state and the Markov network. This theorem posits that the correlation length of CMI remains short-range across all thermal equilibrium quantum phases. In this work, we demonstrate that CMI exhibits exponential decay concerning distance, with its correlation length increasing polynomially with the inverse temperature. While this clustering theorem has previously been established for high temperatures devoid of thermal phase transitions, it has remained elusive at low temperatures, where genuine long-range entanglement is corroborated to exist by the quantum topological order. Our findings unveil that, even at low temperatures, a broad class of tripartite entanglement cannot manifest in the long-range regime. To achieve the proof, we establish a comprehensive formalism for analyzing the locality of effective Hamiltonians on subsystems, commonly known as the `entanglement Hamiltonian' or `Hamiltonian of mean force.' As one outcome of our analyses, we enhance the prior clustering theorem concerning bipartite entanglement. In essence, this means that we investigate genuine bipartite entanglement that extends beyond the limitations of the Positive Partial Transpose (PPT) class.</description>

      <title>Persistent coherent many-body oscillations in a non-integrable quantum Ising chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We identify persistent oscillations in a nonintegrable quantum Ising chain left behind by a rapid transition into a ferromagnetic phase. In the integrable chain with nearest-neighbor (NN) interactions, the nature, origin, and decay of post-transition oscillations are tied to the Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM). However, when coupling to the next nearest neighbor (NNN) is added, the resulting nonintegrable Ising chain (still in the quantum Ising chain universality class) supports persistent post-transition oscillation: KZM-like oscillations turn into persistent oscillations of transverse magnetization. Their longevity in our simulations is likely limited only by the numerical accuracy. Their period differs from the decaying KZM oscillation but their amplitude depends on quench rate. Moreover, they can be excited by driving in resonance with the excitations' energy gap. Thus, while one might have expected that the integrability-breaking NNN coupling would facilitate relaxation, the oscillations we identify are persistent. At low to medium transverse fields, they are associated with Cooper pairs of Bogoliubov quasiparticles -- kinks. This oscillation of the pair condensate is a manifestation of quantum coherence.</description>

      <title>Quantum control of ion-atom collisions beyond the ultracold regime</title>

Abstract: Control of microscopic physical systems is a prerequisite for experimental quantum science and its applications. Neutral atomic and molecular systems can be controlled using tunable scattering resonances. However, the resonant control of effective interactions has so far been limited to the ultracold regime, where quantum effects become manifest. Ultracold temperatures are still out of reach for most hybrid trapped ion-atom systems, a prospective platform for quantum technologies and fundamental research. Here we show that magnetically tunable Feshbach resonances can be used to control inelastic collisions between a single trapped Sr${}^+$ ion and Rb atoms high above the ultracold regime. We measure inelastic collision probabilities and use the results to calibrate a comprehensive theoretical model of ion-atom collisions. The observed collision dynamics show signatures of quantum interference, resulting in the pronounced state and mass dependence of the collision rates in the multiple-partial-wave regime. With our model, we discover multiple measurable Feshbach resonances for magnetic fields from 0 to 400 G, which allow significant enhancement of spin-exchange rates at temperatures as high as 1 mK. Future observation of the predicted resonances should allow precise calibration and control of the short-range dynamics in the ${\text{Sr}^++\text{Rb}}$ collisions under unprecedentedly warm conditions.</description>

      <title>Colloquium: Synthetic quantum matter in non-standard geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulation is making a significant impact on scientific research. The prevailing tendency of the field is to build quantum simulators that get closer to real-world systems of interest, in particular electronic materials. However, progress in the microscopic design also provides an opportunity for an orthogonal research direction: building quantum many-body systems beyond real-world limitations. This colloquium takes this perspective: Concentrating on synthetic quantum matter in non-standard lattice geometries, such as fractal lattices or quasicrystals, higher-dimensional or curved spaces, it aims at providing a fresh introduction to the field of quantum simulation aligned with recent trends across various quantum simulation platforms, including atomic, photonic, and electronic devices. We also shine light on the novel phenomena which arise from these geometries: Condensed matter physicists may appreciate the variety of different localization properties as well as novel topological phases which are offered by such exotic quantum simulators. But also in the search of quantum models for gravity and cosmology, quantum simulators of curved spaces can provide a useful experimental tool.</description>

Abstract: We study the stability and characteristics of two-dimensional (2D) quasi-isotropic quantum droplets (QDs) of fundamental and vortex types, formed by binary Bose-Einstein condensate with magnetic quadrupole-quadrupole interactions (MQQIs). The magnetic quadrupoles are built as pairs of dipoles and antidipoles polarized along the x-axis. The MQQIs are induced by applying an external magnetic field that varies along the x-axis. The system is modeled by the Gross-Pitaevskii equations including the MQQIs and Lee-Huang-Yang correction to the mean-field approximation. Stable 2D fundamental QDs and quasi-isotropic vortex QDs with topological charges S&lt;4 are produced by means of the imaginary-time-integration method for configurations with the quadrupoles polarized parallel to the systems two-dimensional plane. Effects of the norm and MQQI strength on the QDs are studied in detail. Some results, including an accurate prediction of the effective area, chemical potential, and peak density of QDs, are obtained in an analytical form by means of the Thomas-Fermi approximation. Collisions between moving QDs are studied by means of systematic simulations.</description>

      <title>Path-integral treatment of charged Bose polarons</title>

Abstract: The system of a charged impurity in an interacting Bose gas has gained significant attention due to the long-range ion-atom interactions and the study of transport properties. Here, the ground state energy of a charged Bose polaron is calculated within the Bogoliubov approximation for both the Fr\"ohlich and beyond-Fr\"ohlich Hamiltonians using a generalized Feynman variational path-integral approach, which obtained accurate results for other polaron problems. The generalized approach, which was used to improve the energy result for the neutral polaron, has resulted in a minor improvement, indicating that Feynman's approach is sufficient when the impurity-boson interaction is long-range. Beyond-Fr\"ohlich corrections results in the emergence of a divergence in the polaronic energy indicating a transition between the repulsive and attractive polaron regime. The path-integral approach with the beyond-Fr\"ohlich Hamiltonian is also compared to a field-theory calculation from Christensen et al, 2021. The validity of the Bogoliubov approximation is investigated. The optical absorption has also been calculated within the Bogoliubov approximation for weak ion-atom interactions, and the effect of finite temperature has been studied. We show that the coupling of the ion to an oscillating external electric field offers a straigtforward experimental probe for the charged polaron in a Bose gas, different from but complementary to existing spectroscopic techniques.</description>

      <title>Dynamical control in a prethermalized molecular ultracold plasma: Local dissipation drives global relaxation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Prethermalization occurs as an important phase in the dynamics of many-body systems when strong coupling drives a quasi-equilibrium in a subspace separated from the thermodynamic equilibrium by the restriction of a gap in energy or other conserved quantity. Here, we report the signature of an enduring prethermal regime of arrested relaxation in the molecular ultracold plasma that forms following the avalanche of a state-selected Rydberg gas of nitric oxide. Electron collisions mix orbital angular momentum, scattering Rydberg molecules to states of very high-$\ell$. Spontaneous predissociation purifies this non-penetrating character, creating an extraordinary gap between the plasma states of $n \approx \ell$, with measured $n&gt;200$ and penetrating states of $\ell = 0, ~1$ and 2. Evolution to a statistically equilibrated state of N and O atoms cannot occur without Rydberg electron penetration, and this gap blocks relaxation for a millisecond or more. Evolving through the critical phase, electrons that balance the NO$^+$ charge behave as though localized in the prethermal phase and play an ineffective role in bridging this gap. However, the application of a weak radiofrequency (RF) field promotes a dramatic degree of relaxation owing to electron collisions. On an entirely different scale, exciting a quantum-state transition in an exceedingly small fraction of the molecules in the prethermalized ensemble acts with even greater effect to drive the entire system toward equilibrium. We ascribe this to dissipative character added to a small fraction of the states in the prethermally localized ensemble. Using the Lindblad master equation, we illustrate qualitatively similar dynamics for a toy model of an open quantum system that consists of a localized set of spins on which dissipation acts locally at a single site.</description>

      <title>Polarons in supersolids: path-integral treatment of an impurity in a one-dimensional dipolar supersolid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03505v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The supersolid phase of a dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate has an intriguing excitation spectrum displaying a band structure. Here, the dressing of an impurity in a one-dimensional dipolar supersolid with the excitations of the supersolid is studied. The ground-state energy of the supersolid polaron is calculated using a variational path integral approach, which obtained accurate results for other polaron systems within the Bogoliubov and Fr\"ohlich approximations. A divergence is observed at the superfluid-supersolid phase transition. The polaron radius is also computed, showing that for strong impurity-atom interactions, the polaron can become localized to a single droplet, behaving like a small solid-state polaron.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In classical inviscid fluids, parallel vortices perturbed by Kelvin waves may exhibit the Crow instability, where the mutual interaction of the Kelvin modes renders them dynamically unstable. This results in the mutual approach and reconnection of the vortices, leading to a cascaded decay into smaller and smaller vortex loops. We study the Crow instability of quantum vortex lines in a superfluid enjoying the anisotropic, long-ranged dipole-dipole interaction through mean-field simulations of the dynamics of the superfluid order parameter. We observe that both the strength and direction of the dipole-dipole interaction play a crucial role in determining the Kelvin modes that are dynamically favoured. This is shown to be linked to effective enhancements or suppressions of the vortices' curvature and can be explained by the effective dipole-dipole interaction between the vortex lines themselves. This paves the way to a deeper understanding of vortex reconnection dynamics, vortex loop cascading and turbulence in dipolar superfluids.</description>

      <title>Dissipative Dicke time crystals: an atoms' point of view</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00046v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop and study an atom-only description of the Dicke model with time-periodic couplings between atoms and a dissipative cavity mode. The cavity mode is eliminated giving rise to effective atom-atom interactions and dissipation. We use this effective description to analyze the dynamics of the atoms that undergo a transition to a dynamical superradiant phase with macroscopic coherences in the atomic medium and the light field. Using Floquet theory in combination with the atom-only description we provide a precise determination of the phase boundaries and of the dynamical response of the atoms. From this we can predict the existence of dissipative time crystals that show a subharmonic response with respect to the driving frequency. We show that the atom-only theory can describe the relaxation into such a dissipative time crystal and that the damping rate can be understood in terms of a cooling mechanism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14546v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compare two quantum Hamiltonian algorithms that address the maximum independent set problem: one based on emergent non-abelian gauge matrix in adiabatic evolution of an energetically isolated manifold of states; and one based on designed application of single-qubit operations. We demonstrate that they are mathematically equivalent, though at first sight they appear quite different. Despite their mathematical equivalence, their most straightforward physical implementations are different. Our numerical simulations show significant differences in performance, and suggest improved experimental protocols.Intriguingly, this equivalence unveils a deeper connection. We also demonstrate that the PXP model, recently prominent in quantum dynamics research, arises as the non-abelian gauge matrix governing quantum diffusion over the median graph of all independent sets.</description>

      <title>Rationally independent free fermions with local hopping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rationally independent free fermions are those where sums of single-particle energies multiplied by arbitrary rational coefficients vanish only if the coefficients are all zero. This property guaranties that they have no degeneracies in the many-body spectrum and gives them relaxation properties more similar to those of generic systems. Using classic results from number theory we provide minimal examples of rationally independent free fermion models for every system size in one dimension. This is accomplished by considering a free fermion model with a chemical potential, and hopping terms corresponding to all the divisors of the number of sites, each one with an incommensurate complex amplitude. We further discuss the many-body spectral statistics for these models and show that local probes -- like the ratio of consecutive level spacings -- look very similar to what is expected for the Poisson statistics. We however demonstrate that free fermion models can never have Poisson statistics with an analysis of the moments of the spectral form factor.</description>
