      <title>Comparing Rationality Between Large Language Models and Humans: Insights and Open Questions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper delves into the dynamic landscape of artificial intelligence, specifically focusing on the burgeoning prominence of large language models (LLMs). We underscore the pivotal role of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in augmenting LLMs' rationality and decision-making prowess. By meticulously examining the intricate relationship between human interaction and LLM behavior, we explore questions surrounding rationality and performance disparities between humans and LLMs, with particular attention to the Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer. Our research employs comprehensive comparative analysis and delves into the inherent challenges of irrationality in LLMs, offering valuable insights and actionable strategies for enhancing their rationality. These findings hold significant implications for the widespread adoption of LLMs across diverse domains and applications, underscoring their potential to catalyze advancements in artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>A Tale of Two Communities: Exploring Academic References on Stack Overflow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stack Overflow is widely recognized by software practitioners as the go-to resource for addressing technical issues and sharing practical solutions. While it is not typically seen as a forum for scholarly discourse, users on Stack Overflow often refer to academic sources in their discussions. Yet, little is known about these referenced works from the academic community and how they intersect the needs and interests of the Stack Overflow community. To bridge this gap, we conducted a large-scale study on academic references in Stack Overflow. Our findings reveal that Stack Overflow communities with different domains of interest engage with academic literature at varying frequencies and speeds. The contradicting patterns suggest that some disciplines may have diverged in their interests and development trajectories from the corresponding practitioner community. Finally, we discuss the potential of Stack Overflow in gauging the real-world relevance of academic research.</description>

      <title>Designing Sousveillance Tools for Gig Workers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As independently-contracted employees, gig workers disproportionately suffer the consequences of workplace surveillance, which include increased pressures to work, breaches of privacy, and decreased digital autonomy. Despite the negative impacts of workplace surveillance, gig workers lack the tools, strategies, and workplace social support to protect themselves against these harms. Meanwhile, some critical theorists have proposed sousveillance as a potential means of countering such abuses of power, whereby those under surveillance monitor those in positions of authority (e.g., gig workers collect data about requesters/platforms). To understand the benefits of sousveillance systems in the gig economy, we conducted semi-structured interviews and led co-design activities with gig workers. We use "care ethics" as a guiding concept to understand our interview and co-design data, while also focusing on empathic sousveillance technology design recommendations. Through our study, we identify gig workers' attitudes towards and past experiences with sousveillance. We also uncover the type of sousveillance technologies imagined by workers, provide design recommendations, and finish by discussing how to create empowering, empathic spaces on gig platforms.</description>

      <title>Graph Enhanced Reinforcement Learning for Effective Group Formation in Collaborative Problem Solving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study addresses the challenge of forming effective groups in collaborative problem-solving environments. Recognizing the complexity of human interactions and the necessity for efficient collaboration, we propose a novel approach leveraging graph theory and reinforcement learning. Our methodology involves constructing a graph from a dataset where nodes represent participants, and edges signify the interactions between them. We conceptualize each participant as an agent within a reinforcement learning framework, aiming to learn an optimal graph structure that reflects effective group dynamics. Clustering techniques are employed to delineate clear group structures based on the learned graph. Our approach provides theoretical solutions based on evaluation metrics and graph measurements, offering insights into potential improvements in group effectiveness and reductions in conflict incidences. This research contributes to the fields of collaborative work and educational psychology by presenting a data-driven, analytical approach to group formation. It has practical implications for organizational team building, classroom settings, and any collaborative scenario where group dynamics are crucial. The study opens new avenues for exploring the application of graph theory and reinforcement learning in social and behavioral sciences, highlighting the potential for empirical validation in future work.</description>

      <title>Emotion-Aware Multimodal Fusion for Meme Emotion Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ever-evolving social media discourse has witnessed an overwhelming use of memes to express opinions or dissent. Besides being misused for spreading malcontent, they are mined by corporations and political parties to glean the public's opinion. Therefore, memes predominantly offer affect-enriched insights towards ascertaining the societal psyche. However, the current approaches are yet to model the affective dimensions expressed in memes effectively. They rely extensively on large multimodal datasets for pre-training and do not generalize well due to constrained visual-linguistic grounding. In this paper, we introduce MOOD (Meme emOtiOns Dataset), which embodies six basic emotions. We then present ALFRED (emotion-Aware muLtimodal Fusion foR Emotion Detection), a novel multimodal neural framework that (i) explicitly models emotion-enriched visual cues, and (ii) employs an efficient cross-modal fusion via a gating mechanism. Our investigation establishes ALFRED's superiority over existing baselines by 4.94% F1. Additionally, ALFRED competes strongly with previous best approaches on the challenging Memotion task. We then discuss ALFRED's domain-agnostic generalizability by demonstrating its dominance on two recently-released datasets - HarMeme and Dank Memes, over other baselines. Further, we analyze ALFRED's interpretability using attention maps. Finally, we highlight the inherent challenges posed by the complex interplay of disparate modality-specific cues toward meme analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stress is a dynamic process that reflects the responses of the brain. Traditional methods for measuring stress are often time-consuming and susceptible to recall bias. To address this, we investigated changes in heart rate (HR) during the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST). Our study incorporated varying levels of complexity in mental arithmetic problems. Participants' HR increased during the Mental Arithmetic Task phase compared to baseline and resting stages, indicating that stress is reflected in HR.</description>

      <title>AI-enhanced Collective Intelligence: The State of the Art and Prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current societal challenges exceed the capacity of human individual or collective effort alone. As AI evolves, its role within human collectives is poised to vary from an assistive tool to a participatory member. Humans and AI possess complementary capabilities that, when synergized, can achieve a level of collective intelligence that surpasses the collective capabilities of either humans or AI in isolation. However, the interactions in human-AI systems are inherently complex, involving intricate processes and interdependencies. This review incorporates perspectives from network science to conceptualize a multilayer representation of human-AI collective intelligence, comprising a cognition layer, a physical layer, and an information layer. Within this multilayer network, humans and AI agents exhibit varying characteristics; humans differ in diversity from surface-level to deep-level attributes, while AI agents range in degrees of functionality and anthropomorphism. The interplay among these agents shapes the overall structure and dynamics of the system. We explore how agents' diversity and interactions influence the system's collective intelligence. Furthermore, we present an analysis of real-world instances of AI-enhanced collective intelligence. We conclude by addressing the potential challenges in AI-enhanced collective intelligence and offer perspectives on future developments in this field.</description>

      <title>Safety Cases: Justifying the Safety of Advanced AI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As AI systems become more advanced, companies and regulators will make difficult decisions about whether it is safe to train and deploy them. To prepare for these decisions, we investigate how developers could make a 'safety case,' which is a structured rationale that AI systems are unlikely to cause a catastrophe. We propose a framework for organizing a safety case and discuss four categories of arguments to justify safety: total inability to cause a catastrophe, sufficiently strong control measures, trustworthiness despite capability to cause harm, and deference to credible AI advisors. We evaluate concrete examples of arguments in each category and outline how arguments could be combined to justify that AI systems are safe to deploy.</description>

      <title>Moodle Usability Assessment Methodology using the Universal Design for Learning perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The application of the Universal Design for Learning framework favors the creation of virtual educational environments for all. It requires developing accessible content, having a usable platform, and the use of flexible didactics and evaluations that promote constant student motivation. The present study aims to design a methodology to evaluate the usability of the Moodle platform based on the principles of Universal Design for Learning, recognizing the importance of accessibility, usability and the availability of Assistive Technologies. We developed and applied a methodology to assess the usability level of Moodle platforms, taking into consideration that they integrate Assistive Technologies or are used for MOOC contexts. We provide the results of a use case that assesses two instances for the respective Moodle v.2.x and v.3.x family versions. We employed the framework of mixed design research in order to assess a MOOC-type educational program devised under the principles of Universal Design for Learning. As a result of the assessment of Moodle v.2.x and v.3.x, we conclude that the platforms must improve some key elements (e.g. contrasting colors, incorporation of alternative text and links) in order to comply with international accessibility standards. With respect to usability, we can confirm that the principles and guidelines of Universal Design for Learning are applicable to MOOC-type Virtual Learning Environments, are positively valued by students, and have a positive impact on certification rates.</description>

      <title>Navigating the Peril of Generated Alternative Facts: A ChatGPT-4 Fabricated Omega Variant Case as a Cautionary Tale in Medical Misinformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In an era where artificial intelligence (AI) intertwines with medical research, the delineation of truth becomes increasingly complex. This study ostensibly examines a purported novel SARS-CoV-2 variant, dubbed the Omega variant, showcasing 31 unique mutations in the S gene region. However, the real undercurrent of this narrative is a demonstration of the ease with which AI, specifically ChatGPT-4, can fabricate convincing yet entirely fictional scientific data. The so-called Omega variant was identified in a fully vaccinated, previously infected 35-year-old male presenting with severe COVID-19 symptoms. Through a detailed, albeit artificial, genomic analysis and contact tracing, this study mirrors the rigorous methodology of genuine case reports, thereby setting the stage for a compelling but entirely constructed narrative. The entire case study was generated by ChatGPT-4, a large language model by OpenAI. The fabricated Omega variant features an ensemble of mutations, including N501Y and E484K, known for enhancing ACE2 receptor affinity, alongside L452R and P681H, ostensibly indicative of immune evasion. This variant's contrived interaction dynamics - severe symptoms in a vaccinated individual versus mild ones in unvaccinated contacts - were designed to mimic real-world complexities, including suggestions of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). While the Omega variant is a product of AI-generated fiction, the implications of this exercise are real and profound. The ease with which AI can generate believable but false scientific information, as illustrated in this case, raises significant concerns about the potential for misinformation in medicine. This study, therefore, serves as a cautionary tale, emphasizing the necessity for critical evaluation of sources, especially in an age where AI tools like ChatGPT are becoming increasingly sophisticated and widespread in their use.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Depression-Diagnosis-Oriented Chat with Psychological State Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Depression-diagnosis-oriented chat aims to guide patients in self-expression to collect key symptoms for depression detection. Recent work focuses on combining task-oriented dialogue and chitchat to simulate the interview-based depression diagnosis. Whereas, these methods can not well capture the changing information, feelings, or symptoms of the patient during dialogues. Moreover, no explicit framework has been explored to guide the dialogue, which results in some useless communications that affect the experience. In this paper, we propose to integrate Psychological State Tracking (POST) within the large language model (LLM) to explicitly guide depression-diagnosis-oriented chat. Specifically, the state is adapted from a psychological theoretical model, which consists of four components, namely Stage, Information, Summary and Next. We fine-tune an LLM model to generate the dynamic psychological state, which is further used to assist response generation at each turn to simulate the psychiatrist. Experimental results on the existing benchmark show that our proposed method boosts the performance of all subtasks in depression-diagnosis-oriented chat.</description>

      <title>ClaimVer: Explainable Claim-Level Verification and Evidence Attribution of Text Through Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the midst of widespread misinformation and disinformation through social media and the proliferation of AI-generated texts, it has become increasingly difficult for people to validate and trust information they encounter. Many fact-checking approaches and tools have been developed, but they often lack appropriate explainability or granularity to be useful in various contexts. A text validation method that is easy to use, accessible, and can perform fine-grained evidence attribution has become crucial. More importantly, building user trust in such a method requires presenting the rationale behind each prediction, as research shows this significantly influences people's belief in automated systems. It is also paramount to localize and bring users' attention to the specific problematic content, instead of providing simple blanket labels. In this paper, we present $\textit{ClaimVer, a human-centric framework}$ tailored to meet users' informational and verification needs by generating rich annotations and thereby reducing cognitive load. Designed to deliver comprehensive evaluations of texts, it highlights each claim, verifies it against a trusted knowledge graph (KG), presents the evidence, and provides succinct, clear explanations for each claim prediction. Finally, our framework introduces an attribution score, enhancing applicability across a wide range of downstream tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the application of large language models, specifically GPT-4, to enhance programming education. The research outlines the design of a web application that uses GPT-4 to provide feedback on programming tasks, without giving away the solution. A web application for working on programming tasks was developed for the study and evaluated with 51 students over the course of one semester. The results show that most of the feedback generated by GPT-4 effectively addressed code errors. However, challenges with incorrect suggestions and hallucinated issues indicate the need for further improvements.</description>

      <title>Predicting Generalization of AI Colonoscopy Models to Unseen Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background and aims Generalizability of AI colonoscopy algorithms is important for wider adoption in clinical practice. However, current techniques for evaluating performance on unseen data require expensive and time-intensive labels.
  Methods We use a "Masked Siamese Network" (MSN) to identify novel phenomena in unseen data and predict polyp detector performance. MSN is trained to predict masked out regions of polyp images, without any labels. We test MSN's ability to be trained on data only from Israel and detect unseen techniques, narrow-band imaging (NBI) and chromendoscoy (CE), on colonoscopes from Japan (354 videos, 128 hours). We also test MSN's ability to predict performance of Computer Aided Detection (CADe) of polyps on colonoscopies from both countries, even though MSN is not trained on data from Japan.
  Results MSN correctly identifies NBI and CE as less similar to Israel whitelight than Japan whitelight (bootstrapped z-test, |z| &gt; 496, p &lt; 10-8 for both) using the label-free Frechet distance. MSN detects NBI with 99% accuracy, predicts CE better than our heuristic (90% vs 79% accuracy) despite being trained only on whitelight, and is the only method that is robust to noisy labels. MSN predicts CADe polyp detector performance on in-domain Israel and out-of-domain Japan colonoscopies (r=0.79, 0.37 respectively). With few examples of Japan detector performance to train on, MSN prediction of Japan performance improves (r=0.56).
  Conclusion Our technique can identify distribution shifts in clinical data and can predict CADe detector performance on unseen data, without labels. Our self-supervised approach can aid in detecting when data in practice is different from training, such as between hospitals or data has meaningfully shifted from training. MSN has potential for application to medical image domains beyond colonoscopy.</description>

      <title>Explainability through uncertainty: Trustworthy decision-making with neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uncertainty is a key feature of any machine learning model and is particularly important in neural networks, which tend to be overconfident. This overconfidence is worrying under distribution shifts, where the model performance silently degrades as the data distribution diverges from the training data distribution. Uncertainty estimation offers a solution to overconfident models, communicating when the output should (not) be trusted. Although methods for uncertainty estimation have been developed, they have not been explicitly linked to the field of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). Furthermore, literature in operations research ignores the actionability component of uncertainty estimation and does not consider distribution shifts. This work proposes a general uncertainty framework, with contributions being threefold: (i) uncertainty estimation in ML models is positioned as an XAI technique, giving local and model-specific explanations; (ii) classification with rejection is used to reduce misclassifications by bringing a human expert in the loop for uncertain observations; (iii) the framework is applied to a case study on neural networks in educational data mining subject to distribution shifts. Uncertainty as XAI improves the model's trustworthiness in downstream decision-making tasks, giving rise to more actionable and robust machine learning systems in operations research.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In today's interconnected world of widespread mobility, ubiquitous social interaction, and rapid information dissemination, the demand for individuals to swiftly adapt their behaviors has increased dramatically. Timely decision-making faces new challenges due to the necessity of using finely temporal-resolved anonymised individual data to keep up with fast-paced behavioural changes. To tackle this issue, we propose a general framework that leverages privacy-enhanced GPS data from mobile devices alongside census information to infer the employment status of individuals over time. By analysing the mobility patterns of employed and unemployed individuals, we unveil significant differences in behaviours between the two groups, showing a contraction in visited locations and a general decline in the exploratory behaviour of unemployed individuals. Remarkably, these differences intensify over time since job loss, particularly affecting individuals from more vulnerable demographic groups. These findings highlight the importance of early monitoring of unemployed individuals who may face enduring levels of distress. Overall, our findings shed light on the dynamics of employment-related behaviour, emphasizing the importance of implementing timely interventions to support the unemployed and vulnerable populations.</description>

      <title>Scalable Algorithms for Individual Preference Stable Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the individual preference (IP) stability, which is an notion capturing individual fairness and stability in clustering. Within this setting, a clustering is $\alpha$-IP stable when each data point's average distance to its cluster is no more than $\alpha$ times its average distance to any other cluster. In this paper, we study the natural local search algorithm for IP stable clustering. Our analysis confirms a $O(\log n)$-IP stability guarantee for this algorithm, where $n$ denotes the number of points in the input. Furthermore, by refining the local search approach, we show it runs in an almost linear time, $\tilde{O}(nk)$.</description>

      <title>SocialGenPod: Privacy-Friendly Generative AI Social Web Applications with Decentralised Personal Data Stores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present SocialGenPod, a decentralised and privacy-friendly way of deploying generative AI Web applications. Unlike centralised Web and data architectures that keep user data tied to application and service providers, we show how one can use Solid -- a decentralised Web specification -- to decouple user data from generative AI applications. We demonstrate SocialGenPod using a prototype that allows users to converse with different Large Language Models, optionally leveraging Retrieval Augmented Generation to generate answers grounded in private documents stored in any Solid Pod that the user is allowed to access, directly or indirectly. SocialGenPod makes use of Solid access control mechanisms to give users full control of determining who has access to data stored in their Pods. SocialGenPod keeps all user data (chat history, app configuration, personal documents, etc) securely in the user's personal Pod; separate from specific model or application providers. Besides better privacy controls, this approach also enables portability across different services and applications. Finally, we discuss challenges, posed by the large compute requirements of state-of-the-art models, that future research in this area should address. Our prototype is open-source and available at: https://github.com/Vidminas/socialgenpod/.</description>

      <title>Data Ethics Emergency Drill: A Toolbox for Discussing Responsible AI for Industry Teams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Researchers urge technology practitioners such as data scientists to consider the impacts and ethical implications of algorithmic decisions. However, unlike programming, statistics, and data management, discussion of ethical implications is rarely included in standard data science training. To begin to address this gap, we designed and tested a toolbox called the data ethics emergency drill (DEED) to help data science teams discuss and reflect on the ethical implications of their work. The DEED is a roleplay of a fictional ethical emergency scenario that is contextually situated in the team's specific workplace and applications. This paper outlines the DEED toolbox and describes three studies carried out with two different data science teams that iteratively shaped its design. Our findings show that practitioners can apply lessons learnt from the roleplay to real-life situations, and how the DEED opened up conversations around ethics and values.</description>

      <title>ChatGPT as a mapping assistant: A novel method to enrich maps with generative AI and content derived from street-level photographs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores the concept of leveraging generative AI as a mapping assistant for enhancing the efficiency of collaborative mapping. We present results of an experiment that combines multiple sources of volunteered geographic information (VGI) and large language models (LLMs). Three analysts described the content of crowdsourced Mapillary street-level photographs taken along roads in a small test area in Miami, Florida. GPT-3.5-turbo was instructed to suggest the most appropriate tagging for each road in OpenStreetMap (OSM). The study also explores the utilization of BLIP-2, a state-of-the-art multimodal pre-training method as an artificial analyst of street-level photographs in addition to human analysts. Results demonstrate two ways to effectively increase the accuracy of mapping suggestions without modifying the underlying AI models: by (1) providing a more detailed description of source photographs, and (2) combining prompt engineering with additional context (e.g. location and objects detected along a road). The first approach increases the suggestion accuracy by up to 29%, and the second one by up to 20%.</description>

      <title>Generative AI in EU Law: Liability, Privacy, Intellectual Property, and Cybersecurity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07348v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advent of Generative AI, particularly through Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and its successors, marks a paradigm shift in the AI landscape. Advanced LLMs exhibit multimodality, handling diverse data formats, thereby broadening their application scope. However, the complexity and emergent autonomy of these models introduce challenges in predictability and legal compliance. This paper delves into the legal and regulatory implications of Generative AI and LLMs in the European Union context, analyzing aspects of liability, privacy, intellectual property, and cybersecurity. It critically examines the adequacy of the existing and proposed EU legislation, including the Artificial Intelligence Act (AIA) draft, in addressing the unique challenges posed by Generative AI in general and LLMs in particular. The paper identifies potential gaps and shortcomings in the legislative framework and proposes recommendations to ensure the safe and compliant deployment of generative models, ensuring they align with the EU's evolving digital landscape and legal standards.</description>

      <title>MAGPIE: Multi-Task Media-Bias Analysis Generalization for Pre-Trained Identification of Expressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07910v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Media bias detection poses a complex, multifaceted problem traditionally tackled using single-task models and small in-domain datasets, consequently lacking generalizability. To address this, we introduce MAGPIE, the first large-scale multi-task pre-training approach explicitly tailored for media bias detection. To enable pre-training at scale, we present Large Bias Mixture (LBM), a compilation of 59 bias-related tasks. MAGPIE outperforms previous approaches in media bias detection on the Bias Annotation By Experts (BABE) dataset, with a relative improvement of 3.3% F1-score. MAGPIE also performs better than previous models on 5 out of 8 tasks in the Media Bias Identification Benchmark (MBIB). Using a RoBERTa encoder, MAGPIE needs only 15% of finetuning steps compared to single-task approaches. Our evaluation shows, for instance, that tasks like sentiment and emotionality boost all learning, all tasks enhance fake news detection, and scaling tasks leads to the best results. MAGPIE confirms that MTL is a promising approach for addressing media bias detection, enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of existing models. Furthermore, LBM is the first available resource collection focused on media bias MTL.</description>

      <title>Standing on FURM ground -- A framework for evaluating Fair, Useful, and Reliable AI Models in healthcare systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07911v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The impact of using artificial intelligence (AI) to guide patient care or operational processes is an interplay of the AI model's output, the decision-making protocol based on that output, and the capacity of the stakeholders involved to take the necessary subsequent action. Estimating the effects of this interplay before deployment, and studying it in real time afterwards, are essential to bridge the chasm between AI model development and achievable benefit. To accomplish this, the Data Science team at Stanford Health Care has developed a Testing and Evaluation (T&amp;E) mechanism to identify fair, useful and reliable AI models (FURM) by conducting an ethical review to identify potential value mismatches, simulations to estimate usefulness, financial projections to assess sustainability, as well as analyses to determine IT feasibility, design a deployment strategy, and recommend a prospective monitoring and evaluation plan. We report on FURM assessments done to evaluate six AI guided solutions for potential adoption, spanning clinical and operational settings, each with the potential to impact from several dozen to tens of thousands of patients each year. We describe the assessment process, summarize the six assessments, and share our framework to enable others to conduct similar assessments. Of the six solutions we assessed, two have moved into a planning and implementation phase. Our novel contributions - usefulness estimates by simulation, financial projections to quantify sustainability, and a process to do ethical assessments - as well as their underlying methods and open source tools, are available for other healthcare systems to conduct actionable evaluations of candidate AI solutions.</description>

      <title>Unprocessing Seven Years of Algorithmic Fairness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07261v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Seven years ago, researchers proposed a postprocessing method to equalize the error rates of a model across different demographic groups. The work launched hundreds of papers purporting to improve over the postprocessing baseline. We empirically evaluate these claims through thousands of model evaluations on several tabular datasets. We find that the fairness-accuracy Pareto frontier achieved by postprocessing contains all other methods we were feasibly able to evaluate. In doing so, we address two common methodological errors that have confounded previous observations. One relates to the comparison of methods with different unconstrained base models. The other concerns methods achieving different levels of constraint relaxation. At the heart of our study is a simple idea we call unprocessing that roughly corresponds to the inverse of postprocessing. Unprocessing allows for a direct comparison of methods using different underlying models and levels of relaxation.</description>

      <title>Finetuning Text-to-Image Diffusion Models for Fairness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07604v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid adoption of text-to-image diffusion models in society underscores an urgent need to address their biases. Without interventions, these biases could propagate a skewed worldview and restrict opportunities for minority groups. In this work, we frame fairness as a distributional alignment problem. Our solution consists of two main technical contributions: (1) a distributional alignment loss that steers specific characteristics of the generated images towards a user-defined target distribution, and (2) adjusted direct finetuning of diffusion model's sampling process (adjusted DFT), which leverages an adjusted gradient to directly optimize losses defined on the generated images. Empirically, our method markedly reduces gender, racial, and their intersectional biases for occupational prompts. Gender bias is significantly reduced even when finetuning just five soft tokens. Crucially, our method supports diverse perspectives of fairness beyond absolute equality, which is demonstrated by controlling age to a $75\%$ young and $25\%$ old distribution while simultaneously debiasing gender and race. Finally, our method is scalable: it can debias multiple concepts at once by simply including these prompts in the finetuning data. We share code and various fair diffusion model adaptors at https://sail-sg.github.io/finetune-fair-diffusion/.</description>

      <title>Detection and Discovery of Misinformation Sources using Attributed Webgraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02379v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Website reliability labels underpin almost all research in misinformation detection. However, misinformation sources often exhibit transient behavior, which makes many such labeled lists obsolete over time. We demonstrate that Search Engine Optimization (SEO) attributes provide strong signals for predicting news site reliability. We introduce a novel attributed webgraph dataset with labeled news domains and their connections to outlinking and backlinking domains. We demonstrate the success of graph neural networks in detecting news site reliability using these attributed webgraphs, and show that our baseline news site reliability classifier outperforms current SoTA methods on the PoliticalNews dataset, achieving an F1 score of 0.96. Finally, we introduce and evaluate a novel graph-based algorithm for discovering previously unknown misinformation news sources.</description>

      <title>Transforming Competition into Collaboration: The Revolutionary Role of Multi-Agent Systems and Language Models in Modern Organizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07769v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article explores the dynamic influence of computational entities based on multi-agent systems theory (SMA) combined with large language models (LLM), which are characterized by their ability to simulate complex human interactions, as a possibility to revolutionize human user interaction from the use of specialized artificial agents to support everything from operational organizational processes to strategic decision making based on applied knowledge and human orchestration. Previous investigations reveal that there are limitations, particularly in the autonomous approach of artificial agents, especially when dealing with new challenges and pragmatic tasks such as inducing logical reasoning and problem solving. It is also considered that traditional techniques, such as the stimulation of chains of thoughts, require explicit human guidance. In our approach we employ agents developed from large language models (LLM), each with distinct prototyping that considers behavioral elements, driven by strategies that stimulate the generation of knowledge based on the use case proposed in the scenario (role-play) business, using a discussion approach between agents (guided conversation). We demonstrate the potential of developing agents useful for organizational strategies, based on multi-agent system theories (SMA) and innovative uses based on large language models (LLM based), offering a differentiated and adaptable experiment to different applications, complexities, domains, and capabilities from LLM.</description>
