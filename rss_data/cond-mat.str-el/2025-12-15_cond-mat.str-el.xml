      <title>Site Preference and Possible Coexistence of Antiferromagnetic Order and Magnetic Frustration in (Co1-xMgx)10Ge3O16 (0 &lt;= x &lt;= 30%)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geometrically frustrated magnetism has attracted tremendous attention while chemical doping has been utilized as an important tool to probe frustrated magnetism in various systems. Here we perform a systematic study by doping non-magnetic Mg2+ into a magnetically complicated system, Co10Ge3O16, which contains three frustrated sublattices of Co2+, e.g., triangular Co1, Kagome Co2 and Co3 sublattices. By growing crystals for (Co1-xMgx)10Ge3O16 (0 &lt; x &lt;= 30%), we observed obvious site preference of Mg2+ on Co1 and Co3 sites over the Co2 site. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns confirm the high purity of the samples and indicate systematic peak shift, consistent with the loading compositions. Although previously investigated, the magnetic structure and expected magnetic frustration in this system are not fully uncovered. Our temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility measurements suggest that the high-temperature magnetostructural phase transition with antiferromagnetic ordering and a low-temperature broad peak are suppressed with Mg2+ doping, while two new magnetic features emerge at high Mg2+ level. Moreover, the structural phase transition from high-temperature R-3m to low-temperature C2/m space group is absent at the antiferromagnetic ordering temperature, as confirmed by single-crystal XRD. By analyzing the heat capacity and neutron powder diffraction results of the highest doped sample, (Co0.7Mg0.3)10Ge3O16, we speculate that the Co1 site is responsible for the long-range antiferromagnetic ordering, while the other two sites are short-range correlated in addition to a Mg2+-induced spin-glass state. This study provides more insights into the complex magnetism in Co10Ge3O16 by using the non-magnetic Mg2+ as a probe. However, detailed magnetic structure requires further efforts on growing large single crystals.</description>

      <title>Multiloop functional renormalization group from single bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The functional renormalization group (fRG) is an established tool in the treatment of correlated electron systems, notably for the description of competing instabilities. In recent years, methodological advancements led to the multiloop extension of the fRG, which systematically includes loop corrections beyond the conventional one-loop truncation and yields a quantitatively accurate description of two-dimensional lattice systems. At the same time, the single-boson exchange (SBE) decomposition of the two-particle vertex has been shown to offer both computational and interpretative advantages paving the way to more affordable approximation schemes. We here apply their combination coined as multiloop SBE fRG to the two-dimensional Hubbard model at weak coupling. After providing a detailed account of the underlying formalism in physical channels, we analyze the results for the frequency- and momentum-dependent vertex functions. We find that the SBE approximation, i.e., without calculating explicitly multi-boson exchange contributions, accurately reproduces the parquet approximation at loop convergence. The presented algorithmic improvement opens the route for the treatment of more challenging parameter regimes and more realistic models.</description>

      <title>Theory of Out-of-Time-Ordered Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct an effective field theory (EFT) that captures the universal behavior of out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) at late times in generic quantum many-body systems with conservation laws. The EFT hinges on a generalization of the strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking pattern adapted to out-of-time-order observables, and reduces to conventional fluctuating hydrodynamics when time-ordered observables are probed. We use the EFT to explain different power-law behavior observed in OTOCs at late times, and show that many OTOCs are entirely fixed by conventional transport data. Nevertheless, we show that a specific combination of OTOCs is sensitive to novel transport parameters, not visible in regular time-ordered correlators. We test our predictions in Hamiltonian and Floquet spin chains in one dimension.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-protected topological scar subspaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a framework that extends the notion of symmetry-protected topological properties beyond the ground-state paradigm to dynamically isolated subspaces formed by exceptional non-thermal energy eigenstates of non-integrable systems, known as quantum many-body scars (QMBS). We introduce the concept of a symmetry-protected topological (SPT) scar subspace -- a Hilbert subspace stabilized by a restricted spectrum-generating algebra (rSGA) while being protected by on-site, inversion, and time-reversal symmetries. QMBS often admit a non-interacting quasiparticle description, which enables matrix-product representations with small bond dimension. Although individual QMBS do not necessarily retain the protecting symmetries of the Hamiltonian, we show that the subspace formed by the symmetry-connected QMBS does retain them, giving rise to consistently emerging topological properties across the entire scar subspace. Using the spin-$1$ Affleck--Kennedy--Lieb--Tasaki (AKLT) model, we demonstrate that its bimagnon scar subspace reflects the topological properties of the SPT ground state, as evidenced by the appropriate bond-space symmetry representations, the expected topological response, and the numerically verified long-range string order. Our findings indicate that scar subspaces can inherit -- and in inhomogeneous cases systematically modify -- the topological character of the SPT ground state, offering a new and experimentally accessible platform for probing symmetry-protected topology beyond the ground-state regime.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic evidences for the spontaneous symmetry breaking at the $SO(5)$ deconfined critical point of $J$-$Q_3$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent numerical and theoretical studies on the two-dimensional $J$-$Q_3$ model suggests that the deconfined quantum critical point is actually a $SO(5)$-symmetry-enhanced first-order phase transition that is spontaneously broken to $O(4)$. However, this conclusion has mainly relied on finite-size scaling of the entanglement entropy, lacking direct evidence from physical observables.} Here, we investigate the dynamical spectra of spin and bond operators at the deconfined critical point of the $J$-$Q_3$ model using large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations, and contrasting them with the well-established $\mathrm{O(3)}$ Wilson-Fisher criticality in the $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model. Although both models exhibit two gapless magnon modes in the N\'eel phase, their critical behaviors diverge strikingly. At the $J_1$-$J_2$ critical point, the Higgs mode becomes gapless, yielding three gapless modes that reflect the full restoration of the $\mathrm{O(3)}$ symmetry. {In the $J$-$Q_3$ model, we instead observe four gapless transverse modes at the either side of the transition. This spectral feature, together with the entanglement entropy results, provides direct evidence for the weakly first-order scenario that the deconfined quantum critical point exhibits an emergent $\mathrm{SO(5)}$ symmetry that spontaneously breaks to $\mathrm{O(4)}$.</description>

      <title>Magnetic-field induced momentum-dependent symmetry breaking in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ revealed by magneto-ARPES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum materials with multiple degrees of freedom with similar energy scales, intertwined electronic orders with distinct broken symmetries often appear in a strongly coupled fashion. Recently, in a class of kagome superconductors represented by CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, experimental reports have suggested rotational symmetry breaking and time reversal symmetry breaking associated with a charge density wave (CDW) order, revealing an exotic nature of this CDW order. Here, utilizing our recently developed capability of performing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy in a tunable magnetic field (magneto-ARPES), we reveal momentum-selective response of the electronic structure of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ to an external magnetic field. While the response in the electronic structure is clearly compatible with piezomagnetism, strong orbital-selectivity is observed. Specifically, bands associated with the vanadium $d$-orbitals contributing to the Van Hove singularities (VHS) near the Brillouin zone (BZ) boundary exhibit selective spectral broadening that breaks C$_6$ rotational symmetry and is odd in magnetic field, disappearing above the CDW transition. Meanwhile, the antimony $p$-orbital dominated electron pocket at the BZ center becomes elongated under an applied field -- an effect that persists above the $T_{\rm CDW}$. Our observations delineate the origin of the time-reversal symmetry breaking associated with the vanadium VHS-bands at the onset of the CDW order, while the field-induced rotational symmetry breaking largely associated with the antimony $p$ orbitals reflects fluctuations beyond the CDW ordering temperature. Our magneto-ARPES work demonstrates a novel tuning knob for disentangling intertwined orders in the momentum space for quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Stability and complexity of global iterative solvers for the Kadanoff-Baym equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although the Kadanoff-Baym equations are typically solved using time-stepping methods, iterative global-in-time solvers offer potential algorithmic advantages, particularly when combined with compressed representations of two-time objects. We examine the computational complexity and stability of several global-in-time iterative methods, including multiple variants of fixed point iteration, Jacobian-free methods, and a Newton-Krylov method using automatic differentiation. We consider the ramped and periodically-driven Falicov-Kimball and Hubbard models within time-dependent dynamical mean-field theory. Although we observe that several iterative methods yield stable convergence at large propagation times, a standard forward fixed point iteration does not. We find that the number of iterations required to converge to a given accuracy with a fixed time step size scales roughly linearly with the number of time steps. This scaling is associated with the formation of a propagating front in the residual error, whose velocity is method-dependent. We identify key challenges which must be addressed in order to make global solvers competitive with time-stepping methods.</description>

      <title>Chirality-induced spin-selective Peierls transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chirality, referring to the absence of mirror and inversion symmetries, is a ubiquitous concept in nature. In condensed matter physics, vigorous research has clarified how chiral materials harbour unconventional electronic and vibrational responses. In parallel, recent studies have demonstrated that chiral structures can be engineered or tuned from achiral precursors. Despite these complementary advances, an integrated understanding of electronic and phononic dynamics, self-organized chiral structures, and their interplay is still lacking. Such an integrated framework is crucial both for elucidating the spontaneous formation and stabilization of chiral structures and for advancing the electronic functionalities of chiral materials. Here, we predict novel spontaneous structural phase transitions unique to chiral crystals with screw symmetry. In quasi-one-dimensional chiral crystals, the phonon frequency renormalized by the electron-phonon coupling depends on the handedness of circular polarization. Consequently, the soft mode encoding the intrinsic phonon angular momentum induces spin-selective Peierls gaps in the electronic band, entailing a helical spin density wave and chiral lattice distortion. We also elucidate the chiral signature of collective modes. Our findings offer new avenues for advanced spintronics applications and crucial insights into the elusive mechanisms underlying the formation process of chirality in nature.</description>

      <title>Interplay between antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation and electron-phonon coupling and the origin of the peak-dip-hump structure in the anti-nodal spectrum of high-$T_{c}$ cuprate superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron-phonon coupling is believed to be responsible for many spectral anomalies in the cuprate superconductors. In particular, the $B_{1g}$ buckling mode of the oxygen ion in the $CuO_{2}$ plane has been proposed to be responsible for the dramatic peak-dip-hump(PDH) structure in the anti-nodal spectrum. The recent observation of the exceptional flat quasiparticle dispersion in the anti-nodal region and the sudden suppression of the PDH structure around the pseudogap end point cast doubts on such a scenario. Instead, a scenario involving the coupling to the antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation seems to resolve both puzzles naturally. Here we present a systematic study on the interplay between antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation and electron-phonon coupling in the cuprate superconductors. We show that the coupling strength to the $B_{1g}$ buckling mode is strongly suppressed by the vertex correction caused by the antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation in the $\mathbf{q}\rightarrow 0$ limit as a result of the destructive interference between electron-phonon coupling at electron momentum differ by the antiferromagnetic wave vector. Counterintuitively, we find that the same vertex correction enhances the phonon contribution to the PDH structure. We also find that while the coupling to either the antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation or the $B_{1g}$ buckling mode can generate a PDH structure in the anti-nodal spectrum with similar phenomenologies, the sudden suppression of such a structure around the pseudogap end point should be mainly attributed to the dramatic change in the nature of the spin fluctuation at such a critical doping. We suggest to take the PDH structure in the anti-nodal spectrum as a spectral signature for the emergence of fluctuating local moment in the pseudogap phase and the entrance of a doped Mott insulating state.</description>

      <title>$S = 1$ pyrochlore magnets with competing anisotropies: A tale of two Coulomb phases, $Z_2$ flux confinement and $XY$-like transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We argue that the low-temperature physics of $S=1$ pyrochlore magnets with a predominantly Ising-like easy-axis exchange coupling $J$ that favors the local tetrahedral body diagonals, and a comparably large easy-plane single-ion anisotropy $\Delta =J + \mu$ ($|\mu| \ll J$) that favors the plane perpendicular to these local axes will exhibit interesting new phenomena due to the competition between $J$ and $\Delta$. In the $T/J \rightarrow 0$ limit, we find three low temperature phases as a function of $\mu/T$: a short-range correlated paramagnetic phase, and two topologically-distinct Coulomb liquids separated by a $Z_2$ flux confinement transition. Both Coulomb liquids are described at long-wavelengths by a fluctuating divergence-free polarization field and have characteristic pinch-point singularities in their structure factor. In one Coulomb phase, the flux of this polarization field is confined to {\em even} integers, while it takes on all integer values in the other Coulomb phase. Experimental realizations with $|\mu| \ll J$ and negative are predicted to exhibit signatures of a transition from a flux-deconfined Coulomb phase to the flux-confined Coulomb phase as they are cooled below $T_{c_2} \approx 1.57|\mu|$, while realizations with positive $\mu \ll J$ will show signatures of a transition from a flux-deconfined Coulomb liquid to a short-range correlated paramagnet via a continuous $XY$-like transition at $T_{c_1} \approx 0.98 \mu$.</description>

      <title>Physical properties of new delafossite triangular-lattice compounds TlErSe$_2$ and TlTmSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Delafossite compounds containing rare-earth ions have been proven to be an ideal platform to investigate frustrated magnetic ground states. Here, we discuss two triangular-lattice antiferromagnets, TlErSe$_2$ and TlTmSe$_2$, as potential candidates for hosting exotic quantum states. Powder X-ray diffraction data analysis of the black-color polycrystalline Tl$RE$Se$_2$ ($RE$: Er and Tm) samples confirms the phase purity. Both materials crystallize in the trigonal $\alpha$-NaFeO$_2$ structure ($R\overline{3}m$) with lattice parameters $a$ = 4.1070(4) \r{A} and $c$ = 23.1472(1) \r{A} for the erbium compound and $a$ = 4.0916(1) \r{A} and $c$ = 23.1483(2) \r{A} for the thulium compound. Magnetic susceptibility measurements show an effective moment of $\mu_{\text{eff}} = 9.6(2) \mu_B$/f.u. ($7.5(1) \mu_B$/f.u.) for TlErSe$_2$ (TlTmSe$_2$) for temperatures above 200 K. While $^3$He specific-heat measurements reveal long-range magnetic order below $T_N = 0.42 $K for TlErSe$_2$, no sign of long-range magnetic order was observed for TlTmSe$_2$. Based on our results, we map out the T-H phase diagram for polycrystalline TlErSe$_2$ and discuss the striking difference in the magnetic behavior of TlTmSe$_2$ based on our ab initio quantum chemical calculations.</description>

      <title>Curvilinear magnonic crystal based on 3D hierarchical nanotemplates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Curvilinear magnetic nanostructures enable control of magnetization dynamics through geometry-induced anisotropy and chiral interactions as well as magnetic field modulation. In this work, we report a curvilinear magnonic crystal based on large-area square arrays of truncated nanospikes fabricated by conformal coating of 3D hierarchical templates with permalloy thin films. Brillouin light scattering spectroscopy reveals anisotropic band structure with multiple dispersive and folded Bloch-type dispersive spin-wave modes as well as non-dispersive modes exhibiting direction-dependent frequency shifts and intensity asymmetries along lattice principal axes. Finite element micromagnetic simulations indicate that curvature-induced variations of the demagnetizing field govern the magnonic response, enabling the identification of modes propagating in nanochannels and other localized on nanospike apexes or along the ridges connecting adjacent nanospikes. The combination of geometric curvature and optical probing asymmetry produces directional dependence of magnonic bands, establishing 3D hierarchical templates as a versatile platform for curvature-engineered magnonics.</description>

      <title>2$k_F$ instability and chiral spin density wave at the 1/9 magnetization plateau in the kagome antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kagome lattice antiferromagnets exhibit plethora of intriguing phases of matter. Particularly interesting state appears at the magnetic field-induced $1/9$ magnetization plateau observed in several recent experimental studies. The nature and exotic physical properties of the plateau however remain controversial due to an exceptional complexity of the state generated by geometrical frustration. Among candidate states recent studies found a $Z_3$ quantum spin liquid state, a valence bond crystal exhibiting an hourglass pattern and a valence bond crystal state with a $3\times 3$ periodicity and a windmill-shaped motif. Recent torque magnetometry measurements on YCOB single-crystal samples however indicate presence of Dirac-like spinons at $1/9$ magnetization plateau. We study properties of the plateau state using novel machine learning technique that combines variational Monte Carlo, symmetry enhanced neural network quantum states and flux insertion method. Our machine learning study reveals that the ground state at the $1/9$ plateau is a gapless $1\times 1$ chiral spin density wave caused by 2$k_F$ instability of the underlying composite Fermi liquid. The spin wave chirality results from the correlated spin order that reflects its nontrivial topology.</description>

      <title>Pole skipping from universal hydrodynamics of (1+1)d QFTs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: (1+1)d QFTs provide a tractable arena for understanding the emergence of hydrodynamics in thermal states. At high temperatures this process is governed by the weak breaking of conformal symmetry, and so in this limit many features of the hydrodynamic theory that emerges have been argued to be universal. In this paper we study aspects of the stress tensor thermal two-point function in holographic QFTs of this kind and show that they are consistent with the universal hydrodynamic theory proposed to apply at late times. Specifically, we identify the locations of the `pole skipping' points in momentum space at which there is an intersection of poles and zeroes of this two-point function in holographic QFTs. Although these points lie outside the regime where the hydrodynamic theory is controlled, we show that their locations are consistent with those found by resumming the hydrodynamic derivative expansion near the lightcone. For example, this resummation of the universal hydrodynamics correctly predicts the butterfly velocity of holographic theories.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent inclusion of disorder in the BCS-BEC crossover near $T_c$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a systematic theoretical approach to incorporate the effects of a static white-noise disorder into the BCS-BEC crossover near the critical temperature ($T_c$) of the superfluid transition. Starting from a functional-integral formulation in momentum-frequency space, we derive an effective thermodynamic potential that fully accounts for Gaussian fluctuations of the order-parameter field and its coupling to the disorder potential. The effective action, expanded to second order in both the disorder potential and the bosonic field, naturally involves third- and fourth-order terms arising from the logarithmic expansion near $T_c$. This formalism, valid across the entire BCS-BEC crossover, reproduces the well-established BCS and BEC limits and yields self-energy expressions consistent with previous analyses for non-interacting point bosons and tightly bound fermion pairs. The approach applies equally to continuum and lattice systems and provides a natural framework for generalizations to multiband models.</description>

      <title>Topological Order and Non-Hermitian Skin Effect in Generalized Ideal Chern Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fractionalization in ideal Chern bands and non-Hermitian topological physics are two active but so far separate research directions. Merging these, we generalize the notion of ideal Chern bands to the non-Hermitian realm and uncover several striking consequences both on the level of band theory and in the strongly interacting regime. Specifically, we show that the lowest band of a Kapit--Mueller lattice model with an imaginary gauge potential satisfies a generalized ideal condition with complex Berry curvature in sync with a complex quantum metric. The ideal band remains purely real and exactly flat yet all right and left eigenstates accumulate at the boundaries on a cylinder, implying a non-Hermitian skin effect without an accompanying spectral winding. The skin effect is inherited by the many-body zero modes, yielding skin-Laughlin states with an exponential profile on the lattice. Moreover, at a critical strength of non-Hermiticity there is an unconventional phase transition on the torus, which is absent on the cylinder. Our findings lead to an extension of topological order in non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Network-Irreducible Multiparty Entanglement in Quantum Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the standard approach to characterize collective entanglement via genuine multiparty entanglement (GME) leads to an area law in ground and thermal Gibbs states of local Hamiltonians. To capture the truly collective part one needs to go beyond this short-range contribution tied to interfaces between subregions. Genuine network multiparty entanglement (GNME) achieves a systematic resolution of this goal by analyzing whether a $k$-party state can be prepared by a quantum network consisting of $(k-1)$-partite resources. We develop tools to certify and quantify GNME, and benchmark them for GHZ, W and Dicke states. We then study the 1d transverse field Ising model, where we find a sharp peak of GNME near the critical phase transition, and rapid suppression elsewhere. Finite temperature leads to a faster death of GNME compared to GME. Furthermore, certain 2d quantum spin liquids do not have GNME in microscopic subregions while possessing strong GME. This approach will allow to chart truly collective entanglement in quantum matter both in and out of equilibrium.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional moir\'e materials offer a powerful, twist-tunable platform for engineering electronic bands and correlations, though most studies to date have focused on small twist angles where flat bands arise from symmetry-pinned monolayer momenta. Here, we observe the surprising emergence of flat electronic bands with a distinctive quasi-one-dimensional dispersion at large twist angles in bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides that originate from the $\Lambda$ valley states at generic momenta between $\Gamma$ and $K$ points. These taco-shaped anisotropic bands result from optimal interlayer hybridization between like-spin $\Lambda$ valleys at the conduction band minimum in the Brillouin zone, resulting in directional band flattening at a magic twist-angle of 21.8$^{\circ}$. The bands form six anisotropic channels with a sixfold alternating spin texture reminiscent of altermagnetic textures. At low energies, the density of states shows a power-law dependence due to the quasi-one-dimensional character, enhancing the potential for correlated phases. Our results provide a new platform for correlated phenomena and broaden the scope of moir\'e engineering to large twist angles in 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Interplay between charge correlations and superconductivity across the superconducting domes of CsV$_{3}$Sb$_{5-x}$Sn$_x$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The kagome metal CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ shows an unconventional interplay between charge density wave (CDW) order and superconductivity. Tuning the band filling is known to rapidly suppress long-range CDW order and drive the formation of two superconducting ``domes" upon increasing hole concentration. Here we determine the detailed evolution of charge correlations across this phase diagram and resolve their interplay with the superconducting state. Upon light hole-doping, the suppression of a metastable $2\times 2\times 4$ CDW state coincides with the suppression of superconducting fluctuations present in the parent CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ compound. Continued doping suppresses long-range $2\times 2\times 2$ CDW order, leaving remnant short-range, quasi-1D correlations that persist across the second superconducting dome. These higher temperature charge correlations are seemingly essential to the lower temperature superconducting state, as charge correlations vanish coincident with superconductivity as a function of hole-doping. A multidomain model of short-range V-V dimer formation within the kagome plane is proposed in the second superconducting dome, where rotational and translational symmetry remain locally broken even in the absence of long-range CDW order.</description>

Abstract: We introduce an unsupervised machine-learning framework that discovers optimally compressed representations of quantum many-body ground states. Using an autoencoder neural network architecture on data from $L$-site Fermi-Hubbard models, we identify minimal latent spaces with a sharp reconstruction quality threshold at $L-1$ latent dimensions, matching the system's intrinsic degrees of freedom. We demonstrate the use of the trained decoder as a differentiable variational ansatz to minimize energy directly within the latent space. Crucially, this approach circumvents the $N$-representability problem, as the learned manifold implicitly restricts the optimization to physically valid quantum states.</description>

      <title>Quantum Krylov algorithm using unitary decomposition for exact eigenstates of fermionic systems using quantum computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Krylov algorithms have emerged as a useful framework for quantum simulations in quantum chemistry and many-body physics, offering a favorable trade-off between potential quantum speedups and practical resource demands. However, the current primary approach to building Krylov vectors in these algorithms is to use real or imaginary-time evolution, which is not exact, require an arbitrary time-step parameter ($\Delta t$), and degrade the Krylov vectors quickly with increasing $\Delta t$. In this paper, we develop a quantum Krylov algorithm without time evolution and with an exact formulation of the Krylov subspace, named ``Quantum Krylov using Unitary Decomposition'' (QKUD), along with implementation proposals for quantum computers. Not only is this algorithm exact in the limit $\epsilon \to 0$ of the error parameter $\epsilon$, but it also produces more accurate Krylov vectors at $\epsilon \neq 0$ than conventional time evolution due to more favorable error scaling (O($\epsilon^2$) vs O($\Delta t$)). Through simulations, we demonstrate that these theoretical benefits yield numerical advantages: (i) QKUD provides numerically exact results at small $\epsilon$, (ii) it remains stable across a broad range of $\epsilon$ values, indicating low parameter sensitivity, and (iii) it can solve problems unreachable by conventional time evolution. This development resolves a central limitation of quantum Krylov algorithms, namely their inexactness and sensitivity to the time-step parameter, and paves the way for new and powerful quantum Krylov algorithms for quantum computers with a stronger promise of quantum advantage.</description>

Abstract: Numerous experiments on pyrochlore oxides Pr$_2$(Zr, Sn, Hf, Ir)$_2$O$_7$ with non-Kramers Pr$^{3+}$ ions suggest that they support a quantum spin liquid (QSL) ground state, but the precise nature of the QSL remains unclear. Quantum spin ice with dominant dipolar Ising and smaller quadrupolar transverse exchange interactions is one such candidate, but a dominant inelastic neutron scattering signal suggests that such a picture may not be consistent with experimental results. The microscopic exchange couplings of these compounds are also not known, leaving room for many possible QSL states. In this work, we use Schwinger boson mean-field theory supplemented by a projective symmetry group classification to study possible $\mathbb{Z}_2$ QSLs in pyrochlore magnets with dipolar-quadrupolar non-Kramers local moments. We build a mean-field phase diagram and find four QSLs in the frustrated region of parameter space that are consistent with inelastic signals observed in neutron scattering data on Pr$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ and Pr$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$. Among these, two robust QSLs occur in the regime with dominant transverse exchange rather than Ising exchange. We then compute the static and dynamic spin structure factors for these QSL candidates, which can be used to distinguish them in neutron scattering experiments.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the nature of the 5$f$ electrons in the unconventional odd-parity superconductor UTe$_2$, focusing on the degree of covalency, localization versus itinerancy, and dominant electronic configuration. This is achieved using density functional theory (DFT) in combination with dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) calculations. A key aspect of our approach is the material-specific tuning of the double-counting correction parameter, $\mu_{\rm dc}$, within the DFT+DMFT part. This tuning is guided by the energy dependence of photo-ionization cross-sections in valence band photoelectron spectroscopy. The reliability of the parameters is confirmed by the accurate reproduction of the angle-resolved valence-band photoemission spectra and the U 4$f$ core-level data. The DFT+DMFT model reveals that in UTe$_2$ U 5$f^n$ configurations with n=1 to 4 contribute to the ground state, with the 5$f^2$ configuration being most prevalent and an average 5$f$ shell fillings close to 2.5. The model further suggests that the 5$f$ electrons form narrow bands and that charge fluctuations due to degeneracy play a role in addition to coherent valence dynamics arising from hybridization with the conduction bath. Additionally, the significance of the U 6$d$ states in UTe$_2$ is discussed.</description>

Abstract: An exactly solvable model of a quantum spin liquid on a quasicrystal, akin to Kitaev's honeycomb model, was introduced in Kim \textit{et al.}, \href{https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.110.214438}{\text{Phys. Rev. B} \textbf{110}, 214438 (2024)}. It was shown that in contrast to the translationally invariant models, such a spin liquid stabilizes a gapped ground state with a finite irrational flux density. In this work, we analyze the strong bond-anisotropic limit of the model and demonstrate that the aperiodic lattice geometry naturally generates a hierarchy of exponentially separated coupling constants in the resulting toric code Hamiltonian. Furthermore, a perturbative magnetic field leads to anomalous localization properties where an anyonic excitation sequentially delocalizes over subsets of sites forming equipotential contours in the quasicrystal. In addition, certain background flux configurations, together with the underlying geometry, give rise to strictly localized eigenstates that remain decoupled from the rest of the spectrum. Using numerical studies, we uncover the key mechanisms responsible for this unconventional localization behavior. Our study highlights that topologically ordered phases, in the presence of geometrical constraints can lead to highly anomalous localization properties of fractionalized charges.</description>

Abstract: A generic question in the field of ultrafast dynamics is concerned with the relaxation dynamics and the subsequent thermalization of optically excited charge carriers. Among several possible relaxation channels available in a solid-state system, we focus on the coupling to magnetic excitations. In this paper, we study the real-time dynamics of a paradigmatic model, the Kondo lattice model in one dimension. We conduct a comprehensive study of the relaxation processes by evaluating the spin polarization of the conduction electron, the local spin-spin correlation between localized and conduction electrons, and the electronic momentum distribution. While in the well-studied cases of one or two charge carriers in a ferromagnetic background, no thermalization occurs, we demonstrate that the stationary state is compatible with thermalization if either the electronic filling is finite or the magnetic background is in the singlet sector. Our real-time simulations using the time-dependent Lanczos method are corroborated by a direct comparison with finite-temperature expectation values and an analysis of the spectrum in terms of the gap ratio.</description>

      <title>Universal scaling in one-dimensional non-reciprocal matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14384v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unveiling universal non-equilibrium scaling laws has been a central theme in modern statistical physics, with recent attention increasingly directed toward non-equilibrium phases that exhibit rich dynamical phenomena. A striking example arises in non-reciprocal systems, where asymmetric interactions between components lead to inherently dynamic phases and unconventional criticality near a critical exceptional point (CEP), where the criticality arises from the coalescence of collective modes with an existing Nambu-Goldstone mode. However, the universal scaling behavior that emerges in this system with full consideration of many-body effects and stochastic noise remains largely elusive. Here, we establish a dynamical scaling law in a generic one-dimensional (1D) stochastic non-reciprocal $O(2)$-symmetric system. Through large-scale simulations, we uncover a new non-equilibrium scaling in the vicinity of the CEP, distinct from any previously known equilibrium or non-equilibrium universality classes. We report an anomalously large roughening exponent $\alpha_{\rm CEP}=1.35(5)$, which is to be compared with those of simple diffusion $\alpha_{\rm EW}=0.5$. In regimes where the system breaks into domains with opposite chirality and spatiotemporal vortices inevitably emerge, we find that fluctuations are strongly suppressed, leading to a logarithmic scaling as a function of system size $L$ that manifests a short-range correlation. This work elucidates the beyond-mean-field dynamics of non-reciprocal matter, thereby shedding light on the exploration of criticality in non-reciprocal phase transition across diverse physical contexts, from active matter and driven quantum systems to biological pattern formation and non-Hermitian physics.</description>

Abstract: A recent work [Mierzejewski et al., Phys. Rev. B 107, 045134 (2023)] observed "quasiballistic spin transport" - long-lived and transiently ballistic modes of the magnetization density - in numerical simulations of infinite-temperature XXZ chains with power-law exchange interactions. We develop an analytical theory of such quasiballistic spin transport. Previous work found that this effect was maximized along a specific locus in the space of model parameters, which interpolated smoothly between the integrable Haldane-Shastry and XX models and whose shape was estimated from numerics. We obtain an analytical estimate for the lifetime of the spin current and show that it has a unique maximum along a different locus, which interpolates more gradually between the two integrable points. We further rule out the existence of a conserved two-body operator that protects ballistic spin transport away from these integrable points by proving that a corresponding functional equation has no solutions. We discuss connections between our approach and an integrability-transport conjecture for spin.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Bose liquid from anomalous shot noise in nanojunctions of bad metal beta-Ta</title>

Abstract: We report anomalous shot noise in nanojunctions of beta-tantalum, a ``bad" metal whose electronic properties are inconsistent with the Fermi liquid theory. Fano factors cluster around even multiples of the values expected for Fermi liquids, suggesting that beta-Ta may host a correlated charge liquid of Cooper pair-like electron groups. Further evidence for correlations is provided by the effects of magnetic impurities, as well as reduced density of states near the Fermi level indicated by point contact spectroscopy and first principles calculations. Our results open new avenues for studies and applications of electron correlations.</description>

      <title>Zero modes and index theorems for non-Hermitian Dirac fermions</title>

Abstract: Dirac fermions, subject to external magnetic fields and in the presence of mass orders that assume topologically nontrivial spatial textures such as domain wall and vortices, for example, bind robust midgap states at zero energy, the number of which is governed by the Aharonov-Casher and Jackiw-Rebbi or Jackiw-Rossi index theorems, respectively. Here I extend the jurisdiction of these prominent index theorems to Lorentz invariant non-Hermitian (NH) Dirac operators, constructed by augmenting the celebrated Dirac Hamiltonian by a masslike anti-Hermitian operator that also scales linearly with momentum. The resulting NH Dirac operator manifests all-real eigenvalues over an extended NH parameter regime, characterized by a real effective Fermi velocity for NH Dirac fermions ($v_{_{\rm F}}$). From the explicit solutions of the zero-energy bound states, I show that in the presence of external magnetic fields of arbitrary shape such modes always exist when the system encloses a finite number of magnetic flux quanta, while in the presence of spatially nontrivial textures of the mass orders localized zero-energy modes can only be found in the spectrum when $v_{_{\rm F}}$ is real. These findings pave a concrete route to realize nucleation of competing orders from the topologically robust zero-energy manifold in NH or open Dirac systems. Possible extensions of these outcomes to other index theorems and tabletop experimental setups to test these predictions are discussed.</description>

      <title>Steady state diagram of interacting fermionic atoms coupled to dissipative cavities</title>

Abstract: We investigate fermionic atoms subjected to an optical lattice and coupled to a high finesse optical cavity with photon losses. A transverse pump beam introduces a coupling between the atoms and the cavity field. We explore the steady state phase diagram taking fluctuations around the mean-field of the atoms-cavity coupling into account. Our approach allows us to investigate both one- and higher-dimensional atomic systems. The fluctuations beyond mean-field lead to an effective temperature which changes the nature of the self-organization transition. We find a strong dependence of the results on the atomic filling, in particular when contrasting the behavior at low filling and at half filling. At low filling the transition to a self-organized phase takes place at a critical value of the pump strength. In the self-organized phase the cavity field takes a finite expectation value and the atoms show a modulation in the density. Surprisingly, at even larger pump strengths a strongly non-monotonous behavior of the temperature is found and hints towards effects of cavity cooling at many-body resonances. Additionally multiple self-organized stable solutions of the cavity field and the atoms occur, signaling the presence of a fluctuation-induced bistability, with the two solutions having different effective temperatures previously discussed in [Tolle et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 133602 (2025)]. In contrast, at half filling a bistable region arises at the self-organization transition already neglecting the fluctuations. The presence of the fluctuations induce an effective temperature as at lower filling and change the behavior of the transition and the steady states drastically. We analyze the properties of the occurring steady states of the coupled atoms-cavity system.</description>
