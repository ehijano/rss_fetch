      <title>Heterogeneity in Women's Nighttime Ride-Hailing Intention: Evidence from an LC-ICLV Model Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While ride-hailing services offer increased travel flexibility and convenience, persistent nighttime safety concerns significantly reduce women's willingness to use them. Existing research often treats women as a homogeneous group, neglecting the heterogeneity in their decision-making processes. To address this gap, this study develops the Latent Class Integrated Choice and Latent Variable (LC-ICLV) model with a mixed Logit kernel, combined with an ordered Probit model for attitudinal indicators, to capture unobserved heterogeneity in women's nighttime ride-hailing decisions. Based on panel data from 543 respondents across 29 provinces in China, the analysis identifies two distinct female subgroups. The first, labeled the "Attribute-Sensitive Group", consists mainly of young women and students from first- and second-tier cities. Their choices are primarily influenced by observable service attributes such as price and waiting time, but they exhibit reduced usage intention when matched with female drivers, possibly reflecting deeper safety heuristics. The second, the "Perception-Sensitive Group", includes older working women and residents of less urbanized areas. Their decisions are shaped by perceived risk and safety concerns; notably, high-frequency use or essential nighttime commuting needs may reinforce rather than alleviate avoidance behaviors. The findings underscore the need for differentiated strategies: platforms should tailor safety features and user interfaces by subgroup, policymakers must develop targeted interventions, and female users can benefit from more personalized risk mitigation strategies. This study offers empirical evidence to advance gender-responsive mobility policy and improve the inclusivity of ride-hailing services in urban nighttime contexts.</description>

      <title>Sample efficient likelihood-free inference for virus dynamics with different types of experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study applied Bayesian optimization likelihood-free inference(BOLFI) to virus dynamics experimental data and efficiently inferred the model parameters with uncertainty measure. The computational benefit is remarkable compared to existing methodology on the same problem. No likelihood knowledge is needed in the inference. Improvement of the BOLFI algorithm with Gaussian process based classifier for treatment of extreme values are provided. Discrepancy design for combining different forms of data from completely different experiment processes are suggested and tested with synthetic data, then applied to real data. Reasonable parameter values are estimated for influenza A virus data.</description>

      <title>Functional Analysis of Variance for Association Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While progress has been made in identifying common genetic variants associated with human diseases, for most of common complex diseases, the identified genetic variants only account for a small proportion of heritability. Challenges remain in finding additional unknown genetic variants predisposing to complex diseases. With the advance in next-generation sequencing technologies, sequencing studies have become commonplace in genetic research. The ongoing exome-sequencing and whole-genome-sequencing studies generate a massive amount of sequencing variants and allow researchers to comprehensively investigate their role in human diseases. The discovery of new disease-associated variants can be enhanced by utilizing powerful and computationally efficient statistical methods. In this paper, we propose a functional analysis of variance (FANOVA) method for testing an association of sequence variants in a genomic region with a qualitative trait. The FANOVA has a number of advantages: (1) it tests for a joint effect of gene variants, including both common and rare; (2) it fully utilizes linkage disequilibrium and genetic position information; and (3) allows for either protective or risk-increasing causal variants. Through simulations, we show that FANOVA outperform two popularly used methods - SKAT and a previously proposed method based on functional linear models (FLM), - especially if a sample size of a study is small and/or sequence variants have low to moderate effects. We conduct an empirical study by applying three methods (FANOVA, SKAT and FLM) to sequencing data from Dallas Heart Study. While SKAT and FLM respectively detected ANGPTL 4 and ANGPTL 3 associated with obesity, FANOVA was able to identify both genes associated with obesity.</description>

      <title>Risk-Based Prognostics and Health Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is often the case that risk assessment and prognostics are viewed as related but separate tasks. This chapter describes a risk-based approach to prognostics that seeks to provide a tighter coupling between risk assessment and fault prediction. We show how this can be achieved using the continuous-time Bayesian network as the underlying modeling framework. Furthermore, we provide an overview of the techniques that are available to derive these models from data and show how they might be used in practice to achieve tasks like decision support and performance-based logistics. This work is intended to provide an overview of the recent developments related to risk-based prognostics, and we hope that it will serve as a tutorial of sorts that will assist others in adopting these techniques.</description>

      <title>Dissecting Microbial Community Structure and Heterogeneity via Multivariate Covariate-Adjusted Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In microbiome studies, it is often of great interest to identify clusters or partitions of microbiome profiles within a study population and to characterize the distinctive attributes of each resulting microbial community. While raw counts or relative compositions are commonly used for such analysis, variations between clusters may be driven or distorted by subject-level covariates, reflecting underlying biological and clinical heterogeneity across individuals. Simultaneously detecting latent communities and identifying covariates that differentiate them can enhance our understanding of the microbiome and its association with health outcomes. To this end, we propose a Dirichlet-multinomial mixture regression (DMMR) model that enables joint clustering of microbiome profiles while accounting for covariates with either homogeneous or heterogeneous effects across clusters. A novel symmetric link function is introduced to facilitate covariate modeling through the compositional parameters. We develop efficient algorithms with convergence guarantees for parameter estimation and establish theoretical properties of the proposed estimators. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the method in clustering, feature selection, and heterogeneity detection. We illustrate the utility of DMMR through a comprehensive application to upper-airway microbiota data from a pediatric asthma study, uncovering distinct microbial subtypes and their associations with clinical characteristics.</description>

      <title>Estimating Covariate Effects on Functional Connectivity using Voxel-Level fMRI Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Functional connectivity (FC) analysis of resting-state fMRI data provides a framework for characterizing brain networks and their association with participant-level covariates. Due to the high dimensionality of neuroimaging data, standard approaches often average signals within regions of interest (ROIs), which ignores the underlying spatiotemporal dependence among voxels and can lead to biased or inefficient inference. We propose to use a summary statistic -- the empirical voxel-wise correlations between ROIs -- and, crucially, model the complex covariance structure among these correlations through a new positive definite covariance function. Building on this foundation, we develop a computationally efficient two-step estimation procedure that enables statistical inference on covariate effects on region-level connectivity. Simulation studies show calibrated uncertainty quantification, and substantial gains in validity of the statistical inference over the standard averaging method. With data from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange, we show that autism spectrum disorder is associated with altered FC between attention-related ROIs after adjusting for age and gender. The proposed framework offers an interpretable and statistically rigorous approach to estimation of covariate effects on FC suitable for large-scale neuroimaging studies.</description>

      <title>Contrastive CUR: Interpretable Joint Feature and Sample Selection for Case-Control Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dimension reduction is an essential tool for analyzing high dimensional data. Most existing methods, including principal component analysis (PCA), as well as their extensions, provide principal components that are often linear combinations of features, which are often challenging to interpret. CUR decomposition, another matrix decomposition technique, is a more interpretable and efficient alternative, offers simultaneous feature and sample selection. Despite this, many biomedical studies involve two groups: a foreground (treatment or case) group and a background (control) group, where the objective is to identify features unique to or enriched in the foreground. This need for contrastive dimension reduction is not well addressed by existing CUR methods, nor by contrastive approaches rooted in PCAs. Furthermore, they fail to address a key challenge in biomedical studies: the need for selecting samples unique to the foreground. In this paper, we address this gap by proposing a Contrastive CUR (CCUR), a novel method specifically designed for case-control studies. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that CCUR outperforms existing techniques in isolating biologically relevant features as well as identifying sample-specific responses unique to the foreground, offering deeper insights into case-control biomedical data.</description>

      <title>How Much Does Home Field Advantage Matter in Soccer Games? A Causal Inference Approach for English Premier League Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.07193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In many sports, it is commonly believed that the home team has an advantage over the visiting team, known as the home field advantage. Yet its causal effect on team performance is largely unknown. In this paper, we propose a novel causal inference approach to study the causal effect of home field advantage in English Premier League. We develop a hierarchical causal model and show that both league level and team level causal effects are identifiable and can be conveniently estimated. We further develop an inference procedure for the proposed estimators and demonstrate its excellent numerical performance via simulation studies. We implement our method on the 2020-21 English Premier League data and assess the causal effect of home advantage on eleven summary statistics that measure the offensive and defensive performance and referee-assessed disciplinary outcomes. We find that the home field advantage resides more heavily in offensive statistics than it does in defensive or referee statistics. We also find evidence that teams that had lower rankings retain a higher home field advantage.</description>

      <title>A time warping model for seasonal data with application to age estimation from narwhal tusks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Signals with varying periodicity frequently appear in real-world phenomena, necessitating the development of efficient modelling techniques to map the measured nonlinear timeline to linear time. Here we propose a regression model that allows for a representation of periodic and dynamic patterns observed in time series data. The model incorporates a hidden strictly positive stochastic process that represents the instantaneous frequency, allowing the model to adapt and accurately capture varying time scales. A case study focusing on age estimation of narwhal tusks is presented, where cyclic element signals associated with annual growth layer groups are analyzed. We apply the methodology to data from one such tusk collected in West Greenland and use the fitted model to estimate the age of the narwhal. The proposed method is validated using simulated signals with known cycle counts and practical considerations and modelling challenges are discussed in detail. This research contributes to the field of time series analysis, providing a tool and valuable insights for understanding and modeling complex cyclic patterns in diverse domains.</description>

      <title>Accommodating the Analysis Model in Multiple Imputation for the Weibull Mixture Cure Model:Performance under Penalized Likelihood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Introduction In analysis of time-to-event outcomes, a mixture cure (MC) model is preferred over a standard survival model when the sample includes individuals who will never experience the event of interest. Motivated by a cohort study of breast cancer patients with incomplete biomarkers, we develop multiple imputation (MI) methods assuming a Weibull proportional hazards (PH-MC) analysis model with multiple prognostic factors. However, for MI with fully conditional specification, an incorrectly-specified imputation model can impair accuracy of point and interval estimates.
  Objectives and Methods Our goal is to propose imputation models that are compatible with the Weibull PH-MC analysis models. We derive an exact conditional distribution (ECD) imputation model which involves the analysis model likelihood. Using simulation studies, we compare effect estimate bias and confidence interval (CI) coverage under alternative imputation models including the ECD model, an approximation that includes a cure indicator (cECD), and a comprehensive simple (CS) model. For robust parameter estimation in finite and/or sparse samples, we incorporate the Firth-type penalized likelihood (FT-PL) and combined likelihood profile (CLIP) methods into the MI.
  Results Compared to complete case analysis, MI with penalization reduces estimation bias and improves coverage. Although ECD and cECD perform similarly at higher event rates, ECD generates smaller bias and higher coverage at lower rates. CS has larger bias and lower coverage than ECD and cECD, but CIs are narrower than for cECD.
  Conclusions In analyses of biomarkers and composite subtypes for prognosis studies such as in breast cancer, use of compatible imputation models and penalization methods are recommended for MC modelling in samples with low event numbers and/or with covariate imbalance.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Aware Adaptation of Large Language Models for Protein-Protein Interaction Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06173v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Identification of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) helps derive cellular mechanistic understanding, particularly in the context of complex conditions such as neurodegenerative disorders, metabolic syndromes, and cancer. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in predicting protein structures and interactions via automated mining of vast biomedical literature; yet their inherent uncertainty remains a key challenge for deriving reproducible findings, critical for biomedical applications. In this study, we present an uncertainty-aware adaptation of LLMs for PPI analysis, leveraging fine-tuned LLaMA-3 and BioMedGPT models. To enhance prediction reliability, we integrate LoRA ensembles and Bayesian LoRA models for uncertainty quantification (UQ), ensuring confidence-calibrated insights into protein behavior. Our approach achieves competitive performance in PPI identification across diverse disease contexts while addressing model uncertainty, thereby enhancing trustworthiness and reproducibility in computational biology. These findings underscore the potential of uncertainty-aware LLM adaptation for advancing precision medicine and biomedical research.</description>
