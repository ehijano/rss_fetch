      <title>Gapfull and gapless $1$D Topological Superconductivity in Spin-Orbit Coupled Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a way to generate a one-dimensional topological superconductor from a monolayer of a transition metal dichalcogenide coupled to a Bernal-stacked bilayer of graphene under a displacement field. With proper gating, this structure may be tuned to form three parallel pads of superconductors creating two planar Josephson junctions in series, in which normal regions separate the superconductors. Two characteristics of the system which are essential for our discussion are spin orbit coupling induced by the transition metal dichalcogenides and the variation of the Fermi velocities along the Fermi surface. We demonstrate that these two characteristics lead to one-dimensional topological superconductivity occupying large parts in the parameter space defined by the two phase differences across the two junctions and the relative angle between the junctions and the lattice. An angle-shaped device in which this angle varies in space, combined with proper phase tuning, can lead to the formation of domain walls between topological and trivial phases, supporting a zero-energy Majorana mode, within the bulk of carefully designed devices. We derive the spectrum of the Andreev bound states and show that Ising spin-orbit coupling leaves the topological superconductor gapless, and the Rashba spin-orbit coupling opens a gap in its spectrum. Our analysis shows that the transition to a gapped topological state is a result of the band inversion of Andreev states.</description>

      <title>Universal giant spin Hall effect in moire metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While moir\'e phenomena have been extensively studied in low-carrier-density systems such as graphene and semiconductors, their implications for metallic systems with large Fermi surfaces remain largely unexplored. Using GPU-accelerated large-scale ab-initio quantum transport simulations, we investigate spin transport in two distinct platforms: twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ (semiconductor, from lightly to heavily doping) and NbX$_2$ ($X$ = S, Se; metals). In twisted MoTe$_2$, the spin Hall conductivity (SHC) evolves from $4\tfrac{e}{4\pi}$ at $5.09^\circ$ to $10\tfrac{e}{4\pi}$ at $1.89^\circ$, driven by the emergence of multiple isolated Chern bands. Remarkably, in heavily doped metallic regimes--without isolated Chern bands--we observe a universal amplification of the spin Hall effect from Fermi surface reconstruction under long-wavelength potential, with the peak SHC tripling from $6\tfrac{e}{4\pi}$ at $5.09^\circ$ to $17\tfrac{e}{4\pi}$ at $3.89^\circ$. For prototypical moir\'e metals like twisted NbX$_2$, we identify a record SHC of $-17\tfrac{e}{4\pi}$ (-5200 $(\hbar / e)S/cm$ in 3D units), surpassing all known bulk materials. These results establish moir\'e engineering as a powerful strategy for enhancing spin-dependent transport, and advancing ab-initio methodologies to bridge atomic-scale precision with device-scale predictions in transport simulations.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Horizons and Thermalization in an Atomic Chain and its Relation to Quantum Hall Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the sine model, a one-dimensional tight-binding Hamiltonian featuring hoppings with a sinusoidal dependence on position, and demonstrate the formation of synthetic horizons where electronic wave packets exhibit exponential slowdown. Interestingly, employing the exact transformation between this model and the Harper equation, which describes the eigenstates of a square lattice tight-binding model subjected to a perpendicular magnetic field, we find that analogous semi-classical horizons can emerge in a quantum Hall setup at half-filling for specific values of the magnetic flux. Furthermore, by applying sudden quenches to the sine model's hopping profile, we observe the emergence of thermal states characterized by an Unruh temperature. Our numerical calculations of this temperature reveal a non-universal behavior, suggesting the involvement of physical mechanisms beyond a simple low-energy description.</description>

      <title>Nanosecond Ferroelectric Switching of Intralayer Excitons in Bilayer 3R-MoS2 through Coulomb Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-speed, non-volatile tunability is critical for advancing reconfigurable photonic devices used in neuromorphic information processing, sensing, and communication. Despite significant progress in developing phase change and ferroelectric materials, achieving highly efficient, reversible, rapid switching of optical properties has remained a challenge. Recently, sliding ferroelectricity has been discovered in 2D semiconductors, which also host strong excitonic effects. Here, we demonstrate that these materials enable nanosecond ferroelectric switching in the complex refractive index, largely impacting their linear optical responses. The maximum index modulation reaches about 4, resulting in a relative reflectance change exceeding 85%. Both on and off switching occurs within 2.5 nanoseconds, with switching energy at femtojoule levels. The switching mechanism is driven by tuning the excitonic peak splitting of a rhombohedral molybdenum disulfide bilayer in an engineered Coulomb screening environment. This new switching mechanism establishes a new direction for developing high-speed, non-volatile optical memories and highly efficient, compact reconfigurable photonic devices. Additionally, the demonstrated imaging technique offers a rapid method to characterize domains and domain walls in 2D semiconductors with rhombohedral stacking.</description>

      <title>Topological properties of curved spacetime Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, a prime example of a one-dimensional topologically nontrivial insulator, has been extensively studied in flat space-time. In recent times, many studies have been conducted to understand the properties of the low-dimensional quantum matter in curved spacetime, which can mimic the gravitational event horizon and black hole physics. However, the impact of curved spacetime on the topological properties of such systems remains unexplored. Here, we investigate the curved spacetime (CST) version of the SSH model by introducing a position-dependent hopping parameter. We show, using different topological markers, that the CST-SSH model can undergo a topological phase transition. We find that the topologically non-trivial phase can host zero-energy edge modes, but those edge modes are asymmetric, unlike the usual SSH model. Moreover, we find that at the topological transition point, a critical slowdown takes place for zero-energy wave packets near the boundary, indicating the presence of a horizon, and interestingly, if one moves even a slight distance away from the transition point, wave packets start bouncing back and reverse the direction before reaching the horizon. A semiclassical description of the wave packet trajectories also supports these results.</description>

      <title>Nonlinearity-induced corner states in a kagome lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinearity provides a powerful mechanism for controlling energy localization in structured dynamical systems. In this study, we investigate the emergence of nonlinearity-induced energy localization at the corners of a kagome lattice model featuring onsite cubic nonlinearity. Employing quench dynamics simulations and nonlinear continuation methods, we analyze the temporal and spectral characteristics of localized states under strong nonlinearity. Our results demonstrate the formation of stable, localized corner states, strikingly, even within the parameter regime corresponding to the topologically trivial phase of the underlying linear system, which normally lacks such boundary modes. Furthermore, we identify distinct families of nonlinearity-induced corner states residing within the semi-infinite spectral gap above the bulk bands in both the trivial and nontrivial phases. Stability analysis and nonlinear continuation reveal they are intrinsic nonlinear solutions, fundamentally distinct from perturbations of linear topological or bulk states. These findings elucidate a robust mechanism for generating localized states via nonlinearity, independent of linear topological protection, and provide answers to fundamental questions about the nature of nonlinear topological phenomena. The ability to create tunable, localized states in various spectral regions offers potential applications in energy harvesting, wave manipulation, and advanced signal processing.</description>

      <title>Microscopic theory of the inverse Faraday effect in a multiorbital model: Role of orbital magnetic moment and electric dipole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the inverse Faraday effect (IFE), a phenomenon where circularly-polarized light induces a magnetic moment, in a multiorbital metallic system. We demonstrate that the total magnetic moment can be decomposed into several contributions in multiorbital tight-binding models. In particular, we reveal that the electric dipole moment of Wannier orbitals also contributes to the orbital magnetic moment, which is not included in the conventional expression for the orbital magnetic moment in lattice systems. To account for all possible contributions, we adopt an $s$-$p$ tight-binding system as a minimal model for the IFE. Using an analytical approach based on the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, we clarify the physical origins of these contributions. Additionally, we quantitatively evaluate each contribution on an equal footing through a numerical approach based on the Floquet formalism. Our results reveal that the orbital magnetic moment exhibits a significantly larger response compared to the spin magnetic moment, with all contributions to the orbital magnetic moment being comparable in magnitude. These findings highlight the essential role of orbital degrees of freedom in the IFE.</description>

      <title>Impact of unidirectional magnetoresistance on spin-orbit torque analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The second-harmonic Hall technique is a widely used, sensitive method for studying the spin-orbit torques generated by charge current. It exploits the dependence of the Hall resistance on the magnetization direction, although thermal phenomena also contribute. Historically, deviations from the expected magnetic field dependence have usually been neglected. Based on our studies on permalloy/platinum bilayers, we show that a unidirectional magnetoresistance - known to appear in the second-harmonic longitudinal resistance - also appears in the Hall data, and that describing the results in a wide field range with these contributions is essential to accurately estimate the torques.</description>

      <title>Emergent topological phases and coexistence of gapless and spectral-localized Floquet quantum spin Hall states via electron-phonon interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, a thorough exploration has been carried out to unravel the role of electron-phonon interaction (EPI) in a Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang (BHZ) quantum spin Hall (QSH) insulator subjected to a time-periodic step drive. It is observed that upon inclusion of the EPI, the system demonstrates emergent Floquet QSH (FQSH) phases and several topological phase transitions therein, mediated solely by the interaction strength. Quite intriguingly, the emergence of topological zero ($\pi$) modes in the bulk that remains otherwise gapless in the vicinity of the $\pi$ (zero) energy sector is observed, thus serving as a prime candidate of robust topology in gapless systems. With other invariants being found to be deficient in characterizing such coexistent phases, a spectral localizer (SL) is employed, which distinctly ascertains the nature of the (zero or $\pi$) edge modes. Following the SL prescription, a real-space Chern marker computed by us further provides support to such \textit{gapless} Floquet topological scenario. Our results can be realized in advanced optical setups that may underscore the importance of EPI-induced Floquet features.</description>

      <title>Emergent Kagome lattice and non-Abelian lattice gauge field of biexcitons in t-MoTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Abelian gauge fields, characterized by their non-commutative symmetry groups, shape physical laws from the Standard Model to emergent topological matter for quantum computation. Here we find that moir\'e exciton dimers (biexcitons) in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ are governed by a genuine non-Abelian lattice gauge field. These dipolar-bound exciton dimers, formed on bonds of the honeycomb moir\'e superlattice, exhibit three quadrupole configurations organized into a Kagome lattice geometry, on which the valley-flip biexciton hoppings through electron-hole Coulomb exchange act as link variables of the non-Abelian lattice gauge theory. The emergence of gauge structure here is a new possibility for composite particles, where the moir\'e electronic structure and interactions between the electron and hole constituents jointly enforce the underlying geometric constraint. The quadrupole nature of biexciton further makes possible local gate controls to isolate designated pathways from the extended lattice for exploiting consequences of non-commutative gauge structure including the genuine non-Abelian Aharonov-Bohm effect. This also provides a new approach for quantum manipulation of excitonic valley qubit. We show path interference on a simplest loop can deterministically transform the computational basis states into Bell states.</description>

      <title>Tunable Inter-Edge Interactions in a Bilayer Graphene Quantum Hall Antidot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic interferometers in the quantum Hall regime are one of the best tools to study the statistical properties of localized quasiparticles in the topologically protected bulk. However, since their behavior is probed via chiral edge modes, bulk-to-edge and inter-edge interactions are two important effects that affect the observations. Moreover, almost all kinds of interferometers heavily rely on a pair of high-quality quantum point contacts where the presence of impurities significantly modifies the behavior of such constrictions, which in turn can alter the outcome of the measurements. Antidots, potential hills in the quantum Hall regime, are particularly valuable in this context, as they overcome the geometric limitations of conventional geometries and act as controlled impurities within a quantum point contact. Furthermore, antidots allow for quasiparticle charge detection through simple conductance measurements, replacing the need for complex techniques such as shot noise. Here, we use a gate-defined bilayer graphene antidot, operated in the Coulomb-dominated regime. By varying the antidot potential, we can tune inter-edge interactions, enabling a crossover from a single-dot to a double-dot behavior. In the latter, strong coupling between the two edge states leads to edge-state pairing, resulting in a measured doubling of the tunneling charge. We find that in certain regimes, the inter-edge coupling completely dominates over other energy scales of the system, overshadowing the interference effects these devices are mainly designed to probe. These results highlight the significant role of inter-edge interactions and establish antidots as a versatile platform for exploring quantum Hall interferometry.</description>

      <title>Phase locking of ring-shaped exciton-polariton condensates to coherent optical drive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effect of an additional quasi-resonant drive on the dynamics of the ring-shaped incoherently pumped polariton condensates carrying angular momentum (vorticity) is studied theoretically. Numerical simulations of the 2D and 1D Gross-Pitaevskii equations show that the difference of the topological charges(vorticities) $\Delta n$ of the condensate and the quasi-resonant coherent drive plays a crucial role in the synchronization dynamics. It is shown that in an axially symmetric system, synchronization can only occur if $|\Delta n| = 0$, whereas in the other cases the phase of the condensate cannot be locked to the phase of the coherent drive. To explain this effect observed in the numerical simulations a perturbation theory is developed. The theory shows that the phase slip between the condensate and the coherent drive can be understood in terms of the motion of 2$\pi$ kinks. It is shown that the breaking of the axial symmetry can stop the motion of the kinks, allowing the phase locking of the condensate to the coherent drive.</description>

      <title>Rotating effects on the Hall conductivity in a quantum dot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of the quantized Hall conductivity in a two-dimensional quantum system under rotating effects, a uniform magnetic field, and an Aharonov-Bohm (AB) flux tube. By varying the angular velocity and the AB flux, we analyze their impact on the formation, shifting, and structure of quantized Hall plateaus. Our results reveal that rotation modifies the energy spectrum, leading to slight shifts in the plateau positions and variations in their widths. Additionally, we identify Aharonov-Bohm-type oscillations in $\sigma_{\text{Hall}}$, which become more pronounced for lower values of the cyclotron frequency $\omega_c$, indicating enhanced quantum interference effects in the low-field regime. These oscillations are further modulated by $\Omega$, affecting their periodicity and amplitude. The interplay between the confinement frequency $\omega_0$, the cyclotron frequency $\omega_c$, and the rotational effects plays a crucial role in determining the overall behavior of $\sigma_{\text{Hall}}$. Our findings provide insights into the interplay between rotation, magnetic field, and quantum interference effects, which are relevant for experimental investigations of quantum Hall systems in rotating systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the successful simulation of $\sqrt{Z}$-, $\sqrt{X}$- and $X$-quantum gates using Majorana zero modes (MZMs) that emerge in magnetic vortices located in topological superconductors. We compute the transition probabilities and geometric phase differences accounting for the full many-body dynamics and show that qubit states can be read out by fusing the vortex core MZMs and measuring the resulting charge density. We visualize the gate processes using the time- and energy-dependent non-equilibrium local density of states. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of employing vortex core MZMs for the realization of fault-tolerant topological quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Wavefunctions and oscillator strengths of Rydberg excitons in cuprous oxide quantum wells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the eigenstates, that is, the wavefunctions of Rydberg excitons in cuprous oxide quantum wells and derive expressions relating them to the oscillator strengths of different exciton states. Using the B-spline expansion, we compute the wavefunctions in coordinate space and estimate the oscillator strengths. The symmetry properties of the states and the non-separability of the wavefunctions are illustrated. Wavefunctions associated with resonances above the scattering threshold, in particular those of bound states in the continuum as well as their partner states, are also given.</description>

      <title>Boundary Witten effect in multi-axion insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore novel topological responses and axion-like phenomena in three-dimensional insulating systems with spacetime-dependent mass terms encoding domain walls. Via a dimensional-reduction approach, we derive a new axion-electromagnetic coupling term involving three axion fields. This term yields a topological current in the bulk and, under specific conditions of the axions, real-space topological defects such as magnetic-like monopoles and hopfions. Moreover, once one the axions acquires a constant value, a nontrivial boundary theory realizes a (2+1)-dimensional analog of the Witten effect, which shows that point-like vortices on the gapped boundary of the system acquire half-integer electric charge. Our findings reveal rich topological structures emerging from multi-axion theories, suggesting new avenues in the study of topological phases and defects.</description>

      <title>Normal state quantum geometry, non-locality and superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate aspects of the relation between the quantum geometry of the normal state (NS) and the superconducting phase, through the lens of non-locality. By relating band theory to quantum estimation theory, we derive a direct momentum-dependent relation between quantum geometry and the quantum fluctuations of the position operator. We then investigate two effects of the NS quantum geometry on superconductivity. On the one hand, we present a physical interpretation of the conventional and geometric contributions to the superfluid weight in terms of two different movements of the normal state charge carriers forming the Cooper pairs. The first contribution stems from their center-of-mass motion while the second stems from their zero-point motion, thereby explaining its persistence in flat-band systems. On the other hand, we phenomenologically derive an emergent Darwin term driven by the NS quantum metric. We show its form in one and two-body problems, derive the effective pairing potential in $s$-wave superconductors, and explicit its form in the case of two-dimensional massive Dirac fermions. We thus show that the NS quantum metric screens the pairing interaction and weakens superconductivity, which could be tested experimentally by doping a superconductor. Our work reveals the ambivalent relationship between non-interacting quantum geometry and superconductivity, and possibly in other correlated phases.</description>

      <title>Terahertz field effect in a two-dimensional semiconductor MoS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Layered two-dimensional (2D) materials, with their atomic-scale thickness and tunable electronic, optical, and mechanical properties, open many promising pathways to significantly advance modern electronics. The field effect caused by a strong electric field, typically of MV/cm level, applied perpendicular to the material layers, is a highly effective method for controlling these properties. Field effect allows the regulation of the electron flow in transistor channels, improves the photodetector efficiency and spectral range, and facilitates the exploration of novel exotic quantum phenomena in 2D materials. However, existing approaches to induce the field effect in 2D materials utilize circuit-based electrical gating methods fundamentally limited to microwave response rates. Device-compatible ultrafast, sub-picosecond control needed for modern technology and basic science applications still remains a challenge. In this study, we demonstrate such an ultrafast field effect in atomically thin MoS2, an archetypal 2D semiconductor, embedded in a hybrid 3D-2D terahertz nanoantenna structure. This nanoantenna efficiently converts an incident terahertz electric field into the vertical ultrafast gating field in MoS2 while simultaneously enhancing it to the required MV/cm level. We observe the terahertz field effect optically as coherent terahertz-induced Stark shift of characteristic exciton resonances in MoS2. Our results enable novel developments in technology and the fundamental science of 2D materials, where the terahertz field effect is crucial.</description>

      <title>Spin-dependent Transport Studies of Fe/MoxCr1-xS2/Fe Magnetic Tunnel Junction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using Density functional theory and non-equilibrium Green's function formalism, spin-dependent electron transport in Fe/MoxCr1-xS2/Fe magnetic tunnel junction is studied. Spin-transport for different thicknesses (1, 3, 5, and 7 layers) of the spacer MoS2 and for two different surface orientations of the Fe electrode, the Fe(001) and Fe(111) surface and the effect of substitutional doping of magnetic impurity Cr on the spin-transport of the junctions is investigated. The electronic structure of the heterostructure shows presence of metal induced states in the semiconducting MoS2 at the Fe/MoS2 interface and the effect of the interface is limited to the first two layers of MoS2 from the interface. The I-V characteristics of the junctions for the monolayer and three-layer MoS2 spacer show linear behaviour due to the metallic nature of the junction. The tunneling nature of the junction is observed for the thicker junctions with five-layer and seven-layer spacers. With the introduction of magnetic impurity, we have shown that spin-polarisation in the spacer is improved, thus increasing the spin-polarised current. The Cr-defect states are observed below the conduction band and the Cr-doped devices are stable up to a bias of 0.5V. The close packed Fe(111) surface is better electrode material for tunneling of electrons through the junction compared to the Fe(001) surface due to lower surface energy and reduced transmission.</description>

      <title>Mumott -- a Python package for the analysis of multi-modal tensor tomography data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Small and wide angle x-ray scattering tensor tomography are powerful methods for studying anisotropic nanostructures in a volume-resolved manner, and are becoming increasingly available to users of synchrotron facilities. The analysis of such experiments requires, however, advanced procedures and algorithms, which creates a barrier for the wider adoption of these techniques. Here, in response to this challenge, we introduce the mumott package. It is written in Python with computationally demanding tasks handled via just-in-time compilation using both CPU and GPU resources. The package is being developed with a focus on usability and extensibility, while achieving a high computational efficiency. Following a short introduction to the common workflow, we review key features, outline the underlying object-oriented framework, and demonstrate the computational performance. By developing the mumott package and making it generally available, we hope to lower the threshold for the adoption of tensor tomography and to make these techniques accessible to a larger research community.</description>

      <title>Impact of a tunneling particle on the quantum state of a barrier: two-particle wave-packet model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the scattering of two distinguishable particles with unequal masses and a mutual short-range interaction with the aim of quantifying the impact of a tunneling ``projectile'' particle on the quantum mechanical state of the ``barrier'' particle. We find that the states of the barrier particle after the tunneling or reflection of the projectile are displaced by a finite distance that is given by the derivative of the phase of the transmission or reflection amplitudes multiplied by factors dependent on particles' masses, respectively. We demonstrate these results on a numerical example with a resonant interaction between a projectile and barrier. Our work demonstrates physical implication of the concept of phase time delay in the form of finite displacements of particles that are, in principle, experimentally measurable.</description>

      <title>Quantum sensing with spin defects in boron nitride nanotubes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin defects in semiconductors are widely investigated for various applications in quantum sensing. Conventional host materials such as diamond and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) provide bulk or low-dimensional platforms for optically addressable spin systems, but often lack the structural properties needed for chemical sensing. Here, we introduce a new class of quantum sensors based on naturally occurring spin defects in boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs), which combine high surface area with omnidirectional spin control, key features for enhanced sensing performance. First, we present strong evidence that these defects are carbon-related, akin to recently identified centers in hBN, and demonstrate coherent spin control over ensembles embedded within dense, microscale BNNTs networks. Using dynamical decoupling, we enhance spin coherence times by a factor exceeding 300x and implement high-resolution detection of radiofrequency signals. By integrating the BNNT mesh sensor into a microfluidic platform we demonstrate chemical sensing of paramagnetic ions in solution, with detectable concentrations reaching levels nearly 1000 times lower than previously demonstrated using comparable hBN-based systems. This highly porous and flexible architecture positions BNNTs as a powerful new host material for quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>Observation of Double Hysteresis in CoFe$_2$O$_4$/MnFe$_2$O$_4$ Core/Shell Nanoparticles and Its Contribution to AC Heat Induction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic core/shell nanoparticles are promising candidates for magnetic hyperthermia due to its high AC magnetic heat induction (specific loss power (SLP)). It's widely accepted that magnetic exchange-coupling between core and shell plays the crucial role in enhancing SLP of magnetic core/shell nanoparticles. However, the physical contribution of exchange coupling to SLP has not been systematically investigated, and the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In this study, magnetic hard/soft CoFe$_2$O$_4$/MnFe$_2$O$_4 and inverted soft/hard MnFe$_2$O$_4$/CoFe$_2$O$_4$ core/shell nanoparticles were synthesized, systematically varying the number of shell layers, to investigate the physical contribution of internal bias coupling at the core/shell interface to AC heat induction (SLP). Our results show that a unique magnetic property, double-hysteresis loop, was present and clearly observed, which was never reported in previous core/shell research literature. According to the experimentally and theoretically analyzed results, the double-hysteresis behavior in core/shell nanoparticles was caused by the difference in magnetic anisotropy between core and shell materials, separated by a non-magnetic interface. The enhanced SLP and maximum temperature rise (TAC,max) of core/shell nanoparticles are attributed to the optimized magnetic anisotropy, AC magnetic softness and double hysteresis behavior due to the internal bias coupling. These results demonstrate that the rational design capabilities to separately control the magnetic anisotropy, AC/DC magnetic properties by varying the volume ration between core and shell and by switching hard or soft phase materials between core and shell are effective modalities to enhance the AC heat induction of core/shell nanoparticles for magnetic nanoparticle hyperthermia.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13893v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The applications of nanomechanical resonators range from biomolecule mass sensing to hybrid quantum interfaces. Their performance is often limited by internal material damping, which can be greatly reduced by using crystalline materials. Crystalline silicon carbide is appealing due to its exquisite mechanical, electrical and optical properties, but has suffered from high internal damping due to material defects. Here we resolve this by developing nanomechanical resonators fabricated from bulk monocrystalline 4H-silicon carbide. This allows us to achieve damping as low as 2.7 mHz, more than an order-of-magnitude lower than any previous crystalline silicon carbide resonator and corresponding to a quality factor as high as 20 million at room temperature. The volumetric dissipation of our devices reaches the material limit for silicon carbide for the first time. This provides a path to greatly increase the performance of silicon carbide nanomechanical resonators.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field suppression of tomographic electron transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08102v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Degenerate two-dimensional electron liquids are theoretically established to possess two vastly distinct collisional electron mean free paths, where even-parity deformations of the Fermi surface are hydrodynamic with a short collisional mean free path but odd-parity deformations remain near ballistic (known as the "tomographic" transport regime). Predicted signatures of this regime rely on the scaling of observables with temperature or device dimension, both of which are difficult to establish with certainty. Here, we consider magnetotransport in a minimal model of tomographic electrons and show that even a small magnetic field suppresses tomographic transport signatures and thus acts as a sensitive and unique probe of this regime. Fundamentally, the magnetic field breaks time-reversal invariance, which is a prerequisite for the odd-even parity effect in the collisional relaxation. We analyze in detail the scaling of the transverse conductivity, which has been linked to small-channel conductance of interaction-dominated electrons, and show that a tomographic scaling regime at intermediate wave numbers is quickly suppressed with magnetic field to a hydrodynamic or collisionless form. We confirm that the suppression occurs at relatively small magnetic fields when the cyclotron radius is comparable to the ballistic mean free path of the dominant odd-parity mode. This occurs at a much smaller magnetic field than the magnetic field strength required to suppress hydrodynamic electron transport, which suggests an experimental protocol to extract the odd-parity mean free path.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00189v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many-body phenomena in quantum materials emerge from the interplay among a broad continuum of electronic states, and controlling these interactions is critical for engineering novel phases. One promising approach exploits fluctuations of the vacuum electromagnetic field confined within optical cavities to tailor electronic properties. Here, we demonstrate that cavity photons can mediate attractive interactions in a tunable van der Waals material and reorganize a continuum of electron-hole transitions into an exciton-like state. We introduce a broadband, sub-wavelength time-domain microscope that integrates exfoliated, dual-gated two-dimensional quantum materials into a terahertz cavity. This approach enables the first-ever measurement of the field-tunable bandgap of bilayer graphene at terahertz frequencies while revealing ultrastrong coupling with a vacuum Rabi frequency exceeding $\Omega_{Rabi}/\omega\approx 40\%$ of the bare photon energy. Crucially, we identify a novel cavity-induced resonance emerging from the interband continuum that resembles Coulomb-bound excitons and remains stable across a broad temperature range. By uniting longstanding theoretical predictions with advanced experimental techniques, our findings open new avenues for designing and probing unique light-matter states and realizing hybrid correlated phases in quantum materials.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the monitored quantum dynamics of Gaussian mixed states and derive the universal Fokker-Planck equations that govern the stochastic time evolution of entire density-matrix spectra, obtaining their exact solutions. From these equations, we reveal an even-odd effect in purification dynamics: whereas entropy exhibits exponential decay for an even number $N$ of complex fermions, algebraic decay with divergent purification time occurs for odd $N$ as a manifestation of dynamical criticality. Additionally, we identify the universal fluctuations of entropy in the chaotic regime, serving as a non-unitary counterpart of the universal conductance fluctuations in mesoscopic electronic transport phenomena. Furthermore, we elucidate and classify the universality classes of non-unitary quantum dynamics based on fundamental symmetry. We also validate the universality of these analytical results through extensive numerical simulations across different types of models.</description>

Abstract: The rise of non-magnetic topological semimetals, which provide a promising platform for observing and controlling various spin-orbit effects, has led to significant advancements in the field of topological spintronics. RhSi exists in two distinct polymorphs: cubic and orthorhombic crystal structures. The noncentrosymmetric B20 cubic structure has been extensively studied for hosting unconventional multifold fermions. In contrast, the orthorhombic structure, which crystallizes in the Pnma space group (No. 62), remains less explored and belongs to the family of topological Dirac semimetals. In this work, we investigate the structural, magnetic, and electrical properties of RhSi textured-epitaxial films grown on Si(111) substrates, which crystallize in the orthorhombic structure. We investigate the efficiency of pure spin current transport across RhSi/permalloy interfaces and the subsequent spin-to-charge current conversion via inverse spin Hall effect measurements. The xperimentally determined spin Hall conductivity in orthorhombic RhSi reaches a maximum value of 126 ($\hbar$/e)($\Omega$.cm)$^{-1}$ at 10 K, which aligns reasonably well with first-principles calculations that attribute the spin Hall effect in RhSi to the spin Berry curvature mechanism. Additionally, we demonstrate the ability to achieve a sizable spin-mixing conductance (34.7 nm$^{-2}$) and an exceptionally high interfacial spin transparency of 88$%$ in this heterostructure, underlining its potential for spin-orbit torque switching applications. Overall, this study broadens the scope of topological spintronics, emphasizing the controlled interfacial spin-transport processes and subsequent spin-to-charge conversion in a previously unexplored topological Dirac semimetal RhSi/ferromagnet heterostructure.</description>

      <title>High-field Breakdown and Thermal Characterization of Indium Tin Oxide Transistors</title>

Abstract: Amorphous oxide semiconductors are gaining interest for logic and memory transistors compatible with low-temperature fabrication. However, their low thermal conductivity and heterogeneous interfaces suggest that their performance may be severely limited by self-heating, especially at higher power and device densities. Here, we investigate the high-field breakdown of ultrathin (~4 nm) amorphous indium tin oxide (ITO) transistors with scanning thermal microscopy (SThM) and multiphysics simulations. The ITO devices break irreversibly at channel temperatures of ~180 {\deg}C and ~340 {\deg}C on SiO${_2}$ and HfO${_2}$ substrates, respectively, with failure primarily caused by thermally-induced compressive strain near the device contacts. Combining SThM measurements with simulations allows us to estimate a thermal boundary conductance (TBC) of 35 ${\pm}$ 12 MWm${^-}$${^2}$K${^-}$${^1}$ for ITO on SiO${_2}$, and 51 ${\pm}$ 14 MWm${^-}$${^2}$K${^-}$${^1}$ for ITO on HfO${_2}$. The latter also enables significantly higher breakdown power due to better heat dissipation and closer thermal expansion matching. These findings provide insights into the thermo-mechanical limitations of indium-based amorphous oxide transistors, which are important for more reliable and high-performance logic and memory applications.</description>

      <title>Mapping molecular polariton transport via pump-probe microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate how the transport properties of molecular polaritons in optical cavities can be extracted from a microscopic modeling of pump-probe spectroscopy. Our approach combines a mean-field treatment of the light-matter Hamiltonian with a perturbative expansion of both light and matter components, along with spatial coarse-graining. This approach extends semiclassical cavity spectroscopy to multimode light-matter interactions, providing full access to spatially resolved transient spectra. By simulating a microscopy experiment with counter-propagating pump and probe pulses, we compute the differential transmission and show how molecular dephasing and persistent dark exciton populations drive sub-group-velocity transport of the root-mean-square displacement. We analyze transport across the polariton dispersion, showing how velocity renormalization correlates with excitonic weight, consistent with experimental observations, and further its dependence on the rate of molecular dephasing. Our results highlight the need to consider measured spectroscopic observables when characterizing transport in polaritonic systems.</description>

      <title>Full Crystallographic Imaging of Hexagonal Boron Nitride Monolayers with Phonon-Enhanced Sum-Frequency Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15939v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is an important 2D material for van der Waals heterostructures, single photon emitters, and infrared nanophotonics. The optical characterization of mono- and few-layer samples of hBN however remains a challenge as the material is almost invisible optically. Here we introduce phase-resolved sum-frequency microscopy as a technique for imaging monolayers of hBN grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and visualize their crystal orientation. A combination of femtosecond mid-infrared (IR) and visible laser pulses is used for sum-frequency generation (SFG), which is imaged in a wide-field optical microscope. The IR laser resonantly excites a phonon of hBN that leads to an ~800-fold enhancement of the SFG intensity, making it possible to image large 100x100 {\mu}m2 sample areas in less than 1 s. Implementing heterodyne detection in combination with azimuthal rotation of the sample further provides full crystallographic information. Through combined knowledge of topography and crystal orientation, we find that triangular domains of CVD-grown monolayer hBN have nitrogen-terminated zigzag edges. Overall, SFG microscopy can be used as an ultra-sensitive tool to image crystal structure, strain, stacking sequences, and twist angles, and is applicable to the wide range of van der Waals structures, where location and identification of monolayer regions and interfaces with broken inversion symmetry is of paramount importance.</description>
