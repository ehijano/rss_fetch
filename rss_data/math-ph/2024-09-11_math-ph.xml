      <title>Derived algebraic geometry of 2d lattice Yang-Mills theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A derived algebraic geometric study of classical $\mathrm{GL}_n$-Yang-Mills theory on the $2$-dimensional square lattice $\mathbb{Z}^2$ is presented. The derived critical locus of the Wilson action is described and its local data supported in rectangular subsets $V =[a,b]\times [c,d]\subseteq \mathbb{Z}^2$ with both sides of length $\geq 2$ is extracted. A locally constant dg-category-valued prefactorization algebra on $\mathbb{Z}^2$ is constructed from the dg-categories of perfect complexes on the derived stacks of local data.</description>

      <title>The spectral $\zeta$-function for quasi-regular Sturm--Liouville operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we analyze the spectral $\zeta$-function associated with the self-adjoint extensions, $T_{A,B}$, of quasi-regular Sturm--Liouville operators that are bounded from below. By utilizing the Green's function formalism, we find the characteristic function which implicitly provides the eigenvalues associated with a given self-adjoint extension $T_{A,B}$. The characteristic function is then employed to construct a contour integral representation for the spectral $\zeta$-function of $T_{A,B}$. By assuming a general form for the asymptotic expansion of the characteristic function, we describe the analytic continuation of the $\zeta$-function to a larger region of the complex plane. We also present a method for computing the value of the spectral $\zeta$-function of $T_{A,B}$ at all positive integers. We provide two examples to illustrate the methods developed in the paper: the generalized Bessel and Legendre operators. We show that in the case of the generalized Bessel operator, the spectral $\zeta$-function develops a branch point at the origin, while in the case of the Legendre operator it presents, more remarkably, branch points at every nonpositive integer value of $s$.</description>

      <title>Basics of Multiple Polyexponential Integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a set of special functions called multiple polyexponential integrals, defined as iterated integrals of the exponential integral $\text{Ei}(z)$. These functions arise in certain perturbative expansions of the local solutions of second-order ODEs around an irregular singularity. In particular, their recursive definition describes the asymptotic behavior of these local solutions. To complement the study of the multiple polyexponential integrals on the entire complex plane, we relate them with two other sets of special functions - the undressed and dressed multiple polyexponential functions - which are characterized by their Taylor series expansions around the origin.</description>

      <title>Symmetry generators and quantum numbers for fermionic circularly symmetric motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The planar dynamics of spin-1/2 quantum relativistic particles is important for several physical systems. In this paper we derive, by a simple method, the generators for the continuous symmetries of the 3+1 Dirac equation for planar motion, when there is circular symmetry, i.e., the interactions depend only on the radial coordinate. We consider a general set of potentials with different Lorentz structures. These generators allow for several minimal complete sets of commuting observables and their corresponding quantum numbers. We show how they can be used to label the general eigenspinors for this problem. We also derive the generators of the spin and pseudospin symmetries for this planar Dirac problem, which arise when the vector and scalar potentials have the same magnitude and tensor potential and the space components of the four-vector potential are absent. We investigate the associated energy degeneracies and compare them to the known degeneracies in the spherically symmetric 3+1 Dirac equation.</description>

      <title>Current fluctuations in the Dyson Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study large fluctuations of the current in a Dyson gas, a 1D system of particles interacting through a logarithmic potential and subjected to random noise. We adapt the macroscopic fluctuation theory to the Dyson gas and derive two coupled partial differential equations describing the evolution of the density and momentum. These equations are nonlinear and non-local, and the `boundary' conditions are mixed: some at the initial time and others at the final time. If the initial condition can fluctuate (annealed setting), this boundary-value problem is tractable. We compute the cumulant generating function encoding all the cumulants of the current.</description>

      <title>Quasi-potential and drift decomposition in stochastic systems by sparse identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quasi-potential is a key concept in stochastic systems as it accounts for the long-term behavior of the dynamics of such systems. It also allows us to estimate mean exit times from the attractors of the system, and transition rates between states. This is of significance in many applications across various areas such as physics, biology, ecology, and economy. Computation of the quasi-potential is often obtained via a functional minimization problem that can be challenging. This paper combines a sparse learning technique with action minimization methods in order to: (i) Identify the orthogonal decomposition of the deterministic vector field (drift) driving the stochastic dynamics; (ii) Determine the quasi-potential from this decomposition. This decomposition of the drift vector field into its gradient and orthogonal parts is accomplished with the help of a machine learning-based sparse identification technique. Specifically, the so-called sparse identification of non-linear dynamics (SINDy) [1] is applied to the most likely trajectory in a stochastic system (instanton) to learn the orthogonal decomposition of the drift. Consequently, the quasi-potential can be evaluated even at points outside the instanton path, allowing our method to provide the complete quasi-potential landscape from this single trajectory. Additionally, the orthogonal drift component obtained within our framework is important as a correction to the exponential decay of transition rates and exit times. We implemented the proposed approach in 2- and 3-D systems, covering various types of potential landscapes and attractors.</description>

      <title>Deep-water and shallow-water limits of statistical equilibria for the intermediate long wave equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the construction of invariant measures associated with higher order conservation laws of the intermediate long wave equation (ILW) and their convergence properties in the deep-water and shallow-water limits. By exploiting its complete integrability, we first carry out detailed analysis on the construction of appropriate conservation laws of ILW at the $H^\frac k2$-level for each $k \in \mathbb{N}$, and establish their convergence to those of the Benjamin-Ono equation (BO) in the deep-water limit and to those of the Korteweg-de Vries equation (KdV) in the shallow-water limit. In particular, in the shallow-water limit, we prove rather striking 2-to-1 collapse of the conservation laws of ILW to those of KdV. Such 2-to-1 collapse is novel in the literature and, to our knowledge, this is the first construction of a complete family of shallow-water conservation laws with non-trivial shallow-water limits. We then construct an infinite sequence of generalized Gibbs measures for ILW associated with these conservation laws and prove their convergence to the corresponding (invariant) generalized Gibbs measures for BO and KdV in the respective limits. Finally, for $k \ge 3$, we establish invariance of these measures under ILW dynamics, and also convergence in the respective limits of the ILW dynamics at each equilibrium state to the corresponding invariant dynamics for BO and KdV constructed by Deng, Tzvetkov, and Visciglia (2010-2015) and Zhidkov (1996), respectively. In particular, in the shallow-water limit, we establish 2-to-1 collapse at the level of the generalized Gibbs measures as well as the invariant ILW dynamics. As a byproduct of our analysis, we also prove invariance of the generalized Gibbs measure associated with the $H^2$-conservation law of KdV, which seems to be missing in the literature.</description>

      <title>Gelation in Vector Multiplicative Coalescence and Extinction in Multi-Type Poisson Branching Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random coalescent processes and branching processes are two fundamental constructs in the field of stochastic processes, each with a rich history and a wide range of applications. Though developed within distinct contexts, in this note we present a novel connection between a multi-type (vector) multiplicative coalescent process and a multi-type branching process with Poisson offspring distributions. More specifically, we show that the equations that govern the phenomenon of gelation in the vector multiplicative coalescent process are equivalent to the set of equations that yield the extinction probabilities of the corresponding multi-type Poisson branching process. We then leverage this connection with two applications, one in each direction. The first is a new quick proof of gelation in the vector multiplicative coalescent process using a well known result of branching processes, and the second is a new series expression for the extinction probabilities of the multi-type Poisson branching process using results derived from the theory of vector multiplicative coalescence. While the correspondence is fairly straightforward, it illuminates a deep connection between these two paradigms which we hope will continue to reveal new insights and potential for cross-disciplinary research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider mid-spectrum eigenstates of the Sachdev-Ye-Kiteav (SYK) model. We prove that for subsystems whose size is a constant fraction of the system size, the entanglement entropy deviates from the maximum entropy by at least a positive constant. This result highlights the difference between the entanglement entropy of mid-spectrum eigenstates of the SYK model and that of random states.</description>

      <title>Implementation of thermal conduction energy transfer models in the Bifrost Solar atmosphere MHD code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context: Thermal conductivity provides important contributions to the energy evolution of the upper solar atmosphere, behaving as a non-linear concentration-dependent diffusion equation. Recently, different methods have been offered as best-fit solutions to these problems in specific situations, but their effectiveness and limitations are rarely discussed. Aims. We rigorously test the different implementations of solving the conductivity flux, in the massively-parallel magnetohydrodynamics code, Bifrost, with the aim of specifying the best scenarios for the use of each method. Methods: We compare the differences and limitations of explicit versus implicit methods, and analyse the convergence of a hyperbolic approximation. Among the tests, we use a newly derived 1st-order self-similar approximation to compare the efficacy of each method analytically in a 1D pure-thermal test scenario. Results: We find that although the hyperbolic approximation proves the most accurate and the fastest to compute in long-running simulations, there is no optimal method to calculate the mid-term conductivity with both accuracy and efficiency. We also find that the solution of this approximation is sensitive to the initial conditions, and can lead to faster convergence if used correctly. Hyper-diffusivity is particularly useful in aiding the methods to perform optimally. Conclusions: We discuss recommendations for the use of each method within more complex simulations, whilst acknowledging the areas of opportunity for new methods to be developed.</description>

      <title>Homogenisation for Maxwell and Friends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We refine the understanding of continuous dependence on coefficients of solution operators under the nonlocal $H$-topology viz Schur topology in the setting of evolutionary equations in the sense of Picard. We show that certain components of the solution operators converge strongly. The weak convergence behaviour known from homogenisation problems for ordinary differential equations is recovered on the other solution operator components. The results are underpinned by a rich class of examples that, in turn, are also treated numerically, suggesting a certain sharpness of the theoretical findings. Analytic treatment of an example that proves this sharpness is provided too. Even though all the considered examples contain local coefficients, the main theorems and structural insights are of operator-theoretic nature and, thus, also applicable to nonlocal coefficients. The main advantage of the problem class considered is that they contain mixtures of type, potentially highly oscillating between different types of PDEs; a prototype can be found in Maxwell's equations highly oscillating between the classical equations and corresponding eddy current approximations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We leverage quantum graph theory to quickly and accurately characterise acoustic metamaterials comprising networks of interconnected pipes. Anisotropic bond lengths are incorporated in the model that correspond to space-coiled acoustic structures to exhibit dispersion spectra reminiscent of hyperbolic metamaterials. We construct two metasurfaces with embedded graph structure and, motivated by the graph theory, infer and fine-tune their dispersive properties to engineer non-resonant negative refraction of acoustic surface waves at their interface. Agreement between the graph model, full wave simulations, and experiments bolsters quantum graph theory as a new paradigm for metamaterial design.</description>

      <title>Algebraic classification of the gravitational field in general metric-affine geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the algebraic classification of the gravitational field in four-dimensional general metric-affine geometries, thus extending the current results of the literature in the particular framework of Weyl-Cartan geometry by the presence of the traceless nonmetricity tensor. This quantity switches on four of the eleven fundamental parts of the irreducible representation of the curvature tensor under the pseudo-orthogonal group, in such a way that three of them present similar algebraic types as the ones obtained in Weyl-Cartan geometry, whereas the remaining one includes thirty independent components and gives rise to a new algebraic classification. The latter is derived by means of its principal null directions and their levels of alignment, obtaining a total number of sixteen main algebraic types, which can be split into many subtypes. As an immediate application, we determine the algebraic types of the broadest family of static and spherically symmetric black hole solutions with spin, dilation and shear charges in Metric-Affine Gravity.</description>

      <title>Discrete Euler-Bernoulli Beam Lattices with Beyond Nearest Connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The propagation of elastic waves on discrete periodic Euler-Bernoulli mass-beam lattices is characterised by the competition between coupled translational and rotational degrees-of-freedom at the mass-beam junctions. We influence the dynamics of this system by coupling junctions with beyond-nearest-neighbour spatial connections, affording freedom over the locality of dispersion extrema in reciprocal space, facilitating the emergence of interesting dispersion relations. A generalised dispersion relation for an infinite monatomic mass-beam chain, with any integer order combination of non-local spatial connections, is presented. We demonstrate that competing power channels, between mass and rotational inertia, drive the position and existence of zero group velocity modes within the first Brillouin zone.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate existence of topologically nontrivial energy minimizing maps of a given positive degree from bounded domains in the plane to $\mathbb S^2$ in a variational model describing magnetizations in ultrathin ferromagnetic films with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Our strategy is to insert tiny truncated Belavin-Polyakov profiles in carefully chosen locations of lower degree objects such that the total energy increase lies strictly below the expected Dirichlet energy contribution, ruling out loss of degree in the limits of minimizing sequences. The argument requires that the domain be either sufficiently large or sufficiently slender to accommodate a prescribed degree. We also show that these higher degree minimizers concentrate on point-like skyrmionic configurations in a suitable parameter regime.</description>

      <title>Quantum Reference Frames on Homogeneous Spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper initiates a systematic study of operators arising as integrals of operator-valued functions with respect to positive operator-valued measures and utilizes these tools to provide relativization maps (Yen) for quantum reference frames (QRFs) defined on general homogeneous spaces. Properties of operator-valued integration are first studied and then employed to define general relativization maps and show their properties. The relativization maps presented here are defined for QRFs (systems of covariance) based on arbitrary homogeneous spaces of locally compact second countable topological groups and are shown to be contracting quantum channels, injective for localizable (norm-1 property) frames and multiplicative for the sharp ones (PVMs), extending the existing results.</description>

      <title>Rescaling transformations and the Grothendieck bound formalism in a single quantum system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Grothedieck bound formalism is studied using `rescaling transformations', in the context of a single quantum system. The rescaling transformations enlarge the set of unitary transformations (which apply to isolated systems), with transformations that change not only the phase but also the absolute value of the wavefunction, and can be linked to irreversible phenomena (e.g., quantum tunnelling, damping and amplification, etc). A special case of rescaling transformations are the dequantisation transformations, which map a Hilbert space formalism into a formalism of scalars. The Grothendieck formalism considers a `classical' quadratic form ${\cal C}(\theta)$ which takes values less than $1$, and the corresponding `quantum' quadratic form ${\cal Q}(\theta)$ which takes values greater than $1$, up to the complex Grothendieck constant $k_G$. It is shown that ${\cal Q}(\theta)$ can be expressed as the trace of the product of $\theta$ with two rescaling matrices, and ${\cal C}(\theta)$ can be expressed as the trace of the product of $\theta$ with two dequantisation matrices. Values of ${\cal Q}(\theta)$ in the `ultra-quantum' region $(1,k_G)$ are very important, because this region is classically forbidden (${\cal C}(\theta)$ cannot take values in it). An example with ${\cal Q}(\theta)\in (1,k_G)$ is given, which is related to phenomena where classically isolated by high potentials regions of space, communicate through quantum tunnelling. Other examples show that `ultra-quantumness' according to the Grothendieck formalism (${\cal Q}(\theta)\in (1,k_G)$), is different from quantumness according to other criteria (like quantum interference or the uncertainty principle).</description>

      <title>Constraining Genetic Symbolic Regression via Semantic Backpropagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evolutionary symbolic regression approaches are powerful tools that can approximate an explicit mapping between input features and observation for various problems. However, ensuring that explored expressions maintain consistency with domain-specific constraints remains a crucial challenge. While neural networks are able to employ additional information like conservation laws to achieve more appropriate and robust approximations, the potential remains unrealized within genetic algorithms. This disparity is rooted in the inherent discrete randomness of recombining and mutating to generate new mapping expressions, making it challenging to maintain and preserve inferred constraints or restrictions in the course of the exploration. To address this limitation, we propose an approach centered on semantic backpropagation incorporated into the Gene Expression Programming (GEP), which integrates domain-specific properties in a vector representation as corrective feedback during the evolutionary process. By creating backward rules akin to algorithmic differentiation and leveraging pre-computed subsolutions, the mechanism allows the enforcement of any constraint within an expression tree by determining the misalignment and propagating desired changes back. To illustrate the effectiveness of constraining GEP through semantic backpropagation, we take the constraint of physical dimension as an example. This framework is applied to discovering physical equations from the Feynman lectures. Results have shown not only an increased likelihood of recovering the original equation but also notable robustness in the presence of noisy data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new concept named shift system. This is a purely Lie algebraic setting to develop the geometric representation theory of Feigin-Tipunin construction. After reformulating the discussion in past works of the second author under this new setting, as an application, we extend almost all the main results of these works to the (multiplet) principal W-algebra at positive integer level associated with a simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ and Lie superalgebra $\mathfrak{osp}(1|2n)$, respectively. This paper also contains an appendix by Myungbo Shim on the relationship between Feigin-Tipunin construction and recent quantum field theories.</description>

      <title>Spin-charge separation for paired Dirac fermions in $(1+1)$ dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04700v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Dirac fermions at finite density coupled to a complex pairing field assumed to obey scalar field theory with quartic self-repulsion. The bulk of our work develops the mathematics that elucidates the propagation of fermionic excitations in such systems as independent spin (boosts) and charge (fermion number) degrees of freedom. A necessary ingredient is the presence of broken $U(1)$ symmetry in the pairing field and decoupling of its density and phase. In the fermion sector, these elements give rise to an emergent spin-dependent gauge coupling which binds in-vacuum spin and charge into elementary fermions, while driving proliferation of unbound spin and charge for finite condensation in the pairing field. Notably, the onset of spin-charge separation is signaled by $\mathcal{P} \mathcal{T}$-symmetry breaking and decoupling of spin components under Lorentz transformations. Our investigation concludes with two theorems that identify generic features of spin-charge separation in such systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: More then 35 approaches to the Dirac equation derivation are presented. The various physical principles and mathematical methods are used. A review of well-known and not enough known contributions to the problem is given, the unexpected and unconventional derivations are presented as well. Three original approaches to the problem suggested by the author are considered as well. They are (i) the generalization of H. Sallhofer derivation, (ii) the obtaining of the massless Dirac equation from the Maxwell equations in maximally symmetrical form, (iii) the derivation of the Dirac equation with nonzero mass from the relativistic canonical quantum mechanics of the fermion-antifermion spin s=1/2 doublet. Today we are able to demonstrate new features of our derivations given in original papers. In some sense the important role of the Dirac equation in contemporary theoretical physics is demonstrated. A criterion for the usefulness of one or another derivation of the Dirac equation has been established</description>

      <title>Probability Bracket Notation, Wick-Matsubara Relation, Density Operators, and Microscopic Probability Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:0909.1295v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following the Dirac vector bracket notation (VBN), we proposed the probability bracket notation (PBN) in our previous paper. We mentioned that under the special Wick rotation (imaginary time), a stationary Schrodinger equation in the Hilbert space transforms into the master equation of a microscopic probabilistic process (MPP) in the probability space. In this article, we first study the MPP of the system of a single particle, we show that the energy expectation of the MPP eventually approaches the lowest energy level in its initial condition and its von Neumann entropy finally vanishes. Then we explore the MPP for the quantum system of identical particles in the Fock space, we recover the expected occupation number of particles and the grand partition function in quantum statistics by connecting time with temperature (the Wick-Matsubara relation). We also reproduce the internal energy of an ideal gas in thermodynamics by using the relation. To address the entropy issue and relate the PBN with research topics of statistics in the literature, we express the density operators and the von Neumann entropy in the probability space by using the PBN. The Wick-Matsubara relation plus the PBN might provide a new way of microscopic probability modeling.</description>

      <title>On The large Time Asymptotics of Schr\"odinger type equations with General Data</title>

Abstract: For the Schr\"odinger equation with a general interaction term, which may be linear or nonlinear, time dependent and including charge transfer potentials, we prove the global solutions are asymptotically given by a free wave and a weakly localized part. The proof is based on constructing in a new way the Free Channel Wave Operator, and further tools from the recent works \cite{Liu-Sof1,Liu-Sof2,SW2020}. This work generalizes the results of the first part of \cite{Liu-Sof1,Liu-Sof2} to arbitrary dimension, and non-radial data.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic site percolation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.00981v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several results are presented for site percolation on quasi-transitive, planar graphs $G$ with one end, when properly embedded in either the Euclidean or hyperbolic plane. If $(G_1,G_2)$ is a matching pair derived from some quasi-transitive mosaic $M$, then $p_u(G_1)+p_c(G_2)=1$, where $p_c$ is the critical probability for the existence of an infinite cluster, and $p_u$ is the critical value for the existence of a unique such cluster. This fulfils and extends to the hyperbolic plane an observation of Sykes and Essam(1964), and it extends to quasi-transitive site models a theorem of Benjamini and Schramm (Theorem 3.8, J. Amer. Math. Soc. 14 (2001) 487--507) for transitive bond percolation.
  It follows that $p_u (G)+p_c (G_*)=p_u(G_*)+p_c(G)=1$, where $G_*$ denotes the matching graph of $G$. In particular, $p_u(G)+p_c(G)\ge 1$ and hence, when $G$ is amenable we have $p_c(G)=p_u(G) \ge \frac12$. When combined with the main result of the companion paper by the same authors ("Percolation critical probabilities of matching lattice-pairs", Random Struct. Alg. 2024), we obtain for transitive $G$ that the strict inequality $p_u(G)+p_c(G)&gt; 1$ holds if and only if $G$ is not a triangulation.
  A key technique is a method for expressing a planar site percolation process on a matching pair in terms of a dependent bond process on the corresponding dual pair of graphs. Amongst other things, the results reported here answer positively two conjectures of Benjamini and Schramm (Conjectures 7 and 8, Electron. Comm. Probab. 1 (1996) 71--82) in the case of quasi-transitive graphs.</description>

Abstract: Circular photon orbit and black hole shadow are significantly important issues in physics and astronomy, and a number of breakthroughs have been witnessed in recent years. Conventionally, the stable and unstable circular photon orbits are obtained using the effective potential of test particles moving in black hole spacetime. In this work, a pure geometric approach is developed to calculate these circular photon orbits and black hole shadow radius. Furthermore, it can be proved that our geometric approach is completely equivalent to the conventional approach based on effective potentials of test particles.</description>

      <title>On exceptional QP-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11093v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The connection between two recent descriptions of tensor hierarchies - namely, infinity-enhanced Leibniz algebroids, given by Bonezzi &amp; Hohm and Lavau &amp; Palmkvist, the p-brane QP-manifolds constructed by Arvanitakis - is made precise. This is done by presenting a duality-covariant version of latter.
  The construction is based on the QP-manifold $T^\star[n]T[1]M \times \mathcal{H}[n]$, where $M$ corresponds to the internal manifold of a supergravity compactification and $\mathcal{H}[n]$ to a degree-shifted version of the infinity-enhanced Leibniz algebroid. Imposing that the canonical Q-structure on $T^\star[n] T[1] M$ is the derivative operator on $\mathcal{H}$ leads to a set of constraints. Solutions to these constraints correspond to $\frac{1}{2}$-BPS p-branes, suggesting that this is a new incarnation of a brane scan. Reduction w.r.t. to these constraints reproduces the known p-brane QP-manifolds. This is shown explicitly for the SL(3)$\times$SL(2)- and SL(5)-theories.
  Furthermore, this setting is used to speculate about exceptional 'extended spaces' and QP-manifolds associated to Leibniz algebras. A proposal is made to realise differential graded manifolds associated to Leibniz algebras as non-Poisson subspaces (i.e. not Poisson reductions) of QP-manifolds similar to the above. Two examples for this proposal are discussed: generalised fluxes (including the dilaton flux) of O(d,d) and the 3-bracket flux for the SL(5)-theory.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we prove graded versions of the Darboux Theorem and Weinstein's Lagrangian tubular neighbourhood Theorem in order to study the deformation theory of Lagrangian $NQ$-submanifolds of degree $n$ symplectic $NQ$-manifolds. Using Weinstein's Lagrangian tubular neighbourhood Theorem, we attach to every Lagrangian $NQ$-submanifold an $L_\infty$-algebra, which controls its deformation theory. The main examples are coisotropic submanifolds of Poisson manifolds and (higher) Dirac structures with support in (higher) Courant algebroids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.13774v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Feynman's diagrammatic series is a common language for a formally exact theoretical description of systems of infinitely-many interacting quantum particles, as well as a foundation for precision computational techniques. Here we introduce a universal framework for efficient summation of connected or skeleton Feynman diagrams for generic quantum many-body systems. It is based on an explicit combinatorial construction of the sum of the integrands by dynamic programming, at a computational cost that can be made only exponential in the diagram order on a classical computer and potentially polynomial on a quantum computer. We illustrate the technique by an unbiased diagrammatic Monte Carlo calculation of the equation of state of the $2D$ $SU(N)$ Hubbard model in an experimentally relevant regime, which has remained challenging for state-of-the-art numerical methods.</description>

Abstract: New form of Fermat's principle for light propagation in arbitrary (i.e. in general neither static nor stationary) gravitational field is proposed. It is based on Herglotz extension of canonical formalism and simple relation between the dynamics described by the Lagrangians homogeneous in velocities and the reduced dynamics on lower-dimensional configuration manifold. This approach is more flexible as it allows to extend immediately the Fermat principle to the case of massive particles and to eliminate any space-time coordinate, not only $x^0$.</description>

      <title>Edge modes, extended TQFT, and measurement based quantum computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00605v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum teleportation can be used to define a notion of parallel transport which characterizes the entanglement structure of a quantum state \cite{Czech:2018kvg}. This suggests one can formulate a gauge theory of entanglement. In \cite{Wong:2022mnv}, it was explained that measurement based quantum computation in one dimension can be understood in term of such a gauge theory (MBQC). In this work, we give an alternative formulation of this "entanglement gauge theory" as an extended topological field theory. This formulation gives a alternative perspective on the relation between the circuit model and MBQC. In addition, it provides an interpretation of MBQC in terms of the extended Hilbert space construction in gauge theories, in which the entanglement edge modes play the role of the logical qubit.</description>

      <title>A heterotic integrable deformation of the principal chiral model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10149v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A novel classically integrable model is proposed. It is a deformation of the two-dimensional principal chiral model, embedded into a heterotic $\sigma$-model, by a particular heterotic gauge field. This is inspired by the bosonic part of the heterotic $\sigma$-model and its recent Hamiltonian formulation in terms of O$(d,d+n)$-generalised geometry by Hatsuda, Mori, Sasaki and Yata. Classical integrability is shown by construction of a Lax pair and a classical $\mathcal{R}$-matrix. Latter is almost of the canonical form with twist function and solves the classical Yang-Baxter equation.</description>

      <title>On the universal exceptional structure of world-volume theories in string and M-theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10269v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A universal structure of world-volume theories of half-BPS branes in string and M-theory in terms of exceptional generalised geometry is observed. Previous constructions are extended in two ways: from internal $d$-dimensional space to full 11- or 10-dimensional spacetimes, by coupling to the tensor hierarchy gauge fields, and from $E_{d(d)}$ with $d\leq 6$ to $E_{7(7)}$ and $E_{8(8)}$. This is done by a clarification of the role of the tensor hierarchy and its end in the context of brane world-volume theories. The exceptional structure of the gauged $\sigma$-model of the Kaluza-Klein monopole is provided as a new example.</description>

      <title>Boundary element methods for the magnetic field integral equation on polyhedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11071v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper provides a rigorous analysis of boundary element methods for the magnetic field integral equation on Lipschitz polyhedra. The magnetic field integral equation is widely used in practical applications to model electromagnetic scattering by a perfectly conducting body. The governing operator is shown to be coercive by means of the electric field integral operator with a purely imaginary wave number. Consequently, the continuous variational problem is uniquely solvable, given that the wave number does not belong to the spectrum of the interior Maxwell's problem. A Petrov-Galerkin discretization scheme is then introduced, employing Raviart-Thomas boundary elements for the solution space and Buffa-Christiansen boundary elements for the test space. Under a mild assumption depending only on the geometrical domain, the corresponding discrete inf-sup condition is proven, implying the unique solvability of the discrete problem. An asymptotically quasi-optimal error estimate for numerical solutions is established, and the convergence rate of the numerical scheme is examined. In addition, the resulting matrix system is shown to be well-conditioned regardless of the mesh refinement. Some numerical results are presented to support the theoretical analysis.</description>

      <title>Replica symmetry breaking in spin glasses in the replica-free Keldysh formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05842v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the algebra of Parisi ultrametric matrices is recovered by the real-time, replica-free, Dyson-Keldysh equations of infinite-range quantum spin glasses in the late time glassy limit. This connects to earlier results on classical and quantum systems showing how ultrametricity emerges from the persistent slow aging dynamics of the glass phase. The stationary spin glass state thereby spontaneously breaks thermal symmetry, or the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger relation of a state in global thermal equilibrium. We describe the Keldysh path integral of the infinite-range Ising model in transverse and longitudinal fields, and in the context of the Landau expansion of the action functional, show how the long-time limit connects to the full replica symmetry breaking obtained in the equilibrium formalism. We also illustrate our formalism by applying it to the spherical quantum $p$-spin model, which only exhibits one-step replica symmetry breaking</description>

      <title>Nonabelian Anyon Condensation in 2+1d topological orders: A String-Net Model Realization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05852v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a comprehensive framework for realizing anyon condensation of topological orders within the string-net model by constructing a Hamiltonian that bridges the parent string-net model before and the child string-net model after anyon condensation. Our approach classifies all possible types of bosonic anyon condensation in any parent string-net model and identifies the basic degrees of freedom in the corresponding child models. Compared with the traditional UMTC perspective of topological orders, our method offers a finer categorical description of anyon condensation at the microscopic level. We also explicitly represent relevant UMTC categorical entities characterizing anyon condensation through our model-based physical quantities, providing practical algorithms for calculating these categorical data.</description>
