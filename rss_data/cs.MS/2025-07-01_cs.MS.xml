      <title>The Distributed and Unified Numerics Environment (DUNE), Version 2.10</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Version 2.10 of the Distributed and Unified Numerics Environment DUNE introduces a range of enhancements across its core and extension modules, with a continued emphasis on modern C++ integration and improved usability. This release extends support for C++20 features, particularly concepts, through comprehensive refinements in dune-common and dune-grid, enabling safer and more expressive generic programming paradigms. A notable advancement is the improved support for curved geometries, including new geometry implementations and a more flexible interface. Data structures have been modernized through native support for std::mdspan and std::mdarray, performance improvements in sparse matrices, and tools for visualization of matrix patterns. The build system has been restructured towards a modern CMake workflow, emphasizing target-based configuration and improved automation. Furthermore, new local finite elements have been introduced to broaden numerical capabilities. The release also brings updates across DUNE extensions, as well as improvements to infrastructure and module-level components.</description>

      <title>Escher Tile Deformation via Closed-Form Solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a real-time deformation method for Escher tiles -- interlocking organic forms that seamlessly tessellate the plane following symmetry rules. We formulate the problem as determining a periodic displacement field. The goal is to deform Escher tiles without introducing gaps or overlaps. The resulting displacement field is obtained in closed form by an analytical solution. Our method processes tiles of 17 wallpaper groups across various representations such as images and meshes. Rather than treating tiles as mere boundaries, we consider them as textured shapes, ensuring that both the boundary and interior deform simultaneously. To enable fine-grained artistic input, our interactive tool features a user-controllable adaptive fall-off parameter, allowing precise adjustment of locality and supporting deformations with meaningful semantic control. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through various examples, including photo editing and shape sculpting, showing its use in applications such as fabrication and animation.</description>

      <title>Zero-disparity Distribution Synthesis: Fast Exact Calculation of Chi-Squared Statistic Distribution for Discrete Uniform Histograms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pearson's chi-squared test is widely used to assess the uniformity of discrete histograms, typically relying on a continuous chi-squared distribution to approximate the test statistic, since computing the exact distribution is computationally too costly. While effective in many cases, this approximation allegedly fails when expected bin counts are low or tail probabilities are needed. Here, Zero-disparity Distribution Synthesis is presented, a fast dynamic programming approach for computing the exact distribution, enabling detailed analysis of approximation errors. The results dispel some existing misunderstandings and also reveal subtle, but significant pitfalls in approximation that are only apparent with exact values. The Python source code is available at https://github.com/DiscreteTotalVariation/ChiSquared.</description>
