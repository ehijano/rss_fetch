Abstract: In this short note, we exhibit a draw in the game of Philosopher's Phutball. We construct a position on a 12 x 10 Phutball board from where either player has a drawing strategy, and then generalize it to an m x n board with m-2 &gt;= n &gt;= 10.</description>

      <title>Enumerating Flat Fubini Rankings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recall that the set of Fubini rankings on $n$ competitors consists of the $n$-tuples that encode the possible rankings of $n$ competitors in a competition allowing ties. Moreover, recall that a run (weak run) in a tuple is a subsequence of consecutive ascents (weak ascents). If the leading terms of the set of maximally long runs (weak runs) of a tuple are in increasing (weakly increasing) order, then the tuple is said to be flattened (weakly flattened). We define the set of strictly flattened Fubini rankings, which is the subset of Fubini rankings with runs of strict ascents whose leading term are strictly increasing. Analogously, we define the set of weakly flattened Fubini rankings, which is the subset of Fubini rankings with runs of weak ascents whose leading terms are in weakly increasing order. Our main results give formulas for the enumeration of strictly flattened Fubini rankings and weakly flattened Fubini rankings. We also provide some conjectures for further study.</description>

      <title>Improved Bounds for Codes over Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Codes over trees were introduced recently to bridge graph theory and coding theory with diverse applications in computer science and beyond. A central challenge lies in determining the maximum number of labelled trees over $n$ nodes with pairwise distance at least $d$, denoted by $A(n,d)$, where the distance between any two labelled trees is the minimum number of edit edge operations in order to transform one tree to another. By various tools from graph theory and algebra, we show that when $n$ is large, $A(n,d)=O((Cn)^{n-d})$ for any $d\leq n-2$, and $A(n,d)=\Omega((cn)^{n-d})$ for any $d$ linear with $n$, where constants $c\in(0,1)$ and $C\in [1/2,1)$ depending on $d$. Previously, only $A(n,d)=O(n^{n-d-1})$ for fixed $d$ and $A(n,d)=\Omega(n^{n-2d})$ for $d\leq n/2$ were known, while the upper bound is improved for any $d$ and the lower bound is improved for $d\geq 2\sqrt{n}$. Further, for any fixed integer $k$, we prove the existence of codes of size $\Omega(n^k)$ when $n-d=o(n)$, and give explicit constructions of codes which show $A(n,n-4)=\Omega(n^2)$ and $A(n,n-13)=\Omega(n^3)$.</description>

      <title>Mutation Cycles from Reddening Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given two quivers, each with a reddening sequence, we show how to construct a plethora of mutation cycles. We give several examples, including a generalization of the construction of long mutation cycles in earlier work by the second author. We also give new results on the reddening sequences of certain mutation-acyclic quivers and forks, classifying them in some cases.</description>

      <title>Spectrum radii of trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any positive integer $r$ and positive number $\alpha$, let ${\mathscr W}_r(\alpha)$ denote the set of positive numbers defined recursively: $\alpha\in {\mathscr W}_r(\alpha)$, and for any multi-set $\{q_i\in {\mathscr W}_r(\alpha): 1\le i\le s\}$, where $1\le s&lt;r$, $\beta:=\alpha-\sum\limits_{i=1}^sq_i^{-1}$ belongs to ${\mathscr W}_r(\alpha)$ as long as $\beta&gt;0$. We first show that there exists a tree $T$ such that its maximum degree $\Delta(T)$ is at most $r$ and its spectrum radius $\lambda(T)$ is equal to $\alpha$ if and only if $\alpha^{-1}\in {\mathscr W}_r(\alpha)$. It follows that the set of spectrum radii of non-trivial trees is exactly the set of positive numbers $\alpha$ such that $\alpha^{-1}\in {\mathscr W}_{\lfloor\alpha^2\rfloor}(\alpha)$. Applying this conclusion, we then prove that for any positive integers $r$ and $k$, there exists a tree $T$ with $\Delta(T)=r$ and $\lambda(T)=\sqrt k$ if and only if $\frac 14 k+1&lt;r\le k$.</description>

      <title>Sufficient conditions for a graph with minimum degree to have a component factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{T}_{\frac{k}{r}}$ denote the set of trees $T$ such that $i(T-S)\leq\frac{k}{r}|S|$ for any $S\subset V(T)$ and for any $e\in E(T)$ there exists a set $S^{*}\subset V(T)$ with $i((T-e)-S^{*})&gt;\frac{k}{r}|S^{*}|$, where $r&lt;k$ are two positive integers. A $\{C_{2i+1},T:1\leq i&lt;\frac{r}{k-r},T\in\mathcal{T}_{\frac{k}{r}}\}$-factor of a graph $G$ is a spanning subgraph of $G$, in which every component is isomorphic to an element in $\{C_{2i+1},T:1\leq i&lt;\frac{r}{k-r},T\in\mathcal{T}_{\frac{k}{r}}\}$. Let $A(G)$ and $Q(G)$ denote the adjacency matrix and the signless Laplacian matrix of $G$, respectively. The adjacency spectral radius and the signless Laplacian spectral radius of $G$, denoted by $\rho(G)$ and $q(G)$, are the largest eigenvalues of $A(G)$ and $Q(G)$, respectively. In this paper, we study the connections between the spectral radius and the existence of a $\{C_{2i+1},T:1\leq i&lt;\frac{r}{k-r},T\in\mathcal{T}_{\frac{k}{r}}\}$-factor in a graph. We first establish a tight sufficient condition involving the adjacency spectral radius to guarantee the existence of a $\{C_{2i+1},T:1\leq i&lt;\frac{r}{k-r},T\in\mathcal{T}_{\frac{k}{r}}\}$-factor in a graph. Then we propose a tight signless Laplacian spectral radius condition for the existence of a $\{C_{2i+1},T:1\leq i&lt;\frac{r}{k-r},T\in\mathcal{T}_{\frac{k}{r}}\}$-factor in a graph.</description>

      <title>The row left rank of a quaternion unit gain graph in terms of maximum degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Phi=(G,U(\mathbb{Q}),\varphi)$ be a quaternion unit gain graph (or $U(\mathbb{Q})$-gain graph) of order $n$, $A(\Phi)$ be the adjacency matrix of $\Phi$ and $r(\Phi)$ be the row left rank of $\Phi$. Let $\Delta$ be the maximum degree of $\Phi$. In this paper, we prove that $r(\Phi)\geq\frac{n}{\Delta}$. Moreover, if $\Phi$ is connected, we obtain that $r(\Phi)\geq\frac{n-2}{\Delta-1}$. All the corresponding extremal graphs are characterized.</description>

      <title>Preservation of notion of C sets near zero over reals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are several notions of largeness in a semigroup. N. Hindman and D. Strauss established that if $u,v \in \mathbb{N}$, $A$ is a $u \times v$ matrix with entries from $\mathbb{Q}$ and $\psi$ is a notion of a large set in $\mathbb{N}$, then $\{\vec{x} \in \mathbb{N}^v: A\vec{x} \in \psi^u \}$ is large in $\mathbb{N}^v$. Among the several notions of largeness, C sets occupies an important place of study because they exhibit strong combinatorial properties. The analogous notion of C set appears for a dense subsemigroup $S$ of $((0, \infty),+)$ called a C-set near zero. These sets also have very rich combinatorial structure. In this article, we investigate the above result for C sets near zero in $\mathbb{R}^+$ when the matrix has real entries. We also develop a new characterisation of C-sets near zero in $\mathbb{R}^+$.</description>

      <title>On Macdonald expansions of $q$-chromatic symmetric functions and the Stanley-Stembridge Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Stanley-Stembridge conjecture asserts that the chromatic symmetric function of a $(3+1)$-free graph is $e$-positive. Recently, Hikita proved this conjecture by giving an explicit $e$-expansion of the Shareshian-Wachs $q$-chromatic refinement for unit interval graphs. Using the $\mathbb{A}_{q,t}$ algebra, we give an expansion of these $q$-chromatic symmetric functions into Macdonald polynomials. Upon setting $t=1$, we obtain another proof of the Stanley-Stembridge conjecture and rederive Hikita's formula. Upon setting $t=0$, we obtain an expansion into Hall-Littlewood symmetric functions.</description>

      <title>Quasipolynomial bounds for the corners theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite abelian group and $A$ be a subset of $G \times G$ which is corner-free, meaning that there are no $x, y \in G$ and $d \in G \setminus \{0\}$ such that $(x, y)$, $(x+d, y)$, $(x, y+d) \in A$. We prove that \[|A| \le |G|^2 \cdot \exp(-(\log |G|)^{\Omega(1)}).\] As a consequence, we obtain polynomial (in the input length) lower bounds on the non-deterministic communication complexity of Exactly-N in the 3-player Number-on-Forehead model. We also obtain the first "reasonable'' lower bounds on the coloring version of the $3$-dimensional corners problem and equivalently the deterministic communication complexity of Exactly-N in the 4-player Number-on-Forehead model.</description>

      <title>The Density Finite Sums Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For any set $A$ of natural numbers with positive upper Banach density and any $k\geq 1$, we show the existence of an infinite set $B\subset{\mathbb N}$ and a shift $t\geq0$ such that $A-t$ contains all sums of $m$ distinct elements from $B$ for all $m\in\{1,\ldots,k\}$. This can be viewed as a density analog of Hindman's finite sums theorem. Our proof reveals the natural relationships among infinite sumsets, the dynamics underpinning arithmetic progressions, and homogeneous spaces of nilpotent Lie groups.</description>

      <title>On a Characterization of Spartan Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The eternal vertex cover game is played between an attacker and a defender on an undirected graph $G$. The defender identifies $k$ vertices to position guards on to begin with. The attacker, on their turn, attacks an edge $e$, and the defender must move a guard along $e$ to defend the attack. The defender may move other guards as well, under the constraint that every guard moves at most once and to a neighboring vertex. The smallest number of guards required to defend attacks forever is called the eternal vertex cover number of $G$, denoted $evc(G)$.
  For any graph $G$, $evc(G)$ is at least the vertex cover number of $G$, denoted $mvc(G)$. A graph is Spartan if $evc(G) = mvc(G)$. It is known that a bipartite graph is Spartan if and only if every edge belongs to a perfect matching. We show that the only K\"onig graphs that are Spartan are the bipartite Spartan graphs. We also give new lower bounds for $evc(G)$, generalizing a known lower bound based on cut vertices. We finally show a new matching-based characterization of all Spartan graphs.</description>

      <title>Support-2 monomial ideals that are Simis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A monomial ideal $I\subseteq \mathbb{K}[x_1,\ldots , x_n]$ is called a Simis ideal if $I^{(s)}=I^s$ for all $s\geq 1$, where $I^{(s)}$ denotes the $s$-th symbolic power of $I$. Let $I$ be a support-2 monomial ideal such that its irreducible primary decomposition is minimal. We prove that $I$ is a Simis ideal if and only if $\sqrt{I}$ is Simis and $I$ has standard linear weights. This result thereby proves a recent conjecture for the class of support-2 monomial ideals proposed by Mendez, Pinto, and Villarreal. Furthermore, we give a complete characterization of the Cohen-Macaulay property for support-2 monomial ideals whose radical is the edge ideal of a whiskered graph. Finally, we classify when these ideals are Simis in degree 2.</description>

      <title>Tight bound on the minimum degree to guarantee graphs forbidding some odd cycles to be bipartite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.02762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Erd\H{o}s and Simonovits asked the following question: For an integer $r\geq 2$ and a family of non-bipartite graphs $\mathcal{H}$, determine the infimum of $\alpha$ such that any $\mathcal{H}$-free $n$-vertex graph with minimum degree at least $\alpha n$ has chromatic number at most $r$. We answer this question for $r=2$ and any family consisting of odd cycles. Let ${\mathcal C}$ be a family of odd cycles in which $C_{2\ell+1}$ is the shortest odd cycle not in ${\mathcal C}$ and $C_{2k+1}$ is the longest odd cycle in ${\mathcal C}$, we show that if $G$ is an $n$-vertex ${\mathcal C}$-free graph with $n\ge 1000k^{8}$ and $\delta(G)&gt;\max\{ n/(2(2\ell+1)), 2n/(2k+3)\}$, then $G$ is bipartite. Moreover, the bound of the minimum degree is tight.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08274v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper new Steiner systems $S(2,6,121)$, $S(2,6,126)$, $S(2,7,169)$ are introduced. Also some non-existence results for line lengths $7..11$ are presented. There is no solid proof that presented algorithm is exhaustive or correct, but it produces same results on already known difference families for line lengths $3..6$. Due to calculation-based approach this paper probably won't be published, but will be submitted to arxiv as it contains some new results</description>

      <title>Periods and atomic firing sequences of parallel chip-firing games on directed graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15889v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1992, Bitar and Goles introduced the parallel chip-firing game on undirected graphs. Two years later, Prisner extended the game to directed graphs. While the properties of parallel chip-firing games on undirected graphs have been extensively studied, their analogs for parallel chip-firing games on directed graphs have been sporadic. In this paper, we prove the outstanding analogs of the core results of parallel chip-firing games on undirected graphs for those on directed graphs. We find the possible periods of a parallel chip-firing game on a directed simple cycle and introduce the method of Gauss-Jordan elimination on a Laplacian-like matrix to establish a lower bound on the maximum period of a parallel chip-firing game on an orientation of an undirected complete graph and an undirected complete bipartite graph. Finally, we expand the method of motors by Jiang, Scully, and Zhang to directed graphs to show that a binary string $s$ can be the atomic firing sequence of a vertex in a parallel chip-firing game on a strongly connected directed graph if and only if $s$ contains $1$ or $s=0$.</description>

      <title>The geometry of covering codes in the sum-rank metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of a sum-rank saturating system and outline its correspondence to a covering properties of a sum-rank metric code. We consider the problem of determining the shortest sum-rank-$\rho$-saturating systems of a fixed dimension, which is equivalent to the covering problem in the sum-rank metric. We obtain upper and lower bounds on this quantity. We also give constructions of saturating systems arising from geometrical structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new type of $n$-dimensional generalization of symmetric $(v,k,\lambda)$ block designs. We prove upper bounds on the dimension $n$ in terms of $v$ and $k$. We also define the corresponding concept of $n$-dimensional difference sets, and extend some classic families of difference sets to higher dimensions. Complete classifications are performed for small parameters $(v,k,\lambda)$ and some interesting examples are presented.</description>

      <title>On Lattice Tilings of Asymmetric Limited-Magnitude Balls $\cB(n,2,m,m-1)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Limited-magnitude errors modify a transmitted integer vector in at most $t$ entries, where each entry can increase by at most $\kp$ or decrease by at most $\km$. This channel model is particularly relevant to applications such as flash memories and DNA storage. A perfect code for this channel is equivalent to a tiling of $\Z^n$ by asymmetric limited-magnitude balls $\cB(n,t,\kp,\km)$. In this paper, we focus on the case where $t=2$ and $\km=\kp-1$, and we derive necessary conditions on $m$ and $n$ for the existence of a lattice tiling of $\cB(n,2,m,m-1)$. Specifically, we prove that if such a tiling exists, then either $4\leq m \leq 512$ and $n&lt;7.23m+4$, or $m&gt;512$ and $n&lt;4m$. In particular, for $m=2$ and $m=3$, we show that no lattice tiling of $\cB(n,2,2,1)$ or $\cB(n,2,3,2)$ exists for any $n\geq 3$.</description>

      <title>The Cloud and Flock Polynomials of q-Matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14984v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the Whitney function of a q-matroid can be determined from the cloud and flock polynomials associated to the cyclic flats. These polynomials capture information about the corank (resp., nullity) of certain spaces whose cyclic core (resp., closure) is the given cyclic flat. Going one step further, we prove that the Whitney function, and in fact the cloud-flock lattice, are determined by the configuration of the q-matroid, which is the abstract lattice of cyclic flats together with the corank-nullity data. Furthermore, we show that the configuration and cloud-flock lattice behave well under duality and direct sums, whereas the Whitney function does not contain enough information to behave well under taking direct sums. As an aside we show that every configuration of a matroid arises as a configuration of a q-matroid, whereas the converse is not true.</description>

      <title>Sufficient conditions for the variation of toughness under the distance spectral in graphs involving minimum degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23490v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The concept of graph toughness was first introduced in 1973. In 1995, scholars first explored the lower bound of the toughness of connected d-regular graphs with respect to d and the second largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix. The concept of the variation of toughness was first introduced in 1988. The variation of toughness is defined as tau(G) = min{|S|/(c(G-S)-1)}. In 2025, Chen, Fan, and Lin provided sufficient conditions for a graph to be t-tough in terms of the minimum degree and the distance spectral radius. Inspired by this, we propose a sufficient condition for a graph to be tau-tough in terms of minimum degree and distance spectral radius, and provide the corresponding proof, where |S| and c(G-S)-1 are mutually divisible.</description>

      <title>Dynamic and Programmatic Analysis of Fibonacci Word Density</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fibonacci word is the archetype of the Sturmian word, and it is one of the most studied of combinatorics on words. We studied the properties of the Fibonacci word and found its density for limited value then by calculating the limit associated with the general relation of $\frac{F(n)}{F(n+1)}$. We also generated the density function through the integral relation of $\int_a^b f(x) dx $ where $D(n)=\int_a^b f(x) dx$ and $f(x) = e^{-x/\tau} g(x)$.
  we presented the first study of the density of the Fibonacci word, in addition to some analysis through programming.</description>

      <title>Supports for Outerplanar and Bounded Treewidth Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05039v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the existence and construction of sparse supports for hypergraphs derived from subgraphs of a graph $G$. For a hypergraph $(X,\mathcal{H})$, a support $Q$ is a graph on $X$ s.t. $Q[H]$, the graph induced on vertices in $H$ is connected for every $H\in\mathcal{H}$.
  We consider \emph{primal}, \emph{dual}, and \emph{intersection} hypergraphs defined by subgraphs of a graph $G$ that are \emph{non-piercing}, (i.e., each subgraph is connected, their pairwise differences remain connected).
  If $G$ is outerplanar, we show that the primal, dual and intersection hypergraphs admit supports that are outerplanar. For a bounded treewidth graph $G$, we show that if the subgraphs are non-piercing, then there exist supports for the primal and dual hypergraphs of treewidth $O(2^{tw(G)})$ and $O(2^{4tw(G)})$ respectively, and a support of treewidth $2^{O(2^{tw(G)})}$ for the intersection hypergraph. We also show that for the primal and dual hypergraphs, the exponential blow-up of treewidth is sometimes essential.
  All our results are algorithmic and yield polynomial-time algorithms (when the treewidth is bounded). The existence and construction of sparse supports is a crucial step in the design and analysis of PTASs and/or sub-exponential time algorithms for several packing and covering problems.</description>

      <title>Supersaturation of odd linear cycles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05116v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An $r$-uniform linear cycle of length $\ell$, denoted by $C^r_{\ell}$, is an $r$-graph with $\ell$ edges $e_1,e_2,\dots,e_{\ell}$ where $e_i=\{v_{(r-1)(i-1)},v_{(r-1)(i-1)+1},\dots,v_{(r-1)i}\}$ (here $v_0=v_{(r-1)\ell}$). For $0&lt;\delta&lt;1$ and $n$ sufficiently large, we show that every $n$-vertex $r$-graph $G$ with $n^{r-\delta}$ edges contains at least $n^{(r-1)(2\ell+1)-\delta(2\ell+1+\frac{4\ell-1}{(r-1)(2\ell+1)-3})-o(1)}$ copies of $C^r_{2\ell+1}$. Further, conditioning on the existence of dense high-girth hypergraphs, we show that there exists $n$-vertex $r$-graphs with $n^{r-\delta}$ edges and at most $n^{(r-1)(2\ell+1)-\delta(2\ell+1+\frac{1}{(r-1)\ell-1})+o(1)}$ copies of $C^r_{2\ell+1}$.</description>

      <title>Improvement Ergodic Theory For The Infinite Word $\mathfrak{F}=\mathfrak{F}_{b}:=\left({ }_{b} f_{n}\right)_{n \geqslant 0}$ on Fibonacci Density</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05901v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper explores combinatorial properties of Fibonacci words and their generalizations within the framework of combinatorics on words. These infinite sequences, measures the diversity of subwords in Fibonacci words, showing non-decreasing growth for infinite sequences. Extends factor analysis to arithmetic progressions of symbols, highlighting generalized pattern distributions. Recent results link Sturmian sequences (including Fibonacci words) to unbounded binomial complexity and gap inequivalence, with implications for formal language theory and automata. This work underscores the interplay between substitution rules, algebraic number theory, and combinatorial complexity in infinite words, providing tools for applications in fractal geometry and theoretical computer science.</description>

      <title>Totally equimodular matrices: decomposition and triangulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Totally equimodular matrices generalize totally unimodular matrices and arise in the context of box-total dual integral polyhedra. This work further explores the parallels between these two classes and introduces foundational building blocks for constructing totally equimodular matrices. Consequently, we present a decomposition theorem for totally equimodular matrices of full row rank.
  Building on this decomposition theorem, we prove that simplicial cones whose generators form the rows of a totally equimodular matrix sa\-tisfy strong integrality decomposition properties. More precisely, we provide the Hilbert basis for these cones and construct regular unimodular Hilbert triangulations in most cases. We conjecture that cases not covered here do not exist.</description>

      <title>Upper tail bounds for irregular graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05311v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the upper tail large deviations of subgraph counts for irregular graphs $\mathrm{H}$ in $\mathbb{G}(n,p)$, the sparse Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graph on $n$ vertices with edge connectivity probability $p \in (0,1)$. For $n^{-1/\Delta} \ll p \ll 1$, where $\Delta$ is the maximum degree of $\mathrm{H}$, we derive the upper tail large deviations for any irregular graph $\mathrm{H}$. On the other hand, we show that for $p$ such that $1 \ll n^{v_{\mathrm{H}}} p^{e_{\mathrm{H}}} \ll (\log n)^{\alpha^{*}_{\mathrm{H}}/\left(\alpha^{*}_{\mathrm{H}}-1\right)}$, where $v_{\mathrm{H}}$ and $e_{\mathrm{H}}$ denote the number of vertices and edges of $\mathrm{H}$, and $\alpha^*_{\mathrm{H}}$ denotes the fractional independence number, the upper tail large deviations of the number of unlabelled copies of $\mathrm{H}$ in $\mathbb{G}(n,p)$ is given by that of a sequence of Poisson random variables with diverging mean, for any strictly balanced graph $\mathrm{H}$. Restricting to the $r$-armed star graph we further prove a localized behavior in the intermediate range of $p$ (left open by the above two results) and show that the mean-field approximation is asymptotically tight for the logarithm of the upper tail probability. This work further identifies the typical structures of $\mathbb{G}(n,p)$ conditioned on upper tail rare events in the localized regime.</description>
