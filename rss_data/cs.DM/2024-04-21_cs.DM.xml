      <title>Items or Relations -- what do Artificial Neural Networks learn?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: What has an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) learned after being successfully trained to solve a task - the set of training items or the relations between them? This question is difficult to answer for modern applied ANNs because of their enormous size and complexity. Therefore, here we consider a low-dimensional network and a simple task, i.e., the network has to reproduce a set of training items identically. We construct the family of solutions analytically and use standard learning algorithms to obtain numerical solutions. These numerical solutions differ depending on the optimization algorithm and the weight initialization and are shown to be particular members of the family of analytical solutions. In this simple setting, we observe that the general structure of the network weights represents the training set's symmetry group, i.e., the relations between training items. As a consequence, linear networks generalize, i.e., reproduce items that were not part of the training set but are consistent with the symmetry of the training set. In contrast, non-linear networks tend to learn individual training items and show associative memory. At the same time, their ability to generalize is limited. A higher degree of generalization is obtained for networks whose activation function contains a linear regime, such as tanh. Our results suggest ANN's ability to generalize - instead of learning items - could be improved by generating a sufficiently big set of elementary operations to represent relations and strongly depends on the applied non-linearity.</description>

      <title>An algorithm with a delay of $\mathcal{O}(k\Delta)$ for enumerating connected induced subgraphs of size $k$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of enumerating connected subgraphs of a given size in a graph has been extensively studied in recent years. In this short communication, we propose an algorithm with a delay of $\mathcal{O}(k\Delta)$ for enumerating all connected induced subgraphs of size $k$ in an undirected graph $G=(V, E)$, where $k$ and $\Delta$ are respectively the size of subgraphs and the maximum degree of $G$. The proposed algorithm improves upon the current best delay bound $\mathcal{O}(k^2\Delta)$ for the connected induced subgraph enumeration problem in the literature.</description>

      <title>List homomorphisms to separable signed graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.06449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The complexity of the list homomorphism problem for signed graphs appears difficult to classify. Existing results focus on special classes of signed graphs, such as trees and reflexive signed graphs. Irreflexive signed graphs are in a certain sense the heart of the problem, as noted by a recent paper of Kim and Siggers. We focus on a special class of irreflexive signed graphs, namely those in which the unicoloured edges form a spanning path or cycle, which we call separable signed graphs. We classify the complexity of list homomorphisms to these separable signed graphs; we believe that these signed graphs will play an important role for the general resolution of the irreflexive case. We also relate our results to a conjecture of Kim and Siggers concerning the special case of semi-balanced irreflexive signed graphs; we have proved the conjecture in another paper, and the present results add structural information to that topic.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic estimates of the diameters of the Rubik's Cube groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07337v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The diameter of the Cayley graph of the Rubik's Cube group is the fewest number of turns needed to solve the Cube from any initial configurations. For the 2$\times$2$\times$2 Cube, the diameter is 11 in the half-turn metric, 14 in the quarter-turn metric, 19 in the semi-quarter-turn metric, and 10 in the bi-quarter-turn metric. For the 3$\times$3$\times$3 Cube, the diameter was determined by Rokicki et al. to be 20 in the half-turn metric and 26 in the quarter-turn metric. This study shows that a modified version of the coupon collector's problem in probabilistic theory can predict the diameters correctly for both 2$\times$2$\times$2 and 3$\times$3$\times$3 Cubes insofar as the quarter-turn metric is adopted. In the half-turn metric, the diameters are overestimated by one and two, respectively, for the 2$\times$2$\times$2 and 3$\times$3$\times$3 Cubes, whereas for the 2$\times$2$\times$2 Cube in the semi-quarter-turn and bi-quarter-turn metrics, they are overestimated by two and underestimated by one, respectively. Invoking the same probabilistic logic, the diameters of the 4$\times$4$\times$4 and 5$\times$5$\times$5 Cubes are predicted to be 48 (41) and 68 (58) in the quarter-turn (half-turn) metric, whose precise determinations are far beyond reach of classical supercomputing. It is shown that the probabilistically estimated diameter is approximated by $\ln N / \ln r + \ln N / r$, where $N$ is the number of configurations and $r$ is the branching ratio.</description>

      <title>Correcting matrix products over the ring of integers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $A$, $B$, and $C$ be three $n\times n$ matrices. We investigate the problem of verifying whether $AB=C$ over the ring of integers and finding the correct product $AB$. Given that $C$ is different from $AB$ by at most $k$ entries, we propose an algorithm that uses $O(\sqrt{k}n^2+k^2n)$ operations.
  Let $\alpha$ be the largest absolute value of an entry in $A$, $B$, and $C$. The integers involved in the computation are of $O(n^3\alpha^2)$.</description>

      <title>Hypergeometric-Type Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00256v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce hypergeometric-type sequences. They are linear combinations of interlaced hypergeometric sequences (of arbitrary interlacements). We prove that they form a subring of the ring of holonomic sequences. An interesting family of sequences in this class are those defined by trigonometric functions with linear arguments in the index and $\pi$, such as Chebyshev polynomials, $\left(\sin^2\left(n\,\pi/4\right)\cdot\cos\left(n\,\pi/6\right)\right)_n$, and compositions like $\left(\sin\left(\cos(n\pi/3)\pi\right)\right)_n$.
  We describe an algorithm that computes a hypergeometric-type normal form of a given holonomic $n\text{th}$ term whenever it exists. Our implementation enables us to generate several identities for terms defined via trigonometric functions.</description>
