      <title>Very weak solutions of the heat equation with anisotropically singular time-dependent diffusivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the heat equation with a time-dependent, anisotropic, and potentially singular diffusivity tensor. Since weak (in the Sobolev sense) or distributional solutions may not exist in this setting, we employ the framework of very weak solutions to establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the heat equation with singular, anisotropic, time-dependent diffusivity.</description>

      <title>On the direct and inverse electromagnetic scattering in a parallel-plate waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper devotes to providing rigorous theoretical analysis of the wellposedness of the direct problem and the uniqueness of the inverse problem of electromagnetic scattering in a parallel-plate waveguide. The direct problem is reduced to an equivalent boundary value problem on a bounded domain by introducing an exact transparent boundary condition in terms of the electric-to-magnetic Calder\'on operator which can be explicitly represented as a series expansion. Then the wellopsedness of the reduced problem in appropriate Sobolev spaces is proved via the variational approach provided by some necessary properties of the Calder\'on operator and Helmholtz decomposition. Relying on the Green's representation formula and a reciprocity relation, the probe method, finally, is utilized to show the uniqueness of the inverse obstacle problem.</description>

      <title>New non-invertible mappings and general solutions of linear wave equations with variable wave speeds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how the symmetry-based method can be used to obtain new non-invertible equivalence mappings of linear wave equations with variable wave speeds $c(x,t)$ to linear wave equations with different variable wave speeds. Moreover, we present new non-invertible mappings of linear wave equations with variable wave speeds $c(x,t)$ to a linear wave equation with a constant wave speed. Consequently, the general solutions of these linear wave equations with variable wave speeds $c(x,t)$ are obtained.</description>

      <title>A concentration phenomenon for a semilinear Schr\"odinger equation with periodic self-focusing core</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the equation $$-\Delta u+u=Q_\varepsilon(x)|u|^{p-2}u,\qquad u\in H^1(\mathbb{R}^N),$$ where $Q_\varepsilon$ takes the value $1$ on each ball $B_\varepsilon(y)$, $y\in\mathbb{Z}^N$, and the value $-1$ elsewhere. We establish the existence of a least energy solution for each $\varepsilon\in(0,\frac{1}{2})$ and show that their $H^1$ and $L^p$ norms concentrate locally at points of $\mathbb{Z}^N$ as $\varepsilon\to 0$.</description>

      <title>Scattering for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with concentrated nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the cubic defocusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation in one dimension with the nonlinearity concentrated at a single point. We prove global well-posedness in the scaling-critical space $L^2(\mathbb{R})$ and scattering for all such solutions. Moreover, we demonstrate that the same phenomenology holds whenever nonlinear effects are sufficiently concentrated in space.</description>

      <title>Relaxation limit of pressureless Euler-Poisson equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the relaxation problem for the one-dimensional pressureless Euler--Poisson equations with the initial density being a finite Radon measure. The entropy solution of this linearly degenerate hyperbolic system converges to the weak solution of part of drift--diffusion equations without diffusion term when the momentum relaxation time tends to zero. Independent of compactness, our strategy is to construct the formula of solutions to both systems and directly obtain the convergent result. Furthermore, the uniqueness of entropy solution to pressureless Euler--Poisson equations is also proved by Oleinik condition and the initially weak continuity of kinetic energy measure.</description>

      <title>Structurally damped semilinear evolution equation for positive operators on Hilbert space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we analyze a semilinear damped evolution equation under different damping conditions, including the undamped $(\theta=0)$, effectively damped $(0&lt;2\theta&lt;\sigma)$, critically damped $(2\theta=\sigma)$, and non-effectively damped $(\sigma&lt;2\theta\leq 2\sigma)$. The analysis is conducted in two parts; the present article is devoted to examining decay estimates of solutions to the linear evolution equation governed by a self-adjoint, positive operator $\mathcal{L}$ with discrete spectrum subject to initial Cauchy data of minimal regularity. Specifically, we consider the Cauchy problem: \begin{equation*}
  \left\{\begin{array}{l}
  u_{tt}(t)+\mathcal{L}^{\theta}u_{t}(t)+\mathcal{L}^{\sigma}u(t) =0, \quad t&gt;0,
  u(0)=u_{0}\in\mathcal{H},\quad
  u_{t}(0)=u_{1}\in\mathcal{H},
  \end{array}\right. \end{equation*} in different damping conditions. %More precisely, we study decay estimates for a solution, its time derivative, and space derivative in both cases. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the decay rates of the associated solutions improve with the regularity of the initial Cauchy data. As an application of the decay estimates, we also demonstrate the global existence (in time) of the solution in certain cases, taking into account polynomial-type nonlinearity. In the 2nd article, we will address the remaining instances where global existence cannot be assured and instead present findings on local existence and possible blow-up results.</description>

      <title>Global Lipschitz regularity in anisotropic elliptic problems with natural gradient growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We deal with homogeneous Dirichlet and Neumann boundary-value problems for anisotropic elliptic operators of p-Laplace type. They emerge as Euler-Lagrange equations of integral functionals of the Calculus of Variations built upon possibly anisotropic norms of the gradient of trial functions. We establish global Lipschitz regularity of solutions under the weakest possible assumption on right-hand side of the equation, which may also include the gradient term with natural growth exponent. The results hold in either convex domains, or domains enjoying minimal integrability assumptions on the curvature of its boundary.</description>

      <title>Self-Similar Solutions to a Nonlinear Forward-Backward Parabolic Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the mixed-type equation u u_x = u_{yy}, which behaves as forward and backward parabolic equations depending on the sign of u. The equation arises from the study of boundary layers with separation. We seek solutions that change their type smoothly to better understand the equation. We simplify the equation into a second-order ODE using similarity variables, and prove an existence result by analyzing it as a first-order nonlinear ODE system. This provides us a self-similar solution with a sign change.</description>

      <title>On a Generalized System with Applications to Ideal Magnetohydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finite-time blowup of solutions $(u(x,t),b(x,t))$ to a generalized system of equations with applications to ideal Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and one-dimensional fluid convection and stretching, among other areas, is investigated. The system is parameter-dependent, our spatial domain is the unit interval or the circle, and the initial data $(u_0(x),b_0(x))$ is assumed to be smooth. Among other results, we derive precise blowup criteria for specific values of the parameters by tracking the evolution of $u_x$ along Lagrangian trajectories that originate at a point $x_0$ at which $b_0(x)$ and $b_0'(x)$ vanish. We employ concavity arguments, energy estimates, and ODE comparison methods. We also show that for some values of the parameters, a non-vanishing $b_0'(x_0)$ suppresses finite-time blowup.</description>

      <title>Pattern formations of coupled PDEs with transparent boundary conditions in product-type ends and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies pattern formations in coupled elliptic PDE systems governed by transparent boundary conditions. Such systems unify diverse areas, including inverse boundary problems (via a single passive/active boundary measurement), spectral geometry of transmission eigenfunctions, and geometric characterization of invisibility phenomena and inverse shape problems in wave scattering. We uncover and rigorously characterize a novel local pattern formation, establishing a sharp quantitative relationship between the difference in the PDEs' lower-order terms and the geometric/regularity parameters within a generic domain's product-type ends-structures characterized by high extrinsic curvature. This foundational result yields new findings with novel physical insights and practical implications across these fields.</description>

      <title>Existence and asymptotical behavior of normalized solutions to focusing biharmonic HLS upper critical Hartree equation with a local perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the following focusing biharmonic HLS upper critical Hartree equation with a local perturbation $$ \begin{cases}
  {\Delta}^2u-\lambda u-\mu|u|^{p-2}u-(I_\alpha*|u|^{4^*_\alpha})|u|^{4^*_\alpha-2}u=0\ \ \mbox{in}\ \mathbb{R}^N, \\[0.1cm]
  \int_{\mathbb{R}^N} u^2 dx = c, \end{cases} $$ where $0&lt;\alpha&lt;N$, $N \geq 5$, $\mu,c&gt;0$, $2+\frac{8}{N}=:\bar{p}\leq p&lt;4^*:=\frac{2N}{N-4}$, $4^*_\alpha:=\frac{N+\alpha}{N-4}$, $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$ is a Lagrange multiplier and $I_\alpha$ is the Riesz potential. Choosing an appropriate testing function, one can derive some reasonable estimate on the mountain pass level. Based on this point, we show the existence of normalized solutions by verifying the \emph{(PS)} condition at the corresponding mountain pass level for any $\mu&gt;0$. The contribution of this paper is that the recent results obtained for $L^2$-subcritical perturbation by Chen et al. (J. Geom. Anal. 33, 371 (2023)) is extended to the case $\bar{p}\leq p&lt;4^*$. Moreover, we also discuss asymptotic behavior of the energy to the mountain pass solution when $\mu\to 0^+$ and $c\to 0^+$, respectively.</description>

      <title>On global regular axially-symmetric solution to the Navier-Stokes equations in a cylinder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the axisymmetric Navier-Stokes equations in a finite cylinder $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^3$. We assume that $v_r$, $v_\varphi$, $\omega_\varphi$ vanish on the lateral part of boundary $\partial\Omega$ of the cylinder, and that $v_z$, $\omega_\varphi$, $\partial_zv_\varphi$ vanish on the top and bottom parts of the boundary $\partial\Omega$, where we used standard cylindrical coordinates, and we denoted by $\omega={\rm curl}\, v$ the vorticity field. We use $H^3$ Sobolev estimates for the modified stream function (stream function divided by radius) and energy type estimates for gradient of swirl to derive two order reduction estimates. These help one to derive a global estimate for a regular solution. This estimate yields the existence of global regular axially-symmetric solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The primary objective of this paper is to investigate the orthonormal Strichartz estimates at the critical summability exponent for the Schr\"odinger operator $e^{it\Delta}$ with initial data from the homogeneous Sobolev space $\dot{H}^s (\mathbb{R}^n)$. We prove new global strong-type orthonormal Strichartz estimates in the interior of $ODCA$ at the optimal summability exponent $\alpha=q$, thereby substantially supplymenting the work of Bez-Hong-Lee-Nakamura-Sawano \cite{Bez-Hong-Lee-Nakamura-Sawano}. Our approach is based on restricted weak-type orthonormal estimates, real interpolation argument and the advantageous condition $q&lt;p$ in the interior of $ODCA$.</description>

      <title>Propagation of Chaos for Singular Interactions via Regular Drivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a framework to prove propagation of chaos for interacting particle systems with singular, density-dependent interactions, a classical challenge in mean-field theory. Our approach is to define the dynamics implicitly via a regular driver function. This regular driver is engineered to generate a singular effective interaction, yet its underlying regularity provides the necessary analytical control. Our main result establishes propagation of chaos under a key dissipation condition. The proof hinges on deriving a priori bounds, uniform in a regularization parameter, for the densities of the associated non-linear Fokker-Planck equations. Specifically, we establish uniform bounds in $L^\infty([0,T]; H^1(\R) \cap L^\infty(\R))$. These are established via an energy method for the excess mass to secure the $L^\infty$ bound, and a novel energy estimate for the $H^1$ norm that critically leverages the stability condition. These bounds provide the compactness necessary to pass to the singular limit, showing convergence to a McKean-Vlasov SDE with a singular, density-dependent diffusion coefficient. This work opens a new path to analyzing singular systems and provides a constructive theory for a class of interactions that present significant challenges to classical techniques.</description>

      <title>Gradient continuity estimates for elliptic equations of singular $p$-Laplace type with measure data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we are concerned with elliptic equations of $p$-Laplace type with measure data, which is given by $-div\big(a(x)(|\nabla u|^2+s^2)^{\frac{p-2}{2}}\nabla u\big)=\mu$ with $p&gt;1$ and $s\geq0$. Under the assumption that the modulus of continuity of the coefficient $a(x)$ in the $L^2$-mean sense satisfies the Dini condition, we prove a new comparison estimate and use it to derive interior and global gradient pointwise estimates by Wolff potential for $p\geq 2$ and Riesz potential for $1&lt;p&lt;2$, respectively. Our interior gradient pointwise estimates can be applied to a class of singular quasilinear elliptic equations with measure data given by $-div(A(x,\nabla u))=\mu$. We generalize the results in the papers of Duzaar and Mingione [Amer. J. Math. 133, 1093-1149 (2011)], Dong and Zhu [J. Eur. Math. Soc. 26, 3939-3985 (2024)], and Nguyen and Phuc [Arch. Rational Mech. Anal. (2023) 247:49], etc., where the coefficient is assumed to be Dini continuous. Moreover, we establish interior and global modulus of continuity estimates of the gradients of solutions.</description>

      <title>Global Bifurcation of Spiral Wave Solutions to the Complex Ginzburg-Landau Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the $\mathbb T^2$-equivariant degree to establish the existence of unbounded branches of rotating spiral wave solutions with any number of arms for the complex Ginzburg Landau equation GLe on the planar unit disc, leveraging the spatial symmetries inherent to the problem and avoiding limiting constraints encountered in previous studies (Dai 2021) that utilized the classical Leray-Schauder degree. Our results provide rigorous mathematical justification for the formation and persistence of these fundamental patterns, which are ubiquitous in physical, chemical, and biological systems but have, until now, eluded formal proof under general conditions.</description>

      <title>Global Spherically Symmetric Solutions and Relaxation Limit for the Relaxed Compressible Navier-Stokes Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies an initial boundary value problem for the multidimensional hyperbolized compressible Navier-Stokes equations, in which the classical Newtonian law is replaced by the Maxwell law. We seek spherically symmetric solutions to the studied system in an exterior domain of a ball in $\mathbb R^3$, which are a system possessing a uniform characteristic boundary. First, we construct an approximate system featuring a non-characteristic boundary and establish its local well-posedness. Subsequently, by defining a suitable weighted energy functional and carefully handling boundary terms, we derive uniform a priori estimates, enabling the proof of uniform global existence. Leveraging these uniform estimates alongside standard compactness arguments, we establish the global well-posedness of the original system. Additionally, we rigorously justify the global relaxation limit.</description>

      <title>Proofs of singularity-free solutions and scalarization in nonlinear Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the global existence and precise estimates of a class of singularity-free cosmological solutions in nonlinear Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet (ESGB) gravity with quadratic coupling, in close agreement with previous numerical results. Our analysis also yields a rigorous mathematical proof of nonlinear spontaneous scalarization, triggered by a tachyonic instability induced by the Gauss-Bonnet term. The proof is based on a set of decoupled differential inequalities for the Hubble parameter $H$, derived from a key structural identity that we refer to as the power identity.</description>

      <title>On the reachable space for parabolic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we provide a description of the reachable space for the heat equation with various lower order terms, set in the euclidean ball of $\mathbb{R}^d$ centered at $0$ and of radius one and controlled from the whole external boundary. Namely, we consider the case of linear heat equations with lower order terms of order $0$ and $1$, and the case of a semilinear heat equations. In the linear case, we prove that any function which can be extended as an holomorphic function in a set of the form $\Omega_\alpha = \{ z\in\mathbb{C}^d \big| |\Re(z)| + \alpha |\Im(z)| &lt; 1\}$ for some $\alpha \in (0,1)$ and which admits a continuous extension up to $\overline\Omega_\alpha$ belongs to the reachable space. In the semilinear case, we prove a similar result for sufficiently small data. Our proofs are based on well-posedness results for the heat equation in a suitable space of holomorphic functions over $\Omega_\alpha$ for $\alpha &gt; 1$.</description>

      <title>Discontinuous shear-thickening asymptotic for power-law systems related to compressible flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the convergence of a power-law model for dilatant compressible fluids to a class of models exhibiting a maximum admissible shear rate, called thick compressible fluids. These kinds of problems were studied previously for elliptic equations, stating with the work of Bhattacharya, E. DiBenedetto and J. Manfredi [Rend. Sem. Mat. Univ. Politec. Torino 1989], and more recently for incompressible fluids by J.F. Rodrigues [J. Math. Sciences 2015]. Our result may be seen as an extension to the compressible setting of these previous works. Physically, this is motivated by the fact that the pressures generated during a squeezing flow are often large, potentially requiring the consideration of compressibility, see M. Fang and R. Gilbert [Z. Anal. Anwend 2004].  Mathematically, the main difficulty in the compressible setting concerns the strong hyperbolicparabolic coupling between the density and velocity field. We obtain two main results, the first concerning the one-dimensional non-stationary compressible power-law system while the second one concerns the semi-stationary multi-dimensional case. Finally, we present an extension in onedimension for a viscous Cauchy stress with singular dependence on the shear rate.</description>

      <title>Boundary vortices in the presence of a magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the behaviour of the magnetization vector field in a thin ferromagnetic film in the presence of an external in-plane constant magnetic field. We work on a specific thin-film regime where boundary vortices dominate the energy and show the Gamma-convergence at the second order of the micromagnetic energy to an energy term called the renormalized energy, representing the interaction energy between boundary vortices. We present a new approach to defining the renormalized energy and rigorously show the relation between this definition and the classical one. We prove the concentration of the energy around boundary vortices, where the location of these vortices depends on the external field applied. We provide some numerical simulations of the magnetization vector field and the renormalized energy versus the location of the vortices in two different domains: the unit disk and an oval-shaped domain.</description>

      <title>Superlinear fractional $\Phi$-Laplacian type problems via the nonlinear Rayleigh quotient with two parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we establish the existence and multiplicity of weak solutions for nonlocal elliptic problems driven by the fractional $\Phi$-Laplacian operator, in the presence of a sign-indefinite nonlinearity. More specifically, we investigate the following nonlocal elliptic problem: \begin{equation*} \left\{\begin{array}{rcl} (-\Delta_\Phi)^s u +V(x)u &amp; = &amp; \mu a(x)|u|^{q-2}u-\lambda |u|^{p-2}u \mbox{ in }\, \mathbb{R}^N, \\ u\in W^{s,\Phi}(\mathbb{R}^N),&amp;&amp; \end{array} \right. \end{equation*} where $s \in (0,1), N \geq 2$ and $\mu, \lambda &gt;0$. Here, the potentials $V, a : \mathbb{R}^N \to \mathbb{R}$ satisfy some suitable hypotheses. Our main objective is to determine sharp values for the parameters $\lambda &gt; 0$ and $\mu &gt; 0$ where the Nehari method can be effectively applied. To achieve this, we utilize the nonlinear Rayleigh quotient along with a detailed analysis of the fibering maps associated with the energy functional. Additionally, we study the asymptotic behavior of the weak solutions to the main problem as $\lambda \to 0$ or $\mu \to +\infty$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the self-contained PDE analysis, this paper investigates the existence and the decay properties of the invariant measure in elliptic homogenization of non-divergence form with an interface assumptions on the leading coefficient $A$ and the drift $b$ for $b_1\equiv 0$, which partially provides an alternative proof of the previous work by Hairer and Manson [Ann. Probab. 39(2011) 648-682]. Moreover, as a direct application after using the analysis by the second author [Calc. Var. Partial Differ. Equ. 64(2025) No. 114], we obtain the quantitative estimates for the homogenization problem.</description>

      <title>Stability of Gel'fand's inverse interior spectral problem for Schr\"odinger operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Gel'fand's inverse interior spectral problem of determining a closed Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ and a potential function $q$ from the knowledge of the eigenvalues $\lambda_j$ of the Schr\"odinger operator $-\Delta_g + q$ and the restriction of the eigenfunctions $\phi_j|_U$ on a given open subset $U\subset M$, where $\Delta_g$ is the Laplace-Beltrami operator on $(M,g)$. We prove that an approximation of finitely many spectral data on $U$ determines a finite metric space that is close to $(M,g)$ in the Gromov-Hausdorff topology, and further determines a discrete function that approximates the potential $q$ with uniform estimates. This leads to a quantitative stability estimate for the inverse interior spectral problem for Schr\"odinger operators in the general case.</description>

Abstract: We establish the local H\"older regularity of the spatial gradient of bounded weak solutions $u\colon E_T\to\R^k$ to the non-linear system of parabolic type \begin{equation*}
  \partial_tu-\Div\Big( a(x,t)\big(\mu^2+|Du|^2\big)^\frac{p-2}2Du\Big)=0
  \qquad\mbox{in $E_T$}, \end{equation*} where $p&gt;1$, $\mu\in[0,1]$, and the coefficient $a\in L^\infty(E_T)$ is bounded below by a positive constant and is H\"older continuous in the space variable $x$. As an application, we prove H\"older estimates for the gradient of weak solutions to a doubly non-linear parabolic equation in the super-critical fast diffusion regime.</description>

      <title>Superlinear gradient growth for 2D Euler equation without boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the vorticity gradient growth of solutions to the two-dimensional Euler equations in domains without boundary, namely in the torus $\mathbb{T}^{2}$ and the whole plane $\mathbb{R}^{2}$. In the torus, whenever we have a steady state $\omega^*$ that is orbitally stable up to a translation and has a saddle point, we construct ${\tilde{\omega}}_0 \in C^\infty(\mathbb{T}^2)$ that is arbitrarily close to $\omega^*$ in $L^2$, such that superlinear growth of the vorticity gradient occurs for an open set of smooth initial data around ${\tilde{\omega}}_0$. This seems to be the first superlinear growth result which holds for an open set of smooth initial data (and does not require any symmetry assumptions on the initial vorticity). Furthermore, we obtain the first superlinear growth result for smooth and compactly supported vorticity in the plane, using perturbations of the Lamb-Chaplygin dipole.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we investigate the question of finding a network configuration of minimal length connecting three given points in the Heisenberg group. After proving existence of (possibly degenerate) minimal horizontal triods, we investigate their characterization. We then formulate a horizontal curve shortening flow that deforms any given suitable initial triod into a critical point for the length functional. Numerical experiments based on a stable fully discrete finite element scheme provide useful insights into the rich landscape of this sub-Riemannian geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study a class of critical Choquard equations with a symmetric potential, i.e. we consider the equation $$-\Delta u +V(|x|) u =\left(|x|^{-\mu}* |u|^{2^\star_\mu}\right)|u|^{2^\star_\mu-2}u,\quad\mbox{in}\quad\mathbb R^N$$ where $V(|x|)$ is a bounded, nonnegative and symmetric potential in $\mathbb R^N$ with $N\geq 5$, $0&lt;\mu\leq 4$, $*$ stands for the standard convolution and $2^\star_\mu:=\frac{2N-\mu}{N-2}$ is the upper critical exponent in the sense of the Hardy - Littlewood - Sobolev inequality. By applying a finite dimensional reduction method we prove that if $r^2V(r)$ has a local maximum point or local minimum point $r_0&gt;0$ with $V(r_0)&gt;0$ then the problem has infinitely many non-radial solutions with arbitrary large energies.</description>

      <title>Causal Fermion Systems: An Introduction to Fundamental Structures, Methods and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06450v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This textbook introduces the basic concepts of the theory of causal fermion systems, a recent approach to the description of fundamental physics. The theory yields quantum mechanics, general relativity and quantum field theory as limiting cases and is therefore a candidate for a unified physical theory. From the mathematical perspective, causal fermion systems provide a general framework for describing and analyzing non-smooth geometries and "quantum geometries." The dynamics is described by a novel variational principle, the causal action principle.
  The book includes a detailed summary of the mathematical and physical preliminaries. It explains the physical concepts behind the causal fermion system approach from the basics. Moreover, all the mathematical objects and structures are introduced step by step. The mathematical methods used for the analysis of causal fermion systems and the causal action principle are introduced in depth. Many examples and applications are worked out.
  The textbook is addressed to master and graduate students in mathematics or physics. Furthermore, it serves as a reference work for researchers working in the field.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we first establish the existence and uniqueness of strong solutions for multivalued McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations (MMVSDEs) driven by Levy noise with non-Lipschitz coefficients. It is important to note that these findings are based upon the well-posedness of strong solutions for MMVSDEs under Lipschitz conditions, which will be stated briefly. Secondly, we study the existence of weak solutions under linear growth condition. Finally, we prove the existence of martingale solutions.</description>

Abstract: We study the interaction between toric Ricci-flat metrics in dimension 4 and axisymmetric harmonic maps from the 3-dimensional Euclidean space into the hyperbolic plane. Applications include
  (1). The construction of complete Ricci-flat 4-manifolds that are non-spin, simply-connected, and with arbitrary second Betti number. Our method is non-perturbative and is based on ruling out conical singularities arising from axisymmetric harmonic maps. These metrics also give systematic counterexamples to various versions of the Riemannian black hole uniqueness conjecture.
  (2). A PDE classification result for axisymmetric harmonic maps of degree at most 1, via the Gibbons-Hawking ansatz and the LeBrun-Tod ansatz, in terms of axisymmetric harmonic functions. This is motivated by the study of hyperkahler and conformally Kahler gravitational instantons.</description>

      <title>Solving nonconvex Hamilton--Jacobi--Isaacs equations with PINN-based policy iteration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a mesh-free policy iteration framework that combines classical dynamic programming with physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to solve high-dimensional, nonconvex Hamilton--Jacobi--Isaacs (HJI) equations arising in stochastic differential games and robust control. The method alternates between solving linear second-order PDEs under fixed feedback policies and updating the controls via pointwise minimax optimization using automatic differentiation. Under standard Lipschitz and uniform ellipticity assumptions, we prove that the value function iterates converge locally uniformly to the unique viscosity solution of the HJI equation. The analysis establishes equi-Lipschitz regularity of the iterates, enabling provable stability and convergence without requiring convexity of the Hamiltonian. Numerical experiments demonstrate the accuracy and scalability of the method. In a two-dimensional stochastic path-planning game with a moving obstacle, our method matches finite-difference benchmarks with relative $L^2$-errors below %10^{-2}%. In five- and ten-dimensional publisher-subscriber differential games with anisotropic noise, the proposed approach consistently outperforms direct PINN solvers, yielding smoother value functions and lower residuals. Our results suggest that integrating PINNs with policy iteration is a practical and theoretically grounded method for solving high-dimensional, nonconvex HJI equations, with potential applications in robotics, finance, and multi-agent reinforcement learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a survey of a number of analytic and geometric results on `fibred cusp spaces'. These results cover topics in spectral geometry, in particular analytic torsion and index theory, and boundary value problems. The underlying tools include a careful microlocal analysis of the resolvent and the heat kernel. We include an exposition of the geometric and analytic foundations and sketch the ideas of the proofs of the main theorems.</description>

Abstract: In this third work in a series, we prove the local-in-time well-posedness of the IBVP for the vacuum Einstein equations in general relativity with twisted DIrichlet boundary conditions on a finite timelike boundary. The boundary conditions consist of specification of the pointwise conformal class of the boundary metric, together with a scalar density involving a combination of the volume form of the bulk metric restricted to the boundary together with the volume form of the boundary metric itself.</description>

      <title>Bicomplex Hardy Classes of Solutions to Beltrami Equations and the Schwarz Boundary Value Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define Hardy classes of bicomplex-valued functions on the complex unit disk which solve bicomplex versions of the Beltrami and related equations. Using representations in terms of their complex-valued counterparts, we show these bicomplex-valued functions recover the boundary behavior associated with the classic holomorphic Hardy spaces. This work generalizes known results for complex-valued functions and continues recent work in the setting of bicomplex analogues of Hardy spaces of both holomorphic and generalized analytic functions. Also, we show Schwarz and Dirichlet boundary value problems associated with the bicomplex Beltrami equation are solvable and provide solution formulas.</description>

      <title>A Nash-Kuiper theorem for isometric immersions in a high codimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to investigating the isometric immersion problem of Riemannian manifolds in a high codimension. It has recently been demonstrated that any short immersion from an $n$-dimensional smooth compact manifold into $2n$-dimensional Euclidean space can be uniformly approximated by $C^{1,\theta}$ isometric immersions with any $\theta\in(0,1/(n+2))$ in dimensions $n\geq3$. In this paper, we improve the H\"{o}lder regularity of the constructed isometric immersions in the local setting, achieving $C^{1,\theta}$ for all $\theta\in(0,1/n)$ in odd dimensions and all $\theta\in(0,1/(n+1))$ in even dimensions. Moreover, we also establish explicit $C^{1}$ estimates for the isometric immersions, which indicate that the larger the initial metric error is, the greater the $C^{1}$ norms of the resulting isometric maps become, meaning that their slope become steeper.</description>

      <title>H\"older regularity of stable solutions to semilinear elliptic equations up to $\mathbf{\mathbb{R}^9}$: full quantitative proofs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.11352v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article concerns the results obtained in [Cabr\'e, Figalli, Ros-Oton, and Serra, Acta Math. 224 (2020)], which established the H\"older regularity of stable solutions to semilinear elliptic equations in the optimal range of dimensions $n\leq 9$. For expository purposes, we provide self-contained proofs of all results. They involve only basic Analysis tools and are intended to be accessible to a broader mathematical audience beyond PDE specialists.
  Two of the results in the 2020 article relied on compactness arguments. Here we present, instead, quantitative proofs from the more recent paper [Cabr\'e, to appear in Amer. J. Math, arXiv:2211.13033]. They allow to quantify the H\"older regularity exponent and simplify significantly the treatment of boundary regularity.
  We also comment on similar progress and open problems for related equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.13841v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a regularity theory for the optimal transport problem when the target is composed of two disjoint convex domains. This is an important model in which singularities arise. Even though the singular set does not exhibit any form of convexity a priori, we prove its higher order regularity by developing novel methods, which also have many other applications. Notably, our results are achieved without requiring any convexity of the source domain. This aligns with Caffarelli's celebrated regularity theory.</description>

We specifically focus on the impact of the Besov smoothness of the initial condition and quantify how it affects the corresponding density estimates for the SDE. In particular, we manage to attain some critical thresholds allowing to revisit/address in a stable noise setting some concrete physical and biological models.</description>

      <title>Interval bifurcation theorems for Fredholm operator and its application to an elliptic overdetermined problem in bounded domains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.04525v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish local interval bifurcation theorem and global interval bifurcation theorem for Fredholm operator with index $0$ via $0$-group. As one of applications, we investigate the existence of a family of nontrivial domains $\Omega_{\rho}\subset \mathbb{R}^N$ ($N=2,3$ or $4$), bifurcating from a small ball, such that the problem \begin{equation} -\Delta u=u-\left(u^+\right)^3\,\, \text{in}\,\,\Omega_{\rho}, \,\, u=0,\,\,\partial_\nu u=\text{const}\,\,\text{on}\,\,\partial\Omega_{\rho} \nonumber \end{equation} has a sign-changing bounded solution. Compared with the recent result \cite[Theorem 2.1]{Ruiz}, here we obtain a family of domains $\Omega_{\rho}$ instead of a sequence of domains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15486v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the optimal constant in the nonlocal nonlinear Poincar\'e-Wirtinger inequality in $(a,b)\subset\mathbb R$: \begin{equation*} \lambda_\alpha(p,q,r){\left(\int_{a}^{b}|u|^{q}dx\right)^\frac pq}\le{\int_{a}^{b}|u'|^{p}dx+\alpha\left|\int_{a}^{b}|u|^{r-2}u\, dx\right|^{\frac p{r-1}}}, \end{equation*}where $\alpha\in\mathbb R$, $p,q,r &gt;1$ such that $\frac{2p}{p+2}\le q\le p$ and $\frac q2+1\le r \le q+\frac q p$. This problem admits a variational characterization in the nonlocal setting, as the associated Euler-Lagrange equation involves an integral term depending on the unknown function over the entire interval of definition.
  We prove the existence of a critical value $\alpha_C=\alpha_C (p,q,r)$ such that the minimizers are even and have constant sign for $\alpha\le\alpha_{C}$, while they are odd for $\alpha\geq \alpha_{C}$.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Reductibility Experiments of RANS-Inspired Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Prior to any statistical averaging we derive a rotational form of the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations, eliminating the pressure and exposing a velocity--vorticity interplay governed by \[ \partial_t(\boldsymbol{\omega}+\boldsymbol{\tilde{\omega}})
  +(\mathbf{v}\cdot\nabla)\boldsymbol{\omega}
  +(\mathbf{\tilde{v}}\cdot\nabla)\boldsymbol{\tilde{\omega}}
  +(\mathbf{v}\cdot\nabla)\boldsymbol{\tilde{\omega}}
  +(\mathbf{\tilde{v}}\cdot\nabla)\boldsymbol{\omega}
  -\nu\Delta(\boldsymbol{\omega}+\boldsymbol{\tilde{\omega}})=\mathbf{0}. \] All terms are differential polynomials; hence the system generates a differential--algebraic ideal. Using the Rosenfeld--Groebner algorithm we obtain an equivalent triangular hierarchy whose first equation involves a single variable, the second at most two, and so on. This decoupling clarifies how prescribed mean-flow data drive the turbulent fluctuations and provides a hierarchy-ready foundation for physics-informed or physics-embedded neural networks. Energy estimates in Sobolev spaces complement the algebraic reduction and establish local well-posedness when the initial kinetic energy of the velocity and its curl is finite. The joint algebraic--energetic framework thus offers a pressure-free, computationally economical platform for data-driven turbulence analysis.</description>

      <title>Long time derivation of the Boltzmann equation from hard sphere dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07818v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a rigorous derivation of Boltzmann's kinetic equation from the hard sphere system for rarefied gas, which is valid for arbitrarily long times, as long as the solution to the Boltzmann equation exists. This extends Lanford's landmark theorem (1975), which justifies this derivation for a sufficiently short time. In a companion paper (arXiv:2503.01800), we connect this derivation to existing literature on hydrodynamic limits. This completes the resolution of Hilbert's Sixth Problem pertaining to the derivation of fluid equations from Newton's laws, in the case of a rarefied, hard sphere gas.
  The general strategy follows the paradigm introduced by the first two authors for the long-time derivation of the wave kinetic equation in wave turbulence theory. This is based on propagating a long-time cumulant ansatz, which keeps memory of the full collision history of the relevant particles, by an important partial time expansion. The heart of the matter is proving the smallness of these cumulants in $L^1$, which can be reduced to combinatorial properties for the associated diagrams which we call molecules. These properties are then proved by devising an elaborate cutting algorithm, which is a major novelty of this work.</description>

      <title>Cylindrical extensions of critical Sobolev type inequalities and identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate cylindrical extensions of critical Sobolev type (improved Hardy) inequalities and identities in the style of Badiale-Tarantello [BT02], which in a special case give a critical Hardy inequality and its stability results. We also obtain higher-order identities, which interestingly include well-known numbers like double factorial, Oblong numbers, and Stirling numbers of the second kind. All functional identities are obtained in $L^{p}$ for $p\in (1,\infty)$ without the real-valued function assumption, which gives a simple and direct understanding of the corresponding inequalities as well as the nonexistence of nontrivial extremizers. As applications, we obtain Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg type inequalities with logarithmic weights, which in a particular case give the critical case of the Heisenberg-Pauli-Weyl type uncertainty principle. We also discuss these results in the setting of Folland and Stein's homogeneous Lie groups. A special focus is devoted to stratified Lie groups, where Sobolev type inequalities become intricately intertwined with the properties of sub-Laplacians and more general subelliptic partial differential equations. The obtained results are already new even in the classical Euclidean setting with respect to the range of parameters and the arbitrariness of the choice of any homogeneous quasi-norm. Most inequalities are obtained with sharp constants.</description>

Abstract: We consider the nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger equation with a potential, also known as Gross-Pitaevskii equation. By introducing a suitable spectral localization, we prove low regularity error estimates for the time discretization corresponding to an adapted Lie-Trotter splitting scheme. The proof is based on tools from spectral theory and pseudodifferential calculus in order to obtain various estimates on the spectral localization, including discrete Strichartz estimates which support the nonlinear analysis.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we study the Calder\'on problem for nonlocal generalizations of the semilinear Moore--Gibson--Thompson (MGT) equation and the Jordan--Moore--Gibson--Thompson (JMGT) equation of Westervelt-type. These partial differential equations are third order wave equations that appear in nonlinear acoustics, describe the propagation of high-intensity sound waves and exhibit finite speed of propagation. For semilinear MGT equations with nonlinearity $g$ and potential $q$, we show the following uniqueness properties of the Dirichlet to Neumann (DN) map $\Lambda_{q,g}$:
  (i) If $g$ is a polynomial-type nonlinearity whose $m$-th order derivative is bounded, then $\Lambda_{q,g}$ uniquely determines $q$ and $(\partial^{\ell}_\tau g(x,t,0))_{2\leq \ell \leq m}$.
  (ii) If $g$ is a polyhomogeneous nonlinearity of finite order $L$, then $\Lambda_{q,g}$ uniquely determines $q$ and $g$.
  The uniqueness proof for polynomial-type nonlinearities is based on a higher order linearization scheme, while the proof for polyhomogeneous nonlinearities only uses a first order linearization. Finally, we demonstrate that a first linearization suffices to uniquely determine Westervelt-type nonlinearities from the related DN maps. We also remark that all the unknowns, which we wish to recover from the DN data, are allowed to depend on time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15658v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we use the theory of nonlinear semigroups to establish the existence and uniqueness of both local and global solutions for a partial differential-algebraic equation (PDAE) of index one. This method is applied to a reaction-diffusion system coupled with an elliptic equation in one dimension by transforming the PDAE into a system of linear evolution equations with a Lipschitz-continuous perturbation</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the effect of symmetric radial decreasing rearrangement on fractional Orlicz-Sobolev seminorm in domains. Roughly speaking, we prove that symmetric radial decreasing rearrangement can increase the fractional Orlicz-Sobolev seminorm in domains. Our result extends that of Li-Wang [Commun. Contemp. Math. 21.07 (2019): 1850059.] to the setting of fractional seminorm in domains admitting behaviors more general than powers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07271v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain semiclassical resolvent estimates for the Schr{\"o}dinger operator (ih$\nabla$ + b)^2 + V in R^d , d $\ge$ 3, where h is a semiclassical parameter, V and b are real-valued electric and magnetic potentials independent of h. Under quite general assumptions, we prove that the norm of the weighted resolvent is bounded by exp(Ch^{-2} log(h^{ -1} )) . We get better resolvent bounds for electric potentials which are H{\"o}lder with respect to the radial variable and magnetic potentials which are H{\"o}lder with respect to the space variable. For long-range electric potentials which are Lipschitz with respect to the radial variable and long-range magnetic potentials which are Lipschitz with respect to the space variable we obtain a resolvent bound of the form exp(Ch^{-1}) .</description>

      <title>Critical exponent for the one-dimensional wave equation with a space-dependent scale invariant damping and time derivative nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07313v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate in this paper the Cauchy problem of the one-dimensional wave equation with space-dependent damping of the form $\mu_0(1+x^2)^{-1/2}$, where $\mu_0&gt;0$, and time derivative nonlinearity.
  We establish global existence of mild solutions for small data compactly supported by employing energy estimates within suitable Sobolev spaces of the associated homogeneous problem.
  Furthermore, we derive a blow-up result under some positive initial data by employing the test function method. This shows that the critical exponent is given by $p_G(1+\mu_0)=1+2/\mu_0$, when $\mu_0\in (0,1]$, where $p_G$ is the Glassey exponent. To the best of our knowledge, this constitutes the first identification of the critical exponent range for this class of equations. As by product, we extend the global existence result to a more general class of space/time nonlinearities of the form $f(\partial_tu,\partial_x u)=|\partial_x u|^{q}$ or $f(\partial_tu,\partial_x u)=|\partial_tu|^{p}|\partial_x u|^{q}$, with $p,q&gt;1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04238v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a general approach for quantitative convergence analysis of non-reversible Markov processes, based on the concept of second-order lifts and a variational approach to hypocoercivity. To this end, we introduce the flow Poincar{\'e} inequality, a space-time Poincar{\'e} inequality along trajectories of the semigroup, and a general divergence lemma based only on the Dirichlet form of an underlying reversible diffusion. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach by applying it to a pair of run-and-tumble particles with jamming, a model from non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, and several piecewise deterministic Markov processes used in sampling applications, in particular including general stochastic jump kernels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14699v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Cauchy problem for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in dimension three and construct initial data in the critical space $BMO^{-1}$ from which there exist two distinct global solutions, both smooth for all $t&gt;0$. One consequence of this construction is the sharpness of the celebrated small data global well-posedness result of Koch and Tataru. This appears to be the first example of non-uniqueness for the Navier-Stokes equations with data at the critical regularity. The proof is based on a non-uniqueness mechanism proposed by the second author in the context of the dyadic Navier-Stokes equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers the Helmholtz problem in the exterior of a ball with Dirichlet boundary conditions and radiation conditions imposed at infinity. The differential Helmholtz operator depends on the complex wavenumber with non-negative real part and is formulated for general spatial dimension. We prove wavenumber explicit continuity estimates of the corresponding Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) operator which are valid for all wavenumbers under consideration and do not deteriorate as they tend to zero.
  The exterior Helmholtz problem can be equivalently reformulated on a bounded domain with DtN boundary conditions on the artificial boundary of a ball. We derive wavenumber independent trace and Friedrichs-type inequalities for the solution space in wavenumber-indexed norms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23143v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study free-discontinuity functionals in nonlinear elasticity, where discontinuities correspond to the phenomenon of cavitation. The energy comprises two terms: a volume term accounting for the elastic energy; and a surface term concentrated on the boundaries of the cavities in the deformed configuration that depends on their unit normal. First, we prove the existence of energy-minimizing deformations. While the treatment of the volume term is standard, that of the surface term relies on the regularity of inverse deformations, their weak continuity properties, and Ambrosio's lower semicontinuity theorem for special functions of bounded variation. Additionally, we identify sufficient conditions for minimality by employing outer variations and applying the formula for the first derivative of the anisotropic perimeter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a rigorous analytical framework for a coupled stochastic fluid-rigid body system in $\mathbb{R}^3$. The model describes the motion of a rigid ball immersed in an incompressible Newtonian fluid subjected to both additive noise in the fluid and body equations and transport-type noise in the fluid equation. We establish local strong well-posedness of the resulting system by combining stochastic maximal $\mathrm{L}^p$-regularity theory with a decoupling approach for the associated fluid-structure operator. A key step is to prove the boundedness of the $\mathcal{H}^\infty$-calculus for this operator. In addition, we provide blow-up criteria for the maximal existence time of solutions. To our knowledge, this is the first rigorous treatment of strong solutions of stochastic fluid-structure interactions.</description>

      <title>A degree-counting formula for a Keller-Segel equation on a surface with boundary</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12783v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the following Keller-Segel equation on a compact Riemann surface $(\Sigma, g)$ with smooth boundary $\partial\Sigma$: \[
  -\Delta_g u = \rho\Big(\frac{V e^u}{\int_{\Sigma} V e^u \mathrm{d} v_g} - \frac{1}{|\Sigma|_g}\Big) \text{ in } {\Sigma}, \quad \text{ with }
  \partial_{\nu_g} u = 0 \text{ on } \partial \Sigma, \]
  where $V$ is a smooth positive function on $\Sigma$ and $\rho &gt; 0$ is a parameter.
  We perform a refined blow-up analysis of bubbling solutions and establish sharper a priori estimates around their concentration points. We then compute the Morse index of these solutions and use it to derive a counting formula for the Leray-Schauder degree in the non-resonant case (i.e., $\rho \notin 4 \pi \mathbb{N}$). Our approach follows the strategy suggested by Y. Y. Li [33] and later implemented by C.-S. Lin and C.-C. Chen [15,16] for the mean field equations on closed surfaces and employs techniques from Bahri's critical points at infinity [8].</description>

      <title>Sobolev inequality and its extremal functions for homogeneous H\"{o}rmander vector fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16125v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Sobolev inequality and the existence of its extremal functions in the setting of homogeneous H\"{o}rmander vector fields. A principal result establishes a mutual inclusion between the set of volume growth rates of subunit balls and the set of admissible Sobolev conjugate exponents on an arbitrary open subset $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^n$. Our analysis yields a precise characterization of the dependence of the exponents on the volume growth and determines their optimal admissible range. As a consequence, we obtain a global Sobolev inequality on $\mathbb{R}^n$.
  The second part of the paper investigates the attainability of the optimal Sobolev constant in degenerate cases. We develop a refined concentration-compactness lemma adapted to the structure of homogeneous H\"{o}rmander vector fields. We then prove that the optimal Sobolev constant is attained under a broad algebraic condition, namely, that the volume-preserving automorphism group of homogeneous H\"{o}rmander vector fields acts transitively on the maximal level set of the pointwise homogeneous dimension. This result holds for general homogeneous H\"{o}rmander vector fields in non-equiregular degenerate cases, significantly extending the analysis beyond a specific class of Grushin-type vector fields.</description>

      <title>Telegrapher's Generative Model via Kac Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We break the mold in flow-based generative modeling by proposing a new model based on the damped wave equation, also known as telegrapher's equation. Similar to the diffusion equation and Brownian motion, there is a Feynman-Kac type relation between the telegrapher's equation and the stochastic Kac process in 1D. The Kac flow evolves stepwise linearly in time, so that the probability flow is Lipschitz continuous in the Wasserstein distance and, in contrast to diffusion flows, the norm of the velocity is globally bounded. Furthermore, the Kac model has the diffusion model as its asymptotic limit. We extend these considerations to a multi-dimensional stochastic process which consists of independent 1D Kac processes in each spatial component. We show that this process gives rise to an absolutely continuous curve in the Wasserstein space and compute the conditional velocity field starting in a Dirac point analytically. Using the framework of flow matching, we train a neural network that approximates the velocity field and use it for sample generation. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the scalability of our approach, and show its advantages over diffusion models.</description>

      <title>Two types of compressible isotropic neo-Hookean material models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22244v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this contribution, we present a systematic study of the performance of two known types of compressible generalization of the incompressible neo-Hookean material model. The first type of generalization is based on the development of vol-iso neo-Hookean models and involves the additive decomposition of the elastic energy into volumetric and isochoric parts. The second simpler type of generalization is based on the development of mixed neo-Hookean models that do not use this decomposition. Theoretical studies of model performance and simulations of some homogeneous deformations have shown that when using volumetric functions $(J^q+J^{-q}-2)/(2q^2)$ ($J$ is the volume ratio, and $q\in \mathbb{R}$ is a parameter, $q\geq 0$) from the Hartmann-Neff family [Hartmann and Neff, Int. J. Solids Structures, 40: 2767-2791 (2003)] with parameter $q\geq 2$ (the preferred value is $q=5$), mixed and vol-iso models show similar performance in applications and have physically reasonable responses in extreme states, which is convenient for theoretical studies. However, contrary to vol-iso models, mixed models allow the use of a wider set of volumetric functions with physically reasonable responses in extreme states. A further feature of mixed models is simpler expressions for stresses and tangent stiffness tensors.</description>

Abstract: The large time behavior for Lions-Feireisl's finite energy weak solutions to the barotropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations with large potential external forces in three-dimensional (3D) bounded domains is considered. Although the equilibrium state of density is not a constant anymore due to the non-constant external forces, by constructing a suitable Lyapunov functional and using the extra integrability of the density, after expanding the difference of the density and its steady state in a Taylor series with respect to the difference of some power function of density
  and that of the steady density, it is proved that any Lions-Feireisl's finite energy weak solution would decay exponentially to the equilibrium state as time tends to infinity.</description>

      <title>Free-surface Euler equations with density variations, and shallow-water limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study the well-posedness in Sobolev spaces of the incompressible Euler equations in an infinite strip delimited from below by a non-flat bottom and from above by a free-surface. We allow the presence of vorticity and density variations, and in these regards the present system is an extension of the well-studied water waves equations. When the bottom is flat and with no density variations (but when the flow is not necessarily irrotational), our study provides an alternative proof of the already known large-time well-posedness results for the water waves equations. Our main contribution is that we allow for the presence of density variations, while also keeping track of the dependency in the shallow water parameter. This allows us to justify the convergence from the free-surface Euler equations towards the non-linear shallow water equations in this setting. Using an already established large time existence result for these latter equations, we also prove the existence of the free-surface Euler equations on a logarithmic time-scale, in a suitable regime.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically sharp stability of Sobolev inequalities on the Heisenberg group with dimension-dependent constants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we are concerned with the optimal asymptotic lower bound for the stability of Sobolev inequality on the Heisenberg group. We first establish the optimal local stability of Sobolev inequality on the CR sphere through bispherical harmonics and complicated orthogonality technique ( see Lemma 3.1). The loss of rearrangement inequality in the CR setting makes it impossible to use any rearrangement flow technique (either differential rearrangement flow or integral rearrangement flow) to derive the optimal stability of Sobolev inequality on the CR sphere from corresponding optimal local stability. To circumvent this, we will use the CR Yamabe flow to establish the optimal stability of Sobolev inequality on the Heisenberg group with the dimension-dependent constants (see Theorem 1.1). As an application, we also establish the optimal stability of the Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev (HLS) inequality for special conformal index with the dimension-dependent constants (see Theorem 1.3). Our approach is rearrangement-free and can be used to study the optimal stability problem for fractional Sobolev inequality or HLS inequality on the Heisenberg group once the corresponding continuous flow is established.</description>

      <title>Pointwise convergence to initial data of heat and Poisson equations in Modulation Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13220v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize weighted modulation spaces (data space) for which the heat semigroup $e^{-tL}f$ converges pointwise to the initial data $f$ as time $t$ tends to zero. Here $L$ stands for the standard Laplacian $-\Delta $ or Hermite operator $H=-\Delta +|x|^2$ on the whole domain. Similar result also holds for Poisson semigroup $e^{-t\sqrt{L}}f.$ We also prove that the Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator operates on certain modulation spaces. This may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Path-dependent PDEs for volatility derivatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08289v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We regard options on VIX and Realised Variance as solutions to path-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) in a continuous stochastic volatility model. The modeling assumption specifies that the instantaneous variance is a $C^3$ function of a multidimensional Gaussian Volterra process; this includes a large class of models suggested for the purpose of VIX option pricing, either rough, or not, or mixed. We unveil the path-dependence of those volatility derivatives and, under a regularity hypothesis on the payoff function, we prove the well-posedness of the associated PDE. The latter is of heat type, because of the Gaussian assumption, and the terminal condition is also path-dependent. Furthermore, formulae for the greeks are provided, the implied volatility is shown to satisfy a quasi-linear path-dependent PDE and, in Markovian models, finite-dimensional pricing PDEs are obtained for VIX options.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14051v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $(\mathbb{G},\circ)$ be a stratified Lie group. We estimate the Hausdorff dimension (with respect to the Carnot-Carath\'eodory metric) of the singular sets in $\mathbb{G}$, where a positive solution of the Heat equation corresponding to a sub-Laplacian, blows up faster than a prescribed rate along normal limits, in terms of the homogeneous dimension of $\mathbb{G}$ and the rate of the blowup parameter. This generalizes a classical result of Watson for the Euclidean Heat. We also obtain a corresponding sharpness result, which is new even for $\mathbb{R}^n$.</description>

      <title>Shadowing for Infinite Dimensional Dynamical Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08315v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we extend to an infinite dimensional setting some results on the shadowing property that are known on finite dimensional compact manifolds without border and in $\mathbb{R}^n$. In fact, we show that if $\{\T(t):t\ge 0\}$ is a Morse-Smale semigroup defined in a Hilbert space with a global attractor $\mathcal{A}$ and non-wandering set given only by its equilibria, then $\T(1)|_{\mathcal{A}}:\mathcal{A}\to \mathcal{A} $ admits the Lipschitz Shadowing property. Moreover, for any positively invariant bounded neighborhood $\U\supset\mathcal{A}$ of the global attractor, the map $\T(1)|_{\U}:\U\to \U$ has the H\"{o}lder-Shadowing property. We obtain results related to the structural stability of Morse-Smale semigroups, that were only known on finite dimension and continuity of global attractors.</description>

      <title>A large data semi-global existence and convergence theorem for vacuum Einstein's equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11289v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a convergence theorem for the $(3+1)$-dimensional vacuum Einstein equations with positive cosmological constant on spacetimes $\widetilde{M} \cong M \times \mathbb{R}$, where $M$ is a closed, connected, oriented three-manifold of negative Yamabe type. In constant mean curvature transported spatial coordinates, we show that solutions arising from arbitrarily large initial data converge to a Riemannian metric of constant negative scalar curvature in infinite Newtonian-like' time'. As a consequence, the Einstein-$\Lambda$ flow generically fails to produce geometrization in the sense of Thurston and violates the cosmological principle. Our results affirm a conjecture of Ringstr\"om concerning the asymptotic indistinguishability of spatial topology in the large data regime. A related result is established for positive Yamabe type under a technical condition.</description>

      <title>Compact implicit high resolution numerical method for solving transport problems with sorption isotherms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16110v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates numerical methods to solve nonlinear transport problems characterized by various sorption isotherms with a focus on the Freundlich type of isotherms. We describe and compare second order accurate numerical schemes, focusing on implicit methods, to effectively model transport phenomena without stability restriction on the choice of time steps. Furthermore, a high resolution form of the method is proposed that limits a priori the second order accurate scheme towards first order accuracy to keep the values of numerical solutions in a physically acceptable range. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of high resolution methods in minimizing oscillations near discontinuities, thereby enhancing solution plausibility. The observed convergence rates confirm that the second order accurate schemes achieve expected accuracy for smooth solutions and that they yield significant improvements when compared with the results of the first order scheme. As the computational cost of the compact implicit method seems to be comparable to similar explicit ones with a clear profit of unconditional stability, this research provides a practical tool toward numerical simulations of nonlinear transport phenomena applicable in various fields such as contaminant transport in porous media or column liquid chromatography.</description>

      <title>A minimax method for the spectral fractional Laplacian and related evolution problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a numerical method for the approximation of the inverse of the fractional Laplacian $(-\Delta)^{s}$, based on its spectral definition, using rational functions to approximate the fractional power $A^{-s}$ of a matrix $A$, for $0&lt;s&lt;1$. The proposed numerical method is fast and accurate, benefiting from the fact that the matrix $A$ arises from a finite element approximation of the Laplacian $-\Delta$, which makes it applicable to a wide range of domains with potentially irregular shapes. We make use of state-of-the-art software to compute the best rational approximation of a fractional power. We analyze the convergence rate of our method and validate our findings through a series of numerical experiments with a range of exponents $s \in (0,1)$. Additionally, we apply the proposed numerical method to different evolution problems that involve the fractional Laplacian through an interaction potential: the fractional porous medium equation and the fractional Keller-Segel equation. We then investigate the accuracy of the resulting numerical method, focusing in particular on the accurate reproduction of qualitative properties of the associated analytical solutions to these partial differential equations.</description>

      <title>On the zero sets of harmonic polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24116v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider nonzero harmonic polynomials vanishing on certain subvarieties. Among other things, we give a positive solution to the Problem 151 from the Scottish Book posed by R. Wavre in 1936. In more detail, we construct a nonzero harmonic polynomial in the whole space that vanishes on the edges of the unit cube. Moreover, using harmonic morphisms we construct certain new nontrivial families of harmonic polynomials that vanish at the same set in the unit ball in n-dimensional space for all n greater than or equal to 4. This extends results of Logunov and Malinnikova. We also present some presumably new constructions of nontrivial harmonic functions whose zero sets are unions of affine subspaces.</description>

      <title>P\'olya's conjecture up to $\epsilon$-loss and quantitative estimates for the remainder of Weyl's law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04307v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ be a bounded Lipschitz domain. For any $\epsilon\in (0,1)$ we show that for any Dirichlet eigenvalue $\lambda_k(\Omega)&gt;\Lambda(\epsilon,\Omega)$, it holds \begin{align*} k&amp;\le (1+\epsilon)\frac{|\Omega|\omega(n)}{(2\pi)^n}\lambda_k(\Omega)^{n/2}, \end{align*} where $\Lambda(\epsilon,\Omega)$ is given explicitly. This estimate is based on a uniform estimate on the remainder of the Weyl law with explicit constants so that it reduces the $\epsilon$-loss version of P\'olya's conjecture to a computational problem. Our arguments in deriving such uniform estimates yield also, in all dimensions $n\ge 2$, classes of domains that may even have rather irregular shapes or boundaries but satisfy P\'olya's conjecture.</description>

      <title>Quantitative isoperimetric inequalities in capillarity problems and cones in strong and barycentric forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07686v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study quantitative isoperimetric inequalities for two different perimeter-type functionals. We first consider classical capillarity functionals, which measure the perimeter of sets in a Euclidean half-space, assigning a constant weight $\lambda \in (-1, 1)$ to the portion of the boundary that lies on the boundary of the half-space. We then consider the relative perimeter of sets contained in some suitable convex cone in the Euclidean space. In both settings, we establish sharp quantitative isoperimetric inequalities in the so-called strong form. More precisely, we show that the isoperimetric deficit of a competitor not only controls the Fraenkel asymmetry, but it also controls an oscillation asymmetry that measures how much the unit normals to the boundary of a competitor deviate from those of an isoperimetric set. Our technique is also able to explicitly identify a center that can be employed to compute the asymmetries. In particular, we also derive barycentric versions of these quantitative isoperimetric inequalities (both in the classical and in the strong form). The proofs are based on the derivation of Fuglede-type estimates for graphs defined on general spherically convex domains, in combination with a new application of the selection principle that directly provides the inequalities in barycentric form.</description>

      <title>Energy inequalities for cutoff functions of $p$-energies on metric measures spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08577v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For $p\in(1,+\infty)$, and for a $p$-energy on a metric measure space, we establish equivalent conditions for the conjunction of the Poincar\'e inequality and the cutoff Sobolev inequality. In particular, we employ a technique of Trudinger and Wang [Amer. J. Math. 124 (2002), no. 2, 369--410] to derive a Wolff potential estimate for superharmonic functions, and a method of Holopainen [Contemp. Math. 338 (2003), 219--239] to prove the elliptic Harnack inequality for harmonic functions. As applications, we make progress toward the capacity conjecture of Grigor'yan, Hu, and Lau [Springer Proc. Math. Stat. 88 (2014), 147--207], and we prove that the $p$-energy measure is singular with respect to the Hausdorff measure on the Sierpi\'nski carpet for all $p&gt;1$, resolving a problem posed by Murugan and Shimizu [Comm. Pure Appl. Math. 78 (2025), no. 9, 1523--1608].</description>
