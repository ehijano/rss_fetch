      <title>Hardy--Littlewood maximal operators on certain manifolds with bounded geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the $L^p$ boundedness of the centred and the uncentred Hardy--Littlewood maximal operators on certain Riemannian manifolds with bounded geometry. Our results complement those of various authors. We show that, under mild assumptions, $L^p$ estimates for the centred operator are ``stable'' under conformal changes of the metric, and prove sharp~$L^p$ estimates for the centred operator on Riemannian models with pinched negative scalar curvature. Furthermore, we prove that the centred operator is of weak type $(1,1)$ on the connected sum of two space forms with negative curvature, whereas the uncentred operator is, perhaps surprisingly, bounded only on $L^\infty$. We also prove that if two locally doubling geodesic metric measure spaces enjoying the uniform ball size condition are strictly quasi-isometric, then they share the same boundedness properties for both the centred and the uncentred maximal operator. Finally, we discuss some $L^p$ mapping properties for the centred operator on a specific Riemannian surface introduced by Str\"omberg, providing new interesting results.</description>

      <title>Unique expansions in number systems via solutions of refinement equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the subdivision schemes theory, we develop a criterion to check if any natural number has at most one representation in the $n$-ary number system with a set of non-negative integer digits $A=\{a_1, a_2,\ldots, a_n\}$ that contains zero. This uniqueness property is shown to be equivalent to a certain restriction on the roots of the trigonometric polynomial $\sum_{k=1}^n e^{-2\pi i a_k t}$. From this criterion, under a natural condition of irreducibility for $A$, we deduce that in case of prime~$n$ the uniqueness holds if and only if the digits of $A$ are distinct modulo $n$, whereas for any composite $n$ we show that the latter condition is not necessary. We also establish the connection of this uniqueness to the semigroup freeness problem for affine integer functions of equal integer slope; this together with the two criteria allows to fill the gap in the work of D.Klarner on Erd\"os question about densities of affine integer orbits and establish a simple algorithm to check the freeness and the positivity of density when the slope is a prime number.</description>

      <title>Global Existence and Nonlinear Stability of Finite-Energy Solutions of the Compressible Euler-Riesz Equations with Large Initial Data of Spherical Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The compressible Euler-Riesz equations are fundamental with wide applications in astrophysics, plasma physics, and mathematical biology. In this paper, we are concerned with the global existence and nonlinear stability of finite-energy solutions of the multidimensional Euler-Riesz equations with large initial data of spherical symmetry. We consider both attractive and repulsive interactions for a wide range of Riesz and logarithmic potentials for dimensions larger than or equal to two. This is achieved by the inviscid limit of the solutions of the corresponding Cauchy problem for the Navier-Stokes-Riesz equations. The strong convergence of the vanishing viscosity solutions is achieved through delicate uniform estimates in $L^p$. It is observed that, even if the attractive potential is super-Coulomb, no concentration is formed near the origin in the inviscid limit. Moreover, we prove that the nonlinear stability of global finite-energy solutions for the Euler-Riesz equations is unconditional under a spherically symmetric perturbation around the steady solutions. Unlike the Coulomb case where the potential can be represented locally, the singularity and regularity of the nonlocal radial Riesz potential near the origin require careful analysis, which is a crucial step. Finally, unlike the Coulomb case, a Gr\"onwall type estimate is required to overcome the difficulty of the appearance of boundary terms in the sub-Coulomb case and the singularity of the super-Coulomb potential. Furthermore, we prove the nonlinear stability of global finite-energy solutions for the compressible Euler-Riesz equations around steady states by employing concentration compactness arguments. Steady states properties are obtained by variational arguments connecting to recent advances in aggregation-diffusion equations.</description>

      <title>Sum of $g-$frames in Hilbert $C^{\ast}-$modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we study g-frames in Hilbert $C^*$-modules and investigate conditions under which the sum of two g-frames (or a g-frame and a g-Bessel sequence) remains a g-frame. We also address the stability of g-frames under certain perturbations and provide illustrative examples in the context of $C^*$-algebras. Our results unify and extend many of the existing theorems on g-frames, focusing on the invertibility of associated operators as a key condition for guaranteeing that sums of g-frames preserve the g-frame property.</description>

      <title>Complete characterization of symmetric Kubo-Ando operator means satisfying Moln\'ar's weak associativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a complete characterization of a subclass of weakly associative means of positive operators in the class of symmetric Kubo-Ando means. This class, which includes the geometric mean, was first introduced and studied in L. Moln\'ar, ``Characterizations of certain means of positive operators," Linear Algebra Appl. 567 (2019) 143-166, where he gives a characterization of this subclass (which we call the Moln\'ar class of means) in terms of the properties of their representing operator monotone functions. Moln\'ar's paper leaves open the problem of determining if the geometric mean is the only such mean in that subclass. Here we give a negative answer to this question by constructing an order-preserving bijection between this class and a class of real measurable odd periodic functions bounded in absolute value by $1/2$. Each member of the latter class defines a Molnar mean by an explicit exponential-integral representation. From this we are able to understand the order structure of the Moln\'ar class and construct several infinite families of explicit examples of Moln\'ar means that are not the geometric mean. Our analysis also shows how to modify Moln\'ar's original characterization so that the geometric mean is the only one satisfying the requisite set of properties.</description>

      <title>Quantitative stability in optimal transport for general power costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish novel quantitative stability results for optimal transport problems with respect to perturbations in the target measure. We provide explicit bounds on the stability of optimal transport potentials and maps, which are relevant for both theoretical and practical applications. Our results apply to a wide range of costs, including all Wasserstein distances with power cost exponent strictly larger than $1$ and leverage mostly assumptions on the source measure, such as log-concavity and bounded support. Our work provides a significant step forward in the understanding of stability of optimal transport problems, as previous results where mostly limited to the case of the quadratic cost.</description>

      <title>Vector Fourier analysis on compact groups and Assiamoua spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper shows how a family of function spaces (coined as Assiamoua spaces) plays a fundamental role in the Fourier analysis of vector-valued functions compact groups. These spaces make it possible to transcribe the classic results of Fourier analysis in the framework of analysis of vector-valued functions and vector measures. The construction of Sobolev spaces of vector-valued functions on compact groups rests heavily on the members of the aforementioned family.</description>

      <title>Generalized Hilbert Operator Acting on Hardy Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\alpha&gt;0$ and $\mu$ be a positive Borel measure on the interval $[0,1)$. The Hankel matrix $\mathcal{H}_{\mu,\alpha}=(\mu_{n,k,\alpha})_{n,k\ge0}$ with entries $\mu_{n,k,\alpha}=\int_{[0,1)}^{}\frac{\Gamma(n+\alpha)}{\Gamma(n+1)\Gamma(\alpha)}t^{n+k}d\mu(t)$, induces, formally, the generalized-Hilbert operator as $$ \mathcal{H}_{\mu,\alpha}\left ( f \right ) \left ( z \right ) =\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \left (\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \mu_{n,k,\alpha}a_k \right )z^n,z\in\mathbb{D} $$ where $f(z)={\textstyle \sum_{k=0}^{\infty }} a_kz^k$ is an analytic function in $\mathbb{D}$. This article is devoted study the measures $\mu$ for which $\mathcal{H}_{\mu,\alpha }$ is a bounded(resp., compact) operator from $H^p(0&lt;p\le1)$ into $H^p(1\le q&lt;\infty)$. Then, we also study the analogous problem in the Hardy spaces $H^p(1\le p\le2)$. Finally, we obtain the essential norm of $\mathcal{H}_{\mu,\alpha}$ from $H^p(0&lt;p\le1)$ into $H^p(1\le q&lt;\infty)$.</description>

      <title>Translation-Invariant Behavior of General Scattering Transforms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21030v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main result of our paper offers an alternative, simpler, proof of Mallat's result on the translation invariance of the limiting behavior of sequences of Wavelet Scattering Transforms, which (unlike Mallat's proof) does not rely on the admissibility condition or on the density of a logarithmic Sobolev space in $L^2$. Furthermore, this result is generalized to a broader class of scattering transforms, including, for instance, a modification of the Fourier Scattering Transform. As a result, we also prove a new upper bound for the translation contraction for the Fourier Scattering Transform.</description>

      <title>Pointwise convergence of solutions of the Schr\"odinger equation along general curves on Damek-Ricci spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14020v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the most celebrated problems in Euclidean Harmonic analysis is the Carleson's problem: determining the optimal regularity of the initial condition $f$ of the Schr\"odinger equation given by \begin{equation*} \begin{cases}
  i\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} =\Delta u\:,\: (x,t) \in \mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R} \newline
  u(0,\cdot)=f\:, \text{ on } \mathbb{R}^n \:,
  \end{cases} \end{equation*} in terms of the index $\beta$ such that $f$ belongs to the inhomogeneous Sobolev space $H^\beta(\mathbb{R}^n)$, so that the solution of the Schr\"odinger operator $u$ converges pointwise to $f$, \begin{equation*} \displaystyle\lim_{t \to 0+} u(x,t)=f(x), \text{ almost everywhere}. \end{equation*} Recently, the author considered the Carleson's problem for the Schr\"odinger equation with radial initial data on Damek-Ricci spaces and obtained the sharp bound up to the endpoint $\beta \ge 1/4$.
  Interpreting the above as convergence along vertical lines, in this article, we consider the problem of pointwise convergence via more general approach paths. By constructing a counter-example on the $3$-dimensional Real Hyperbolic space, we show that the solutions of the Schr\"odinger equation, unlike Harmonic functions or solutions of the Heat equation, do not admit any natural wide approach region. We then study their pointwise convergence properties on Damek-Ricci spaces along general curves that satisfy certain H\"older conditions and bilipschitz conditions in the distance from the identity and again obtain the sharp bound up to the endpoint $\beta \ge 1/4$. Certain Euclidean analogues are also obtained.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10821v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the space of bounded linear operators on a Banach space equipped with a norm which is equivalent to the operator norm such that the subspace of compact operators is an M-ideal. In particular, we observe that the space of compact operators on $\ell_p$ $(1&lt;p&lt;\infty)$ equipped with the numerical radius norm is an M-ideal whenever the numerical index of $\ell_p$ is not $0$. On the other hand, we show that the space of compact operators on a Banach space containing an isomorphic copy of $\ell_1$ whose numerical index is greater than $1/2$ is not M-ideals. We also study the proximinality, the existence of farthest points and the compact perturbation property for the numerical radius.</description>

      <title>M-ideals in real operator algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05383v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recent paper we showed that a subspace of a real JBW*-triple is an M-summand if and only if it is a weak*-closed triple ideal. As a consequence, M-ideals of real JB*-triples, including real C*-algebras, real JB*-algebras and real TROs, correspond to norm-closed triple ideals. In the present paper we extend this result to (possibly non-selfadjoint) real operator algebras and Jordan operator algebras, where the argument is necessarily different. We also give simple characterizations of one-sided M-ideals in real operator algebras, and give some applications to that theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03579v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We exhibit an obstruction for groups with Relative Property (T) to act on the real line by bi-Lipschitz homeomorphisms. This condition is expressed in terms of the Lipschitz and Kazhdan constants associated to finite generating subsets. As an application, we obtain an explicit lower bound for the Lipschitz constants associated to actions of the semidirect product $\mathbb{F}_2\ltimes\mathbb{Z}^2$. We also obtain an upper bound for the Kazhdan constants of pairs of orderable groups, depending only on the cardinal of the generating subset.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05678v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a theory of optimal transport relative to a distinguished subset, which acts as a reservoir of mass, allowing us to compare measures of different total variation. This relative transportation problem has an optimal solution and we obtain relative versions of the Kantorovich-Rubinstein norm, Wasserstein distance, Kantorovich-Rubinstein duality and Monge-Kantorovich duality. We also prove relative versions of the Riesz-Markov-Kakutani theorem, which connect the spaces of measures arising from the relative optimal transport problem to spaces of Lipschitz functions. For a boundedly compact Polish space, we show that our relative 1-finite real-valued Radon measures with relative Kantorovich-Rubinstein norm coincide with the sequentially order continuous dual of relative Lipschitz functions with the operator norm. As part of our work we develop a theory of Riesz cones that may be of independent interest.</description>
