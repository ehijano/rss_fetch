      <title>Transport Properties of Active Particles Moving on Adjustable Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active adaptive matter has attracted considerable interest due to its rich, largely unexplained dynamics and its relevance to a wide range of synthetic and biological materials. An important subclass of such systems consists of active particles that can remodel the network in which they move. Here, we introduce a minimal yet versatile model of active particles moving on an adjustable network. In this model, particles undergo discrete run-and-tumble motion along the links of a triangular lattice and leave behind a trail of temporarily blocked links. These closed links cannot be traversed by other particles and reopen only after a characteristic healing time. The resulting trail-mediated blocking mechanism is fundamentally distinct from more familiar interactions such as excluded-volume effects. In the high-persistence limit, we find a qualitative contrast between the two mechanisms: while steric blocking leads to reduced diffusivity with increasing persistence, trail-induced blocking causes diffusivity to increase monotonically. We characterize this fundamental difference and the associated, unexpected transport properties, and discuss potential applications of our findings.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics substantially affects induced structure formation in magnetic fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetorheological fluids consist of micrometer-sized magnetic particles in a carrier liquid. Sufficiently strong external magnetic fields lead to the formation of string-like particle aggregates. We demonstrate that hydrodynamic interactions, that is, mutual couplings via induced flows, play a substantial role during structure formation. Hydrodynamics supports the emergence of string-like aggregates, while magnetic interactions align them. This fundamental insight is substantial from an application perspective, due to the enormous technical importance and potential of magnetorheological fluids.</description>

      <title>Temperature overshooting in the Mpemba effect of frictional active matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23137v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The traditional Mpemba effect refers to an anomalous cooling phenomenon when an initial hotter system cools down faster than an initial warm system. Such counterintuitive behavior has been confirmed and explored across phase transitions in condensed matter systems and also for colloidal particles exposed to a double-well potential. Here we predict a frictional Mpemba effect for a macroscopic body moving actively on a surface governed by Coulomb (dry) friction. For an initial high temperature, relaxation towards a cold state occurs much faster than that for an intermediate initial temperature, due to a large temperature overshooting in the latter case. This frictional Mpemba effect can be exploited to steer the motion of robots and granules.</description>

      <title>Advection selects pattern in multistable emulsions of active droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00827v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Controlling the size of droplets, for example in biological cells, is challenging because large droplets typically outcompete smaller droplets due to surface tension. This coarsening is generally accelerated by hydrodynamic effects, but active chemical reactions can suppress it. We show that the interplay of these processes leads to three different dynamical regimes: (1) Advection dominates the coalescence of small droplets, (2) diffusion leads to Ostwald ripening for intermediate sizes, and (3) reactions finally suppress coarsening. Interestingly, a range of final droplet sizes is stable, of which one is selected depending on initial conditions. Our analysis demonstrates that hydrodynamic effects control initial droplet sizes, but they do not affect the later dynamics, in contrast to passive emulsions.</description>

      <title>Routes to the density profile and structural inconsistency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical density functional theory (DFT) is the primary method for investigations of inhomogeneous fluids in external fields. It requires the excess Helmholtz free energy functional as input to an Euler-Lagrange equation for the one-body density. A variant of this methodology, the force-DFT, uses instead the Yvon-Born-Green equation to generate density profiles. It is known that the latter are consistent with the virial route to the thermodynamics, while DFT is consistent with the compressibility route. In this work we will show an alternative DFT scheme using the Lovett-Mou-Buff-Wertheim (LMBW) equation to obtain density profiles, that are shown to be also consistent with the compressibility route. However, force-DFT and LMBW DFT can both be implemented using a closure relation on the level of the two-body correlation functions. This is proven to be an advantageous feature, opening the possibility of an optimisation scheme in which the structural inconsistency between different routes to the density profile is minimized. (Structural inconsistency is a generalization of the notion of thermodynamic inconsistency, familiar from bulk integral equation studies.) Numerical results are given for the density profiles of two-dimensional systems of hard-core Yukawa particles with a repulsive or an attractive tail, in planar geometry.</description>

      <title>Rheologically tuned diffusion modulates quorum sensing in Vibrio fischeri</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01786v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how the physical properties of a fluid influence bacterial behavior is essential for explaining how microorganisms interact with their environment and with animal hosts. Here, we examine how changes in fluid viscosity and rheological properties affect the locomotion of the marine bacterium Vibrio fischeri and its ability to produce luminescence through cell--cell communication. We track the three-dimensional motion of single cells in well-defined fluids with different physical properties and measure the luminescence emitted by cell populations. We find that fluids with higher viscosity cause V. fischeri to spend more time in a slower, turning-focused swimming mode, which reduces how effectively cells spread out and encounter the chemical signals required to activate luminescence. As a result, luminescence first increases and then decreases in Newtonian fluids, but decreases monotonically in fluids that exhibit non-Newtonian rheological behavior. Computer simulations based on our measurements confirm that the ability of cells to explore their surroundings plays a central role in determining when and how strongly they communicate. These findings reveal a direct link between the physical environment, bacterial movement, and collective behavior, and offer new insight into how microorganisms adapt to complex fluid habitats, including those found inside animal hosts.</description>

      <title>Ultrastable 2D glasses and packings explained by local centrosymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the most recent numerical data by Bolton-Lum \emph{et al.} [Phys. Rev. Lett. 136, 058201 (2026)], we demonstrate that ideal ultrastable glasses in the athermal limit (or ultrastable ideal 2D disk packings) possess a remarkably high degree of local centrosymmetry. In particular, we find that the inversion-symmetry order parameter for local force transmission introduced in Milkus and Zaccone, [Phys. Rev. 93, 094204 (2016)], is as high as $F_{IS}= 0.93546$, to be compared with $F_{IS}=1$ for perfect centrosymmetric crystals free of defects, and with $F_{IS} \sim 0.3-0.5$ for standard random packings. This observation provides a clear, natural explanation for the ultra-high shear modulus of ideal packings and ideal glasses, because the high centrosymmetry prevents non-affine relaxations which decrease the shear modulus. The same mechanism explains the absence of boson peak-like soft vibrational modes. These results also confirm what was found previous work, i.e. that the bond-orientational order parameter is a very poor correlator for the vibrational and mechanical</description>

      <title>Biomass transfer on autocatalytic reaction network: a delay differential equation formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.09470v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a biological system to grow and expand, mass must be transferred from the environment to the system and be assimilated into its reaction network. Here, I characterize the biomass transfer process for growing autocatalytic systems. By track biomass along reaction pathways, an n-dimensional ordinary differential equation (ODE) of the reaction network can be reformulated into a one-dimensional delay differential equation (DDE) for its long-term dynamics. The kernel function of the DDE summarizes the overall amplification and transfer delay of the system and serves as a signature for autocatalysis dynamics. The DDE formulation allows reaction networks of various topologies and complexities to be compared and provides rigorous estimation scheme for growth rate upon dimensional reduction of reaction networks.</description>

      <title>Mechanically concealed holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00135v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When a hole is introduced into an elastic material, it will usually act to reduce the overall mechanical stiffness. A general ambition is to investigate whether a stiff shell around the hole can act to maintain the overall mechanical properties. We consider this effect from a macroscopic continuum perspective down to atomistic scales. For this purpose, we focus on the basic continuum example situation of an isotropic, homogeneous, linearly elastic material loaded uniformly under compressive plane strain for low concentrations of holes. As we demonstrate, the thickness of the shell can be adjusted in a way to maintain the overall stiffness of the system. We derive a corresponding mathematical expression for the thickness of the shell that conceals the hole. Thus, one can work with given materials to mask the presence of the holes simply by adjusting the thickness of the surrounding shells, with no need to change the materials. Our predictions from linear elasticity continuum theory are extended to atomistic levels using molecular dynamics simulations of a model Lennard-Jones solid. These extensions attest the robustness of our predictions down to atomistic scales. Thus, they open a straightforward possibility to adjust the strategy of mechanical cloaking via atomistic manipulations. From both perspectives, the underlying concept is important in the context of light-weight construction.</description>

      <title>Unbounded Systematic Error in Thin Film Conductivity Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02418v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electrical conductivity is the most fundamental charge transport parameter, and measurements of conductivity are a basic part of materials characterization for nearly all conducting materials. In thin films, conductivity is often measured in four bar architectures in which the current source and voltage measurement are spatially separated to eliminate systematic error due to contact resistance. Despite the apparent simplicity of these measurements, we demonstrate here that the four bar architecture is subject to significant systematic error arising from the finite conductivity of the metal electrodes. Remarkably, these systematic errors can in some cases become unbounded, producing arbitrarily high measured conductivity at modest true film conductivities, within the range relevant to emerging thin film thermoelectric materials such as conducting polymers. These unbounded errors, which can occur even in properly conducted four-point measurements of patterned films, likely explain literature reports of extremely high conductivities in conducting polymers, and can lead to anomalous scaling in temperature dependent studies, potentially leading to incorrect interpretation of the relevant charge transport mechanism. We characterize the device geometric factors that control these errors, which stand partially at odds with those required for accurate Seebeck coefficient measurements. Our analyses allow us to identify device architectures that provide small systematic errors for conductivity and Seebeck coefficient while still providing a low measurement resistance, critical to reducing noise in thermal voltage measurements. These findings provide important guidelines for accurate measurements in the growing field of thin-film thermoelectric materials.</description>

      <title>How to Train Your Resistive Network: Generalized Equilibrium Propagation and Analytical Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03546v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning is a powerful method of extracting meaning from data; unfortunately, current digital hardware is extremely energy-intensive. There is interest in an alternative analog computing implementation that could match the performance of traditional machine learning while being significantly more energy-efficient. However, it remains unclear how to train such analog computing systems while adhering to locality constraints imposed by the physical (as opposed to digital) nature of these systems. Local learning algorithms such as Equilibrium Propagation and Coupled Learning have been proposed to address this issue. In this paper, we develop an algorithm to exactly calculate gradients using a graph theoretic and analytical framework for Kirchhoff's laws. We also introduce Generalized Equilibrium Propagation, a framework encompassing a broad class of Hebbian learning algorithms, including Coupled Learning and Equilibrium Propagation, and show how our algorithm compares. We demonstrate our algorithm using numerical simulations and show that we can train resistor networks without the need for a replica or readout over all resistors, only at the output layer. We also show that under the analytical gradient approach, it is possible to update only a subset of the resistance values without a strong degradation in performance.</description>
