      <title>A finiteness condition for complex continued fraction algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A continued fraction algorithm allows to represent numbers in a way that is particularly valuable if one wants to approximate irrational numbers by rationals. Some of these algorithms are simple in the sense that the possible representations can be characterized in an easy way. For instance, for the classical continued fraction algorithm each infinite string of positive integer digits (called partial quotients in this setting) can occur. For complex continued fraction algorithms this does not hold. However, for some algorithms an easy condition, the so-called finite range condition, characterizes the possible "digit strings". We show that this condition holds for complex $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$-Hurwitz algorithms with parameters $\boldsymbol{\alpha}\in\mathbb{Q}^2$. Our proofs are elementary, and our result opens new perspectives for the exploration of these algorithms.</description>

      <title>A New Diophantine Approximation Inequality on Surfaces and Its Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a Diophantine approximation inequality for closed subschemes on surfaces which can be viewed as a joint generalization of recent inequalities of Ru-Vojta and Heier-Levin in this context. As applications, we study various Diophantine problems on affine surfaces given as the complement of three numerically parallel ample projective curves: inequalities involving greatest common divisors, degeneracy of integral points, and related Diophantine equations including families of S-unit equations. We state analogous results in the complex analytic setting, where our main result is an inequality of Second Main Theorem type for surfaces, with applications to the study and value distribution theory of holomorphic curves in surfaces.</description>

      <title>Imaginary logarithmic classes of abelian number fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are interested in classical and logarithmic imaginary classes of abelian number fields in connection with Iwasawa theory. For any given odd prime ${\ell}$ and any imaginary abelian number field K, we compute the isotypic components of the logarithmic ${\ell}$-class group of K associated to imaginary irreducible ${\ell}$-adic characters of its Galois group and we extend to this situation the Gold criterium on lambda invariants. We first study the semi-simple case, thus the non semi-simple case in connection with transition formulas of genus for supercircular fields.</description>

      <title>Integral Representation for Riemann-Siegel $Z(t)$ function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply Poisson formula for a strip to give a representation of $Z(t)$ by means of an integral. \[F(t)=\int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{h(x)\zeta(4+ix)}{7\cosh\pi\frac{x-t}{7}}\,dx, \qquad Z(t)=\frac{\Re F(t)}{(\frac14+t^2)^{\frac12}(\frac{25}{4}+t^2)^{\frac12}}.\] After that we get the estimate \[Z(t)=\Bigl(\frac{t}{2\pi}\Bigr)^{\frac74}\Re\bigl\{e^{i\vartheta(t)}H(t)\bigr\}+O(t^{-3/4}),\] with \[H(t)=\int_{-\infty}^\infty\Bigl(\frac{t}{2\pi}\Bigr)^{ix/2}\frac{\zeta(4+it+ix)}{7\cosh(\pi x/7)}\,dx=\Bigl(\frac{t}{2\pi}\Bigr)^{-\frac74}\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^{\frac12+it}}\frac{2}{1+(\frac{t}{2\pi n^2})^{-7/2}}.\] We explain how the study of this function can lead to information about the zeros of the zeta function on the critical line.</description>

      <title>Galois groups of reciprocal polynomials and the van der Waerden-Bhargava theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Galois groups $G_f$ of degree $2n$ reciprocal (a.k.a. palindromic) polynomials $f$ of height at most $H$, finding that $G_f$ falls short of the maximal possible group $S_2 \wr S_n$ for a proportion of all $f$ bounded above and below by constant multiples of $H^{-1} \log H$, whether or not $f$ is required to be monic. This answers a 1998 question of Davis-Duke-Sun and extends Bhargava's 2023 resolution of van der Waerden's 1936 conjecture on the corresponding question for general polynomials. Unlike in that setting, the dominant contribution comes not from reducible polynomials but from those $f$ for which $(-1)^n f(1) f(-1)$ is a square, causing $G_f$ to lie in an index-$2$ subgroup.</description>

      <title>Construction of subspaces with known Diophantine exponents for the last angle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Schmidt generalized in 1967 the theory of classical Diophantine approximation to subspaces of $\R^n$. We consider Diophantine exponents for linear subspaces of $\R^n$ which generalize the irrationality measure for real numbers. Using geometry of numbers, we construct subspaces of $\R^n$ for which we are able to compute the associated exponents for the last angle.</description>

      <title>On the Hahn-Witt series and their generalizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the field of Hahn-Witt series $HW(\overline{\mathbb{F}}_p)$ with residue field $\overline{\mathbb{F}}_p$ (also known as a $p$-adic Malcev-Neumann field \cite{La86, P93}), and its generalizations. Informally, the Hahn-Witt series are possibly infinite linear combinations of rational powers of $p,$ in which the coefficients are Teichm\"uller representatives, and the set of exponents is well-ordered. They form an algebraically closed extension of $\mathbb{Q}_p,$ with a canonical automorphism $\varphi,$ coming from the absolute Frobenius of $\overline{\mathbb{F}}_p.$ We prove that the action of $\varphi$ on the $p$-power roots of unity is given by $\varphi(\zeta)=\zeta^{-1},$ answering a question of Kontsevich.
  More generally, we consider the $\pi$-typical Hahn-Witt series $HW_{(K,\pi)}(\overline{\mathbb{F}}_q)$, where $\pi$ is a uniformizer in a local field $K$ with residue field $\mathbb{F}_q.$ Again, this field is an algebraically closed extension of $K,$ and it has a canonical automorphism $\varphi_{\pi},$ coming from the relative Frobenius of $\overline{\mathbb{F}}_q$ over $\mathbb{F}_q.$ We prove that the action of $\varphi_{\pi}$ on the maximal abelian extension $K^{ab}$ corresponds via local class field theory to the uniformizer $-\pi\in K^*.$</description>

      <title>Borel-Cantelli, zero-one laws and inhomogeneous Duffin-Schaeffer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The most versatile version of the classical divergence Borel-Cantelli lemma shows that for any divergent sequence of events $E_n$ in a probability space satisfying a quasi-independence condition, its corresponding limsup set $E_\infty$ has positive probability. In particular, it provides a lower bound on the probability of $E_\infty$. In this paper we establish a new version of this classical result which guarantees, under an additional mild assumption, that the probability of $E_\infty$ is not just positive but is one. Unlike existing optimal results, it is applicable within the setting of arbitrary probability spaces. We then go onto to consider a range of applications in number theory and dynamical systems. These include new results on the inhomogeneous Duffin-Schaeffer conjecture. In particular, we establish alternatives to the classical (homogeneous) zero-one laws of Cassels and Gallagher and use them to resolve the so-called weak Duffin-Schaeffer conjecture for an arbitrary rational inhomogeneous shift. As a bi-product, we establish the Duffin-Schaeffer conjecture with congruence relations. The applications to dynamical systems include new characterisations of Borel-Cantelli sequences and new dynamical Borel-Cantelli lemmas, as well as characterising Khintchine-type sequences for shrinking targets.</description>

      <title>On $p$-adic solutions to KZ equations, ordinary crystals, and $p^s$-hypergeometric solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the KZ connection associated with a family of hyperelliptic curves of genus $g$ over the ring of $p$-adic integers $\mathbb{Z}_p$. Then the dual connection is the Gauss-Manin connection of that family. We observe that the Gauss-Manin connection has an ordinary $F$-crystal structure and its unit root subcrystal is of rank $g$. We prove that all local flat sections of the KZ connection annihilate the unite root subcrystal, and the space of all local flat sections of the KZ connection is a free $\mathbb{Z}_p$-module of rank $g$. We also consider the reduction modulo $p^s$ of the unit root subcrystal for any $s\geq 1$. We prove that its annihilator is generated by the so-called $p^s$-hypergeometric flat sections of the KZ connection. In particular, that means that the reduction modulo $p^s$ of an arbitrary local flat section of the KZ connection over $\mathbb{Z}_p$ is a linear combination of the $p^s$-hypergeometric flat sections.</description>

      <title>$L^\infty$-sizes of the spaces Siegel cusp forms of degree $n$ via Poincar\'e series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the conjectures on the ($L^{\infty}$)-sizes of the spaces of Siegel cusp forms of degree $n$, weight $k$, for any congruence subgroup in the weight aspect as well as for all principal congruence subgroups in the level aspect, in particular. This size is measured by the size of the Bergman kernel of the space. More precisely we show that the aforementioned size is $\asymp_{n} k^{3n(n+1)/4}$. Our method uses the Fourier expansion of the Bergman kernel, and has wide applicability. We illustrate this by a simple algorithm. We also include some of the applications of our method, including individual sup-norms of small weights and non-vanishing of Poincar\'e series.</description>

      <title>On an entropic analogue of additive energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances have linked various statements involving sumsets and cardinalities with corresponding statements involving sums of random variables and entropies. In this vein, this paper shows that the quantity $2{\bf H}\{X, Y\} - {\bf H}\{X+Y\}$ is a natural entropic analogue of the additive energy $E(A,B)$ between two sets. We develop some basic theory surrounding this quantity, and demonstrate its role in the proof of Tao's entropy variant of the Balog--Szemer\'edi--Gowers theorem. We examine the regime where entropic additive energy is small, and discuss a family of random variables related to Sidon sets. In finite fields, one can define an entropic multiplicative energy as well, and we formulate sum-product-type conjectures relating these two entropic energies.</description>

      <title>Generation of Random (Generalized) Orthogonal Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an algorithmic method for generating random orthogonal matrices \(A\) that satisfy the property \(A^t S A = S\), where \(S\) is a fixed real invertible symmetric or skew-symmetric matrix. This method is significant as it generalizes the procedures for generating orthogonal matrices that fix a general fixed symmetric or skew-symmetric bilinear form. These include orthogonal matrices that fall to groups such as the symplectic group, Lorentz group, Poincar\'e group, and more generally the indefinite orthogonal group, to name a few. These classes of matrices play crucial roles in diverse fields such as theoretical physics, where they are used to describe symmetries and conservation laws, as well as in computational geometry, numerical analysis, and number theory, where they are integral to the study of quadratic forms and modular forms. The implementation of our algorithms can be accomplished using standard linear algebra libraries.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the positive-dimensional part of the torsion locus of the Ceresa normal function in $\mathcal{M}_g$ is not Zariski dense when $g\geq 3$. Moreover, it has only finitely many components with generic Mumford-Tate group equal to $\mathrm{GSp}_{2g}$; these components are defined over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$, and their union is closed under the action of $\mathrm{Gal}(\overline{\mathbb{Q}}/\mathbb Q)$. More generally, we study the distribution of the torsion locus of arbitrary admissible normal functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.02048v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A simply laced Dynkin diagram gives rise to a family of curves over $\mathbb{Q}$ and a coregular representation, using deformations of simple singularities and Vinberg theory respectively. Thorne has conjectured and partially proven a strong link between the arithmetic of these curves and the rational orbits of these representations. In this paper, we complete Thorne's picture and show that $2$-Selmer elements of the Jacobians of the smooth curves in each family can be parametrised by integral orbits of the corresponding representation. Using geometry-of-numbers techniques, we deduce statistical results on the arithmetic of these curves. We prove these results in a uniform manner. This recovers and generalises results of Bhargava, Gross, Ho, Shankar, Shankar and Wang. The main innovations are: an analysis of torsors on affine spaces using results of Colliot-Th\'el\`ene and the Grothendieck--Serre conjecture, a study of geometric properties of compactified Jacobians using the Bialynicki-Birula decomposition, and a general construction of integral orbit representatives.</description>

      <title>Locally analytic vector bundles on the Fargues-Fontaine curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.11354v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we develop a version of Sen theory for equivariant vector bundles on the Fargues-Fontaine curve. We show that every equivariant vector bundle canonically descends to a locally analytic vector bundle. A comparison with the theory of $(\varphi,\Gamma)$-modules in the cyclotomic case then recovers the Cherbonnier-Colmez decompletion theorem. Next, we focus on the subcategory of de Rham locally analytic vector bundles. Using the p-adic monodromy theorem, we show that each locally analytic vector bundle $\mathcal{E}$ has a canonical differential equation for which the space of solutions has full rank. As a consequence, $\mathcal{E}$ and its sheaf of solutions $\mathrm{Sol}(\mathcal{E})$ are in a natural correspondence, which gives a geometric interpretation of a result of Berger on $(\varphi,\Gamma)$-modules. In particular, if $V$ is a de Rham Galois representation, its associated filtered $(\varphi,N,G_{K})$-module is realized as the space of global solutions to the differential equation. A key to our approach is a vanishing result for the higher locally analytic vectors of representations satisfying the Tate-Sen formalism, which is also of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Overconvergence of \'etale $(\varphi,\Gamma)$-modules in families</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.05050v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a conjecture of Emerton, Gee and Hellmann concerning the overconvergence of \'etale $(\varphi,\Gamma)$-modules in families parametrized by topologically finite type $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$-algebras. As a consequence, we deduce the existence of a natural map from the rigid fiber of the Emerton-Gee stack to the rigid analytic stack of $(\varphi,\Gamma)$-modules.</description>

      <title>Drinfeld Module and Weil pairing over Dedekind domain of class number two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The primary objective of this paper is to derive explicit formulas for rank one and rank two Drinfeld modules over a specific domain denoted by A. This domain corresponds to the projective line associated with an infinite place of degree two. To achieve the goals, we construct a pair of standard Drinfeld modules whose coefficients are in the Hilbert class field of A. We demonstrate that the period lattice of the exponential functions corresponding to both modules behaves similarly to the period lattice of the Carlitz module, the standard rank one Drinfeld module defined over rational function field. Moreover, we employ Andersons t-motive to obtain the complete family of rank two Drinfeld modules. This family is parameterized by the invariant J = \lambda^{q^2+1} which effectively serves as the counterpart of the j-invariant for elliptic curves. Building upon the concepts introduced by van~der~Heiden, particularly with regard to rank two Drinfeld modules, we are able to reformulate the Weil pairing of Drinfeld modules of any rank using a specialized polynomial in multiple variables known as the Weil operator. As an illustrative example, we provide a detailed examination of a more explicit formula for the Weil pairing and the Weil operator of rank two Drinfeld modules over the domain A.</description>

      <title>Old Meets New: Connecting Two Infinite Families of Congruences Modulo Powers of 5 for Generalized Frobenius Partition Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2012 Paule and Radu proved a difficult family of congruences modulo powers of 5 for Andrews' 2-colored generalized Frobenius partition function. The family is associated with the classical modular curve of level 20. We demonstrate the existence of a congruence family for a related generalized Frobenius partition function associated with the same curve. Unlike traditional proofs, we construct an isomorphism between this new family and the original family of congruences via a mapping on the associated rings of modular functions. The existence of this second congruence family and its relationship with the first poses significant implications for future work on congruences associated with modular curves of composite level. We show how a similar approach can be made to multiple other recent examples in the literature. We also give some important insights into the behavior of these congruence families with respect to the Atkin--Lehner involution which proved very important in Paule and Radu's original proof.</description>

      <title>The $a$-number of $y^n=x^m+x$ over finite fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08149v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a formula for $a$-number of certain maximal curves characterized by the equation $y^{\frac{q+1}{2}} = x^m + x$ over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$. $a$-number serves as an invariant for the isomorphism class of the $p$-torsion group scheme. Utilizing the action of the Cartier operator on $H^0(\mathcal{X}, \Omega^1)$, we establish a closed formula for $a$-number of $\mathcal{X}$.</description>

      <title>Improved upper bounds on Diophantine tuples with the property $D(n)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00840v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $n$ be a non-zero integer. A set $S$ of positive integers is a Diophantine tuple with the property $D(n)$ if $ab+n$ is a perfect square for each $a,b \in S$ with $a \neq b$. It is of special interest to estimate the quantity $M_n$, the maximum size of a Diophantine tuple with the property $D(n)$. In this notes, we show the contribution of intermediate elements is $O(\log \log |n|)$, improving a result by Dujella. As a consequence, we deduce that $M_n\leq (2+o(1))\log |n|$, improving the best-known upper bound on $M_n$ by Becker and Murty.</description>

      <title>A specialisation theorem for Lang-N\'eron groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06114v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that, for a polarised smooth projective variety $B \hookrightarrow \mathbb{P}^n_k$ of dimension $\geq 2$ over an infinite field $k$ and an abelian variety $A$ over the function field of $B$, there exists a dense Zariski open set of smooth geometrically connected hyperplane sections $h$ of $B$ such that $A$ has good reduction at $h$ and the specialisation homomorphism of Lang-N\'eron groups at $h$ is injective (up to a finite $p$-group in positive characteristic $p$). This gives a positive answer to a conjecture of the first author, which is used to deduce a negative definiteness result on his refined height pairing. This also sheds a new light on N\'eron's specialisation theorem.</description>
