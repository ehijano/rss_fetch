      <title>Statistical Properties of Turbulence Under a Smart Lagrangian Forcing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how turbulence is reshaped by the presence of externally forced light particles, using high-resolution direct numerical simulations with four-way coupling. The particles are subject to an oscillatory force that in turn locally affects the fluid flow through momentum exchange at the position of the particles. Since the light particles preferentially concentrate in high vorticity regions, this leads to an intricate preferential turbulence modulation. We show that through this modulation, the forced light particles strongly reduce the intermittency of the flow, shedding new light on the delicate relationship between vortex filaments and turbulence intermittency.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Analytical Turbulence Closures for Quasi-Geostrophic Ocean Flows with Coastal Boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical turbulence simulations typically involve parameterizations such as Large Eddy Simulations (LES). Applications to geophysical flows, especially ocean flows, are further complicated by the presence of complex topography and interior landforms such as coastlines, islands, and capes. In this work, we extend pseudo-spectral quasi-geostrophic (QG) numerical schemes and GPU-based solvers to simulate flows with coastal boundaries using the Brinkman volume penalization approach. We incorporate sponging and a splitting scheme to handle inflow and aperiodic boundary conditions. We evaluate four analytical sub-grid-scale (SGS) closures based on the eddy viscosity hypothesis: the standard Smagorinsky and Leith closures, and their dynamic variants. We show applications to QG flows past circular islands and capes with the beta-plane approximation. We perform both a priori analysis of the SGS closure terms as well as a posteriori assessment of the SGS terms and simulated vorticity fields. Our results showcase differences between the various closures, especially their approach to phase and feature reconstruction errors in the presence of coastal boundaries.</description>

      <title>Exploiting repeated matrix block structures for more efficient CFD on modern supercomputers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations are often constrained by the memory-bound nature of sparse matrix-vector operations, which eventually limits performance on modern high-performance computing (HPC) systems. This work introduces a novel approach to increase arithmetic intensity in CFD by leveraging repeated matrix block structures. The method transforms the conventional sparse matrix-vector product (SpMV) into a sparse matrix-matrix product (SpMM), enabling simultaneous processing of multiple right-hand sides. This shifts the computation towards a more compute-bound regime by reusing matrix coefficients. Additionally, an inline mesh-refinement strategy is proposed: simulations initially run on a coarse mesh to establish a statistically steady flow, then refine to the target mesh. This reduces the wall-clock time to reach transition, leading to faster convergence with equivalent computational cost. The methodology is evaluated using theoretical performance bounds and validated through three test cases: a turbulent channel flow, Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard convection, and an industrial airfoil simulation. Results demonstrate substantial speed-ups - from modest improvements in basic configurations to over 50% in the mesh-refinement setup - highlighting the benefits of integrating SpMM across all CFD operators, including divergence, gradient, and Laplacian.</description>

      <title>Effect of translational shear on interfacial structure in the viscous fingering instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce applied shear as a method to control viscous fingering by smoothing the interface between miscible fluids. In the viscous fingering instability, a less viscous fluid displaces a more viscous one through the formation of fingers. The instability, which requires a confined geometry, is often studied in the thin gap of a quasi-two-dimensional Hele-Shaw cell. When the two fluids are miscible, the structures that form in the dimension traversing the gap are important for determining the instability onset. We demonstrate with experiments and simulations that oscillatory translational shear of the confining plates changes the gap-averaged viscosity profile so that it becomes less abrupt at the finger tips. Increasing the amplitude or velocity of the shear delays the instability onset and decreases the finger growth rate. Shear can thus be used to stabilize a pair of miscible fluids against fingering. The results show a direct correlation between a smoother viscosity profile and delayed instability.

      <title>Lagrangian entropic lattice Boltzmann method for Courant-free supersonic compressible flow simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents the Lagrangian entropic lattice Boltzmann method (LELBM), a novel framework for supersonic lattice Boltzmann method that surpasses traditional restrictions on velocity, temperature, viscosity, and memory, resulting in stable and efficient Courant-free LBM formulation, while still maintaining explicit time stepping. A regularized central moment collision method coupled with a double-distribution function (DDF) that considers internal degrees of freedom enabled the precise control of shear viscosity, bulk viscosity, and thermal conductivity. Lagrangian acoustic stencils (LAS), a generalized multispeed shifted lattice construction method, is introduced to adapt to arbitrary local velocity and temperature. Additionally, entropic population reconstruction (EPR) has been used to obtain entropy-satisfying post-collision population while achieving both positivity and conservation of moments. Memory requirements are drastically reduced from a polynomial order of temperature to a constant by employing moment streaming (MS) algorithm. The unified LELBM framework is validated through comprehensive benchmark problems. In one dimension, the model is evaluated through Sod's shock tube, Lax problem, and Shu-Osher wave. In two dimensions, 2D Riemann problem, double Mach reflection, oblique shock, supersonic flow past a circular cylinder, and supersonic flow past a NACA0012 airfoil have been tested to assess the robustness and accuracy of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Gas dynamic equations from Boltzmann to Navier-Stokes scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of nonequilibrium gas flows spanning multiple flow regimes is challenging due to the breakdown of scale separation. In this work, we propose a kinetic framework that captures the transport of molecules under varying collision behaviors within a given observation timescale $h$. Within this framework, gas molecules in the system are classified into three types over the time interval $0\le t&lt;h$, namely, collided molecules that have experienced collisions with other molecules, free-transport molecules that encounter no collisions during $[0,h]$, and transitional molecules which encounter no collisions during $[0, t]$ but collide with other molecules during $[t,h]$. Then three coupled sub-kinetic equations for different types of molecules are developed rigorously through the formal solution of the Boltzmann equation. The asymptotic behaviors of the three sub-kinetic equations are analyzed, and it is shown that the system presents a framework for describing the exchange among the molecules with different collision behaviors. Beyond enabling variable-scale kinetic modeling, this framework can provide a basis for developing efficient numerical methods for simulating multiscale gas flows. Importantly, due to its intrinstic mutiscale nature, the proposed framework may also offer new insights into Hillbert's sixth problem.</description>

      <title>Hidden in plain sight: How evaporation impacts the pendant drop method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The surface tension of a liquid, which drives most free surface flows at small scales, is often measured with the pendant drop method due to its simplicity and reliability. When the drop is suspended in air, controlling the ambient temperature and humidity is usually an afterthought, resulting in evaporation of the drop during the measurement. Here, we investigate the effect of evaporation on the measured surface tension using experiments and numerical simulations. In the experiments, we measured the evolution of the droplet temperature, which can drastically reduce by ($\Delta T \approx 10 \degC$) due to evaporative cooling, and thereby altering the measured surface tension by more than 1 mN/m. This finding can be reproduced by numerical simulations, which additionally allows for controlled investigations of the individual influences of further effects on the pendant drop method, namely shape deformations by evaporation-driven flows in the gas-phase and in the liquid-phase including the resulting Marangoni flow. We provide a simple passive method to control the relative humidity without requiring additional instrumentation. Our findings are particularly pertinent to Marangoni flows which are driven by surface tension gradients, and which are consequently highly sensitive to measurement inaccuracies. We apply our method with different aqueous mixtures of glycerol and various diols. Our results and insights have implications for various applications, ranging from inkjet printing to agricultural sprays. Finally, we have meticulously documented our setup and procedure for future reference.</description>

      <title>Slip over liquid-infused gratings in the singular limit of a nearly inviscid lubricant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider shear-driven longitudinal flow of an exterior fluid over a periodic array of rectangular grooves filled with an immiscible interior fluid (the "lubricant"), the grooves being formed by infinitely thin ridges protruding from a flat substrate. The ratio $\lambda$ of the effective slip length to the semi-period is a function of the ratio $\mu$ of the interior to exterior viscosities and the ratio $h$ of the grooves depth to the semi-period. We focus on the limit $\mu\ll1$, which is singular for that geometry. We find that the viscous resistance to the imposed shear is dominated by a boundary layer of exponentially small extent about the ridge tips, resulting in the effective slip length scaling as $\mu^{-1/2}$ - not $\mu^{-1}$ as implied by intuitive arguments overlooking the tip contributions (and by proposed approximations in the literature). Analyzing that exponential region in conjunction with an integral force balance, we find the simple asymptotic approximation $\lambda\approx \mu^{-1/2}$; using conformal mappings, we also calculate the leading-order correction to that result, which introduces a dependence upon $h$. The ensuing asymptotic expansion breaks down for $h=O(\mu^{1/2})$, upon transitioning to a lubrication geometry. We accordingly conduct a companion asymptotic analysis in the distinguished limit of small $\mu$ and fixed $H=h/\mu^{1/2}$, which gives $\lambda\approx \mu^{-1/2}H/(1+H)$ as well as a closed-form leading-order correction to that approximation; the intuitive $\mu^{-1}$ scaling is accordingly only relevant to the regime $H\ll1$ corresponding to extremely shallow grooves. We demonstrate excellent agreement between our predictions and numerical solutions constructed using a boundary-integral formulation.</description>

      <title>Modeling Dynamic Gas-Liquid Interfaces in Underwater Explosions Using Interval-Constrained Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Underwater explosion modeling faces a critical challenge of simultaneously resolving shock waves and gas-liquid interfaces, as traditional methods struggle to balance accuracy and computational efficiency. To address this, we develop a physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework featuring a dual-network architecture, that one network learns flow-field variables (pressure, density, velocity) from simulation data, while another network tracks the gas-liquid interface despite lacking direct numerical solutions. Crucially, we introduce an interval-constraint training strategy that penalizes interface deviations beyond grid spacing limits, paired with a physics-preserving linear mapping of 1D spherical Euler equations to ensure consistency. Our results show that this approach accurately reconstructs spatiotemporal fields from coarse-grid data, achieving superior computational efficiency over conventional CFD-enabling rapid, mesh-free blast-load analysis for near/far-field scenarios and extensibility to higher-dimensional problems.</description>

      <title>An implicit gas-kinetic scheme for internal and external flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gas-kinetic scheme(GKS) is a promising computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method for solving the Navier-Stokes equations. It is based on the analytical solution of the BGK equation, which enables accurate and robust simulations. While GKS has demonstrated excellent properties (e.g., unified treatment of inviscid and viscous fluxes, inherent adaptive dissipation control), its application to classical engineering problems, such as aerodynamic flows and fluid machinery, remains underdeveloped compared to conventional CFD methods. This study bridges this gap by advancing GKS capabilities for real-world engineering challenges. First, the GKS is extended to a rotating coordinate frame, enabling efficient simulations of internal flows in turbomachinery. Second, the computational inefficiency of explicit GKS is addressed through an implicit time discretization using the generalized minimal residual method. The Jacobian matrices for inviscid/viscous fluxes are approximated using the first-order kinetic flux vector splitting scheme and the thin shear layer approximation to enhance robustness and computational efficiency further. Third, the shear-stress transport turbulence model is coupled to expand GKS's applicability to industrial turbulent flows. Numerical tests, including internal compressor rotor flow and external flow over a 3-D wingbody, validate the proposed method's accuracy and efficiency. Via our implicit scheme, the force coefficients of the 3-D wing-body flow with about five million mesh elements can converge after 500 steps. This work represents a practical advancement of GKS, demonstrating its potential to compete with established CFD solvers in high-Reynolds-number external and internal turbulent flows.</description>

      <title>Mean velocity profiles and total shear stress profiles in adverse-pressure-gradient turbulent boundary layers considering history effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study focuses on developing a predictive model for mean velocity profiles and total shear stress profiles in turbulent boundary layers subjected to adverse pressure gradients, especially with history effects. Based on universal near-wall similarity, a new scaling using friction velocity modified by Clauser pressure gradient parameter is introduced to restore streamwise self-similarity. Furthermore, an estimation-correction model is developed, explicitly incorporating a streamwise derivative for pressure gradient, which effectively captures history effect beyond the reach of Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations. A detailed analysis is conducted on the corrected model of total shear stress, which is decomposed into four parts, in which the latter two parts correspond to non-equilibrium effect, and they are considered the first-order history effect. Generally, they tend to offset each other, but in downstream region, their combined effect is significantly stronger, accounting for up to approximately half of the total stress. Validation against multiple DNS/LES datasets across a wide range of pressure gradients and Reynolds numbers demonstrates model's accuracy in predicting both mean velocity profiles and total shear stress profiles.</description>

      <title>A Lagrangian method for solving the spherical shallow water equations using power diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical simulations of the air in the atmosphere and water in the oceans are essential for numerical weather prediction. The state-of-the-art for performing these fluid simulations relies on an Eulerian viewpoint, in which the fluid domain is discretized into a mesh, and the governing equations describe the fluid motion as it passes through each cell of the mesh. However, it is unclear whether a Lagrangian viewpoint, in which the fluid is discretized by a collection of particles, can outperform Eulerian simulations in global atmospheric simulations. To date, Lagrangian approaches have shown promise, but tend to produce smoother solutions. In this work, a new Lagrangian method is developed to simulate the atmosphere in which particles are represented with spherical power cells. We introduce an efficient algorithm for computing these cells which are then used to discretize the spherical shallow water equations. Mass conservation is enforced by solving a semi-discrete optimal transport problem and a semi-implicit time stepping procedure is used to advance the solution in time. We note that, in contrast to previous work, artificial viscosity is not needed to stabilize the simulation. The performance of the spherical Voronoi diagram calculation is first assessed, which shows that spherical Voronoi diagrams of 100 million sites can be computed in under 2 minutes on a single machine. The new simulation method is then evaluated on standard benchmark test cases, which shows that momentum and energy conservation of this new method is comparable to the latest Lagrangian approach for simulating the spherical shallow water equations.</description>

      <title>Slantwise convection and heat transport in the icy moon oceans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ocean heat transport on icy moons shapes the ice shell topography, a primary observable of these moons. Two key processes control the heat transport: baroclinic instability driven by surface buoyancy contrasts and convective instability driven by heating from the core. However, global ocean simulations cannot accurately resolve convection under realistic icy moon conditions and instead often use Earth-based convective parameterizations, which capture only vertical convective mixing and cannot represent rotation-aligned slantwise convection on icy moons. We use high-resolution convection-resolving simulations to investigate ocean heat transport by slantwise convection in a parameter regime relevant to icy moons, isolated from baroclinic instability. Total heat transport follows the Coriolis-Inertial-Archimedean scaling with an added latitude dependence. The vertical transport increases with latitude, and the meridional transport is poleward. These results indicate that slantwise convection redistributes heat toward the poles, favoring a poleward-thinning ice shell, qualitatively consistent with Enceladus's observed ice thickness distribution.</description>

      <title>Data Assimilation in Large Eddy Simulation: Addressing Model-Observation Mismatch from Navier-Stokes Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In atmospheric and turbulent flow modeling, Large Eddy Simulation (LES) is often used to reduce computational cost, while observational data typically originates from the underlying physical system. Motivated by this setting, we study a continuous data assimilation (CDA) algorithm applied to a Smagorinsky/Ladyzhenskaya-type LES model, in which the observational data is generated from the full Navier--Stokes equations (NSE). In the two-dimensional setting, we establish global well-posedness of the assimilated system and prove exponential convergence to the true solution, up to an error of order $\bar{\nu}^{1/2}$, where $\bar{\nu}$ is the turbulence viscosity parameter. In addition to rigorous analysis in 2D, we provide numerical simulations in both 2D domains with physical boundary conditions and 3D periodic domains, demonstrating effective synchronization in these cases, and corroborating our theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Effect of filter kernel on scale-energetics of near-wall turbulent structures</title>

Abstract: Inter-scale energy fluxes, $\Pi^\lambda$, are widely used as a diagnostic tool to analyse energy transfer across length scales, $\lambda$, in turbulence data. Here, we investigate how the choice of filter kernel (sharp spectral, Gaussian, box) affects the computed energy fluxes at constant filter width. We apply spatial filtering to a turbulent pipe flow simulation dataset and assess the effect on the local structure of $\Pi$. While the mean energy flux profile at each wall-normal distance is qualitatively robust across kernels, we observe significant differences in the intensity and spatial distribution of localised $\Pi$ events. Correlations between typical flow structures in the buffer layer (streaks, vortices, and Q-events) and regions of forward/backward transfer in the instantaneous $\Pi$ field differ markedly between kernel types. Cross-correlations appear strongly upstream--downstream symmetric when using the sharp spectral kernel, but asymmetric for the Gaussian and box kernels. For the Gaussian and box kernels $\Pi$ events tend to localise along the inclined meander of streaks, while they are centred on top of the streaks for the sharp spectral kernel. Moreover, using the sharp spectral kernel, we observe a coincidence of backward scatter and fluid transport away from the wall ($Q_1$), which does not appear with the Gaussian and box kernels. All kernels, however, predict backward scatter directly downstream of $Q_1$ events. The results suggest that interpretations of inter-scale energy flux based on sharp spectral scale separation should be treated with caution, since such kernels act non-local in physical space, whereas $\Pi$ events are inherently localised. Our python post-processing tool eFlux for scale separation and energy flux analysis in pipe flows is freely available and readily adaptable to other flow configurations and filter widths.</description>

      <title>Non-monotonic surface tension leads to spontaneous symmetry breaking in a binary evaporating drop</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The evaporation of water/1,2-hexanediol binary drops shows remarkable segregation dynamics, with hexanediol-rich spots forming at the rim, thus breaking axisymmetry. While the segregation of hexanediol near the rim can be attributed to the preferential evaporation of water, the symmetry-breaking and spot formation could not yet be successfully explained. With three-dimensional simulations and azimuthal stability analysis of a minimal model, we investigate the flow and composition in the drop. We show that a slightly non-monotonic surface tension causes the emergence of a counter-rotating Marangoni vortex in the hexanediol-rich rim region, which subsequently becomes azimuthally unstable and forms the observed spots. Accurate measurements with several different methods reveal that the surface tension is indeed non-monotonic. This work provides valuable insight for applications like inkjet printing or spray cooling.</description>

      <title>Direct numerical simulation of particle clustering and turbulence modulation: an Eulerian approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07988v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new Eulerian framework for the computation of turbulent compressible multiphase channel flows, specifically to assess turbulence modulation by dispersed particulate matter in dilute concentrations but with significant mass loadings. By combining a modified low-dissipation numerical scheme for the carrier gas phase and a quadrature-based moment method for the solid particle phase, turbulent statistics of the fluid phase and fluctuations of the particle phase may be obtained as both are resolved as coupled fields. Using direct numerical simulations, we demonstrate how this method effectively resolves the turbulent statistics, kinetic energy, skin friction drag, particle mass flow rate and interphase drag for moderate-Reynolds-number channel flows for the first time. Validation of our approach to the turbulent particle-free flow and the turbulent particle-laden flow proves the applicability of the carrier flow low-dissipation scheme to simulate relatively low-Mach-number compressible flows and of the quadrature-based moment method to simulate the particle phase as an Eulerian field. This study also rationalises the computed interphase drag modulation and total Reynolds shear stress results using a simplified analytical approach, revealing how the particle migration towards the wall can affect the drag between the two phases at different Stokes numbers and particle loadings. Furthermore, we show the effect of near-wall particle accumulation on the particle mass flow rate. Using our Eulerian approach, we also explore the complex interplay between the particles and turbulent fluctuations by capturing the preferential clustering of particles in turbulence streaks. This interplay leads to turbulence modulations similar to recent observations reported in prior computational works using Lagrangian simulations.</description>

      <title>Free surface topography of capillary flows using spatiotemporal phase shifting profilometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel experimental technique to characterize the free surface of capillary flows adapted from the Spatio-Temporal Phase Shifting Profilometry (ST-PSP) method introduced by Ri et al. (Journal of Optics, 2019) for solid bodies. The present study is focused on various regimes of capillary flows over inclined surfaces, including drops, rivulets, meanders, and braided films. A calibration process is carried out using a solid wedge to determine the optical distances required for the phase-to-height relationship. The optimal dye concentration necessary for accurately reconstructing the free surface of a dyed water flow is explored. The ST-PSP method is then applied to profile different liquid flows and objects, achieving large signal-to-noise ratios across all experiments. Notably, the analysis of a sessile droplet shows a promising correlation between the ST-PSP results and side-view visualizations, as evidenced by the accurate recovery of its apparent contact angle. Furthermore, free surface reconstructions of rivulet flows exhibit good agreement with the theoretical predictions of Duffy and Moffatt (The Chemical Engineering Journal and the Biochemical Engineering Journal, 1995). These results suggest that the ST-PSP method is highly effective for obtaining accurate height maps of capillary flows and objects, making it a valuable tool for validating theoretical models in the future.</description>

      <title>Residual U-Net for accurate and efficient prediction of hemodynamics in two-dimensional asymmetric stenosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05778v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents residual U-Net (U-ResNet), a deep learning surrogate model for predicting steady hemodynamic fields in two-dimensional asymmetric stenotic channels at Reynolds numbers ranging from 200 to 800. By integrating residual connections with multi-scale feature extraction, U-ResNet achieves exceptional accuracy while significantly reducing computational costs compared to computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approaches. Comprehensive evaluation against U-Net, Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), and U-Net enhanced Fourier Neural Operator (UFNO) demonstrates U-ResNet superior performance in capturing sharp hemodynamic gradients and complex flow features. For pressure prediction, U-ResNet achieves a normalized mean absolute error (NMAE) of 1.10%. Similarly, the performance of U-ResNet for wall shear stress (NMAE: 0.56%), velocity (NMAE: 1.06%), and vorticity (NMAE: 0.69%) consistently surpasses alternative architectures. Notably, U-ResNet demonstrates robust generalization to interpolated Reynolds numbers without retraining - a capability rarely achieved in existing models. From a computational perspective, U-ResNet delivers a 180-fold acceleration over CFD, reducing simulation time from approximately 30 minutes to 10 seconds per case. The model with non-dimensional formulation ensures scalability across vessel sizes and anatomical locations, enhancing its applicability to diverse clinical scenarios. These advances position U-ResNet as a promising auxiliary tool to complement CFD simulations for real-time clinical decision support, treatment planning, and medical device optimization. Future work will focus on extending the framework to three-dimensional geometries and integrating it with patient-specific data.</description>

      <title>The role of porosity in the transition to inertial regime in porous media flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the fundamental physical mechanism of the transition from Darcy to inertial (Darcy-Forchheimer) regime in steady-state flows through porous media, with the focus on vortex formation. We investigate their influence on the tortuosity--Reynolds number relation during this transition for systems of various porosities. We do so by numerically solving the Navier-Stokes equations within the pore-scale of simple cubic systems and relating the observations made therein to stochastic systems of more complex geometry. We observe that the tortuosity defined by integrals over the whole fluid volume behaves similarly in both types of systems. At the same time, in simple cubic systems, the tortuosity based on averaging of the length of the streamlines diverges from the volume-integrated one when the inertia onset takes place. We show that the discrepancy between those two tortuosities at increasing Reynolds number carries information about the dynamics of the vortex growth in the system. We stipulate that those dynamics are directly governed by the porosity. Our results highlight the utility of various definitions of tortuosity as measures of inertia in porous media flows and explain the reasons for the differences between those definitions. This can lead to a more sensible choice of inertia indicators in more application-oriented problems.</description>

      <title>UniFoil: A Universal Dataset of Airfoils in Transitional and Turbulent Regimes for Subsonic and Transonic Flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21124v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present UniFoil, a large publicly available universal airfoil dataset based on Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations. It contains over 500,000 samples spanning a wide range of Reynolds and Mach numbers, capturing both transitional and fully turbulent flows across incompressible to compressible regimes. UniFoil is designed to support machine learning research in fluid dynamics, particularly for modeling complex aerodynamic phenomena. Most existing datasets are limited to incompressible, fully turbulent flows with smooth field characteristics, overlooking the critical physics of laminar\-turbulent transition and shock\-wave interactions\-features that exhibit strong nonlinearity and sharp gradients. UniFoil addresses this limitation by offering a broad spectrum of realistic flow conditions. Turbulent simulations utilize the Spalart\-Allmaras (SA) model, while transitional flows are modeled using an e^N\-based transition prediction method coupled with the SA model. The dataset includes a comprehensive geometry set comprising over 4,800 natural laminar flow (NLF) airfoils and 30,000 fully turbulent (FT) airfoils, covering a diverse range of airfoil designs relevant to aerospace, wind energy, and marine applications. This dataset is also valuable for scientific machine learning, enabling the development of data-driven models that more accurately capture the transport processes associated with laminar-turbulent transition. UniFoil is freely available under a permissive CC\-BY\-SA license.</description>

      <title>Enhanced zeta potentials caused by surface ion mobilities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02915v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The electro-hydrodynamics near conducting walls is revisited. Attention is focused on the impact of an explicit diffuse Stern layer, which permittivity and viscosity differ from the bulk values, on the velocity of an electro-osmotic plug flow. To solve this problem we propose an approach of mapping the flow in the Stern layer to the surface dividing the Stern and diffuse layer, where an effective electro-hydrodynamic slip boundary condition is imposed. The latter implies that an effective surface charge is responding to the applied field and characterized by a mobility parameter $\mu \geq 1$. We derive analytic equations for $\mu$ and demonstrate that it is determined only by electrostatic properties of the electric double layer. These equations are then used to calculate electrokinetic (zeta) potentials of surfaces. We show that the zeta potential generally exceeds the surface one, which implies an amplification of the electro-osmotic flow. This effect is most pronounced if the hydrodynamic slip length is large and/or in concentrated solutions.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive Darcy-type law for viscoplastic fluids: I. Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06184v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A comprehensive Darcy-type law for viscoplastic fluids is proposed. Different regimes of yield-stress fluid flow in porous media can be categorised based on the Bingham number (i.e. the ratio of the yield stress to the characteristic viscous stress). In a recent study (Chaparian, J. Fluid Mech., vol. 980, A14, 2024), we addressed the yield/plastic limit (infinitely large Bingham number), namely, the onset of flow when the applied pressure gradient is just sufficient to overcome the yield stress resistance and initiate the flow. A purely geometrical universal scale was derived for the non-dimensional critical pressure gradient, which was thoroughly validated against computational data. In the present work, we investigate the Newtonian limit (infinitely large pressure difference compared to the yield stress of the fluid - ultra low Bingham number) both theoretically and computationally. We then propose a Darcy-type law applicable across the entire range of Bingham numbers by combining the mathematical models of the yield/plastic and Newtonian limits. Exhaustive computational data generated in this study (using augmented Lagrangian method coupled with anisotropic adaptive mesh at the pore scale) confirm the validity of the theoretical proposed law.</description>

Abstract: Leonardo da Vinci's aerial screw, conceived in the 15th century, represents one of the earliest conceptualizations of lift-generating rotary flight. Despite its historical significance, the aerodynamic and aeroacoustic performance of this rotor has received limited scientific attention. In this study, we employ direct numerical simulations to analyze the aerodynamic forces and acoustic emissions of a modernized da Vinci aerial screw design across a range of Reynolds numbers (2000, 4000, 8000, and 16000). These results are compared against those from a canonical two-bladed rotor producing similar lift. The aerial screw demonstrates 42.2% lower mechanical power consumption and 72.3% lower acoustic intensity per unit lift, primarily due to its larger wetted area and correspondingly lower rotational speed. Although the aerial screw exhibits a lower lift coefficient and much of its surface contributes minimally to lift generation, the net performance under iso-lift conditions highlights its efficiency and reduced noise signature. The continuous spiral geometry of the aerial screw also helps suppress blade-vortex interaction noise common in multi-bladed systems. These findings support previous scaling analyses and point toward unconventional rotor designs as viable options for low-noise aerial platforms.</description>

Abstract: Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) drives progress in numerous scientific and engineering fields, yet high-fidelity simulations remain computationally prohibitive. While machine learning approaches offer computing acceleration, they typically specialize in single physical systems or require extensive training data, hindering their applicability in highly nonlinear and 3D flow scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose OmniFluids, a pure physics pre-trained model that captures fundamental fluid dynamics laws and adapts efficiently to diverse downstream tasks with minimal data. We develop a training framework combining physics-only pre-training, coarse-grid operator distillation, and few-shot fine-tuning. This enables OmniFluids to retain broad physics knowledge while delivering fast and accurate predictions. Architecturally, OmniFluids integrates a mixture of operators, a multi-frame decoder, and factorized Fourier layers, seamlessly incorporating physics-based supervision while allowing efficient and scalable modeling of diverse tasks. Extensive tests on a broad range of 2D and 3D benchmarks show that OmniFluids outperforms state-of-the-art AI-driven methods in terms of flow field prediction and turbulence statistics. It delivers 10--100$\times$ speedups over traditional solvers while maintaining a comparable accuracy and accurately identifies unknown physical parameters from sparse, noisy data. This work demonstrates the potential of training a unified CFD solver exclusively from physics knowledge, offering a new approach for efficient and generalizable modeling across complex fluid systems.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Behavior of a Buoyant Jet Regime inside a Carbon-dioxide Ejector</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01992v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ejectors are used in various engineering systems, including steam and vapor compression cycles. Optimizing the performance of ejectors requires understanding and analysis of multiphase and turbulent flow structures associated with their internal flow fields. This approach yields higher fidelity but at a high computational cost. Lower-fidelity one-dimensional (1D) models offer lower computational costs; however, 1D models are often empirical and provide limited understanding of the internal flow fields, overlooking possibilities of optimization. Ejector flows can be categorized into four regimes: Regime 1 (R1), which is compressibility dominated; Regime 2 (R2), which is interface instability driven; Regime 3 (R3), which is buoyancy dominated; and Regime 4 (R4), which is a wall-bounded turbulent jet expansion. Among these, the buoyancy-dominated regime is the most complex and least understood. This work discusses an approach to develop a reduced-order model utilizing a self-similarity framework to capture the internal flow field of the jet within the buoyancy-dominated regime under quasi-steady, compressible, and isothermal flow conditions, where density variations arise only from mixing. The density variation is captured through the Favre-averaging approach. The model captures the expansion of a central jet influenced by momentum diffusivity and a constant streamwise pressure gradient. Interaction of the central jet with the cylindrical wall induces a counterflow annular wall jet due to the combined effects of negative radial density gradients and shear stress imposed by the wall. Initially, the discussion focuses on flow topology inside the ejector, followed by the self-similarity methodology and implementation of asymptotic analysis. Finally, the resemblance...</description>

Abstract: This study proposes a novel spatial discretization procedure for the compressible Euler equations that guarantees entropy conservation at a discrete level for thermally perfect gases. The procedure is based on a locally conservative formulation, and extends the entropy-conserving schemes to the more realistic case of thermally perfect gases, while still guaranteeing preservation of both linear invariants and kinetic energy. The proposed methodology, which can also be extended to multicomponent gases and to an Asymptotically Entropy-Conservative formulation, shows advantages in terms of accuracy and robustness when compared to existing similar approaches.</description>

Abstract: We present the results of a combined experimental and theoretical study of the spreading of viscous droplets over rough and smooth substrates. First, we experimentally investigate the wetting of a roughened glass surface by a viscous droplet of silicone oil, wide and shallow relative to the capillary length $\ell_c$. The radius of the droplet grows according to a $R_\mathrm{drop}\sim t^{1/8}$ scaling reminiscent of gravity currents (Lopez, 1976; Voinov, 1999). The droplet is preceded by a mesoscopic fluid film that percolates through the rough substrate, its radius increasing according to $R_\mathrm{film}\sim t^{3/8}/(\log t)^{1/2}$. To rationalize these observed scalings, we develop a new 'capillary current' model for the spreading of shallow droplets with arbitrary radius on both smooth and rough surfaces. We propose that, throughout their evolution, capillary currents maintain a quasi-equilibrium balance between hydrostatic and curvature pressure, perturbed only by unbalanced contact line forces arising along the droplet's edge. In addition to rationalizing our experimental data, our model provides new rationale for a number of scalings reported in prior work. In particular, for drops small with respect to $\ell_c$, it recovers the classic spreading laws of Tanner (1979) and Hoffman (1975); for drops wide with respect to $\ell_c$, it reveals how millimetric, surface-tension-driven capillary currents exhibit the same spreading behavior as relatively large-scale viscous gravity currents.</description>

Abstract: Despite the fundamentally different dissipation mechanisms, many laws and phenomena of classical turbulence equivalently manifest in quantum turbulence. The Reynolds law of dynamical similarity states that two objects of same geometry across different length scales are hydrodynamically equivalent under the same Reynolds number, leading to a universal drag coefficient law. In this work we confirm the existence of a universal drag law in a superfluid wake, facilitated by the nucleation of quantized vortices. We numerically study superfluid flow across a range of Reynolds numbers for the paradigmatic classical hard-wall and the Gaussian obstacle, popular in experimental quantum hydrodynamics. In addition, we provide a feasible method for measuring superfluid drag forces in an experimental environment using control volumes.</description>
