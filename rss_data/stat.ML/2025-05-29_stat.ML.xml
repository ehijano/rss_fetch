      <title>A Kernelised Stein Discrepancy for Assessing the Fit of Inhomogeneous Random Graph Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex data are often represented as a graph, which in turn can often be viewed as a realisation of a random graph, such as of an inhomogeneous random graph model (IRG). For general fast goodness-of-fit tests in high dimensions, kernelised Stein discrepancy (KSD) tests are a powerful tool. Here, we develop, test, and analyse a KSD-type goodness-of-fit test for IRG models that can be carried out with a single observation of the network. The test is applicable to a network of any size and does not depend on the asymptotic distribution of the test statistic. We also provide theoretical guarantees.</description>

      <title>STACI: Spatio-Temporal Aleatoric Conformal Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fitting Gaussian Processes (GPs) provides interpretable aleatoric uncertainty quantification for estimation of spatio-temporal fields. Spatio-temporal deep learning models, while scalable, typically assume a simplistic independent covariance matrix for the response, failing to capture the underlying correlation structure. However, spatio-temporal GPs suffer from issues of scalability and various forms of approximation bias resulting from restrictive assumptions of the covariance kernel function. We propose STACI, a novel framework consisting of a variational Bayesian neural network approximation of non-stationary spatio-temporal GP along with a novel spatio-temporal conformal inference algorithm. STACI is highly scalable, taking advantage of GPU training capabilities for neural network models, and provides statistically valid prediction intervals for uncertainty quantification. STACI outperforms competing GPs and deep methods in accurately approximating spatio-temporal processes and we show it easily scales to datasets with millions of observations.</description>

      <title>Nearly Dimension-Independent Convergence of Mean-Field Black-Box Variational Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that, given a mean-field location-scale variational family, black-box variational inference (BBVI) with the reparametrization gradient converges at an almost dimension-independent rate. Specifically, for strongly log-concave and log-smooth targets, the number of iterations for BBVI with a sub-Gaussian family to achieve an objective $\epsilon$-close to the global optimum is $\mathrm{O}(\log d)$, which improves over the $\mathrm{O}(d)$ dependence of full-rank location-scale families. For heavy-tailed families, we provide a weaker $\mathrm{O}(d^{2/k})$ dimension dependence, where $k$ is the number of finite moments. Additionally, if the Hessian of the target log-density is constant, the complexity is free of any explicit dimension dependence. We also prove that our bound on the gradient variance, which is key to our result, cannot be improved using only spectral bounds on the Hessian of the target log-density.</description>

      <title>Global Minimizers of $\ell^p$-Regularized Objectives Yield the Sparsest ReLU Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Overparameterized neural networks can interpolate a given dataset in many different ways, prompting the fundamental question: which among these solutions should we prefer, and what explicit regularization strategies will provably yield these solutions? This paper addresses the challenge of finding the sparsest interpolating ReLU network -- i.e., the network with the fewest nonzero parameters or neurons -- a goal with wide-ranging implications for efficiency, generalization, interpretability, theory, and model compression. Unlike post hoc pruning approaches, we propose a continuous, almost-everywhere differentiable training objective whose global minima are guaranteed to correspond to the sparsest single-hidden-layer ReLU networks that fit the data. This result marks a conceptual advance: it recasts the combinatorial problem of sparse interpolation as a smooth optimization task, potentially enabling the use of gradient-based training methods. Our objective is based on minimizing $\ell^p$ quasinorms of the weights for $0 &lt; p &lt; 1$, a classical sparsity-promoting strategy in finite-dimensional settings. However, applying these ideas to neural networks presents new challenges: the function class is infinite-dimensional, and the weights are learned using a highly nonconvex objective. We prove that, under our formulation, global minimizers correspond exactly to sparsest solutions. Our work lays a foundation for understanding when and how continuous sparsity-inducing objectives can be leveraged to recover sparse networks through training.</description>

      <title>A General-Purpose Theorem for High-Probability Bounds of Stochastic Approximation with Polyak Averaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polyak-Ruppert averaging is a widely used technique to achieve the optimal asymptotic variance of stochastic approximation (SA) algorithms, yet its high-probability performance guarantees remain underexplored in general settings. In this paper, we present a general framework for establishing non-asymptotic concentration bounds for the error of averaged SA iterates. Our approach assumes access to individual concentration bounds for the unaveraged iterates and yields a sharp bound on the averaged iterates. We also construct an example, showing the tightness of our result up to constant multiplicative factors. As direct applications, we derive tight concentration bounds for contractive SA algorithms and for algorithms such as temporal difference learning and Q-learning with averaging, obtaining new bounds in settings where traditional analysis is challenging.</description>

      <title>Spectral clustering for dependent community Hawkes process models of temporal networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal networks observed continuously over time through timestamped relational events data are commonly encountered in application settings including online social media communications, financial transactions, and international relations. Temporal networks often exhibit community structure and strong dependence patterns among node pairs. This dependence can be modeled through mutual excitations, where an interaction event from a sender to a receiver node increases the possibility of future events among other node pairs.
  We provide statistical results for a class of models that we call dependent community Hawkes (DCH) models, which combine the stochastic block model with mutually exciting Hawkes processes for modeling both community structure and dependence among node pairs, respectively. We derive a non-asymptotic upper bound on the misclustering error of spectral clustering on the event count matrix as a function of the number of nodes and communities, time duration, and the amount of dependence in the model. Our result leverages recent results on bounding an appropriate distance between a multivariate Hawkes process count vector and a Gaussian vector, along with results from random matrix theory. We also propose a DCH model that incorporates only self and reciprocal excitation along with highly scalable parameter estimation using a Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimator that we demonstrate to be consistent for growing network size and time duration.</description>

      <title>Almost Linear Convergence under Minimal Score Assumptions: Quantized Transition Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable performance in data generation across various domains, yet their efficiency remains constrained by two critical limitations: (1) the local adjacency structure of the forward Markov process, which restricts long-range transitions in the data space, and (2) inherent biases introduced during the simulation of time-inhomogeneous reverse denoising processes. To address these challenges, we propose Quantized Transition Diffusion (QTD), a novel approach that integrates data quantization with discrete diffusion dynamics. Our method first transforms the continuous data distribution $p_*$ into a discrete one $q_*$ via histogram approximation and binary encoding, enabling efficient representation in a structured discrete latent space. We then design a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) with Hamming distance-based transitions as the forward process, which inherently supports long-range movements in the original data space. For reverse-time sampling, we introduce a \textit{truncated uniformization} technique to simulate the reverse CTMC, which can provably provide unbiased generation from $q_*$ under minimal score assumptions. Through a novel KL dynamic analysis of the reverse CTMC, we prove that QTD can generate samples with $O(d\ln^2(d/\epsilon))$ score evaluations in expectation to approximate the $d$--dimensional target distribution $p_*$ within an $\epsilon$ error tolerance. Our method not only establishes state-of-the-art inference efficiency but also advances the theoretical foundations of diffusion-based generative modeling by unifying discrete and continuous diffusion paradigms.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Group Synchronization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Group synchronization is the problem of determining reliable global estimates from noisy local measurements on networks. The typical task for group synchronization is to assign elements of a group to the nodes of a graph in a way that respects group elements given on the edges which encode information about local pairwise relationships between the nodes. In this paper, we introduce a novel higher-order group synchronization problem which operates on a hypergraph and seeks to synchronize higher-order local measurements on the hyperedges to obtain global estimates on the nodes. Higher-order group synchronization is motivated by applications to computer vision and image processing, among other computational problems. First, we define the problem of higher-order group synchronization and discuss its mathematical foundations. Specifically, we give necessary and sufficient synchronizability conditions which establish the importance of cycle consistency in higher-order group synchronization. Then, we propose the first computational framework for general higher-order group synchronization; it acts globally and directly on higher-order measurements using a message passing algorithm. We discuss theoretical guarantees for our framework, including convergence analyses under outliers and noise. Finally, we show potential advantages of our method through numerical experiments. In particular, we show that in certain cases our higher-order method applied to rotational and angular synchronization outperforms standard pairwise synchronization methods and is more robust to outliers. We also show that our method has comparable performance on simulated cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) data compared to a standard cryo-EM reconstruction package.</description>

      <title>Learning Curves of Stochastic Gradient Descent in Kernel Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers a canonical problem in kernel regression: how good are the model performances when it is trained by the popular online first-order algorithms, compared to the offline ones, such as ridge and ridgeless regression? In this paper, we analyze the foundational single-pass Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) in kernel regression under source condition where the optimal predictor can even not belong to the RKHS, i.e. the model is misspecified. Specifically, we focus on the inner product kernel over the sphere and characterize the exact orders of the excess risk curves under different scales of sample sizes $n$ concerning the input dimension $d$. Surprisingly, we show that SGD achieves min-max optimal rates up to constants among all the scales, without suffering the saturation, a prevalent phenomenon observed in (ridge) regression, except when the model is highly misspecified and the learning is in a final stage where $n\gg d^{\gamma}$ with any constant $\gamma &gt;0$. The main reason for SGD to overcome the curse of saturation is the exponentially decaying step size schedule, a common practice in deep neural network training. As a byproduct, we provide the \emph{first} provable advantage of the scheme over the iterative averaging method in the common setting.</description>

      <title>Individualised Counterfactual Examples Using Conformal Prediction Intervals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Counterfactual explanations for black-box models aim to pr ovide insight into an algorithmic decision to its recipient. For a binary classification problem an individual counterfactual details which features might be changed for the model to infer the opposite class. High-dimensional feature spaces that are typical of machine learning classification models admit many possible counterfactual examples to a decision, and so it is important to identify additional criteria to select the most useful counterfactuals. In this paper, we explore the idea that the counterfactuals should be maximally informative when considering the knowledge of a specific individual about the underlying classifier. To quantify this information gain we explicitly model the knowledge of the individual, and assess the uncertainty of predictions which the individual makes by the width of a conformal prediction interval. Regions of feature space where the prediction interval is wide correspond to areas where the confidence in decision making is low, and an additional counterfactual example might be more informative to an individual. To explore and evaluate our individualised conformal prediction interval counterfactuals (CPICFs), first we present a synthetic data set on a hypercube which allows us to fully visualise the decision boundary, conformal intervals via three different methods, and resultant CPICFs. Second, in this synthetic data set we explore the impact of a single CPICF on the knowledge of an individual locally around the original query. Finally, in both our synthetic data set and a complex real world dataset with a combination of continuous and discrete variables, we measure the utility of these counterfactuals via data augmentation, testing the performance on a held out set.</description>

      <title>Credal Prediction based on Relative Likelihood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predictions in the form of sets of probability distributions, so-called credal sets, provide a suitable means to represent a learner's epistemic uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a theoretically grounded approach to credal prediction based on the statistical notion of relative likelihood: The target of prediction is the set of all (conditional) probability distributions produced by the collection of plausible models, namely those models whose relative likelihood exceeds a specified threshold. This threshold has an intuitive interpretation and allows for controlling the trade-off between correctness and precision of credal predictions. We tackle the problem of approximating credal sets defined in this way by means of suitably modified ensemble learning techniques. To validate our approach, we illustrate its effectiveness by experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrating superior uncertainty representation without compromising predictive performance. We also compare our method against several state-of-the-art baselines in credal prediction.</description>

      <title>Computing Optimal Transport Maps and Wasserstein Barycenters Using Conditional Normalizing Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel method for efficiently computing optimal transport maps and Wasserstein barycenters in high-dimensional spaces. Our approach uses conditional normalizing flows to approximate the input distributions as invertible pushforward transformations from a common latent space. This makes it possible to directly solve the primal problem using gradient-based minimization of the transport cost, unlike previous methods that rely on dual formulations and complex adversarial optimization. We show how this approach can be extended to compute Wasserstein barycenters by solving a conditional variance minimization problem. A key advantage of our conditional architecture is that it enables the computation of barycenters for hundreds of input distributions, which was computationally infeasible with previous methods. Our numerical experiments illustrate that our approach yields accurate results across various high-dimensional tasks and compares favorably with previous state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Hypothesis Testing in Imaging Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a framework for semantic hypothesis testing tailored to imaging inverse problems. Modern imaging methods struggle to support hypothesis testing, a core component of the scientific method that is essential for the rigorous interpretation of experiments and robust interfacing with decision-making processes. There are three main reasons why image-based hypothesis testing is challenging. First, the difficulty of using a single observation to simultaneously reconstruct an image, formulate hypotheses, and quantify their statistical significance. Second, the hypotheses encountered in imaging are mostly of semantic nature, rather than quantitative statements about pixel values. Third, it is challenging to control test error probabilities because the null and alternative distributions are often unknown. Our proposed approach addresses these difficulties by leveraging concepts from self-supervised computational imaging, vision-language models, and non-parametric hypothesis testing with e-values. We demonstrate our proposed framework through numerical experiments related to image-based phenotyping, where we achieve excellent power while robustly controlling Type I errors.</description>

      <title>IGNIS: A Neural Network Framework for Robust Parameter Estimation in Archimedean Copulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parameter estimation for Archimedean copulas remains a challenging problem, particularly for the recently developed A1 and A2 families that exhibit complex dependency structures. Traditional methods, such as the Method of Moments (MoM), Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), and Maximum Pseudo-Likelihood (MPL), often struggle due to issues of non-monotonic relationship with dependency measures such as Kendall's tau (as in the case of A1) and numerical instability. In this paper, we present the IGNIS Network, a novel, unified neural framework that learns a direct mapping from observable dependency measures to copula parameters, thereby overcoming the limitations of classical approaches. Our approach is trained on simulated data spanning five Archimedean copula families including Clayton, Gumbel, Frank, A1, and A2, ensuring its general applicability across the entire family. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate that the IGNIS Network reduces estimation errors compared to MoM, while inherently enforcing parameter constraints through theory-guided post-processing. We further validate the practical utility of our method on diverse real-world datasets, including financial returns (AAPL-MSFT), healthcare metrics (CDC Diabetes indicators), and environmental measurements (PM2.5 air quality). Our results underscore the transformative potential of neural methods for robust and accurate dependence modeling in modern applications.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Symplectic Generative Network (SGN), a deep generative model that leverages Hamiltonian mechanics to construct an invertible, volume-preserving mapping between a latent space and the data space. By endowing the latent space with a symplectic structure and modeling data generation as the time evolution of a Hamiltonian system, SGN achieves exact likelihood evaluation without incurring the computational overhead of Jacobian determinant calculations. In this work, we provide a rigorous mathematical foundation for SGNs through a comprehensive theoretical framework that includes: (i) complete proofs of invertibility and volume preservation, (ii) a formal complexity analysis with theoretical comparisons to Variational Autoencoders and Normalizing Flows, (iii) strengthened universal approximation results with quantitative error bounds, (iv) an information-theoretic analysis based on the geometry of statistical manifolds, and (v) an extensive stability analysis with adaptive integration guarantees. These contributions highlight the fundamental advantages of SGNs and establish a solid foundation for future empirical investigations and applications to complex, high-dimensional data.</description>

      <title>Can Copulas Be Used for Feature Selection? A Machine Learning Study on Diabetes Risk Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate diabetes risk prediction relies on identifying key features from complex health datasets, but conventional methods like mutual information (MI) filters and genetic algorithms (GAs) often overlook extreme dependencies critical for high-risk subpopulations. In this study we introduce a feature-selection framework using the upper-tail dependence coefficient ({\lambda}U) of the novel A2 copula, which quantifies how often extreme higher values of a predictor co-occur with diabetes diagnoses (target variable). Applied to the CDC Diabetes Health Indicators dataset (n=253,680), our method prioritizes five predictors (self-reported general health, high blood pressure, body mass index, mobility limitations, and high cholesterol levels) based on upper tail dependencies. These features match or outperform MI and GA selected subsets across four classifiers (Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting), achieving accuracy up to 86.5% (XGBoost) and AUC up to 0.806 (Gradient Boosting), rivaling the full 21-feature model. Permutation importance confirms clinical relevance, with BMI and general health driving accuracy. To our knowledge, this is the first work to apply a copula's upper-tail dependence for supervised feature selection, bridging extreme-value theory and machine learning to deliver a practical toolkit for diabetes prevention.</description>

      <title>Principled Out-of-Distribution Generalization via Simplicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern foundation models exhibit remarkable out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, solving tasks far beyond the support of their training data. However, the theoretical principles underpinning this phenomenon remain elusive. This paper investigates this problem by examining the compositional generalization abilities of diffusion models in image generation. Our analysis reveals that while neural network architectures are expressive enough to represent a wide range of models -- including many with undesirable behavior on OOD inputs -- the true, generalizable model that aligns with human expectations typically corresponds to the simplest among those consistent with the training data.
  Motivated by this observation, we develop a theoretical framework for OOD generalization via simplicity, quantified using a predefined simplicity metric. We analyze two key regimes: (1) the constant-gap setting, where the true model is strictly simpler than all spurious alternatives by a fixed gap, and (2) the vanishing-gap setting, where the fixed gap is replaced by a smoothness condition ensuring that models close in simplicity to the true model yield similar predictions. For both regimes, we study the regularized maximum likelihood estimator and establish the first sharp sample complexity guarantees for learning the true, generalizable, simple model.</description>

      <title>Learning Shared Representations from Unpaired Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning shared representations is a primary area of multimodal representation learning. The current approaches to achieve a shared embedding space rely heavily on paired samples from each modality, which are significantly harder to obtain than unpaired ones. In this work, we demonstrate that shared representations can be learned almost exclusively from unpaired data. Our arguments are grounded in the spectral embeddings of the random walk matrices constructed independently from each unimodal representation. Empirical results in computer vision and natural language processing domains support its potential, revealing the effectiveness of unpaired data in capturing meaningful cross-modal relations, demonstrating high capabilities in retrieval tasks, generation, arithmetics, zero-shot, and cross-domain classification. This work, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to demonstrate these capabilities almost exclusively from unpaired samples, giving rise to a cross-modal embedding that could be viewed as universal, i.e., independent of the specific modalities of the data.

      <title>Learning Where to Learn: Training Distribution Selection for Provable OOD Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization remains a fundamental challenge in machine learning. Models trained on one data distribution often experience substantial performance degradation when evaluated on shifted or unseen domains. To address this challenge, the present paper studies the design of training data distributions that maximize average-case OOD performance. First, a theoretical analysis establishes a family of generalization bounds that quantify how the choice of training distribution influences OOD error across a predefined family of target distributions. These insights motivate the introduction of two complementary algorithmic strategies: (i) directly formulating OOD risk minimization as a bilevel optimization problem over the space of probability measures and (ii) minimizing a theoretical upper bound on OOD error. Last, the paper evaluates the two approaches across a range of function approximation and operator learning examples. The proposed methods significantly improve OOD accuracy over standard empirical risk minimization with a fixed distribution. These results highlight the potential of distribution-aware training as a principled and practical framework for robust OOD generalization.</description>

      <title>Efficient Diffusion Models for Symmetric Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a framework for designing efficient diffusion models for $d$-dimensional symmetric-space Riemannian manifolds, including the torus, sphere, special orthogonal group and unitary group. Existing manifold diffusion models often depend on heat kernels, which lack closed-form expressions and require either $d$ gradient evaluations or exponential-in-$d$ arithmetic operations per training step. We introduce a new diffusion model for symmetric manifolds with a spatially-varying covariance, allowing us to leverage a projection of Euclidean Brownian motion to bypass heat kernel computations. Our training algorithm minimizes a novel efficient objective derived via Ito's Lemma, allowing each step to run in $O(1)$ gradient evaluations and nearly-linear-in-$d$ ($O(d^{1.19})$) arithmetic operations, reducing the gap between diffusions on symmetric manifolds and Euclidean space. Manifold symmetries ensure the diffusion satisfies an "average-case" Lipschitz condition, enabling accurate and efficient sample generation. Empirically, our model outperforms prior methods in training speed and improves sample quality on synthetic datasets on the torus, special orthogonal group, and unitary group.</description>

      <title>AutoSGD: Automatic Learning Rate Selection for Stochastic Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The learning rate is an important tuning parameter for stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and can greatly influence its performance. However, appropriate selection of a learning rate schedule across all iterations typically requires a non-trivial amount of user tuning effort. To address this, we introduce AutoSGD: an SGD method that automatically determines whether to increase or decrease the learning rate at a given iteration and then takes appropriate action. We introduce theory supporting the convergence of AutoSGD, along with its deterministic counterpart for standard gradient descent. Empirical results suggest strong performance of the method on a variety of traditional optimization problems and machine learning tasks.</description>

      <title>Saddle-To-Saddle Dynamics in Deep ReLU Networks: Low-Rank Bias in the First Saddle Escape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When a deep ReLU network is initialized with small weights, GD is at first dominated by the saddle at the origin in parameter space. We study the so-called escape directions, which play a similar role as the eigenvectors of the Hessian for strict saddles. We show that the optimal escape direction features a low-rank bias in its deeper layers: the first singular value of the $\ell$-th layer weight matrix is at least $\ell^{\frac{1}{4}}$ larger than any other singular value. We also prove a number of related results about these escape directions. We argue that this result is a first step in proving Saddle-to-Saddle dynamics in deep ReLU networks, where GD visits a sequence of saddles with increasing bottleneck rank.</description>

      <title>Are Statistical Methods Obsolete in the Era of Deep Learning?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the era of AI, neural networks have become increasingly popular for modeling, inference, and prediction, largely due to their potential for universal approximation. With the proliferation of such deep learning models, a question arises: are leaner statistical methods still relevant? To shed insight on this question, we employ the mechanistic nonlinear ordinary differential equation (ODE) inverse problem as a testbed, using physics-informed neural network (PINN) as a representative of the deep learning paradigm and manifold-constrained Gaussian process inference (MAGI) as a representative of statistically principled methods. Through case studies involving the SEIR model from epidemiology and the Lorenz model from chaotic dynamics, we demonstrate that statistical methods are far from obsolete, especially when working with sparse and noisy observations. On tasks such as parameter inference and trajectory reconstruction, statistically principled methods consistently achieve lower bias and variance, while using far fewer parameters and requiring less hyperparameter tuning. Statistical methods can also decisively outperform deep learning models on out-of-sample future prediction, where the absence of relevant data often leads overparameterized models astray. Additionally, we find that statistically principled approaches are more robust to accumulation of numerical imprecision and can represent the underlying system more faithful to the true governing ODEs.</description>

      <title>pared: Model selection using multi-objective optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivation: Model selection is a ubiquitous challenge in statistics. For penalized models, model selection typically entails tuning hyperparameters to maximize a measure of fit or minimize out-of-sample prediction error. However, these criteria fail to reflect other desirable characteristics, such as model sparsity, interpretability, or smoothness. Results: We present the R package pared to enable the use of multi-objective optimization for model selection. Our approach entails the use of Gaussian process-based optimization to efficiently identify solutions that represent desirable trade-offs. Our implementation includes popular models with multiple objectives including the elastic net, fused lasso, fused graphical lasso, and group graphical lasso. Our R package generates interactive graphics that allow the user to identify hyperparameter values that result in fitted models which lie on the Pareto frontier. Availability: We provide the R package pared and vignettes illustrating its application to both simulated and real data at https://github.com/priyamdas2/pared.</description>

      <title>Broad Spectrum Structure Discovery in Large-Scale Higher-Order Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex systems are often driven by higher-order interactions among multiple units, naturally represented as hypergraphs. Understanding dependency structures within these hypergraphs is crucial for understanding and predicting the behavior of complex systems but is made challenging by their combinatorial complexity and computational demands. In this paper, we introduce a class of probabilistic models that efficiently represents and discovers a broad spectrum of mesoscale structure in large-scale hypergraphs. The key insight enabling this approach is to treat classes of similar units as themselves nodes in a latent hypergraph. By modeling observed node interactions through latent interactions among classes using low-rank representations, our approach tractably captures rich structural patterns while ensuring model identifiability. This allows for direct interpretation of distinct node- and class-level structures. Empirically, our model improves link prediction over state-of-the-art methods and discovers interpretable structures in diverse real-world systems, including pharmacological and social networks, advancing the ability to incorporate large-scale higher-order data into the scientific process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The overdamped Langevin stochastic differential equation (SDE) is a classical physical model used for chemical, genetic, and hydrological dynamics. In this work, we prove that the drift and diffusion terms of a Langevin SDE are jointly identifiable from temporal marginal distributions if and only if the process is observed out of equilibrium. This complete characterization of structural identifiability removes the long-standing assumption that the diffusion must be known to identify the drift. We then complement our theory with experiments in the finite sample setting and study the practical identifiability of the drift and diffusion, in order to propose heuristics for optimal data collection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We design new differentially private algorithms for the problems of adversarial bandits and bandits with expert advice. For adversarial bandits, we give a simple and efficient conversion of any non-private bandit algorithm to a private bandit algorithm. Instantiating our conversion with existing non-private bandit algorithms gives a regret upper bound of $O\left(\frac{\sqrt{KT}}{\sqrt{\epsilon}}\right)$, improving upon the existing upper bound $O\left(\frac{\sqrt{KT \log(KT)}}{\epsilon}\right)$ for all $\epsilon \leq 1$. In particular, our algorithms allow for sublinear expected regret even when $\epsilon \leq \frac{1}{\sqrt{T}}$, establishing the first known separation between central and local differential privacy for this problem. For bandits with expert advice, we give the first differentially private algorithms, with expected regret $O\left(\frac{\sqrt{NT}}{\sqrt{\epsilon}}\right), O\left(\frac{\sqrt{KT\log(N)}\log(KT)}{\epsilon}\right)$, and $\tilde{O}\left(\frac{N^{1/6}K^{1/2}T^{2/3}\log(NT)}{\epsilon ^{1/3}} + \frac{N^{1/2}\log(NT)}{\epsilon}\right)$, where $K$ and $N$ are the number of actions and experts respectively. These rates allow us to get sublinear regret for different combinations of small and large $K, N$ and $\epsilon.$</description>

      <title>PolarGrad: A Class of Matrix-Gradient Optimizers from a Unifying Preconditioning Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ever-growing scale of deep learning models and datasets underscores the critical importance of efficient optimization methods. While preconditioned gradient methods such as Adam and AdamW are the de facto optimizers for training neural networks and large language models, structure-aware preconditioned optimizers like Shampoo and Muon, which utilize the matrix structure of gradients, have demonstrated promising evidence of faster convergence. In this paper, we introduce a unifying framework for analyzing "matrix-aware" preconditioned methods, which not only sheds light on the effectiveness of Muon and related optimizers but also leads to a class of new structure-aware preconditioned methods. A key contribution of this framework is its precise distinction between preconditioning strategies that treat neural network weights as vectors (addressing curvature anisotropy) versus those that consider their matrix structure (addressing gradient anisotropy). This perspective provides new insights into several empirical phenomena in language model pre-training, including Adam's training instabilities, Muon's accelerated convergence, and the necessity of learning rate warmup for Adam. Building upon this framework, we introduce PolarGrad, a new class of preconditioned optimization methods based on the polar decomposition of matrix-valued gradients. As a special instance, PolarGrad includes Muon with updates scaled by the nuclear norm of the gradients. We provide numerical implementations of these methods, leveraging efficient numerical polar decomposition algorithms for enhanced convergence. Our extensive evaluations across diverse matrix optimization problems and language model pre-training tasks demonstrate that PolarGrad outperforms both Adam and Muon.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Data Augmentation through Bayesian Model Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data Augmentation (DA) has become an essential tool to improve robustness and generalization of modern machine learning. However, when deciding on DA strategies it is critical to choose parameters carefully, and this can be a daunting task which is traditionally left to trial-and-error or expensive optimization based on validation performance. In this paper, we counter these limitations by proposing a novel framework for optimizing DA. In particular, we take a probabilistic view of DA, which leads to the interpretation of augmentation parameters as model (hyper)-parameters, and the optimization of the marginal likelihood with respect to these parameters as a Bayesian model selection problem. Due to its intractability, we derive a tractable Evidence Lower BOund (ELBO), which allows us to optimize augmentation parameters jointly with model parameters. We provide extensive theoretical results on variational approximation quality, generalization guarantees, invariance properties, and connections to empirical Bayes. Through experiments on computer vision tasks, we show that our approach improves calibration and yields robust performance over fixed or no augmentation. Our work provides a rigorous foundation for optimizing DA through Bayesian principles with significant potential for robust machine learning.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Bayesian Model Averaging in the Era of Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the classical, full-fledged Bayesian model averaging (BMA) paradigm to ensemble pre-trained and/or lightly-finetuned foundation models to enhance the classification performance on image and text data. To make BMA tractable under foundation models, we introduce trainable linear classifiers that take frozen features from the pre-trained foundation models as inputs. The model posteriors over the linear classifiers tell us which linear heads and frozen features are better suited for a given dataset, resulting in a principled model ensembling method. Furthermore, we propose a computationally cheaper, optimizable model averaging scheme (OMA). In OMA, we directly optimize the model ensemble weights, just like those weights based on model posterior distributions in BMA, by reducing the amount of surprise (expected entropy of the predictions) we get from predictions of ensembled models. With the rapid development of foundation models, these approaches will enable the incorporation of future, possibly significantly better foundation models to enhance the performance of challenging classification tasks.</description>

      <title>Continual Learning Beyond Experience Rehearsal and Full Model Surrogates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continual learning (CL) has remained a significant challenge for deep neural networks as learning new tasks erases previously acquired knowledge, either partially or completely. Existing solutions often rely on experience rehearsal or full model surrogates to mitigate CF. While effective, these approaches introduce substantial memory and computational overhead, limiting their scalability and applicability in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose SPARC, a scalable CL approach that eliminates the need for experience rehearsal and full-model surrogates. By effectively combining task-specific working memories and task-agnostic semantic memory for cross-task knowledge consolidation, SPARC results in a remarkable parameter efficiency, using only 6% of the parameters required by full-model surrogates. Despite its lightweight design, SPARC achieves superior performance on Seq-TinyImageNet and matches rehearsal-based methods on various CL benchmarks. Additionally, weight re-normalization in the classification layer mitigates task-specific biases, establishing SPARC as a practical and scalable solution for CL under stringent efficiency constraints.</description>

      <title>Judging LLMs on a Simplex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated evaluation of free-form outputs from large language models (LLMs) is challenging because many distinct answers can be equally valid. A common practice is to use LLMs themselves as judges, but the theoretical properties of this approach are not yet well understood. We show that a geometric framework that represents both judges and candidates as points on a probability simplex can provide helpful insight on what is or is not identifiable using LLM judges. Our theoretical analysis uncovers a "phase transition" in ranking identifiability: for binary scoring systems, true rankings are identifiable even with weak judges under mild assumptions, while rankings become non-identifiable for three or more scoring levels even with infinite data, absent additional prior knowledge. This non-identifiability highlights how uncertainty in rankings stems from not only aleatoric uncertainty (i.e., inherent stochasticity in the data) but also epistemic uncertainty regarding which assumptions hold, an aspect that has received limited attention until now. To integrate both types of uncertainty, we use Bayesian inference to encode assumptions as priors and conduct sensitivity analysis of ranking estimates and credible intervals. Empirical evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that Bayesian inference yields more accurate rankings and substantially improves coverage rates. These results underscore the importance of taking a more holistic approach to uncertainty quantification when using LLMs as judges.</description>

      <title>Handling bounded response in high dimensions: a Horseshoe prior Bayesian Beta regression approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bounded continuous responses -- such as proportions -- arise frequently in diverse scientific fields including climatology, biostatistics, and finance. Beta regression is a widely adopted framework for modeling such data, due to the flexibility of the Beta distribution over the unit interval. While Bayesian extensions of Beta regression have shown promise, existing methods are limited to low-dimensional settings and lack theoretical guarantees. In this work, we propose a novel Bayesian approach for high-dimensional sparse Beta regression framework that employs a tempered posterior. Our method incorporates the Horseshoe prior for effective shrinkage and variable selection. Most notable, we propose a novel Gibbs sampling algorithm using P\'olya-Gamma augmentation for efficient inference in Beta regression model. We also provide the first theoretical results establishing posterior consistency and convergence rates for Bayesian Beta regression. Through extensive simulation studies in both low- and high-dimensional scenarios, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing alternatives, offering improved estimation accuracy and model interpretability.
  Our method is implemented in the R package ``betaregbayes" available on Github.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Group Relative Policy Optimization: Insights into On-Policy and Off-Policy Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) in both on-policy and off-policy optimization regimes. Our motivation comes from recent work on off-policy Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), which improves training stability, sampling efficiency, and memory usage. In addition, a recent analysis of GRPO suggests that estimating the advantage function with off-policy samples could be beneficial. Building on these observations, we adapt GRPO to the off-policy setting. We show that both on-policy and off-policy GRPO objectives yield an improvement in the reward. This result motivates the use of clipped surrogate objectives in the off-policy version of GRPO. We then compare the empirical performance of reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards in post-training using both GRPO variants. Our results show that off-policy GRPO either significantly outperforms or performs on par with its on-policy counterpart.</description>

      <title>Suitability Filter: A Statistical Framework for Classifier Evaluation in Real-World Deployment Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deploying machine learning models in safety-critical domains poses a key challenge: ensuring reliable model performance on downstream user data without access to ground truth labels for direct validation. We propose the suitability filter, a novel framework designed to detect performance deterioration by utilizing suitability signals -- model output features that are sensitive to covariate shifts and indicative of potential prediction errors. The suitability filter evaluates whether classifier accuracy on unlabeled user data shows significant degradation compared to the accuracy measured on the labeled test dataset. Specifically, it ensures that this degradation does not exceed a pre-specified margin, which represents the maximum acceptable drop in accuracy. To achieve reliable performance evaluation, we aggregate suitability signals for both test and user data and compare these empirical distributions using statistical hypothesis testing, thus providing insights into decision uncertainty. Our modular method adapts to various models and domains. Empirical evaluations across different classification tasks demonstrate that the suitability filter reliably detects performance deviations due to covariate shift. This enables proactive mitigation of potential failures in high-stakes applications.</description>

      <title>Continuum-armed Bandit Optimization with Batch Pairwise Comparison Oracles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies a bandit optimization problem where the goal is to maximize a function $f(x)$ over $T$ periods for some unknown strongly concave function $f$. We consider a new pairwise comparison oracle, where the decision-maker chooses a pair of actions $(x, x')$ for a consecutive number of periods and then obtains an estimate of $f(x)-f(x')$. We show that such a pairwise comparison oracle finds important applications to joint pricing and inventory replenishment problems and network revenue management. The challenge in this bandit optimization is twofold. First, the decision-maker not only needs to determine a pair of actions $(x, x')$ but also a stopping time $n$ (i.e., the number of queries based on $(x, x')$). Second, motivated by our inventory application, the estimate of the difference $f(x)-f(x')$ is biased, which is different from existing oracles in stochastic optimization literature. To address these challenges, we first introduce a discretization technique and local polynomial approximation to relate this problem to linear bandits. Then we developed a tournament successive elimination technique to localize the discretized cell and run an interactive batched version of LinUCB algorithm on cells. We establish regret bounds that are optimal up to poly-logarithmic factors. Furthermore, we apply our proposed algorithm and analytical framework to the two operations management problems and obtain results that improve state-of-the-art results in the existing literature.</description>

      <title>On the Surprising Effectiveness of Large Learning Rates under Standard Width Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dominant paradigm for training large-scale vision and language models is He initialization and a single global learning rate (\textit{standard parameterization}, SP). Despite its practical success, standard parametrization remains poorly understood from a theoretical perspective: Existing infinite-width theory would predict instability under large learning rates and vanishing feature learning under stable learning rates. However, empirically optimal learning rates consistently decay much slower than theoretically predicted. By carefully studying neural network training dynamics, we demonstrate that this discrepancy is not fully explained by finite-width phenomena such as catapult effects or a lack of alignment between weights and incoming activations. We instead show that the apparent contradiction can be fundamentally resolved by taking the loss function into account: In contrast to Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss, we prove that under cross-entropy (CE) loss, an intermediate \textit{controlled divergence} regime emerges, where logits diverge but loss, gradients, and activations remain stable. Stable training under large learning rates enables persistent feature evolution at scale in all hidden layers, which is crucial for the practical success of SP. In experiments across optimizers (SGD, Adam), architectures (MLPs, GPT) and data modalities (vision, language), we validate that neural networks operate in this controlled divergence regime under CE loss but not under MSE loss. Our empirical evidence suggests that width-scaling considerations are surprisingly useful for predicting empirically optimal learning rate exponents. Finally, our analysis clarifies the effectiveness and limitations of recently proposed layerwise learning rate scalings for standard initialization.</description>

      <title>Demystifying the Paradox of Importance Sampling with an Estimated History-Dependent Behavior Policy in Off-Policy Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies off-policy evaluation (OPE) in reinforcement learning with a focus on behavior policy estimation for importance sampling. Prior work has shown empirically that estimating a history-dependent behavior policy can lead to lower mean squared error (MSE) even when the true behavior policy is Markovian. However, the question of why the use of history should lower MSE remains open. In this paper, we theoretically demystify this paradox by deriving a bias-variance decomposition of the MSE of ordinary importance sampling (IS) estimators, demonstrating that history-dependent behavior policy estimation decreases their asymptotic variances while increasing their finite-sample biases. Additionally, as the estimated behavior policy conditions on a longer history, we show a consistent decrease in variance. We extend these findings to a range of other OPE estimators, including the sequential IS estimator, the doubly robust estimator and the marginalized IS estimator, with the behavior policy estimated either parametrically or non-parametrically.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Quantification with Proper Scoring Rules: Adjusting Measures to Prediction Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of uncertainty quantification and propose measures of total, aleatoric, and epistemic uncertainty based on a known decomposition of (strictly) proper scoring rules, a specific type of loss function, into a divergence and an entropy component. This leads to a flexible framework for uncertainty quantification that can be instantiated with different losses (scoring rules), which makes it possible to tailor uncertainty quantification to the use case at hand. We show that this flexibility is indeed advantageous. In particular, we analyze the task of selective prediction and show that the scoring rule should ideally match the task loss. In addition, we perform experiments on two other common tasks. For out-of-distribution detection, our results confirm that a widely used measure of epistemic uncertainty, mutual information, performs best. Moreover, in the setting of active learning, our measure of epistemic uncertainty based on the zero-one-loss consistently outperforms other uncertainty measures.</description>

      <title>GLAMP: An Approximate Message Passing Framework for Transfer Learning with Applications to Lasso-based Estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Approximate Message Passing (AMP) algorithms enable precise characterization of certain classes of random objects in the high-dimensional limit, and have found widespread applications in fields such as statistics, deep learning, genetics, and communications. However, existing AMP frameworks cannot simultaneously handle matrix-valued iterates and non-separable denoising functions. This limitation prevents them from precisely characterizing estimators that draw information from multiple data sources with distribution shifts. In this work, we introduce Generalized Long Approximate Message Passing (GLAMP), a novel extension of AMP that addresses this limitation. We rigorously prove state evolution for GLAMP. GLAMP significantly broadens the scope of AMP, enabling the analysis of transfer learning estimators that were previously out of reach. We demonstrate the utility of GLAMP by precisely characterizing the risk of three Lasso-based transfer learning estimators: the Stacked Lasso, the Model Averaging Estimator, and the Second Step Estimator. We also demonstrate the remarkable finite sample accuracy of our theory via extensive simulations.</description>

      <title>Improving the Variance of Differentially Private Randomized Experiments through Clustering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00957v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimating causal effects from randomized experiments is only possible if participants are willing to disclose their potentially sensitive responses. Differential privacy, a widely used framework for ensuring an algorithms privacy guarantees, can encourage participants to share their responses without the risk of de-anonymization. However, many mechanisms achieve differential privacy by adding noise to the original dataset, which reduces the precision of causal effect estimation. This introduces a fundamental trade-off between privacy and variance when performing causal analyses on differentially private data. In this work, we propose a new differentially private mechanism, "Cluster-DP", which leverages a given cluster structure in the data to improve the privacy-variance trade-off. While our results apply to any clustering, we demonstrate that selecting higher-quality clusters, according to a quality metric we introduce, can decrease the variance penalty without compromising privacy guarantees. Finally, we evaluate the theoretical and empirical performance of our Cluster-DP algorithm on both real and simulated data, comparing it to common baselines, including two special cases of our algorithm: its unclustered version and a uniform-prior version.</description>

      <title>Infinite-dimensional Mahalanobis Distance with Applications to Kernelized Novelty Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Mahalanobis distance is a classical tool used to measure the covariance-adjusted distance between points in $\bbR^d$. In this work, we extend the concept of Mahalanobis distance to separable Banach spaces by reinterpreting it as a Cameron-Martin norm associated with a probability measure. This approach leads to a basis-free, data-driven notion of anomaly distance through the so-called variance norm, which can naturally be estimated using empirical measures of a sample. Our framework generalizes the classical $\bbR^d$, functional $(L^2[0,1])^d$, and kernelized settings; importantly, it incorporates non-injective covariance operators. We prove that the variance norm is invariant under invertible bounded linear transformations of the data, extending previous results which are limited to unitary operators. In the Hilbert space setting, we connect the variance norm to the RKHS of the covariance operator and establish consistency and convergence results for estimation using empirical measures. Using the variance norm, we introduce the notion of a kernelized nearest-neighbour Mahalanobis distance. In an empirical study on 12 real-world data sets, we demonstrate that the kernelized nearest-neighbour Mahalanobis distance outperforms the traditional kernelized Mahalanobis distance for multivariate time series novelty detection, using state-of-the-art time series kernels such as the signature, global alignment, and Volterra reservoir kernels.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for tensor eigenvalue analysis in the context of multi-modal data fusion, leveraging topological invariants such as Betti numbers. Traditional approaches to tensor eigenvalue analysis often extend matrix theory, whereas this work introduces a topological perspective to enhance the understanding of tensor structures. By establishing new theorems that link eigenvalues to topological features, the proposed framework provides deeper insights into the latent structure of data, improving both interpretability and robustness. Applications in data fusion demonstrate the theoretical and practical significance of this approach, with potential for broad impact in machine learning and data science.</description>

      <title>Privacy for Free in the Overparameterized Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14787v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Differentially private gradient descent (DP-GD) is a popular algorithm to train deep learning models with provable guarantees on the privacy of the training data. In the last decade, the problem of understanding its performance cost with respect to standard GD has received remarkable attention from the research community, which formally derived upper bounds on the excess population risk $R_{P}$ in different learning settings. However, existing bounds typically degrade with over-parameterization, i.e., as the number of parameters $p$ gets larger than the number of training samples $n$ -- a regime which is ubiquitous in current deep-learning practice. As a result, the lack of theoretical insights leaves practitioners without clear guidance, leading some to reduce the effective number of trainable parameters to improve performance, while others use larger models to achieve better results through scale. In this work, we show that in the popular random features model with quadratic loss, for any sufficiently large $p$, privacy can be obtained for free, i.e., $\left|R_{P} \right| = o(1)$, not only when the privacy parameter $\varepsilon$ has constant order, but also in the strongly private setting $\varepsilon = o(1)$. This challenges the common wisdom that over-parameterization inherently hinders performance in private learning.</description>

      <title>A Novel Characterization of the Population Area Under the Risk Coverage Curve (AURC) and Rates of Finite Sample Estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15361v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The selective classifier (SC) has been proposed for rank based uncertainty thresholding, which could have applications in safety critical areas such as medical diagnostics, autonomous driving, and the justice system. The Area Under the Risk-Coverage Curve (AURC) has emerged as the foremost evaluation metric for assessing the performance of SC systems. In this work, we present a formal statistical formulation of population AURC, presenting an equivalent expression that can be interpreted as a reweighted risk function. Through Monte Carlo methods, we derive empirical AURC plug-in estimators for finite sample scenarios. The weight estimators associated with these plug-in estimators are shown to be consistent, with low bias and tightly bounded mean squared error (MSE). The plug-in estimators are proven to converge at a rate of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\ln(n)/n})$ demonstrating statistical consistency. We empirically validate the effectiveness of our estimators through experiments across multiple datasets, model architectures, and confidence score functions (CSFs), demonstrating consistency and effectiveness in fine-tuning AURC performance.</description>

      <title>Statistical Inference for Temporal Difference Learning with Linear Function Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16106v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the statistical properties of Temporal Difference (TD) learning with Polyak-Ruppert averaging, arguably one of the most widely used algorithms in reinforcement learning, for the task of estimating the parameters of the optimal linear approximation to the value function. We make three significant contributions that improve the current state-of-the-art results: (i) we derive sharper high probability convergence guarantee that depend explicitly on the asymptotic variance and hold under weaker conditions than those normally assumed; (ii) we establish refined high-dimensional Berry-Esseen bounds over the class of convex sets, achieving faster rates than those previously established in the literature, and (iii) we propose and analyze a novel, computationally efficient online plug-in estimator of the asymptotic covariance matrix.These results enable the construction of confidence regions and simultaneous confidence intervals for the linear parameters of the value function approximation, with guaranteed finite-sample coverage. We demonstrate the applicability of our theoretical findings through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Random Feature Representation Boosting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18283v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce Random Feature Representation Boosting (RFRBoost), a novel method for constructing deep residual random feature neural networks (RFNNs) using boosting theory. RFRBoost uses random features at each layer to learn the functional gradient of the network representation, enhancing performance while preserving the convex optimization benefits of RFNNs. In the case of MSE loss, we obtain closed-form solutions to greedy layer-wise boosting with random features. For general loss functions, we show that fitting random feature residual blocks reduces to solving a quadratically constrained least squares problem. Through extensive numerical experiments on tabular datasets for both regression and classification, we show that RFRBoost significantly outperforms RFNNs and end-to-end trained MLP ResNets in the small- to medium-scale regime where RFNNs are typically applied. Moreover, RFRBoost offers substantial computational benefits, and theoretical guarantees stemming from boosting theory.</description>

      <title>LoRA-One: One-Step Full Gradient Could Suffice for Fine-Tuning Large Language Models, Provably and Efficiently</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01235v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores how theory can guide and enhance practical algorithms, using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA, Hu et al. 2022) in large language models as a case study. We rigorously prove that, under gradient descent, LoRA adapters align with specific singular subspaces of the one-step full fine-tuning gradient. This result suggests that, by properly initializing the adapters using the one-step full gradient, subspace alignment can be achieved immediately and applicable to both linear and nonlinear models. Building on our theory, we propose a theory-driven algorithm, LoRA-One, where the linear convergence (as well as generalization) is built and incorporating preconditioners theoretically helps mitigate the effects of ill-conditioning. Besides, our theory reveals connections between LoRA-One and other gradient-alignment-based methods, helping to clarify misconceptions in the design of such algorithms. LoRA-One achieves significant empirical improvements over LoRA and its variants across benchmarks in natural language understanding, mathematical reasoning, and code generation. Code is available at: https://github.com/YuanheZ/LoRA-One.</description>

      <title>Spurious Correlations in High Dimensional Regression: The Roles of Regularization, Simplicity Bias and Over-Parameterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning models have been shown to rely on spurious correlations between non-predictive features and the associated labels in the training data, with negative implications on robustness, bias and fairness. In this work, we provide a statistical characterization of this phenomenon for high-dimensional regression, when the data contains a predictive core feature $x$ and a spurious feature $y$. Specifically, we quantify the amount of spurious correlations $C$ learned via linear regression, in terms of the data covariance and the strength $\lambda$ of the ridge regularization. As a consequence, we first capture the simplicity of $y$ through the spectrum of its covariance, and its correlation with $x$ through the Schur complement of the full data covariance. Next, we prove a trade-off between $C$ and the in-distribution test loss $L$, by showing that the value of $\lambda$ that minimizes $L$ lies in an interval where $C$ is increasing. Finally, we investigate the effects of over-parameterization via the random features model, by showing its equivalence to regularized linear regression. Our theoretical results are supported by numerical experiments on Gaussian, Color-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets.</description>

      <title>Smooth Sailing: Lipschitz-Driven Uncertainty Quantification for Spatial Association</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06067v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimating associations between spatial covariates and responses - rather than merely predicting responses - is central to environmental science, epidemiology, and economics. For instance, public health officials might be interested in whether air pollution has a strictly positive association with a health outcome, and the magnitude of any effect. Standard machine learning methods often provide accurate predictions but offer limited insight into covariate-response relationships. And we show that existing methods for constructing confidence (or credible) intervals for associations fail to provide nominal coverage in the face of model misspecification and distribution shift - despite both being essentially always present in spatial problems. We introduce a method that constructs valid frequentist confidence intervals for associations in spatial settings. Our method requires minimal assumptions beyond a form of spatial smoothness. In particular, we do not require model correctness or covariate overlap between training and target locations. Our approach is the first to guarantee nominal coverage in this setting and outperforms existing techniques in both real and simulated experiments.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial Reinforcement Learning with Preference Feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider combinatorial reinforcement learning with preference feedback, where a learning agent sequentially offers an action--an assortment of multiple items to--a user, whose preference feedback follows a multinomial logistic (MNL) model. This framework allows us to model real-world scenarios, particularly those involving long-term user engagement, such as in recommender systems and online advertising. However, this framework faces two main challenges: (1) the unknown value of each item, unlike traditional MNL bandits that only address single-step preference feedback, and (2) the difficulty of ensuring optimism while maintaining tractable assortment selection in the combinatorial action space with unknown values. In this paper, we assume a contextual MNL preference model, where the mean utilities are linear, and the value of each item is approximated by a general function. We propose an algorithm, MNL-VQL, that addresses these challenges, making it both computationally and statistically efficient. As a special case, for linear MDPs (with the MNL preference feedback), we establish the first regret lower bound in this framework and show that MNL-VQL achieves nearly minimax-optimal regret. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to provide statistical guarantees in combinatorial RL with preference feedback.</description>

      <title>Learning Enhanced Ensemble Filters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17836v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The filtering distribution in hidden Markov models evolves according to the law of a mean-field model in state-observation space. The ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) approximates this mean-field model with an ensemble of interacting particles, employing a Gaussian ansatz for the joint distribution of the state and observation at each observation time. These methods are robust, but the Gaussian ansatz limits accuracy. This shortcoming is addressed by approximating the mean-field evolution using a novel form of neural operator taking probability distributions as input: a measure neural mapping (MNM). A MNM is used to design a novel approach to filtering, the MNM-enhanced ensemble filter (MNMEF), which is defined in both the mean-field limit and for interacting ensemble particle approximations. The ensemble approach uses empirical measures as input to the MNM and is implemented using the set transformer, which is invariant to ensemble permutation and allows for different ensemble sizes. The derivation of methods from a mean-field formulation allows a single parameterization of the algorithm to be deployed at different ensemble sizes. In practice fine-tuning of a small number of parameters, for specific ensemble sizes, further enhances the accuracy of the scheme. The promise of the approach is demonstrated by its superior root mean-square-error performance relative to leading methods in filtering the Lorenz 96 and Kuramoto-Sivashinsky models.</description>

      <title>Generalization Analysis for Supervised Contrastive Representation Learning under Non-IID Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04937v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Contrastive Representation Learning (CRL) has achieved impressive success in various domains in recent years. Nevertheless, the theoretical understanding of the generalization behavior of CRL has remained limited. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, the current literature only analyzes generalization bounds under the assumption that the data tuples used for contrastive learning are independently and identically distributed. However, in practice, we are often limited to a fixed pool of reusable labeled data points, making it inevitable to recycle data across tuples to create sufficiently large datasets. Therefore, the tuple-wise independence condition imposed by previous works is invalidated. In this paper, we provide a generalization analysis for the CRL framework under non-$i.i.d.$ settings that adheres to practice more realistically. Drawing inspiration from the literature on U-statistics, we derive generalization bounds which indicate that the required number of samples in each class scales as the logarithm of the covering number of the class of learnable feature representations associated to that class. Next, we apply our main results to derive excess risk bounds for common function classes such as linear maps and neural networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03219v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the \emph{linear contextual bandit problem} with independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) contexts. In this problem, we aim to develop a \emph{Best-of-Both-Worlds} (BoBW) algorithm with regret upper bounds in both stochastic and adversarial regimes. We develop an algorithm based on \emph{Follow-The-Regularized-Leader} (FTRL) with Tsallis entropy, referred to as the $\alpha$-\emph{Linear-Contextual (LC)-Tsallis-INF}. We show that its regret is at most $O(\log(T))$ in the stochastic regime under the assumption that the suboptimality gap is uniformly bounded from below, and at most $O(\sqrt{T})$ in the adversarial regime. Furthermore, our regret analysis is extended to more general regimes characterized by the \emph{margin condition} with a parameter $\beta \in (1, \infty]$, which imposes a milder assumption on the suboptimality gap. We show that the proposed algorithm achieves $O\left(\log(T)^{\frac{1+\beta}{2+\beta}}T^{\frac{1}{2+\beta}}\right)$ regret under the margin condition.</description>

      <title>Optimal convex $M$-estimation via score matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the context of linear regression, we construct a data-driven convex loss function with respect to which empirical risk minimisation yields optimal asymptotic variance in the downstream estimation of the regression coefficients. At the population level, the negative derivative of the optimal convex loss is the best decreasing approximation of the derivative of the log-density of the noise distribution. This motivates a fitting process via a nonparametric extension of score matching, corresponding to a log-concave projection of the noise distribution with respect to the Fisher divergence. At the sample level, our semiparametric estimator is computationally efficient, and we prove that it attains the minimal asymptotic covariance among all convex $M$-estimators. As an example of a non-log-concave setting, the optimal convex loss function for Cauchy errors is Huber-like, and our procedure yields asymptotic efficiency greater than $0.87$ relative to the maximum likelihood estimator of the regression coefficients that uses oracle knowledge of this error distribution. In this sense, we provide robustness and facilitate computation without sacrificing much statistical efficiency. Numerical experiments using our accompanying R package 'asm' confirm the practical merits of our proposal.</description>

      <title>Learning Latent Graph Structures and their Uncertainty</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19933v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks use relational information as an inductive bias to enhance prediction performance. Not rarely, task-relevant relations are unknown and graph structure learning approaches have been proposed to learn them from data. Given their latent nature, no graph observations are available to provide a direct training signal to the learnable relations. Therefore, graph topologies are typically learned on the prediction task alongside the other graph neural network parameters. In this paper, we demonstrate that minimizing point-prediction losses does not guarantee proper learning of the latent relational information and its associated uncertainty. Conversely, we prove that suitable loss functions on the stochastic model outputs simultaneously grant solving two tasks: (i) learning the unknown distribution of the latent graph and (ii) achieving optimal predictions of the target variable. Finally, we propose a sampling-based method that solves this joint learning task. Empirical results validate our theoretical claims and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Shielded Diffusion: Generating Novel and Diverse Images using Sparse Repellency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06025v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The adoption of text-to-image diffusion models raises concerns over reliability, drawing scrutiny under the lens of various metrics like calibration, fairness, or compute efficiency. We focus in this work on two issues that arise when deploying these models: a lack of diversity when prompting images, and a tendency to recreate images from the training set. To solve both problems, we propose a method that coaxes the sampled trajectories of pretrained diffusion models to land on images that fall outside of a reference set. We achieve this by adding repellency terms to the diffusion SDE throughout the generation trajectory, which are triggered whenever the path is expected to land too closely to an image in the shielded reference set. Our method is sparse in the sense that these repellency terms are zero and inactive most of the time, and even more so towards the end of the generation trajectory. Our method, named SPELL for sparse repellency, can be used either with a static reference set that contains protected images, or dynamically, by updating the set at each timestep with the expected images concurrently generated within a batch, and with the images of previously generated batches. We show that adding SPELL to popular diffusion models improves their diversity while impacting their FID only marginally, and performs comparatively better than other recent training-free diversity methods. We also demonstrate how SPELL can ensure a shielded generation away from a very large set of protected images by considering all 1.2M images from ImageNet as the protected set.</description>

      <title>EventFlow: Forecasting Temporal Point Processes with Flow Matching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07430v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continuous-time event sequences, in which events occur at irregular intervals, are ubiquitous across a wide range of industrial and scientific domains. The contemporary modeling paradigm is to treat such data as realizations of a temporal point process, and in machine learning it is common to model temporal point processes in an autoregressive fashion using a neural network. While autoregressive models are successful in predicting the time of a single subsequent event, their performance can degrade when forecasting longer horizons due to cascading errors and myopic predictions. We propose EventFlow, a non-autoregressive generative model for temporal point processes. The model builds on the flow matching framework in order to directly learn joint distributions over event times, side-stepping the autoregressive process. EventFlow is simple to implement and achieves a 20%-53% lower error than the nearest baseline on standard TPP benchmarks while simultaneously using fewer model calls at sampling time.</description>

      <title>Universal Approximation of Mean-Field Models via Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16295v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the use of transformers to approximate the mean-field dynamics of interacting particle systems exhibiting collective behavior. Such systems are fundamental in modeling phenomena across physics, biology, and engineering, including opinion formation, biological networks, and swarm robotics. The key characteristic of these systems is that the particles are indistinguishable, leading to permutation-equivariant dynamics. First, we empirically demonstrate that transformers are well-suited for approximating a variety of mean field models, including the Cucker-Smale model for flocking and milling, and the mean-field system for training two-layer neural networks. We validate our numerical experiments via mathematical theory. Specifically, we prove that if a finite-dimensional transformer effectively approximates the finite-dimensional vector field governing the particle system, then the $L_2$ distance between the \textit{expected transformer} and the infinite-dimensional mean-field vector field can be uniformly bounded by a function of the number of particles observed during training. Leveraging this result, we establish theoretical bounds on the distance between the true mean-field dynamics and those obtained using the transformer.</description>

      <title>AutoElicit: Using Large Language Models for Expert Prior Elicitation in Predictive Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17284v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) acquire a breadth of information across various domains. However, their computational complexity, cost, and lack of transparency often hinder their direct application for predictive tasks where privacy and interpretability are paramount. In fields such as healthcare, biology, and finance, specialised and interpretable linear models still hold considerable value. In such domains, labelled data may be scarce or expensive to obtain. Well-specified prior distributions over model parameters can reduce the sample complexity of learning through Bayesian inference; however, eliciting expert priors can be time-consuming. We therefore introduce AutoElicit to extract knowledge from LLMs and construct priors for predictive models. We show these priors are informative and can be refined using natural language. We perform a careful study contrasting AutoElicit with in-context learning and demonstrate how to perform model selection between the two methods. We find that AutoElicit yields priors that can substantially reduce error over uninformative priors, using fewer labels, and consistently outperform in-context learning. We show that AutoElicit saves over 6 months of labelling effort when building a new predictive model for urinary tract infections from sensor recordings of people living with dementia.</description>

      <title>Absolute Risk Prediction for Cannabis Use Disorder in Adolescence and Early Adulthood Using Bayesian Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09156v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Introduction: Substance use disorders (SUDs) have emerged as a pressing public health concern in the United States, with adolescent substance use often leading to SUDs in adulthood. Effective strategies are needed to stem this progression. To help fulfill this need, we developed a novel absolute risk prediction model for cannabis use disorder (CUD) for adolescents or young adults who use cannabis. Methods: We trained a Bayesian machine learning model that provides a personalized CUD absolute risk for adolescents or young adults who use cannabis with data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health. Model performance was assessed using 5-fold cross-validation (CV) with area under the curve (AUC) and ratio of the expected to observed number of cases (E/O). Independent validation of the final model was conducted using two datasets. Results: The proposed model has five risk factors: biological sex, delinquency, and scores on personality traits of conscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness. For predicting CUD risk within five years of first cannabis use, AUC values for the training dataset and two validation datasets were 0.68, 0.64, and 0.75, respectively, and E/O values were 0.95, 0.98, and 1, respectively. This indicates good discrimination and calibration performance of the model. Discussion and Conclusion: The proposed model can aid clinicians in assessing the risk of developing CUD among adolescents and young adults who use cannabis, enabling clinically appropriate interventions.</description>

      <title>PUATE: Efficient Average Treatment Effect Estimation from Treated (Positive) and Unlabeled Units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19345v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The estimation of average treatment effects (ATEs), defined as the difference in expected outcomes between treatment and control groups, is a central topic in causal inference. This study develops semiparametric efficient estimators for ATE in a setting where only a treatment group and an unlabeled group, consisting of units whose treatment status is unknown, are observed. This scenario constitutes a variant of learning from positive and unlabeled data (PU learning) and can be viewed as a special case of ATE estimation with missing data. For this setting, we derive the semiparametric efficiency bounds, which characterize the lowest achievable asymptotic variance for regular estimators. We then construct semiparametric efficient ATE estimators that attain these bounds. Our results contribute to the literature on causal inference with missing data and weakly supervised learning.</description>

      <title>BILBO: BILevel Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02121v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bilevel optimization is characterized by a two-level optimization structure, where the upper-level problem is constrained by optimal lower-level solutions, and such structures are prevalent in real-world problems. The constraint by optimal lower-level solutions poses significant challenges, especially in noisy, constrained, and derivative-free settings, as repeating lower-level optimizations is sample inefficient and predicted lower-level solutions may be suboptimal. We present BILevel Bayesian Optimization (BILBO), a novel Bayesian optimization algorithm for general bilevel problems with blackbox functions, which optimizes both upper- and lower-level problems simultaneously, without the repeated lower-level optimization required by existing methods. BILBO samples from confidence-bounds based trusted sets, which bounds the suboptimality on the lower level. Moreover, BILBO selects only one function query per iteration, where the function query selection strategy incorporates the uncertainty of estimated lower-level solutions and includes a conditional reassignment of the query to encourage exploration of the lower-level objective. The performance of BILBO is theoretically guaranteed with a sublinear regret bound for commonly used kernels and is empirically evaluated on several synthetic and real-world problems.</description>

      <title>Robust and Conjugate Spatio-Temporal Gaussian Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: State-space formulations allow for Gaussian process (GP) regression with linear-in-time computational cost in spatio-temporal settings, but performance typically suffers in the presence of outliers. In this paper, we adapt and specialise the robust and conjugate GP (RCGP) framework of Altamirano et al. (2024) to the spatio-temporal setting. In doing so, we obtain an outlier-robust spatio-temporal GP with a computational cost comparable to classical spatio-temporal GPs. We also overcome the three main drawbacks of RCGPs: their unreliable performance when the prior mean is chosen poorly, their lack of reliable uncertainty quantification, and the need to carefully select a hyperparameter by hand. We study our method extensively in finance and weather forecasting applications, demonstrating that it provides a reliable approach to spatio-temporal modelling in the presence of outliers.</description>

      <title>From Kernels to Features: A Multi-Scale Adaptive Theory of Feature Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03210v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Feature learning in neural networks is crucial for their expressive power and inductive biases, motivating various theoretical approaches. Some approaches describe network behavior after training through a change in kernel scale from initialization, resulting in a generalization power comparable to a Gaussian process. Conversely, in other approaches training results in the adaptation of the kernel to the data, involving directional changes to the kernel. The relationship and respective strengths of these two views have so far remained unresolved. This work presents a theoretical framework of multi-scale adaptive feature learning bridging these two views. Using methods from statistical mechanics, we derive analytical expressions for network output statistics which are valid across scaling regimes and in the continuum between them. A systematic expansion of the network's probability distribution reveals that mean-field scaling requires only a saddle-point approximation, while standard scaling necessitates additional correction terms. Remarkably, we find across regimes that kernel adaptation can be reduced to an effective kernel rescaling when predicting the mean network output in the special case of a linear network. However, for linear and non-linear networks, the multi-scale adaptive approach captures directional feature learning effects, providing richer insights than what could be recovered from a rescaling of the kernel alone.</description>

      <title>Model Diffusion for Certifiable Few-shot Transfer Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06970v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In contemporary deep learning, a prevalent and effective workflow for solving low-data problems is adapting powerful pre-trained foundation models (FMs) to new tasks via parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). However, while empirically effective, the resulting solutions lack generalisation guarantees to certify their accuracy - which may be required for ethical or legal reasons prior to deployment in high-importance applications. In this paper we develop a novel transfer learning approach that is designed to facilitate non-vacuous learning theoretic generalisation guarantees for downstream tasks, even in the low-shot regime. Specifically, we first use upstream tasks to train a distribution over PEFT parameters. We then learn the downstream task by a sample-and-evaluate procedure -- sampling plausible PEFTs from the trained diffusion model and selecting the one with the highest likelihood on the downstream data. Crucially, this confines our model hypothesis to a finite set of PEFT samples. In contrast to the typical continuous hypothesis spaces of neural network weights, this facilitates tighter risk certificates. We instantiate our bound and show non-trivial generalization guarantees compared to existing learning approaches which lead to vacuous bounds in the low-shot regime.</description>

      <title>Solving Empirical Bayes via Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work applies modern AI tools (transformers) to solving one of the oldest statistical problems: Poisson means under empirical Bayes (Poisson-EB) setting. In Poisson-EB a high-dimensional mean vector $\theta$ (with iid coordinates sampled from an unknown prior $\pi$) is estimated on the basis of $X=\mathrm{Poisson}(\theta)$. A transformer model is pre-trained on a set of synthetically generated pairs $(X,\theta)$ and learns to do in-context learning (ICL) by adapting to unknown $\pi$. Theoretically, we show that a sufficiently wide transformer can achieve vanishing regret with respect to an oracle estimator who knows $\pi$ as dimension grows to infinity. Practically, we discover that already very small models (100k parameters) are able to outperform the best classical algorithm (non-parametric maximum likelihood, or NPMLE) both in runtime and validation loss, which we compute on out-of-distribution synthetic data as well as real-world datasets (NHL hockey, MLB baseball, BookCorpusOpen). Finally, by using linear probes, we confirm that the transformer's EB estimator appears to internally work differently from either NPMLE or Robbins' estimators.</description>

      <title>Closed-Form Training Dynamics Reveal Learned Features and Linear Structure in Word2Vec-like Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09863v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised word embedding algorithms such as word2vec provide a minimal setting for studying representation learning in language modeling. We examine the quartic Taylor approximation of the word2vec loss around the origin, and we show that both the resulting training dynamics and the final performance on downstream tasks are empirically very similar to those of word2vec. Our main contribution is to analytically solve for both the gradient flow training dynamics and the final word embeddings in terms of only the corpus statistics and training hyperparameters. The solutions reveal that these models learn orthogonal linear subspaces one at a time, each one incrementing the effective rank of the embeddings until model capacity is saturated. Training on Wikipedia, we find that each of the top linear subspaces represents an interpretable topic-level concept. Finally, we apply our theory to describe how linear representations of more abstract semantic concepts emerge during training; these can be used to complete analogies via vector addition.</description>

      <title>Position: Don't Use the CLT in LLM Evals With Fewer Than a Few Hundred Datapoints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01747v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rigorous statistical evaluations of large language models (LLMs), including valid error bars and significance testing, are essential for meaningful and reliable performance assessment. Currently, when such statistical measures are reported, they typically rely on the Central Limit Theorem (CLT). In this position paper, we argue that while CLT-based methods for uncertainty quantification are appropriate when benchmarks consist of thousands of examples, they fail to provide adequate uncertainty estimates for LLM evaluations that rely on smaller, highly specialized benchmarks. In these small-data settings, we demonstrate that CLT-based methods perform very poorly, usually dramatically underestimating uncertainty (i.e. producing error bars that are too small). We give recommendations for alternative frequentist and Bayesian methods that are both easy to implement and more appropriate in these increasingly common scenarios. We provide a simple Python library for these Bayesian methods at https://github.com/sambowyer/bayes_evals .</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05861v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How do classification models "see" our data? Based on their success in delineating behaviors, there must be some lens through which it is easy to see the boundary between classes; however, our current set of visualization techniques makes this prospect difficult. In this work, we propose a hybrid supervised-unsupervised technique distinctly suited to visualizing the decision boundaries determined by classification problems. This method provides a human-interpretable map that can be analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively, which we demonstrate through visualizing and interpreting a decision boundary for chemical neurotoxicity. While we discuss this method in the context of chemistry-driven problems, its application can be generalized across subfields for "unboxing" the operations of machine-learning classification models.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards: GRPO's Effective Loss, Dynamics, and Success Amplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06639v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) was introduced recently and used successfully to train DeepSeek-R1 models for promoting reasoning capabilities of LLMs using verifiable or binary rewards. We show in this paper that GRPO with verifiable rewards can be written as a Kullback--Leibler (KL) regularized contrastive loss, where the contrastive samples are synthetic data sampled from the old policy. The optimal GRPO policy $\pi_{n}$ can be expressed explicitly in terms of the binary reward, as well as the first- and second-order statistics of the old policy ($\pi_{n-1}$) and the reference policy $\pi_{\text{ref}}$. Iterating this scheme, we obtain a sequence of policies $\pi_{n}$ for which we can quantify the probability of success $p_n$. We show that the probability of success of the policy satisfies a recurrence that converges to a fixed point of a function that depends on the initial probability of success $p_{\text{ref}}$ and the regularization parameter $\beta$ of the $KL$ regularizer. We show that the fixed point $p^*$ is guaranteed to be larger than $p_{\text{ref}}$, thereby demonstrating that GRPO effectively amplifies the probability of success of the policy.</description>

      <title>In-Context Linear Regression Demystified: Training Dynamics and Mechanistic Interpretability of Multi-Head Softmax Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12734v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study how multi-head softmax attention models are trained to perform in-context learning on linear data. Through extensive empirical experiments and rigorous theoretical analysis, we demystify the emergence of elegant attention patterns: a diagonal and homogeneous pattern in the key-query (KQ) weights, and a last-entry-only and zero-sum pattern in the output-value (OV) weights. Remarkably, these patterns consistently appear from gradient-based training starting from random initialization. Our analysis reveals that such emergent structures enable multi-head attention to approximately implement a debiased gradient descent predictor -- one that outperforms single-head attention and nearly achieves Bayesian optimality up to proportional factor. Furthermore, compared to linear transformers, the softmax attention readily generalizes to sequences longer than those seen during training. We also extend our study to scenarios with anisotropic covariates and multi-task linear regression. In the former, multi-head attention learns to implement a form of pre-conditioned gradient descent. In the latter, we uncover an intriguing regime where the interplay between head number and task number triggers a superposition phenomenon that efficiently resolves multi-task in-context learning. Our results reveal that in-context learning ability emerges from the trained transformer as an aggregated effect of its architecture and the underlying data distribution, paving the way for deeper understanding and broader applications of in-context learning.</description>

      <title>Identifying Causal Direction via Variational Bayesian Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07503v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Telling apart the cause and effect between two random variables with purely observational data is a challenging problem that finds applications in various scientific disciplines. A key principle utilized in this task is the algorithmic Markov condition, which postulates that the joint distribution, when factorized according to the causal direction, yields a more succinct codelength compared to the anti-causal direction. Previous approaches approximate these codelengths by relying on simple functions or Gaussian processes (GPs) with easily evaluable complexity, compromising between model fitness and computational complexity. To overcome these limitations, we propose leveraging the variational Bayesian learning of neural networks as an interpretation of the codelengths. Consequently, we can enhance the model fitness while promoting the succinctness of the codelengths, while avoiding the significant computational complexity of the GP-based approaches. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks in cause-effect identification demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, surpassing the overall performance of related complexity-based and structural causal model regression-based approaches.</description>

      <title>Improved Bounds for Swap Multicalibration and Swap Omniprediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20885v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the related problems of multicalibration -- a multigroup fairness notion and omniprediction -- a simultaneous loss minimization paradigm, both in the distributional and online settings. The recent work of Garg et al. (2024) raised the open problem of whether it is possible to efficiently achieve $O(\sqrt{T})$ $\ell_{2}$-multicalibration error against bounded linear functions. In this paper, we answer this question in a strongly affirmative sense. We propose an efficient algorithm that achieves $O(T^{\frac{1}{3}})$ $\ell_{2}$-swap multicalibration error (both in high probability and expectation). On propagating this bound onward, we obtain significantly improved rates for $\ell_{1}$-swap multicalibration and swap omniprediction for a loss class of convex Lipschitz functions. In particular, we show that our algorithm achieves $O(T^{\frac{2}{3}})$ $\ell_{1}$-swap multicalibration and swap omniprediction errors, thereby improving upon the previous best-known bound of $O(T^{\frac{7}{8}})$. As a consequence of our improved online results, we further obtain several improved sample complexity rates in the distributional setting. In particular, we establish a $O(\varepsilon ^ {-3})$ sample complexity of efficiently learning an $\varepsilon$-swap omnipredictor for the class of convex and Lipschitz functions, $O(\varepsilon ^{-2.5})$ sample complexity of efficiently learning an $\varepsilon$-swap agnostic learner for the squared loss, and $O(\varepsilon ^ {-5}), O(\varepsilon ^ {-2.5})$ sample complexities of learning $\ell_{1}, \ell_{2}$-swap multicalibrated predictors against linear functions, all of which significantly improve on the previous best-known bounds.</description>

      <title>Bridging Arbitrary and Tree Metrics via Differentiable Gromov Hyperbolicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21073v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Trees and the associated shortest-path tree metrics provide a powerful framework for representing hierarchical and combinatorial structures in data. Given an arbitrary metric space, its deviation from a tree metric can be quantified by Gromov's $\delta$-hyperbolicity. Nonetheless, designing algorithms that bridge an arbitrary metric to its closest tree metric is still a vivid subject of interest, as most common approaches are either heuristical and lack guarantees, or perform moderately well. In this work, we introduce a novel differentiable optimization framework, coined DeltaZero, that solves this problem. Our method leverages a smooth surrogate for Gromov's $\delta$-hyperbolicity which enables a gradient-based optimization, with a tractable complexity. The corresponding optimization procedure is derived from a problem with better worst case guarantees than existing bounds, and is justified statistically. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art distortion.</description>
