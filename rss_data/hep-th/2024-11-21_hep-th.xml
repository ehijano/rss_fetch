      <title>An exceptionally simple family of Orthosymplectic 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ rank-0 SCFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We look at a family of 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ rank-0 orthosymplectic quiver gauge theories. We define a superconformal field theory (SCFT) to be rank-0 if either the Higgs branch or Coulomb branch is trivial. This family of non-linear orthosymplectic quivers has Coulomb branches that can be factorized into products of known moduli spaces. More importantly, the Higgs branches are all trivial. Consequently, the full moduli space of the smallest member is simply $\mathrm{(one-}F_4 \; \mathrm{instanton}) \times \mathrm{(one-}F_4 \; \mathrm{instanton})$. Although the $3d$ mirror is non-Lagrangian, it can be understood through the gauging of topological symmetries of Lagrangian theories. Since the 3d mirror possesses a trivial Coulomb branch, we discuss some implications for rank-0 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFTs and symplectic duality.</description>

      <title>D-commuting SYK model: building quantum chaos from integrable blocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a new family of quantum chaotic models by combining multiple copies of integrable commuting SYK models. As each copy of the commuting SYK model does not commute with others, this construction breaks the integrability of each commuting SYK and the family of models demonstrates the emergence of quantum chaos. We study the spectrum of this model analytically in the double-scaled limit. As the number of copies tends to infinity, the spectrum becomes compact and equivalent to the regular SYK model. For finite $d$ copies, the spectrum is close to the regular SYK model in UV but has an exponential tail $e^{E/T_c}$ in the IR. We identify the reciprocal of the exponent in the tail as a critical temperature $T_c$, above which the model should be quantum chaotic. $T_c$ monotonically decreases as $d$ increases, which expands the chaotic regime over the non-chaotic regime. We propose the existence of a new phase around $T_c$, and the dynamics should be very different in two phases. We further carry out numeric analysis at finite $d$, which supports our proposal.
  Given any finite dimensional local Hamiltonian, by decomposing it into $d$ groups, in which all terms in one group commute with each other but terms from different groups may not, our analysis can give an estimate of the critical temperature for quantum chaos based on the decomposition. We also comment on the implication of the critical temperature to future quantum simulations of quantum chaos and quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Scaffolding Residues in Yang-Mills-Scalar \`a la CHY</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent work by Arkani-Hamed et al. arXiv:2401.00041, we compute the ''scaffolding'' residue of $2n$-scalar Yang-Mills-Scalar amplitudes to obtain pure $n$-gluon amplitudes \`a la Cachazo-He-Yuan (CHY). In particular, we show how the Pfaffian of $\Psi$, which is a matrix rich in structure, emerges from that of the simple $A$ matrix. The same CHY computation straightforwardly produces $n$-graviton amplitudes from $2n$-scalar amplitudes in the Einstein-Maxwell-Scalar theory. We also consider partial ''scaffolding'' residues, i.e., general multi-collinear limits and their interplay with color-dressed amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Bridging Boundaries: $T\bar{T}$, Double Holography, and Reflected Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the reflected entropy for bipartite mixed state configurations in a $T\bar{T}$ deformed boundary conformal field theory in $2$ dimensions (BCFT$_2$). The bulk dual is described by asymptotically AdS$_3$ geometries with the cut off surface pushed deeper into the bulk and truncated by an end of the world brane. We obtain the reflected entropy up to a linear order in the radial cut-off for static and time dependent configurations involving an eternal black hole, from the island and defect extremal surface (DES) prescriptions in the context of the deformed AdS/BCFT. We observe agreement of the leading order correction for all cases between the two prescriptions. We also obtain the analogous of the Page curves for the reflected entropy and investigate the modification due to the $T\bar{T}$ deformation.</description>

      <title>Towards Stabilization on Noncommutative Torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent introduction of center vortices with 't Hooft flux on two torus compactification leads to a new semiclassical regime where confinement is analytically calculable. In this work, we investigate the stability of the classical minima for gauge fields under quantum corrections. Although the classical $Z_N \times Z_N$ symmetric minima is stable at small-$N$, because of the nature of the quantum corrections, it can be destabilized at sufficiently large-$N$. Using Morita equivalence, we switch to field theory on noncommutative torus instead of working with theory on torus with 't Hooft flux in a certain limit. Noncommutative Yang-Mills theory compactified on two torus leads to a tachyonic instability and it leads to the spontaneous breaking of translation symmetry. We discuss that spontaneous breaking of translation symmetry is identical to the $Z_N \times Z_N$ center symmetry breaking similar to an older version of large N twisted Eguichi-Kawai model. We compute the photon polarization diagram for noncommutative U(1) theory in the presence of adjoint fermions and show that they stabilize the tachyonic instability on the noncommutative torus and restore the broken symmetry.</description>

      <title>On-shell approach to scalar hair in spinning binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an on-shell description of spinning binary systems in gravitational theories where compact objects display scalar hair. The framework involves matter particles of arbitrary spin which, in addition to the minimal coupling to gravitons, are conformally coupled to a massless scalar mediating non-standard interactions. We use the unitary factorization techniques to derive the on-shell amplitudes relevant for emission of scalars and gravitons in matter scattering, paying attention to parametrize the freedom due to contact terms. Using the KMOC formalism, these amplitudes allow one to derive succinct expressions for the radiation waveforms at the leading post-Minkowskian order, together with the associated memory effects. Furthermore, we compute the power emitted via gravitational and scalar radiation in hyperbolic encounters of compact objects. After a continuation to bound orbits, these can be compared with the results obtained in specific scalar-tensor theories where black holes exhibit scalar hair, such as the scalar-Gauss-Bonnet or dynamical Chern-Simons theories. Finally, we identify possible deformations from the conformal coupling that can contribute to radiation observables at the same post-Newtonian order.</description>

      <title>Parisi-Sourlas Supertranslation and Scale without Conformal symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the possibility of emergent supersymmetry in critical random systems, we study a field theory model with a quartic potential of one superfield, possessing the Parisi-Sourlas supertranslation symmetry. Within perturbative $\epsilon$ expansion, we find nine non-trivial scale invariant renormalization group fixed points, but only one of them is conformal. We, however, believe scale invariance without conformal invariance cannot occur without a sophisticated mechanism because it predicts the existence of a non-conserved but non-renormalized vector operator called virial current, whose existence must be non-generic. We show that the virial current in this model is related to the supercurrent by supertranslation. The supertranslation Ward-Takahashi identity circumvents the genericity argument, explaining its non-renormalization property.</description>

      <title>Dynamical behaviour of soliton train in holographic superfluids at zero temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13007v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a soliton train configuration with holographic superfluid model under AdS soliton background. We investigate the stability of a soliton train using Bloch waves under two distinct quantization schemes. Upon imposing a minor perturbation on the soliton train system, it has been observed that there exist two elastic modes and one phonon mode. Most importantly, we find, under soliton train background, that there is a rich phase diagram concerning the chemical potential under standard quantization. Nevertheless, there are no unstable modes under alternative quantization.</description>

      <title>A toy model for $p$-form gauge symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The abelian $(p+1)$-form gauge field is inherently coupled to the $p$-brane worldvolume. After quantization, the corresponding $p$-form gauge transformation is associated with the local phase ambiguity of the $p$-brane wave functional. In essence, the $p$-form gauge symmetry can be realized as a special construction of the generic 0-form gauge symmetry in the functional space of $p$-brane configurations. The non-abelian generalization is straightforward in the functional space language. To simplify the analysis, we further introduce a toy model where the infinite dimensional functional space of $p$-brane configurations is replaced by a finite dimensional matrix space. After taking the symmetric trace in the matrix model, the original discussions of the $p$-form gauge symmetry can be inherited by the toy model.</description>

Abstract: We study holography of the 3d Chern-Simons theory as a gauge theory of $so(3,2)$, $sl_4$ and $sl_5$ algebras. For the near horizon boundary conditions we comment solutions from several projectors from Chern-Simons to the metric formulation. These solutions are generalized BTZ solutions for our theories. We also study the classification according to $so(3,2)$ one parameter subgroups for obtained solutions.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian entanglement asymmetry in random states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The entanglement asymmetry measures the extent to which a symmetry is broken within a subsystem of an extended quantum system. Here, we analyse this quantity in Haar random states for arbitrary compact, semi-simple Lie groups, building on and generalising recent results obtained for the $U(1)$ symmetric case. We find that, for any symmetry group, the average entanglement asymmetry vanishes in the thermodynamic limit when the subsystem is smaller than its complement. When the subsystem and its complement are of equal size, the entanglement asymmetry jumps to a finite value, indicating a sudden transition of the subsystem from a fully symmetric state to one devoid of any symmetry. For larger subsystem sizes, the entanglement asymmetry displays a logarithmic scaling with a coefficient fixed by the dimension of the group. We also investigate the fluctuations of the entanglement asymmetry, which tend to zero in the thermodynamic limit. We check our findings against exact numerical calculations for the $SU(2)$ and $SU(3)$ groups. We further discuss their implications for the thermalisation of isolated quantum systems and black hole evaporation.</description>

      <title>On Emergent Directions in Weakly Coupled, Large N$_c$ $\mathcal{N}=1$ SYM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills theory compactified on $\mathbb{R}^3 \times S^1_L$ with small $L$ has many merits, for example the long range effective theory is weakly coupled and adopts rich topological structures, making it semi-classically solvable. Due to the $SU(N) \to U(1)^{N-1}$ symmetry breaking by gauge holonomy, the low-energy effective theory can be described in terms of unbroken $U(1)$ photons and gauge holonomy. With the addition of $N_f$ adjoint light fermions, the center symmetry breaking phase transition can be studied using the twisted partition function, i.e., fermions with periodic boundary conditions, which preserve the supersymmetry in the massless case. In this paper, we show that in the large-$N$ abelian limit with $N_f=1$ and an $N$-independent W-boson mass, the long-range $3$d effective theory can be regarded as a bosonic field theory in $4$d with an emergent spatial dimension. The emergent dimension is flat in the confining phase, but conformally flat in the center-symmetry broken phase with a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ reflection symmetry. The center symmetry breaking phase transition itself is due to the competition between instanton-monopoles, magnetic and neutral bions controlled by the fermion mass, whose critical value at the transition point is given analytically in the large $N$ limit.</description>

      <title>Non-Perturbative Corrections to Charged Black Hole Evaporation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent work of Brown et al. (arXiv:2411.03447) demonstrated that the low-temperature evaporation rate of a large near-extremal charged black hole is significantly reduced from semiclassical expectations. The quantum corrections responsible for the deviation come from Schwarzian modes of an emergent Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity description of the near-horizon geometry of the black hole. Using a one-parameter family of non-perturbative Airy completions, we extend these results to incorporate non-perturbative effects. At large parameter value, the non-perturbative evaporation rate is even smaller than the perturbative JT gravity results. The disparity becomes especially pronounced at very low energies, where the non-perturbative neutral Hawking flux is suppressed by a double exponential in the entropy of the black hole, effectively stopping its evaporation until the next charged particle is emitted via the Schwinger effect. We also explore an alternative family of Bessel completions for which the non-perturbative energy flux exceeds the perturbative JT gravity prediction.</description>

      <title>Effective Actions for Domain Wall Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a systematic method to derive the effective action for domain walls directly from the scalar field theory that gives rise to their solitonic solutions. The effective action for the Goldstone mode, which characterizes the soliton's position, is shown to consist of the Nambu-Goto action supplemented by higher-order curvature invariants associated to its worldvolume metric. Our approach constrains the corrections to a finite set of Galileon terms, specifying both their functional forms and the procedure to compute their coefficients. We do a collection of tests across various models in $2+1$ and $3+1$ dimensions that confirm the validity of this framework. Additionally, the method is extended to include bound scalar fields living on the worldsheet, along with their couplings to the Goldstone mode. These interactions reveal a universal non-minimal coupling of these scalar fields to the Ricci scalar on the worldsheet. A significant consequence of this coupling is the emergence of a parametric instability, driven by interactions between the bound states and the Goldstone mode.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relations between the graviton mass and the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ have led to some interesting implications. We show that in any approach which leads to a direct correlation between the graviton mass and $\Lambda$, either through direct substitution of gravitational coupling in dispersion relations or through the linearization of Einstein equations with massive spin-2 fields, the Compton wavelength of the graviton lies in the superhorizon scale. As a result any gravitational approaches where the graviton mass is related directly to the cosmological constant are of no observational significance.</description>

      <title>Deep Boundary Perturbations at a Quantum Critical Point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a new class of problems in the study of (quantum) critical phenomena, termed "deep boundary criticality". Traditionally, critical systems are analyzed with two types of perturbations: those uniformly distributed throughout the bulk, which can significantly alter the bulk criticality by triggering a nontrivial bulk renormalization group flow, and those confined to a boundary or subdimensional defect, which affect only the boundary or defect condition. Here, we go beyond this paradigm by studying quantum critical systems with boundary perturbations that decay algebraically (following a power law) into the bulk. By continuously varying the decay exponent, such perturbations can transition between having no effect on the bulk and strongly influencing bulk behavior. We investigate this new regime using two prototypical models based on (1+1)D massless Dirac fermions. Through a combination of analytical and numerical approaches, we uncover exotic scaling laws in simple observables and observe qualitative changes in model behavior as the decay exponent varies.</description>

      <title>Efficient on-shell matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an efficient method to perform on-shell matching calculations in effective field theories. The standard off-shell approach to matching requires the use of a Green's basis that includes redundant and evanescent operators. The reduction of such a basis to a physical one is often highly non-trivial, difficult to automate and error prone. Our proposal is based on a numerical solution of the corresponding on-shell matching equations, which automatically implements in a trivial way the delicate cancellation between the non-local terms in the full theory and those in the effective one. The use of rational on-shell kinematics ensures an exact analytic solution despite the numerical procedure. In this way we only need a physical basis to perform the matching. Our procedure can be used to reduce any Green's basis to an arbitrary physical one, or to translate between physical bases; to renormalize arbitrary effective Lagrangians, directly in terms of a physical basis; and to perform finite matching, including evanescent contributions, as we discuss with explicit examples.</description>

      <title>Entanglement entropy of a color flux tube in (1+1)D Yang-Mills theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent work arxiv:2410.00112 , we computed a novel flux tube entanglement entropy (FTE$^2$) of the color flux tube stretched between a heavy quark-antiquark pair on a Euclidean lattice in (2+1)D Yang-Mills theory. Our numerical results suggested that FTE$^2$ can be partitioned into an internal color entanglement entropy and a vibrational entropy corresponding to the transverse excitations of a QCD string, with the latter described by a thin string model. Since the color flux tube does not have transverse excitations in (1+1)D, we analytically compute the contribution of the internal color degrees of freedom to FTE$^2$ in this simpler framework. For the multipartite partitioning of the color flux tube, we find the remarkable result that FTE$^2$ only depends on the number of times the flux tube crosses the border between two spatial regions, and the dimension of the representation of the color group, but not on the string length. The result holds independently of whether the branching points are placed on the vertices of the lattice or in the center of plaquettes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse the stability issue of the vector and axial modes of the torsion and nonmetricity tensors around general backgrounds in the framework of cubic Metric-Affine Gravity. We show that the presence of cubic order invariants defined from the curvature, torsion and nonmetricity tensors allow the cancellation of the well-known instabilities arising in the vector and axial sectors of quadratic Metric-Affine Gravity. For the resulting theory, we also obtain Reissner-Nordstr\"om-like black hole solutions with dynamical torsion and nonmetricity, which in general include massive tensor modes for these quantities, thus avoiding further no-go theorems that potentially prevent a consistent interaction of massless higher spin fields in the quantum regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate soliton solutions in a system involving a charged Dirac field minimally coupled to Einstein gravity and the Bardeen field. We analyze the impact of two key parameters on the properties of the solution family: the magnetic charge $p$ of the Bardeen field and the electric charge $q$ of the Dirac field. We discover that the introduction of the Bardeen field alters the critical charge of the charged Dirac field. In reference [1], solutions named frozen stars are obtained when the magnetic charge is sufficiently large and the frequency approaches zero. In this paper, we define an effective frequency and find that, when the magnetic charge is sufficiently large, a frozen star solution can also be obtained, at which point the effective frequency approaches zero rather than the frequency itself.</description>

Abstract: A flavor-unified theory based on the simple Lie algebra of ${\mathfrak{s}\mathfrak{u}}(8)$ was previously proposed to generate the observed Standard Model quark/lepton mass hierarchies and the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa mixing pattern due to their non-universal symmetry properties. A level-$1$ affine Lie algebra of $\widehat{ \mathfrak{s}\mathfrak{u} }(8)_{ k_U =1}$ with the ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric extension is found to unify three gauge couplings through the maximally symmetry breaking pattern.</description>

      <title>Hawking radiation at the zero temperature limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the thermal radiation derived by Hawking can be smoothly extended to the $T=0$ limit for Kerr black holes. The emission of the modes with $\omega &gt; m\Omega $ comes to a halt as the surface gravity vanishes. However, Kerr black holes smoothly continue to radiate both in bosonic and fermionic modes with $\omega &lt; m\Omega$, at the $T=0$ limit. We derive explicit expressions for the absorption probabilities which imply that the highest rate of emission pertains to the modes with $\omega=(m\Omega)/2$, both for bosonic and fermionic cases. At the zero limit of thermal radiation, the number of emitted particles vanishes as $\omega \to 0$, which strictly differentiates it from the non-thermal radiation of soft particles by extremal Kerr black holes. We also note that the thermal radiation at the zero limit, drives the black hole away from extremality in accord with the third law and the cosmic censorship conjecture</description>

      <title>Radiative Mass Mechanism: Addressing the Flavour Hierarchy and Strong CP Puzzle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a class of models based on the parity invariant Left-Right Symmetric Model (LRSM), which incorporates the mechanism of radiative generation of fermion masses while simultaneously possessing the solution to the Strong CP problem. A flavour non-universal gauged abelian symmetry is imposed on top of LRSM, which helps in inducing the masses of second and first-generation fermions at one-loop and two-loop, respectively, and thereby reproduces the hierarchical spectrum of the masses. Parity invariance requires the vanishing of the strong CP parameter at the zeroth order, and the non-zero contribution arises at the two-loop level, which is in agreement with the experimental constraints. The minimal model predicts flavour symmetry breaking scale and the $SU(2)_R$ symmetry breaking scale at the same level. flavour non-universality of the new gauge interaction leads to various flavour-changing transitions both in quarks and leptonic sectors and, therefore, has various phenomenologically interesting signatures. The model predicts a new physics scale near $10^8$ GeV or above for phenomenological consistent solutions. This, in turn, restricts strong CP phase $\bar{\theta} \lesssim 10^{-14}$ as the parity breaking scale and flavour scale are related in the minimal framework.</description>

      <title>Beyond Classical Thermodynamics: Insight into the Microstructures of Black Holes with Quantum-Triggered Violations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the microstructures of a charged AdS (Anti-de Sitter) black hole exhibiting quantum anomalies through the lens of Ruppeiner geometry. Previous research has established that black holes undergo $P$-$V$ phase transitions and exhibit critical phenomena near their critical points, characterized by four critical exponents that typically obey scaling laws predicted by mean-field theory. However, recent findings have revealed that black holes with quantum anomalies can violate these scaling laws. Motivated by these discoveries, we employ Ruppeiner geometry to probe the thermodynamic fluctuations and gain insights into the microstructure of such black holes. Our analysis aims to elucidate how quantum effects modify the microscopic properties of spacetime, offering a novel perspective on the understanding of black hole thermodynamics.</description>

Abstract: Using effective field theory approach one can describe localization of electromagnetic field on a non-topological soliton. Pursuing this aim we consider the U(1) gauge theory with gauge kinetic coupling to a self-interacting complex neutral Proca field. The model possesses single energy scale given by the vector boson mass. Considering spherically symmetric stationary configurations, we study vibrational modes of the Proca field on the background of the soliton and discuss their properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the scenario of a fluctuating spacetime due to a deformed commutation relation with a fluctuating deformation parameter, or to a fluctuating metric tensor. By computing the resulting dynamics and averaging over these fluctuations, we find that a system experiences a decoherence in the momentum basis. We studied the predictions of the model for a free particle and an harmonic oscillator. Using experimental data taken from a mechanical oscillator prepared in quantum states of motion, we put a bound on the free parameters of the considered model. In addition, we comment on how these measurements can also provide bounds to other phenomenological quantum gravity models, such as the length scale for nonlocal dynamics.</description>

      <title>Living dangerously with decoupled first/second generation scalars: SUSY prospects at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The string landscape statistical draw to large scalar soft masses leads to a mixed quasi-degeneracy/decoupling solution to the SUSY flavor and CP problems where first/second generation matter scalars lie in the 20-40 TeV range. With increasing first/second generation scalars, SUSY models actually become more natural due to two-loop RG effects which suppress the corresponding third generation soft masses. This can also lead to substantial parameter space regions which are forbidden by the presence of charge and/or color breaking (CCB) minima of the scalar potential. We outline the allowed SUSY parameter space for the gravity-mediated three extra-parameter-non-universal Higgs model NUHM3. The natural regions with m_h~ 125 GeV, \Delta_{EW}&lt;~ 30 and decoupled first/second generation scalar are characterized by rather heavy gluinos and EW gauginos, but with rather small \mu and top-squarks not far beyond LHC Run 2 limits. This scenario also explains why SUSY has so far eluded discovery at LHC in that the parameter space with small scalar and gaugino masses is all excluded by the presence of CCB minima.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by a recent construction of non-supersymmetric $\text{AdS}_3$, we revisit the $O(16)\times O(16)$ heterotic string compactified on a torus. The string one-loop potential energy has interesting dependence on the classical moduli; extrema of this potential include loci where the gauge symmetry is maximally enhanced. Focusing on the case of a circle, we use lattice embeddings to find the maximal enhancement points together with their spectra of massless and tachyonic modes. We find an extended Dynkin diagram that encodes the global structure of the moduli space, as well as all symmetry enhancements and the loci where they occur. We find $107$ points of maximal enhancement with $8$ that are free of tachyons. The tachyon-free points each have positive cosmological constant. We determine the profile of the potential energy near each of these points and find that one is a maximum while three are saddle points. The remaining four live at the boundary of a tachyonic region in field space. In this way, we show that every point of maximal symmetry enhancement is unstable. We further find that the curvature of this stringy potential satisfies the de Sitter swampland conjecture. Finally, we discuss the implications for constructions of $\text{AdS}_3$.</description>

Abstract: We investigate $T\bar{T}$ deformation on non-Hermitian coupled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model and the holographic picture. The relationship between ground state and thermofield double state is preserved under the $T\bar{T}$ deformation. We prove that $T\bar{T}$ deformed theory provides a reparameterization in large $N$ limit. These deformation effects is calculated numerically with green functions and free energy. The thermodynamic phase structures show the equivalence of the wormhole-black hole picture between non-Hermitian model and Hermitian model still holds under $T\bar{T}$ deformation. We also study the correlation function in Lorentz time and revival dynamic.</description>

      <title>On co-dimension 2 defect anomalies in N=4 SYM and (2,0) theory via brane probes in AdS/CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07881v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a $\frac{1}{2}$-BPS solution for a D3 brane probe in AdS$_5 \times S^5$ that has world-volume geometry of AdS$_3 \times S^1$. It intersects the boundary over a surface that represents a dimension 2 defect in the boundary N=4 SYM theory. The effective action of the probe brane is proportional to the logarithmically divergent volume of AdS$_3$ and may thus be interpreted as computing conformal anomaly of the supersymmetric $S^2$ defect. The classical action scales as $N$. We compute the 1-loop correction to it due to quantum fluctuations of the D3 brane world-volume fields and compare the result to an earlier suggested expression for the defect anomaly. We also perform a similar analysis of a $\frac{1}{2}$-BPS M5 brane probe solution in AdS$_7 \times S^4$ with the world-volume geometry of AdS$_5 \times S^1$ that represents a dimension 4 defect in the boundary (2,0) 6d theory. Here the classical M5 brane action computes the leading order $N^2$ term in $a$-anomaly of the supersymmetric $S^4$ defect. We perform a detailed computation of the 1-loop correction to the M5 brane effective action and thus provide a prediction for the subleading constant in the $S^4$ defect $a$-anomaly coefficient.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13706v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Massive higher spin fields are notoriously difficult to introduce interactions when they are described by symmetric (spin)-tensors. An alternative approach is to use chiral description that does not have unphysical longitudinal modes. For low spin fields we show that chiral and symmetric approaches can be related via a family of invertible change of variables (equivalent to parent actions), which should facilitate introduction of consistent interactions in the symmetric approach and help to control parity in the chiral one. We consider some examples of electromagnetic and gravitational interactions and their transmutations when going to the chiral formulation. An interesting feature of the relation is how second class constraints get eliminated while preserving Lorentz invariance.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we present a gravitational dual to a constriction Josephson junction constructed from the AdS/BCFT correspondence. On the gravity side, we consider a planar AdS-Schwarzschild black hole. Our junction is connected by the boundary $\partial\Omega$ with tension $\Sigma$ on the boundary CFT. This approach lead us to analytical solutions rather than usual numerical methods. Our computations on the gravity side reproduce the standard relation between the current across the junction and the phase difference of the condensate controlled by the tension $\Sigma$. We also study the maximum current's dependence on the junction's tension and size and reproduce familiar results.</description>

      <title>Probing the Holographic Universe: Aspects of Entanglement Entropy Modifications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entanglement entropy is crucial for understanding the link between quantum mechanics and information theory. This thesis investigates how energy fluctuations and acceleration affect entanglement entropy through three key scenarios. First, we analyze entanglement between disjoint Rindler observers in de Sitter spacetime. We introduce 1-loop corrections to the partition function of the conformal field theory, disrupting the previously flat entanglement spectrum and resulting in an area law for entanglement entropy, while preserving the finiteness of the Hilbert space. Next, we extend the holographic entanglement entropy framework to field theories with global $U(1)$ symmetry, considering non-linearly charged theories and their thermal and quantum fluctuations. We find that the dual theory experiences spontaneous symmetry breaking and a reduction in the leading-order coefficient of the $\langle TT\rangle$ correlator due to quantum corrections. Using conformal electrodynamics coupled with three-dimensional gravity as an example, we explore a black hole solution and its connection to two-dimensional free bosons. Finally, we investigate three-dimensional accelerating black holes, revealing that increased acceleration reduces the accessible boundary region and, consequently, the entanglement entropy. This suggests a loss of information in the dual theory due to acceleration.</description>

Abstract: We investigate two-dimensional conformal field theories (CFTs) with affine $\widehat{su}(2)$ and $\widehat{su}(3)$ algebra symmetry. Their bosonic modular-invariant partition functions have been fully classified based on the ADE classification. In this work, we extend the classification to include fermionic and parafermionic CFTs with the same affine symmetries, utilizing techniques of fermionization and parafermionization. We find that the fermionic and parafermionic $\widehat{su}(2)$ models are related to non-simply laced Dynkin diagrams.</description>

      <title>Measurement in Quantum Field Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.13356v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The topic of measurement in relativistic quantum field theory is addressed in this article. Some of the long standing problems of this subject are highlighted, including the incompatibility of an instantaneous ``collapse of the wavefunction'' with relativity of simultaneity, and the difficulty of maintaining causality in the rules for measurement highlighted by ``impossible measurement'' scenarios. Thereafter, the issue is considered from the perspective of mathematical physics. To this end, quantum field theory is described in a model-independent, operator algebraic setting, on generic Lorentzian spacetime manifolds. The process of measurement is modelled by a localized dynamical coupling between a quantum field called the ``system'', and another quantum field, called the ``probe''. The result of the dynamical coupling is a scattering map, whereby measurements carried out on the probe can be interpreted as measurements of induced observables on the system. The localization of the dynamical coupling allows it to derive causal relations for the induced observables. It will be discussed how this approach leads to the concept of selective or non-selective system state updates conditioned on the result of probe measurements, which in turn allows it to obtain conditional probabilities for consecutive probe measurements consistent with relativistic causality and general covariance, without the need for a physical collapse of the wavefunction. In particular, the problem of impossible measurements is resolved. Finally, there is a brief discussion of accelerated detectors and other related work.</description>

      <title>Solutions to the constant Yang-Baxter equation: additive charge conservation in three dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find all solutions to the constant Yang--Baxter equation $R_{12}R_{13}R_{23}=R_{23}R_{13}R_{12}$ in three dimensions, subject to an additive charge-conservation ansatz. This ansatz is a generalisation of (strict) charge-conservation, for which a complete classification in all dimensions was recently obtained. Additive charge-conservation introduces additional sector-coupling parameters -- in 3 dimensions there are $4$ such parameters. In the generic dimension 3 case, in which all of the $4$ parameters are nonzero, we find there is a single 3 parameter family of solutions. We give a complete analysis of this solution, giving the structure of the centraliser (symmetry) algebra in all orders. We also solve the remaining cases with three, two, or one nonzero sector-coupling parameter(s).</description>

      <title>Key drivers of the preference for dynamic dark energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03983v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Joint analysis of the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) measurement by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) first data release, Type Ia supernovae (SNe) of the Dark Energy Survey Year 5 (DES5YR) release and cosmic microwave background (CMB) data favors a quintom-like dynamic dark energy model over the standard Lambda cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model at $3.9\sigma$ level (Adame et al. 2024). We confirm the previous finding in the literature that the preference for dynamic dark energy does not rely on the detailed modeling of CMB physics and remains at a similar significance level ($3.2\sigma$) when the full CMB likelihood is replaced by a CMB acoustic-oscillation angle ($\theta_\star$) prior and a baryon abundance ($\Omega_bh^2$) prior. The computationally efficient $\theta_\star$ and $\Omega_bh^2$ priors allow us to take a frequentist approach by comparing DES5YR SNe and DESI BAO with a large number ($\gtrsim 10^4$) of Planck-constrained $\Lambda$CDM simulations. We find that $\geq 3.2\sigma$ preference for dynamic dark energy is very rare (occurrence rate = $0.28\%$) in simulations. When we combine DESI BAO with SN simulations or combine DES5YR SNe with BAO simulations, the occurrence rate of $\geq 3.2\sigma$ preference for dynamic dark energy increases to $1.2\%$ and $4.8\%$, respectively. These results indicate an internal inconsistency, i.e., a significant tension between DESI BAO + DES5YR SNe and Planck-constrained $\Lambda$CDM models in both Bayesian and frequentist points of view. Although both DESI BAO and DES5YR SNe contribute to the preference for dynamic dark energy, the contribution from DES5YR SNe is more significant. In the frequentist point of view, even DES5YR SNe alone is in tension with Planck-constrained $\Lambda$CDM models, though in Bayesian point of view this tension is prior dependent and inclusive.</description>

      <title>Post-Minkowskian Theory Meets the Spinning Effective-One-Body Approach for Bound-Orbit Waveforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19181v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Driven by advances in scattering amplitudes and worldline-based methods, recent years have seen significant progress in our ability to calculate gravitational two-body scattering observables. These observables effectively encapsulate the gravitational two-body problem in the weak-field and high-velocity regime (post-Minkowskian, PM), with applications to the bound two-body problem and gravitational-wave modeling. We leverage PM data to construct a complete inspiral-merger-ringdown waveform model for non-precessing spinning black holes within the effective-one-body (EOB) formalism: SEOBNR-PM. This model is closely based on the highly successful SEOBNRv5 model, used by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration, with its key new feature being an EOB Hamiltonian derived by matching the two-body scattering angle in a perturbative PM expansion. The model performs remarkably well, showing a median mismatch against 441 numerical-relativity (NR) simulations that is somewhat lower than a similarly calibrated version of SEOBNRv5. Comparisons of the binding energy with NR also demonstrate better agreement than SEOBNRv5, despite the latter containing additional calibration to NR simulations.</description>

      <title>Primordial gravitational wave backgrounds from phase transitions with next generation ground based detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02359v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Third generation ground-based gravitational wave (GW) detectors, such as Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, will operate in the $(\text{few}-10^4)$ Hz frequency band, with a boost in sensitivity providing an unprecedented reach into primordial cosmology. Working concurrently with pulsar timing arrays in the nHz band, and LISA in the mHz band, these 3G detectors will be powerful probes of beyond the standard model particle physics on scales $T\gtrsim 10^{7}$GeV. Here we focus on their ability to probe phase transitions (PTs) in the early universe. We first overview the landscape of detectors across frequencies, discuss the relevance of astrophysical foregrounds, and provide convenient and up-to-date power-law integrated sensitivity curves for these detectors. We then present the constraints expected from GW observations on first order PTs and on topological defects (strings and domain walls), which may be formed when a symmetry is broken irrespective of the order of the phase transition. These constraints can then be applied to specific models leading to first order PTs and/or topological defects. In particular we discuss the implications for axion models, which solve the strong CP problem by introducing a spontaneously broken Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry. For post-inflationary breaking, the PQ scale must lie in the $10^{8}-10^{11}$ GeV range, and so the signal from a first order PQ PT falls within reach of ground based 3G detectors. A scan in parameter space of signal-to-noise ratio in a representative model reveals their large potential to probe the nature of the PQ transition. Additionally, in heavy axion type models domain walls form, which can lead to a detectable GW background. We discuss their spectrum and summarise the expected constraints on these models from 3G detectors, together with SKA and LISA.</description>

      <title>Bipartite reweight-annealing algorithm to extract large-scale data of entanglement entropy and its derivative in high precision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05324v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) scheme able to extract large-scale data of entanglement entropy (EE) and its derivative with high precision and low technical barrier. We avoid directly computing the overlap of two partition functions within different spacetime manifolds and instead obtain them separately via reweight-annealing scheme. The incremental process can be designed along the path of real physical parameters in this frame, and all intermediates are EEs of corresponding parameters, so the algorithm efficiency is improved by more than $10^4$ of times. The calculation of EE becomes much cheaper and simpler. It opens a way to numerically detect the novel phases and phase transitions by scanning EE in a wide parameter-region in two and higher dimensional systems. We then show the feasibility of using EE and its derivative to find phase transition points and to probe novel phases.</description>

      <title>Four no-go theorems on the existence of spin and orbital angular momentum of massless bosons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06276v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interest in the so-called orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light is ever-increasing, driven largely by its diverse range of applications, from new imaging techniques to optical tweezers. However, there are fundamental theoretical issues with decomposing the photon angular momentum operator into spin (SAM) and orbital angular momentum parts. While such an SAM-OAM splitting is unambiguous for massive particles, there are numerous proposed splittings for massless photons and no consensus about which is correct. Moreover, it has been shown that most of the proposed SAM and OAM operators do not satisfy the defining commutation relations of angular momentum operators and are thus not legitimate splittings. Here, we prove that it is generally impossible to split the total angular momentum operator of massless bosons, such as photons and gravitons, into spin and orbital parts. The obstruction to such a splitting can be understood as both geometric and topological. We prove two additional no-go theorems which generalize this result, in particular showing that there are no SAM-OAM splittings even if (1) the SAM operator is allowed to represent non-internal symmetries or (2) if one allows the SAM and OAM operators to generate non-SO(3) symmetries. We show how gauge redundant descriptions of massless particles can suggest SAM-OAM splittings which are invalid once gauge-invariance is imposed.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic charge transport in strongly magnetized relativistic matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13828v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate electrical charge transport in hot magnetized plasma using first-principles quantum field theoretical methods. By employing Kubo's linear response theory, we express the electrical conductivity tensor in terms of the fermion damping rate in the Landau-level representation. Utilizing leading-order results for the damping rates from a recent study within a gauge theory, we derive the transverse and longitudinal conductivities for a strongly magnetized plasma. The analytical expressions reveal drastically different mechanisms that explain the high anisotropy of charge transport in a magnetized plasma. Specifically, the transverse conductivity is suppressed, while the longitudinal conductivity is enhanced by a strong magnetic field. As in the case of zero magnetic field, longitudinal conduction is determined by the probability of charge carriers to remain in their quantum states without damping. In contrast, transverse conduction critically relies on quantum transitions between Landau levels, effectively lifting charge trapping in localized Landau orbits. We examine the temperature and magnetic field dependence of the transverse and longitudinal electrical conductivities over a wide range of parameters and investigate the effects of a nonzero chemical potential. Additionally, we extend our analysis to strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma and study the impact of the coupling constant on the anisotropy of electrical charge transport.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21649v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, J. Harada proposed a theory relating gravity to the Cotton tensor, dubbed as ''Cotton gravity'' (CG). This is an extension of General Relativity such that every solution of the latter turns out to be a solution of the former (but the converse is not true) and, furthermore, it is possible to derive the cosmological constant as an integration constant within it. In this work we investigate CG by coupling it to both non-linear electrodynamics (NLED) and scalar fields. We study static and spherically symmetric solutions implementing a bouncing behaviour in the radial function so as to avoid the development of singularities, inspired by the Simpson-Visser black bounce and the Bardeen model, both interpreted as magnetic monopoles. We identify the NLED Lagrangian density and the scalar field potential generating such solutions, and investigate the corresponding gravitational configurations in terms of horizons, behaviour of the metric functions, and regularity of the Kretchsman curvature scalar. Our analysis extends the class of non-singular geometries found in the literature and paves the ground for further analysis of black holes in CG.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21786v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interplay between symmetries and entanglement in out-of-equilibrium quantum systems is currently at the centre of an intense multidisciplinary research effort. Here we introduce a setting where these questions can be characterised exactly by considering dual-unitary circuits with an arbitrary number of $U(1)$ charges. After providing a complete characterisation of these systems we show that one can introduce a class of solvable states, which extends that of generic dual unitary circuits, for which the non-equilibrium dynamics can be solved exactly. In contrast to the known class of solvable states, which relax to the infinite temperature state, these states relax to a family of non-trivial generalised Gibbs ensembles. The relaxation process of these states can be simply described by a linear growth of the entanglement entropy followed by saturation to a non-maximal value but with maximal entanglement velocity. We then move on to consider the dynamics from non-solvable states, combining exact results with the entanglement membrane picture we argue that the entanglement dynamics from these states is qualitatively different from that of the solvable ones. It shows two different growth regimes characterised by two distinct slopes, both corresponding to sub-maximal entanglement velocities. Moreover, we show that non-solvable initial states can give rise to the quantum Mpemba effect, where less symmetric initial states restore the symmetry faster than more symmetric ones.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05142v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational shockwaves are geometries where components of the transverse curvature have abrupt behaviour across null hypersurfaces, which are fronts of the waves. We develop a general approach to describe classical field theories on such geometries in a linearized approximation, by using free scalar fields as a model. Perturbations caused by shockwaves exist above the wave front and are solutions to a characteristic Cauchy problem with initial data on the wave front determined by a supertranslation of ingoing fields. A special attention is paid to perturbations of fields of pointlike sources generated by plane-fronted gravitational shockwaves. One has three effects: conversion of non-stationary perturbations into an outgoing radiation, a spherical scalar shockwave which appears when the gravitational wave hits the source, and a plane scalar shockwave accompanying the initial gravitational wave. Our analysis is applicable to gravitational shockwaves of a general class including geometries sourced by null particles and null branes.</description>

      <title>Parametrically amplified super-radiance towards hot big bang universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08605v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a mechanism of preheating stage after inflation, using a new idea of parametrically amplified super-radiance. Highly coherent state, characterized by macro-coherence of scalar field coupled to produced massless particle in pairs, is created by parametric resonance effects associated with field oscillation around its potential minimum, within a Hubble volume. The state is described effectively by the simple Dicke-type of super-radiance model, and super-radiant pulse is emitted within a Hubble time, justifying neglect of cosmic expansion. Produced particles are shown to interact to change their energy and momentum distribution to realize thermal hot big bang universe. A long standing problem of heating after inflation may thus be solved. A new dark matter candidate produced at the emergence of thermalized universe is suggested as well.</description>

      <title>Computing $G$-Crossed Extensions and Orbifolds of Vertex Operator Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16357v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we develop tools for computing $G$-crossed extensions of braided tensor categories. Their equivariantisations appear as categories of modules of fixed-point subalgebras (or orbifolds) of vertex operator algebras and are often difficult to determine.
  As the first tool, we show how the seminal work of Etingof, Nikshych and Ostrik on the uniqueness of $G$-crossed extensions can be used to determine the category of modules of orbifold vertex operator algebras. As an application, we determine the modular tensor category of the orbifold of a lattice vertex operator algebra under a lift of $-\mathrm{id}$ for a lattice with odd-order discriminant form. In that case, the de-equivariantisation is of Tambara-Yamagami type.
  As the second tool, we describe how $G$-crossed extensions and condensations by commutative algebras commute in a suitable sense. This leads to an effective approach to compute new $G$-crossed extensions. As one application, we produce the coherence data that are then used in arXiv:2411.12251 to define a generalisation of the Tambara-Yamagami categories with more than one simple object in the twisted sector. This also yields the modular tensor category of the orbifold of an arbitrary lattice vertex operator algebra under a lift of $-\mathrm{id}$. Finally, we sketch how to categorically approach the general problem of lattice orbifolds under lifts of arbitrary lattice involutions.</description>

      <title>Traversable Wormholes with Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an exact, spherically symmetric, static solution of the Einstein field equations minimally coupled to a self-interacting scalar field. The solution does not exhibit any zero proper volume singularity at the centre, and therefore, curvature scalars are always regular. We study the property of radial null geodesics and derive that the metric can describe either a two-way or a one-way traversable wormhole depending on certain parameter ranges. Notably, it lacks a Schwarzschild limit. The scalar field exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking within the coordinate range where a wormhole throat forms. It can be seen as a suggestion that spontaneous symmetry breaking may act as a threshold for wormhole throat formation. Additionally, we compute the radius of the photon sphere, the Lyapunov exponent, the shadow radius, and the innermost stable circular orbits for this spacetime metric.</description>
