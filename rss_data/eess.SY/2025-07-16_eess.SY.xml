      <title>Learning to Quantize and Precode in Massive MIMO Systems for Energy Reduction: a Graph Neural Network Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive MIMO systems are moving toward increased numbers of radio frequency chains, higher carrier frequencies and larger bandwidths. As such, digital-to-analog converters (DACs) are becoming a bottleneck in terms of hardware complexity and power consumption. In this work, non-linear precoding for coarsely quantized downlink massive MIMO is studied. Given the NP-hard nature of this problem, a graph neural network (GNN) is proposed that directly outputs the precoded quantized vector based on the channel matrix and the intended transmit symbols. The model is trained in a self-supervised manner, by directly maximizing the achievable rate. To overcome the non-differentiability of the objective function, introduced due to the non-differentiable DAC functions, a straight-through Gumbel-softmax estimation of the gradient is proposed. The proposed method achieves a significant increase in achievable sum rate under coarse quantization. For instance, in the single-user case, the proposed method can achieve the same sum rate as maximum ratio transmission (MRT) by using one-bit DAC's as compared to 3 bits for MRT. This reduces the DAC's power consumption by a factor 4-7 and 3 for baseband and RF DACs respectively. This, however, comes at the cost of increased digital signal processing power consumption. When accounting for this, the reduction in overall power consumption holds for a system bandwidth up to 3.5 MHz for baseband DACs, while the RF DACs can maintain a power reduction of 2.9 for higher bandwidths. Notably, indirect effects, which further reduce the power consumption, such as a reduced fronthaul consumption and reduction in other components, are not considered in this analysis.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Safety Certificates of Infinite Networks with Unknown Models and Interconnection Topologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infinite networks are complex interconnected systems comprising a countably infinite number of subsystems, where counting them precisely poses a significant challenge due to the seemingly endless interconnected nature of the network (e.g., counting vehicles on the road). In such scenarios, the presence of infinitely many subsystems within the network renders the existing analysis frameworks tailored for finite networks inapplicable to infinite ones. This paper is concerned with offering a data-driven approach, within a compositional framework, for the safety certification of infinite networks with both unknown mathematical models and interconnection topologies. Given the immense computational complexity stemming from the extensive dimension of infinite networks, our approach capitalizes on the joint dissipativity-type properties of subsystems, characterized by storage certificates. We introduce innovative compositional data-driven conditions to construct a barrier certificate for the infinite network leveraging storage certificates of its unknown subsystems derived from data, while offering correctness guarantees across the network safety. We demonstrate that our compositional data-driven reasoning eliminates the requirement for checking the traditional dissipativity condition, which typically mandates precise knowledge of the interconnection topology. In addition, while existing data-driven literature demonstrates an exponential trend in sample complexity with respect to network size, we showcase that our compositional strategy notably reduces it to a linear scale in terms of the number of subsystems. We illustrate our data-driven results on two physical infinite networks with unknown models and interconnection topologies.</description>

      <title>Approximate solutions to games of ordered preference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous vehicles must balance ranked objectives, such as minimizing travel time, ensuring safety, and coordinating with traffic. Games of ordered preference effectively model these interactions but become computationally intractable as the time horizon, number of players, or number of preference levels increase. While receding horizon frameworks mitigate long-horizon intractability by solving sequential shorter games, often warm-started, they do not resolve the complexity growth inherent in existing methods for solving games of ordered preference. This paper introduces a solution strategy that avoids excessive complexity growth by approximating solutions using lexicographic iterated best response (IBR) in receding horizon, termed "lexicographic IBR over time." Lexicographic IBR over time uses past information to accelerate convergence. We demonstrate through simulated traffic scenarios that lexicographic IBR over time efficiently computes approximate-optimal solutions for receding horizon games of ordered preference, converging towards generalized Nash equilibria.</description>

      <title>Standards-Compliant DM-RS Allocation via Temporal Channel Prediction for Massive MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reducing feedback overhead in beyond 5G networks is a critical challenge, as the growing number of antennas in modern massive MIMO systems substantially increases the channel state information (CSI) feedback demand in frequency division duplex (FDD) systems. To address this, extensive research has focused on CSI compression and prediction, with neural network-based approaches gaining momentum and being considered for integration into the 3GPP 5G-Advanced standards. While deep learning has been effectively applied to CSI-limited beamforming and handover optimization, reference signal allocation under such constraints remains surprisingly underexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce the concept of channel prediction-based reference signal allocation (CPRS), which jointly optimizes channel prediction and DM-RS allocation to improve data throughput without requiring CSI feedback. We further propose a standards-compliant ViViT/CNN-based architecture that implements CPRS by treating evolving CSI matrices as sequential image-like data, enabling efficient and adaptive transmission in dynamic environments. Simulation results using ray-tracing channel data generated in NVIDIA Sionna validate the proposed method, showing up to 36.60% throughput improvement over benchmark strategies.</description>

      <title>Optimal Honeypot Ratio and Convergent Fictitious-Play Learning in Signaling Games for CPS Defense</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) are facing a fast-growing wave of attacks. To achieve effective proactive defense, this paper models honeypot deployment as a gamma-fixed signaling game in which node liveness serves as the only signal and normal-node signal gamma is exogenously fixed. We define the gamma-perfect Bayesian-Nash equilibrium (gamma-PBNE). Analytical expressions are obtained for all gamma-PBNEs, revealing three distinct equilibrium regimes that depend on the priori honeypot ratio. Furthermore, the optimal honeypot ratio and signaling strategy that jointly maximize the network average utility are obtained. To capture strategic interaction over time, we develop a discrete-time fictitious-play algorithm that couples Bayesian belief updates with empirical best responses. We prove that, as long as the honeypot ratio is perturbed within a non-degenerate neighbourhood of the optimum, every fictitious-play path converges to the defender-optimal gamma-PBNE. Numerical results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method and demonstrate its applicability to CPS defense.</description>

      <title>Optimal Sensor Scheduling and Selection for Continuous-Discrete Kalman Filtering with Auxiliary Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Continuous-Discrete Kalman Filter (CD-KF) for State-Space Models (SSMs) where continuous-time dynamics are observed via multiple sensors with discrete, irregularly timed measurements. Our focus extends to scenarios in which the measurement process is coupled with the states of an auxiliary SSM. For instance, higher measurement rates may increase energy consumption or heat generation, while a sensor's accuracy can depend on its own spatial trajectory or that of the measured target. Each sensor thus carries distinct costs and constraints associated with its measurement rate and additional constraints and costs on the auxiliary state. We model measurement occurrences as independent Poisson processes with sensor-specific rates and derive an upper bound on the mean posterior covariance matrix of the CD-KF along the mean auxiliary state. The bound is continuously differentiable with respect to the measurement rates, which enables efficient gradient-based optimization. Exploiting this bound, we propose a finite-horizon optimal control framework to optimize measurement rates and auxiliary-state dynamics jointly. We further introduce a deterministic method for scheduling measurement times from the optimized rates. Empirical results in state-space filtering and dynamic temporal Gaussian process regression demonstrate that our approach achieves improved trade-offs between resource usage and estimation accuracy.</description>

      <title>Moving Beyond Marginal Carbon Intensity: A Poor Metric for Both Carbon Accounting and Grid Flexibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Marginal Carbon Intensity (MCI) has been promoted as an effective metric for carbon-aware computing. Although it is already considered as impractical for carbon accounting purposes, many still view it as valuable when optimizing for grid flexibility by incentivizing electricity usage during curtailment periods. In this statement paper, we argue that MCI is neither reliable nor actionable for either purpose. We outline its fundamental limitations, including non-observability, reliance on opaque predictive models, and the lack of verifiability. Moreover, MCI fails to reflect curtailment caused by high-carbon sources and offers no insight into the quantity of available excess power. We advocate moving beyond MCI and instead call for research on more actionable metrics, such as direct reporting of excess power, explicit modeling of energy storage and grid stability, and integration with emerging granular renewable energy certificate markets.</description>

      <title>Inverse Optimal Control with Constraint Relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inverse optimal control (IOC) is a promising paradigm for learning and mimicking optimal control strategies from capable demonstrators, or gaining a deeper understanding of their intentions, by estimating an unknown objective function from one or more corresponding optimal control sequences. When computing estimates from demonstrations in environments with safety-preserving inequality constraints, acknowledging their presence in the chosen IOC method is crucial given their strong influence on the final control strategy. However, solution strategies capable of considering inequality constraints, such as the inverse Karush-Kuhn-Tucker approach, rely on their correct activation and fulfillment; a restrictive assumption when dealing with noisy demonstrations. To overcome this problem, we leverage the concept of exact penalty functions for IOC and show preservation of estimation accuracy. Considering noisy demonstrations, we then illustrate how the usage of penalty functions reduces the number of unknown variables and how their approximations enhance the estimation method's capacity to account for wrong constraint activations within a polytopic-constrained environment. The proposed method is evaluated for three systems in simulation, outperforming traditional relaxation approaches for noisy demonstrations.</description>

      <title>A Risk-Aware Adaptive Robust MPC with Learned Uncertainty Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving chance-constrained optimal control problems for systems subject to non-stationary uncertainties is a significant challenge.Conventional robust model predictive control (MPC) often yields excessive conservatism by relying on static worst-case assumptions, while standard stochastic MPC methods struggle when underlying uncertainty distributions are unknown a priori.This article presents a Risk-Aware Adaptive Robust MPC (RAAR-MPC) framework,a hierarchical architecture that systematically orchestrates a novel synthesis of proactive, learning-based risk assessment and reactive risk regulation. The framework employs a medium-frequency risk assessment engine, which leverages Gaussian process regression and active learning, to construct a tight, data-driven characterization of the prediction error set from operational data.Concurrently, a low-timescale outer loop implements a self-correcting update law for an adaptive safety margin to precisely regulate the empirical risk and compensate for unmodeled dynamics.This dual-timescale adaptation enables the system to rigorously satisfy chance constraints with a user-defined probability, while minimizing the conservatism inherent in traditional approaches.We formally establish that the interplay between these adaptive components guarantees recursive feasibility and ensures the closed-loop system satisfies the chance constraints up to a user-defined risk level with high probability.Numerical experiments on a benchmark DC-DC converter under non-stationary parametric uncertainties demonstrate that our framework precisely achieves the target risk level, resulting in a significantly lower average cost compared to state-of-the-art robust and stochastic MPC strategies.</description>

      <title>A Feed-Forward Artificial Intelligence Pipeline for Sustainable Desalination under Climate Uncertainties: UAE Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The United Arab Emirates (UAE) relies heavily on seawater desalination to meet over 90% of its drinking water needs. Desalination processes are highly energy intensive and account for approximately 15% of the UAE's electricity consumption, contributing to over 22% of the country's energy-related CO2 emissions. Moreover, these processes face significant sustainability challenges in the face of climate uncertainties such as rising seawater temperatures, salinity, and aerosol optical depth (AOD). AOD greatly affects the operational and economic performance of solar-powered desalination systems through photovoltaic soiling, membrane fouling, and water turbidity cycles.
  This study proposes a novel pipelined two-stage predictive modelling architecture: the first stage forecasts AOD using satellite-derived time series and meteorological data; the second stage uses the predicted AOD and other meteorological factors to predict desalination performance efficiency losses. The framework achieved 98% accuracy, and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) was used to reveal key drivers of system degradation. Furthermore, this study proposes a dust-aware rule-based control logic for desalination systems based on predicted values of AOD and solar efficiency. This control logic is used to adjust the desalination plant feed water pressure, adapt maintenance scheduling, and regulate energy source switching.
  To enhance the practical utility of the research findings, the predictive models and rule-based controls were packaged into an interactive dashboard for scenario and predictive analytics. This provides a management decision-support system for climate-adaptive planning.</description>

      <title>A Leap-on-Success Exhaustive Search Method to Find Optimal Robust Minimum Redundancy Arrays (RMRAs): New Array Configurations for Sensor Counts 11 to 20</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-fold redundant sparse arrays (TFRAs) are designed to maintain accurate direction estimation even in the event of a single sensor failure, leveraging the deliberate coarray redundancy infused into their design. Robust Minimum Redundancy Arrays (RMRAs), a specialized class of TFRAs, optimize this redundancy to achieve the maximum possible aperture for a given number of sensors. However, finding optimal RMRA configurations is an NP-hard problem, with prior research reporting optimal solutions only for arrays of up to ten sensors. This paper presents newly discovered optimal RMRA configurations for array sizes 11 to 15, identified using a novel Leap-on-Success exhaustive search algorithm that efficiently reduces computational effort by terminating the search upon locating optimal solutions. The robustness of these arrays was validated under all single-element failure scenarios using MATLAB simulations, confirming their superior resilience compared to some existing TFRAs vulnerable to failures at specific sensor positions. Furthermore, near-optimal configurations for array sizes 16 to 20 are also reported, highlighting the potential applicability of the proposed method for larger array designs given sufficient computational resources. This work not only advances the state-of-the-art in RMRA design but also introduces an effective search methodology that can be leveraged for future explorations in array configuration optimization.</description>

      <title>Contrastive-KAN: A Semi-Supervised Intrusion Detection Framework for Cybersecurity with scarce Labeled Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the era of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, cybersecurity and intrusion detection systems are vital for the secure and reliable operation of IoT and IIoT environments. A key challenge in this domain is the scarcity of labeled cyber-attack data, as most industrial systems operate under normal conditions. This data imbalance, combined with the high cost of annotation, hinders the effective training of machine learning models. Moreover, rapid detection of attacks is essential, especially in critical infrastructure, to prevent large-scale disruptions. To address these challenges, we propose a real-time intrusion detection system based on a semi-supervised contrastive learning framework using the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN). Our method leverages abundant unlabeled data to distinguish between normal and attack behaviors effectively. We validate our approach on three benchmark datasets: UNSW-NB15, BoT-IoT, and Gas Pipeline, using only 2.20 percent, 1.28 percent, and 8 percent of labeled samples, respectively, to simulate real-world conditions. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing contrastive learning-based approaches. We further compare KAN with a traditional multilayer perceptron (MLP), demonstrating KAN's superior performance in both detection accuracy and robustness under limited supervision. KAN's ability to model complex relationships and its learnable activation functions are also explored and visualized, offering interpretability and potential for rule extraction. The method supports multi-class classification and proves effective in safety-critical environments where reliability is paramount.</description>

      <title>OpenGCRAM: An Open-Source Gain Cell Compiler Enabling Design-Space Exploration for AI Workloads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gain Cell memory (GCRAM) offers higher density and lower power than SRAM, making it a promising candidate for on-chip memory in domain-specific accelerators. To support workloads with varying traffic and lifetime metrics, GCRAM also offers high bandwidth, ultra low leakage power and a wide range of retention times, which can be adjusted through transistor design (like threshold voltage and channel material) and on-the-fly by changing the operating voltage. However, designing and optimizing GCRAM sub-systems can be time-consuming. In this paper, we present OpenGCRAM, an open-source GCRAM compiler capable of generating GCRAM bank circuit designs and DRC- and LVS-clean layouts for commercially available foundry CMOS, while also providing area, delay, and power simulations based on user-specified configurations (e.g., word size and number of words). OpenGCRAM enables fast, accurate, customizable, and optimized GCRAM block generation, reduces design time, ensure process compliance, and delivers performance-tailored memory blocks that meet diverse application requirements.</description>

Abstract: Merging onto a highway is a complex driving task that requires identifying a safe gap, adjusting speed, often interactions to create a merging gap, and completing the merge maneuver within a limited time window while maintaining safety and driving comfort. In this paper, we introduce a Safe Merging and Real-Time Merge (SMART-Merge) planner, a lattice-based motion planner designed to facilitate safe and comfortable forced merging. By deliberately adapting cost terms to the unique challenges of forced merging and introducing a desired speed heuristic, SMART-Merge planner enables the ego vehicle to merge successfully while minimizing the merge time. We verify the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed merge planner through high-fidelity CarMaker simulations on hundreds of highway merge scenarios. Our proposed planner achieves the success rate of 100% as well as completes the merge maneuver in the shortest amount of time compared with the baselines, demonstrating our planner's capability to handle complex forced merge tasks and provide a reliable and robust solution for autonomous highway merge.

      <title>MPC-based Coarse-to-Fine Motion Planning for Robotic Object Transportation in Cluttered Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This letter presents a novel coarse-to-fine motion planning framework for robotic manipulation in cluttered, unmodeled environments. The system integrates a dual-camera perception setup with a B-spline-based model predictive control (MPC) scheme. Initially, the planner generates feasible global trajectories from partial and uncertain observations. As new visual data are incrementally fused, both the environment model and motion planning are progressively refined. A vision-based cost function promotes target-driven exploration, while a refined kernel-perceptron collision detector enables efficient constraint updates for real-time planning. The framework accommodates closed-chain kinematics and supports dynamic replanning. Experiments on a multi-arm platform validate its robustness and adaptability under uncertainties and clutter.</description>

      <title>Ocean Diviner: A Diffusion-Augmented Reinforcement Learning for AUV Robust Control in the Underwater Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a diffusion-augmented reinforcement learning (RL) approach for robust autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) control, addressing key challenges in underwater trajectory planning and dynamic environment adaptation. The proposed method integrates three core innovations: (1) A diffusion-based trajectory generation framework that produces physically feasible multi-step trajectories, enhanced by a high-dimensional state encoding mechanism combining current observations with historical states and actions through a novel diffusion U-Net architecture, significantly improving long-horizon planning. (2) A sample-efficient hybrid learning architecture that synergizes diffusion-guided exploration with RL policy optimization, where the diffusion model generates diverse candidate actions and the RL critic selects optimal actions, achieving higher exploration efficiency and policy stability in dynamic underwater environments. Extensive simulation experiments validating the method's superior robustness and flexibility, outperforms conventional control methods in challenging marine conditions, offering enhanced adaptability and reliability for AUV operations in the underwater tasks.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Optimization is a Multi-Objective Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) is a worst-case approach to decision making when there is model uncertainty. Though formulated as a single-objective problem, we show that it is intrinsically multi-objective in that DRO solutions map out a near-Pareto-optimal frontier between expected cost and a measure of robustness called worst-case sensitivity (WCS). We take this as the starting point and explore robust decision making through a multi-objective lens. We show that WCS is a measure of spread and derive WCS for a collection of uncertainty sets commonly used in DRO. These sensitivity measures identify the errors against which the nominal expected cost is most vulnerable and the uncertainty set for the worst-case problem that most effectively mitigates it. The associated mean-sensitivity frontier is used to select its size. The multi-objective perspective provides a quantitative measure of robustness and a sensitivity-based approach to addressing important conceptual gaps in DRO -- how to choose the family and size of uncertainty sets for a given cost distribution, and how this affects the solution.</description>

      <title>Multi-IMU Sensor Fusion for Legged Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a state-estimation solution for legged robots that uses a set of low-cost, compact, and lightweight sensors to achieve low-drift pose and velocity estimation under challenging locomotion conditions. The key idea is to leverage multiple inertial measurement units on different links of the robot to correct a major error source in standard proprioceptive odometry. We fuse the inertial sensor information and joint encoder measurements in an extended Kalman filter, then combine the velocity estimate from this filter with camera data in a factor-graph-based sliding-window estimator to form a visual-inertial-leg odometry method. We validate our state estimator through comprehensive theoretical analysis and hardware experiments performed using real-world robot data collected during a variety of challenging locomotion tasks. Our algorithm consistently achieves minimal position deviation, even in scenarios involving substantial ground impact, foot slippage, and sudden body rotations. A C++ implementation, along with a large-scale dataset, is available at https://github.com/ShuoYangRobotics/Cerberus2.0.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Next-Generation Radio Access Networks (NGRAN) aim to support diverse vertical applications with strict security, latency, and Service-Level Agreement (SLA) requirements. These demands introduce challenges in securing the infrastructure, allocating resources dynamically, and enabling real-time reconfiguration. This demo presents SnSRIC, a secure and intelligent network slicing framework that mitigates a range of Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks in Open RAN environments. SnSRIC incorporates an AI-driven xApp that dynamically allocates Physical Resource Blocks (PRBs) to active users while enforcing slice-level security. The system detects anomalous behavior, distinguishes between benign and malicious devices, and uses the E2 interface to throttle rogue signaling while maintaining service continuity for legitimate users.</description>

      <title>Canonical Bayesian Linear System Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Standard Bayesian approaches for linear time-invariant (LTI) system identification are hindered by parameter non-identifiability; the resulting complex, multi-modal posteriors make inference inefficient and impractical. We solve this problem by embedding canonical forms of LTI systems within the Bayesian framework. We rigorously establish that inference in these minimal parameterizations fully captures all invariant system dynamics (e.g., transfer functions, eigenvalues, predictive distributions of system outputs) while resolving identifiability. This approach unlocks the use of meaningful, structure-aware priors (e.g., enforcing stability via eigenvalues) and ensures conditions for a Bernstein--von Mises theorem -- a link between Bayesian and frequentist large-sample asymptotics that is broken in standard forms. Extensive simulations with modern MCMC methods highlight advantages over standard parameterizations: canonical forms achieve higher computational efficiency, generate interpretable and well-behaved posteriors, and provide robust uncertainty estimates, particularly from limited data.</description>

      <title>Offline and Online Use of Interval and Set-Based Approaches for Control and State Estimation: A Selection of Methodological Approaches and Their Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11622v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Control and state estimation procedures need to be robust against imprecisely known parameters, uncertainty in initial conditions, and external disturbances. Interval methods and other set-based techniques form the basis for the implementation of powerful approaches that can be used to identify parameters of dynamic system models in the presence of the aforementioned types of uncertainty. Moreover, they are applicable to a verified feasibility and stability analysis of controllers and state estimators. In addition to these approaches which are typically used offline for analysis of system models designed with classical floating point procedures, interval and set-based methods have also been developed in recent years, which allow to directly solve the associated design tasks and to implement reliable techniques that are applicable online, i.e., during system operation. The latter approaches include set-based model predictive control, online parameter adaptation techniques for nonlinear variable-structure and backstepping controllers, interval observers, and fault diagnosis techniques. This paper provides an overview of the methodological background and reviews numerous practical applications for which interval and other set-valued approaches have been employed successfully.</description>

      <title>A Forward Reachability Perspective on Control Barrier Functions and Discount Factors in Reachability Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17180v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Control invariant sets are crucial for various methods that aim to design safe control policies for systems whose state constraints must be satisfied over an indefinite time horizon. In this article, we explore the connections among reachability, control invariance, and Control Barrier Functions (CBFs). Unlike prior formulations based on backward reachability concepts, we establish a strong link between these three concepts by examining the inevitable Forward Reachable Tube (FRT), which is the set of states such that every trajectory reaching the FRT must have passed through a given initial set of states. First, our findings show that the inevitable FRT is precisely this initial set itself if it is a robust control invariant set with a differentiable boundary-a property necessary to connect with CBFs whose zero-level sets are control invariant. We highlight that if the boundary is not differentiable, the FRT of the robust control invariant set may become a strict superset of the invariant set and lose invariance. Next, we formulate a differential game between the control and disturbance, where the inevitable FRT is characterized by the zero-superlevel set of the value function. By incorporating a discount factor in the cost function of the game, the barrier constraint of the CBF naturally arises in the Hamilton-Jacobi equation and determines the optimal policy. Combining these results, the value function of our FRT formulation serves as a CBF-like function, and conversely, any valid CBF is also a forward reachability value function inside the control invariant set, thereby revealing the inverse optimality of the CBF. This strong link between reachability and barrier constraints is not achievable by previous backward reachability-based formulations, and addresses an important gap in existing literature for constructing valid CBFs to ensure safety.</description>

      <title>Parallel Batch Scheduling With Incompatible Job Families Via Constraint Programming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11981v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the incompatible case of parallel batch scheduling, where compatible jobs belong to the same family, and jobs from different families cannot be processed together in the same batch. The state-of-the-art constraint programming (CP) model for this problem relies on specific functions and global constraints only available in a well established commercial CP solver. This paper expands the literature around this problem by proposing four new CP models that can be implemented in commercial and open-source solvers: a new model that relies on automaton constraints, and three alternative models that integrate assignment and scheduling decisions with different strategies and global constraints. Extensive computational experiments on standard test cases under multiple objectives and multiple solvers demonstrate the implementation flexibility and competitive performance of the proposed models.</description>

      <title>Skew-Induced Insertion Loss Deviation (SILD) and FOM_SILD: Metrics for Quantifying P/N Skew Effects in High-Speed Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rise of AI workloads and growing data center demands have driven the need for ultra-high-speed interconnects exceeding 200 Gb/s. As unit intervals (UI) shrink, even a few picoseconds of P/N skew can degrade serializer-deserializer (SerDes) performance. Traditional methods for quantifying skew fall short in capturing its impact. We introduce two new metrics: 1) Skew-Induced Insertion Loss Deviation (SILD) and 2) its complementary Figure of Merit (FOM_SILD), analytically developed to assess P/N skew effects. Measured S-parameters confirm FOM_SILD reciprocity, while simulations of 224G PAM4 SerDes show strong correlation with bit error rate (BER) trends. This approach offers a robust framework for analyzing skew in next-generation ultra-high-speed interconnects.</description>

      <title>Gain and phase type multipliers for feedback robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.11837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.11837v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is known that the stability of a feedback interconnection of two linear time-invariant systems implies that the graphs of the open-loop systems are quadratically separated. This separation is defined by an object known as the multiplier. The theory of integral quadratic constraints shows that the converse also holds under certain conditions. This paper establishes that if the feedback is robustly stable against certain structured uncertainty, then there always exists a multiplier that takes a corresponding form. In particular, if the feedback is robustly stable to certain gain-type uncertainty, then there exists a corresponding multiplier that is of phase-type, i.e., its diagonal blocks are zeros. These results build on the notion of phases of matrices and systems, which was recently introduced in the field of control. Similarly, if the feedback is robustly stable to certain phase-type uncertainty, then there exists a gain-type multiplier, i.e., its off-diagonal blocks are zeros. The results are meaningfully instructive in the search for a valid multiplier for establishing robust closed-loop stability, and cover the well-known small-gain and the recent small-phase theorems.</description>

      <title>Orthogonality Analysis in LoRa Uplink Satellite Communications Affected by Doppler Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper provides, for the first time, analytical expressions for the Long-Range (LoRa) waveform and cross-correlation in both continuous and discrete time domains under the Doppler effect in satellite communication. We propose the concept and formulas of the shared visibility window for satellites toward two ground devices. Our analysis covers cross-correlation results with varying spreading factors (SF) for no-Doppler and with-Doppler cases. We find the maximum cross-correlation with different SFs and the mean cross-correlation are immune to the Doppler effect. However, the maximum cross-correlation with the same SFs is only immune to high Doppler shift, with its value fluctuating between 0.6 and 1 under high Doppler rate. We interpret this fluctuation by introducing the relationship between transmission start time and cross-correlation. We provide a parameter analysis for orbit height, ground device distance, and inclination angle. Additionally, we analyze the bit error rate (BER) for LoRa signals and observe worse performance under high Doppler shift or interference with same SF. Increasing the SNR or the SIR improves the BER only when Doppler effect is below a frequency threshold. Notably, under Doppler effect, the performance behaviors of BER no longer align with those of maximum cross-correlation. Finally, our results lead to two recommendations: 1) To mitigate Doppler impact on cross-correlation, we recommend utilizing low SFs, high orbit height, short ground device distance, and the transmission start time with high Doppler shift; 2) To mitigate Doppler impact on BER, we recommend employing low SFs, high bandwidth, and transmission start time with high Doppler rate. These conflicting recommendations regarding transmission start time highlight the necessity of Doppler shift compensation techniques to help operate LoRa in space properly.</description>

      <title>Characterizing gaussian mixture of motion modes for skid-steer vehicle state estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00200v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Skid-steered wheel mobile robots (SSWMRs) are characterized by the unique domination of the tire-terrain skidding for the robot to move. The lack of reliable friction models cascade into unreliable motion models, especially the reduced ordered variants used for state estimation and robot control. Ensemble modeling is an emerging research direction where the overall motion model is broken down into a family of local models to distribute the performance and resource requirement and provide a fast real-time prediction. To this end, a gaussian mixture model based modeling identification of model clusters is adopted and implemented within an interactive multiple model (IMM) based state estimation. The framework is adopted and implemented for angular velocity as the estimated state for a mid scaled skid-steered wheel mobile robot platform.</description>

      <title>LVLM-MPC Collaboration for Autonomous Driving: A Safety-Aware and Task-Scalable Control Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04980v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM) and Model Predictive Control (MPC) integration framework that delivers both task scalability and safety for Autonomous Driving (AD). LVLMs excel at high-level task planning across diverse driving scenarios. However, since these foundation models are not specifically designed for driving and their reasoning is not consistent with the feasibility of low-level motion planning, concerns remain regarding safety and smooth task switching. This paper integrates LVLMs with MPC Builder, which automatically generates MPCs on demand, based on symbolic task commands generated by the LVLM, while ensuring optimality and safety. The generated MPCs can strongly assist the execution or rejection of LVLM-driven task switching by providing feedback on the feasibility of the given tasks and generating task-switching-aware MPCs. Our approach provides a safe, flexible, and adaptable control framework, bridging the gap between cutting-edge foundation models and reliable vehicle operation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a simulation experiment, showing that our system can safely and effectively handle highway driving while maintaining the flexibility and adaptability of LVLMs.</description>
